{"-gdysmn5LEE": "well Aloha brothers and sisters welcome back to the channel it's your man Kimo back to do another review for all you cannabis enthusiasts and connoisseurs out there this time I've got a 5-10 thread of a cartridge coming to you from Palmetto cannabis that's sundial cannabis company it's agent orange it's a sativa hybrid stream it's coming in at 800 milligrams THC and one point two six milligrams of CBD so that's about 80% THC and less than a percent CBD so it's gonna be a high THC heavy-hitting cartridge really excited when I bought this I'm gonna admit I cheated a little bit I did buy it a few days ago and I was excited to try to open it up I've been faking it the last few days stuck it back in the cart in the container here to show you the package I'm gonna hate this packaging it's awful I'll show you on the front it shows to open the package you push it on the sides and you push open the top it's easier said than done like I was pushing pushing pushing I'm glad I didn't record the initial truck time I opened this package because it was real futile effort took me a while but after a while I just find out that usually if you play enough pressure on the sides and push in and pop you can open this packaging is horrible I can't stand the packaging and then when you do open it up you got your car to gene there it's nestled nice and safe away in this foam little cutout but it's straight through for me because you want the orientation of your cartridge to be upright and by having it designed in here you know this is probably gonna sit on the shelf like this or like this and your oils gonna be you know on the side it's gonna potentially clog or plummet your device not a cool design choice Palmetto I don't like that at all you know and strike three for me is this packaging big hard plastic and flung away what do you need all this packaging for this little device I don't like it you know it's it's horrible to me so packaging no good Paul metal so once you open it up though you do get this lovely little cartridge hopefully that's coming in nice and clear you see it says Agent Orange on the bottom and what I think is a really cool retro font I'd it the big bold letters you see the oil in there it is pretty dark doesn't move around a lot as you can see I've aped a lot of this the last few days it's a little dark almost kind of orange I'm wondering if the glass is actually tinted orange to go with the whole Agent Orange vibe I don't know let's get these rubber nubs off here with a mouthpiece condom get the battery put it on we're gonna vape a little bit here I've been vaping a lot of this I got some opinions on it but let's just take a rip right now as you can see is not a lot of vapor production it's not like a lot but it's enough gets the job done it is a little harsh so you can tell you're taking a drag that's one of the downsides to it after about four or five drags it gets a little harsh on the throat and I have coughed a little bit using this over the last few days but the taste you do get you're expecting orange oh you're expecting well Agent Orange gonna be citrusy orange II yeah not so much there's a little bit of a citrusy orange on the inhale and on the exhale it's a little tiny bit is there but it's mostly a kind of spicy peppery flavor cannabis flavor mixed in with the orange so it's a little bit sick you see with kind of spicy on the inhale on the exhale you lose a little of citrus and it's mostly just kind of a spicy peppery flavor it's not bad it's just not orange or really citrusy it's alright but like I said it's a little harsh so if you're going if you're really reefing on it you could COFF a little bit and you might feel a little irritation in your throat that's kind of the negatives the positives are the effects this this hits really good I find it to be a bit of a creeper strain don't really notice the effects for about 10-15 minutes and then all of a sudden you feel a Deadhead band effect come on and it comes down over and your smile comes up and I travels down your body and you feel energized and focused though like it's a really clear high you feel really focused and clear but you feel kind of happy and just like an overall general mood you're not really hi you got a bit of a headband effect but you're really focused and clear and just happy and conversational sociable it's a good get things done strains 50 times training good wakey bait string good any time stream however I will say that if you really refine it it kind of overdo it a bit start getting into you know quite a number of drags when the effects do kind of start to take over they're pretty intense at first and you know they wear off after a few minutes and they they develop into that sort of really focused clear high but you can make this pretty intense high it's kind of fun if you really want a refund get a little stone this is a great anytime babe because like I said it does dissipate into sort of a clear head in it you know certified so you're not all stony all day this this is great anytime Cape I would recommend it it's a good value it's forty five bucks I paid for it and you know it's point five grams it's gonna go about as far as any other 510 0.5 gram cartridge out there it depends on the use depends on your mileage mileage berries with you know how much you use it in your experience so thumbs up I recommend it I really like a good job Palmetto cannabis changing down packaging I can't stand your packaging I really like your cartridge I really like your oil I really like the Agent Orange pick it up if you see it it's a good deal that's the end of the review hope you all liked it leave me a comment let me know what you think that he tried it do you like it do you not

take care of each other and until next time brothers and sisters keep smoking", "bzGdyneMAzU": "yo yo yo what's up G fam today guys hoppin straight into it it's been a long week for me it's been a stressful week for a lot of people guys I don't know if I'm ready to get into the situation to the topic yet I might save it for another video you know it's still kind of early but this week has been a rough week guys that's why I haven't been able to produce any content or anything like that so sorry if you guys haven't missed it on the videos but today I'm bringing you guys a quick [ __ ] the last the last of the tree-based guys tree-based clear the best one agent orange like literally probably by far the most potent one the most the the best-tasting one and the one that gets me the most [ __ ] faded so this one right here is a hybrid I didn't think a hybrid would get me that [ __ ] up but the times that I've been smoking it and everybody that let hit they're like [ __ ] bro this is literally the best the best one ever so yeah guys this is the packaging that it comes in it's a better upgrade than what they used to have they used to have just the regular little plastic ones where you could see through and it's like right there but you know got a step your game up if you want to being the best and then this tree I suppose they come in these little [ __ ] clear tubes and all professional so yeah guys Agent Orange look at this [ __ ] um I'm more than halfway through with it already look how clear that [ __ ] is you can see the holes everything like water like if there's nothing in there but yeah guys I'm pretty much halfway done with this and man like I still haven't gotten tired of it I'm not gonna lie with the other ones with the Mendo breath with the Wi-Fi og I got tired of them pretty quick I got tired of them within like 2 to 3 days and I was just like [ __ ] do you like on time I'm just waiting for the next one so this one is [ __ ] bomb though this is by far the best one Agent Orange you guys when you take a hit of it it literally takes like alright you guys know one you guys are gonna open a brand new [ __ ] fresh orange peel that [ __ ] that first little peel and you like you take a sniff and it's like orange peel like I don't know if you guys like that I mean it I like it so that's what it tastes like guys it's nothing artificial there's no official flavoring like just like a little hint of like orange peel that's probably why they call it Agent Orange and [ __ ] it's hot today sorry guys I keep wiping my sweat off but it's [ __ ] hot today it's already [ __ ] 4 o'clock and it's 93 degrees though so we're gonna smoke on this [ __ ] I tell you guys how I feel I'm sober right now so I'm gonna tell you guys how this [ __ ] makes me feel what I like about it what I don't like about it and we're gonna go straight through the review guys so turn off the [ __ ] air real quick so you guys can see these fat ass clouds and this one actually produces a lot more vapor than all the other ones I'm not sure why but it produces a pretty good amount watch [ __ ] delicious and what I like about these cartridges men but to never it's never a boring hit like even though I didn't like the men doe breath and the Wi-Fi og that much I still enjoyed them just because it was a really strong high like compare compare it to like brass knuckles and heavy hitters and all those other shit's like this is pretty top-notch quality and I understand why you have to pay $40 for half a gram you know I I mean I do kind of wish it would be a little bit lower maybe in the 30 35 range because 40 is pretty absurd like you can get you can go out and get yourself something not as good but pretty much up there in quality for $50 full gram and this is 40 for half gram so it's kind of like you know 5050 this is definitely after trying all four of these and after having these for probably like two weeks I I'd say if you have the money go ahead and go buy it if you don't have the money don't don't sweat it you know you I'm sure a time will come when you'll be able to afford it but don't be killing yourself over this Sh it's definitely it's worth it though it's worth it like I'll tell you that it's definitely worth it if you have the money and you're debating it what should I get is it worth it yeah it's definitely worth it and I've tried pretty much for now I'm pretty sure I've tried every single tree based flavor that on the market that they have I think the only one I haven't tried it is the gelato but I'm not really a fan of gelato wax cuz you know for me I like smoking the the real weed from burner for a more originated originated from so I think everything else is pretty much a knockoff so yeah guys so we're gonna keep talking on this I'm outside the gym right now and put it I'm gonna hit the gym after this [ __ ] this [ __ ] always has me feeling good I go into the gym and I just like get in my zone and I start working out guys so if you guys are 18 over 21 and over whatever it is in your state and make sure you guys are smoking along let me know what you guys are smoking on in the [ __ ] description I'm about to turn the [ __ ] air on his hot and ya guys Cheers mmm all I ever take is like probably two to three hits max to this because it is potent like like I said in last video guys this [ __ ] has to be the most herpes cartridge on the market like the hit that you get from it it's like no other eye I've smoked so much [ __ ] in my life nothing nothing hits me this hard no no I mean other than like dabs and [ __ ] like that but like from cartridge wise this is probably by far the best one one thing one thing guys I know I know some of you guys might want to wait for this but I know they they just announced on their Instagram that they're gonna be releasing one gram cartridges and I'm wondering I'm trying to guess how much with OSHA's they're gonna cost like you think they're gonna cost the same amount they're gonna call as like two of these would cost you know $80 [ __ ] $75 but I don't know guys we'll see we'll see what they [ __ ] decide on what the pricing is going to be hopefully it's not too much because I know I know usually come B's charge for the cartridge itself because I know the cartridges are pretty expensive they're like 5 to 10 a pop I heard and then so hopefully it's not that expensive and we're gonna take one last rip of this guy's hopefully this coming week I am able to do some more content it's still gonna be a pretty busy month in my in my opinion we'll see how it goes but yeah it's good I'm soaking to be pretty busy guys but now that I'm reaching I'm getting higher in my um subscribe go and view count I know my evaders I've been popping off lately and I appreciate that I love you guys shout out for all the people watching my videos commenting on my videos you guys keep me [ __ ] motivated and keep it going and I wanna probably soon pause I started maybe this week next week I don't know whenever I find out I'm I'm probably gonna start live streaming for at least an hour to two hours a day I want to start streaming probably for at night and might be streaming the new blackout if you guys would be interested in the new color TV for I'll probably be streaming that [ __ ] and then cuz I what what my plan is now that once I hit 100 I wanted that that pretty much gives me a decent amount of people that watching me I would say you know 100 people so every time I livestream I were to get a couple like 20 30 or whatever the cases and basically what I wanted to do is just live stream and have more people from other communities like the Fortnight community come in and watching and check out my [ __ ] and let's see if they if they like my content and they go ahead and hit the subscribe button you guys know how it goes so you guys should be seeing some more [ __ ] like that I'm gonna probably be getting into more different [ __ ] I'm kind of getting over the wax game or the cartridge game because I feel like I've tried everything this tree base right here with best on the [ __ ] best on the market right now so I really don't know what to try man I know I want I probably want to head out to cookies because I checked out their Instagram and I saw that they have a collaboration with them with the G with the G pins you know guys are no little [ __ ] so you put wax pins and hit it they have a collaboration with those so I want to maybe go pick one of those up see if they're not a [ __ ] expensive there because they're shit's always are overpriced as [ __ ] to go run for like a hundred a gram is stupid but [ __ ] man that [ __ ] has me fade I don't even be able to go to the gym right now but yeah guys if you guys liked today's video make sure to go leave a like make sure to go leave a comment make sure to hit that subscribe button and make sure to share with your friends I'll be creating some more better video sorry guys if this is like not the best video like I said I have been dealing with issues within my family so it's not my mindset isn't in on making videos you know my mindset is elsewhere and I know when you guys know how it is when your mind isn't set on one thing it's hard to focus on that thing and it's hard to work towards that thing but hopefully you guys understand and hopefully you guys stick around so the other guys schedule later", "NYweYsi0x2E": "everyone Pope all's well so recently there's been some negativity when it comes to vaping and buying carts off the black market knowing what you inhale into your body should be priority number one and when stepping into the realm of vaping you don't want to inhale something that's gonna harm you long term so today we want to put an end to all the pleasures out there regarding bad practice and to truly answer the question what is a fake oil cartridge and how to avoid [Music] they coil cards go beyond branding and counterfeit boxes the number one question you should be asking yourself is where am i buying my cards from most reputable companies have authorized retail stores that are allowed to sell their cartridges if you're buying from anywhere other than licensed reputable companies or their authorized retailers nine times out of ten it's a fake and companies that are legit aren't gonna risk selling products to non-leap States eBay Amazon Alibaba are not where they experience weavers goaded by high quality oils sure you can compare your boxes to the boxes on the website but unless you buy from the right site you can still get it wrong also if you're buying oils on a budget you're gonna run into the same problem a big red flag is recognizable big-name brands at low prices let's face it if you paid bunk prices you're gonna pay for bunk oils but how do people get ahold of big name brands and if it's the same cart how can it be fake that brings us to fake cartridge answer number one fake oils take these sell cartridges for example defconn action calm says that all seasaw cards must have two logos a serial number and a transparent rubber ring at the bottom of the cart this cartridge is everything a vapor should look for but I know for a fact that the oil inside is fake meaning that nothing's tested and they let the name brand to sell the cartridge for them to me this is black market plus most cards and boxes can just be bought online and some people think that if cartridges and boxes look legit then there's nothing stopping people from putting their own formula inside plus cartridges can just be a replica and they use cheap metals unless you have somebody you trust a source who tests their oils you never really know what's in it from a normal customer standpoint so what could be in here was they can put synthetics in there like k2 which is a huge deal you shouldn't do that oil thickener or anything that you usually wouldn't see on the cartridge unless your oils are solvent free distillates which indicates that the substances are environmentally friendly with no des lunes then you're gonna run into terpenes in PG you want to limit the amount that's put into your oils both drippings and PG act as carrying agents to carry more flavors into your discipline because distillate itself doesn't really have much flavor and no PG does not cause formaldehyde companies only use these agents to give it their own unique formula and it may also indicate on the stickers the percentages that they use but not always think about as buying mid grade versus Private Reserve but you still don't know what a fake oil cartridge is so what's a fake oil cartridge okay so you got your cleaning lab all set up you got your formula lock down and now you're ready to start filling it up cartridges can you just use any cartridge no no you cannot in January this year of 2019 a new California State law was passed calls phase Reena saving that all California cartridges must be lab tested for heavy metals these tests are specifically for for metals cadmium arsenic mercury and lead and phase threes testings limit is 0.5 parts per million of lead allowed in your oils this is a big deal for vape cartridge producers because unless you have glass pores cartridges contain metal and sometimes the exact same cartridge will pass in one lab and fail in another causing producers to just bypass testing all together just to make a quick buck also the price of testing in a lab has gone up so people are cheating the system by avoiding it entirely so why the variation of testing there is no standardized testing procedures for each lab to follow this means that each lab extracts oil differently and if oil touches exposed brass then it may very well fail phase 3 testing so how to metal get inside of your oil cartridges well that's easy 99% of companies buy cartridges from overseas which allow up to 4% of your oils to be made up of lead which is much higher tooth into what phase 3 wants and unless you're on top of your menu this could be a problem let an arsenic is added to metals like brass which help make metal easier to mold into cartridges and oil is acidic so it eats away at cheap metals allowing particles to be invaded into your body so stop giving people reasons to ban they don't become a victim of uncertainty unfortunately some companies don't want to know how the cartridge is made because they don't want to be how reliable and there's just too much money to be made not to get inside of the oil cartridge market we can't change state law or lab test procedures but we sure can certainly change babe cartridges there are companies out there that are responding to the issue companies like Herve pur have already started innovating carts that are guaranteed to pass phase three testing and multiple facilities and are currently leaving the market who completely lead-free cartridges that vetted testing facilities in California that know how to properly test for phase three requirements the next generation of VAP cartridges might be hidden stores in winter time this year but keep in mind that cartridges made before January 1st 2018 are still allowed to be sold and could still be in circulation and states like Washington and have passed similar laws only allowing 0.7 parts per million so be aware of your state's requirements I know it seems like a lot but now you're in the know and knowing is half the battle so please no more black market cards we hope this video was helpful to you guys let us know what you'd like to see in the next video where do you buy your loyal cards did you know that metal could be in it as always don't forget to subscribe and like and we'll see you next time face", "NxEAgqkpn1k": "if you could buy the packaging online then you don't know what is in it but this could have been cup of vitamin e caught with something else kind of sauce you know i got to have grub but i have the granola okay all right he had a bunch of in there i don't know it's kind of hard to tell about you know what's bootleg and what's not it's unusual that they're this heavily contaminated this is potentially deadly this this particular cartridge when you're dealing with the black market remember that there's risk it's never 100 i just felt like i was going to faint i realized that there's something wrong with me on the news two or three people have already died [Music] it's interesting that a lot of these cases fell off in the fall of 2019 it's true it's gone and that's what puzzles us the most like where these people are still vaping out there we see them all the time like what happened why aren't they coming in anymore vaping illness blamed antifa is [Music] as clickbait headlines warp our view of the world we're going down the rabbit hole to ask how afraid should we really be on this episode the mysterious vaping illnesses of 2019 that created a media frenzy the centers for disease control is warning people to stop using e-cigarettes following several mysterious deaths linked to vaping the cdc investigating a medical mystery spreading across the country tonight two new deaths in minnesota bring the nationwide total to 31 deaths three-quarters were using thc containing products doctors are now warning the public about what they call ivali there was a lot of confusion at first was this an e-cigarette thing a tec thing there were a lot of question marks what we know now is that a lung injury called evali peaked in september of 2019. by february 2020 2800 cases and 68 deaths were linked to the injury but where did divali come from and should we still be afraid of vaping i started going down the rabbit hole by first reaching out to greg rodriguez who was sick with the volume in september 2019. i remember thinking that it was a miracle you know these vapes because there was no smell yeah no more no more dryer sheets right i remember i remember those days but yeah exactly tell me about the onset of you starting to get sick i felt very dehydrated i felt like i was my chest was just becoming very tight it started to vomit like a greenish yellowish type substance which in hindsight it was what was this vitamin e acetate that my body was trying to reject after checking into a hospital in queens greg was put into a coma by doctors and brought here to the long island jewish hospital we sat down with greg's physician who treated greg along with some of the first divali cases in new york so how did you meet greg so we got called from one of our sister hospitals forest hills uh that they had a young patient that they had just put on events later in the er they wanted to let us know that they were worried they were going to run into trouble and could we think about putting him on ecmo what is ecmo exactly ecmo's extracorporeal membrane oxygenation where we take the blood out of someone's body and we oxygenate it in an oxygenator outside of the body and then put it back in so we use it as a replacement for your lungs when your lungs are not working and it sort of buys you time for your lungs to get better i think we cleaned out his lungs every single day for the first two days and what came back with him was just this thick caramel looking stuff just his lungs were filled with it this is his original chest x-ray when he came in and if you look here you could see that both of the lungs are involved there's the lungs should all be black like that and his lungs you can see have a lot of white areas here none of that should be there what exactly in the vaping caused these illnesses i still think we don't know for sure i think a lot of people have a lot of different theories and some think it was the vitamin e that was mixed in with the vaping product and some people think it was the flavoring some people think it was just the marijuana the way that it was heated and mixed in some way so i think we have an exact answer while the science is not fully understood it's thought that additives in the vaping oils break down and change when heated at the high temperatures required for vaping when these substances cool down they may cause inflammation or coat the walls of the lungs and debris unprepared for these foreign objects the lungs push the body into crisis mode when these came out we started to see news stories like you should stop smoking e-cigarettes this is an e-cigarette thing and then it slowly shifted that the story the picture became a little bit more clear that it was oh maybe it's mostly thc products but then still certain people said that they didn't vape thc that it was only nicotine do you believe that it's possible to get some of these illnesses from just vaping nicotine or do you think that they maybe weren't exactly being totally truthful we definitely saw patients who told us it was they only were taking nicotine i think they were truthful i do think that they don't know what they were taking for craig that's exactly what happened basically yeah i had decided to stop buying off the street and then i decided to take the risk of buying them in bulk on the dark web so i thought i hit the jackpot and it turns out that i made a huge mistake with uh trying to get a good deal when i first started to vape it was easy to spot a fake car then summer 2019 these these fake cars um came out the oil inside it was so thick and it just looked the same color it just felt so real what greg is referring to here is known as the bubble test a low-fi way to spot a fake cart a high purity distillate would mean the bubble in the cartridge moves slowly or not at all when it is turned upside down however pure thc extract can be too thick to constantly flow to the coil so cutting agents like terpenes can be added for both flavor and flow counterfeiters who might dilute the product for bigger profits could then add vitamin e acetate to re-thicken the extract fooling the bubble test and the consumer the cdc says that vitamin e acetate is strongly linked to the valley outbreak in 2019 but how prevalent is this dirty card industry i asked greg how hard it was to find a marketplace in the dark web anyone who wants to know would just go on google and type in dark web best marketplaces okay it seems like you know it's that easy you know but yeah it really is after some surprisingly easy google searches i booted up my vpn downloaded tor and started browsing the dark web you're going on the dark web don't you want to go oh okay we're in the tour all right so now i'm on the dark web what do we got here you get a fake id driver's license to have lsd for 30 bucks euro bank notes wow you can get counterfeit money on here unbelievable just spend money to make money what if i find my credit card information on here that'd be really wild okay we're here for purpose we're just looking for weed cannabis concentrates live resin better than sex better than money is it after finding dozens of vendors at dell thc carts i slid into some dms well i didn't get too many responses back i did get a suggestion i could easily find dirty carts in places like liquor or corner stores with some spots in mind i met up with the dower hour aficionado and sometimes camera operator taji amin to do some undercover research so we're in brooklyn right now where cannabis is legal but that doesn't mean that you can't buy underground thc cartridges at a number of smoke and vape shops so we're gonna go look around see what these stores have and i'm wearing a wire and uh hopefully i don't get caught can't see anything right can't see anything i'm wearing a wire here look okay all right let's go check it out oh i'm so sketched out by myself i wouldn't sell to me all right hey man you guys got greens no no okay no go no go there's a couple more down here i think it was a little sketched out by me though i mean we just look like we're hanging out right [Music] right okay the next one's right up here and then what's going on you got any greens right now growth and these are legit right these uh these are bootleg right how much are they 140. all right one day when i get paid man i'll be back all right so you had a bunch of in there they were 140 a piece all right we're going just across the street hey man how's it going how are you doing good how are you doing do you guys have greens thc cartridges yeah how much of these guys 70 70. 45. yeah it's good stuff i've read about though i've read that they they've got the bootleg but there's bootlegs out there these uh so far people coming all right that's all good man thanks dude yeah uh he had a bunch of carts he had like half grams of grams i don't know it's kind of hard to tell about you know what's bootleg and what's not we were given a sample of a bodega bot thc cartridge there's nothing in these right now so i'm not in possession of thc it looked real to me with nice packaging and branding but was it i connected with push a distributor of thc carts in new york city to see if he knew anything about these corner store carts i went shopping for some cartridges at a bodega do like any of your you know i don't do nothing like that no you know where those cards come from i mean most likely they come from l.a if not somebody maybe they make them here the thc cartridges that you're selling out here are they licensed to be made in california yeah some of them all have that are actual have license and there's a lot of vape brands in california that operate in the gray market they have their own original packaging and their own original you know liquid but they don't want to jump through the hoops to get licensed what's the quality of something that's in the gray market sure i mean you can find really good  like i try to stick with brands that haven't gotten so big that they're you know counterfeited if i could buy the packaging oh mine i don't want that i showed push the sample we had obtained to get his opinion on it the main thing is the packaging like this is you know somebody spent good money to to design all this they got big enough and then somebody else said well we want to rip that brand off and they knew somebody a graphic designer they knew somebody in china and they just duplicated it and now this is a clone you don't know what the is in this it's not like you met big chief right right i don't know big chief sure so now you're doing the bubble test right well that ain't moving okay that's not moving so somebody that would only go by the bubble test would say oh this is good because this  don't move it's not moving at all [Music] which would probably mean that you don't want to hit this thing rather than the bubble test push showed me what he called the google test to avoid counterfeit brands so big chief packaging is what you showed me right so the first thing that pops up is that holy so let me see that again this is exactly okay look you could buy 150 pieces of this at 214 a piece wow that looks legit right so that yeah that looks nice that looks exactly the same holy so i have no idea you don't know what this is you don't know what's in that push showed me a number of different cart brands that have counterfeit clones each of them looking like the real deal big chief right now their actual website was all the way down here do they have anything on their side about you know uh yeah here's how to verify the problem okay is there a code somewhere there it is oh not authentic no way yeah so somebody's selling this at bodegas in brooklyn it is not legitimate that's just crazy man yeah google test google test google test for the win realizing that i had a counterfeit cartridge i had to find out what was actually in this thing i reached out to pro verde labs to run some tests on our sample the lab results that came back were alarming to say the least the sample exceeded the acceptable amount for eight pesticides as well as containing concentration of vitamin e acetate we saw this in there at about eight percent little eight and a half percent this is potentially deadly this this particular cartridge the pesticides were there at such a heavy concentration that we had to do further dilutions uh enable to analyze that and still be within our calibration per range wow it's unusual that they're this heavily contaminated were you surprised to find vitamin e acetate in in this cartridge i was it's well known there's better alternatives i thought by now that there would be no more in production and that what had been produced would have already been either purchased consumed or disposed of apparently that's not the case and then in addition i mean you usually find some levels of pesticides but this one had um a lot of pesticides you know we see in this one biphenyzate at 190 000 parts per billion this is 190 times what would be permissible in california i don't know what the long-term effect of consuming a product like this would be but it's not good the pesticides were not meant to be put in our body are vaping products safe or is the market just so unregulated that it's not even worth the risk all states now have a a supply chain of regulated safe produced products if you're sourcing products from reputable uh suppliers i don't think that there's any concern for that so i'm just curious to know as a professional like yourself what do you think the media got right and what do you think the media got wrong in this situation i think as as human beings we try to simplify things into our what we're capable of understanding and i think the problem with the vape crisis is it's a very very complex issue when we see these acute things happening people dying we look for the culprit and i think it's so hard because i think there's a mixture of components that may be responsible for the hazards associated with it not just the vitamin e acetate so the vitamin e acetate is very much like that could affect you in the very short term whereas these other other the flavorings and the pesticides we don't know what the long-term consequences of them are sure they could be they could result in you know generations of increased lung cancer because of these we don't we don't know you know these could be 10 20 years out till we do we understand it i mean think about the the tobacco industry and we may find the same thing 10 years down the road with vape products associated with cannabis or nicotine this story doesn't really have an ending toxic vape cartridges will continue to flood the streets nicotine thc legal gray market and black market it's out there and even though we don't hear much about a volley anymore it still seems very easy to find vitamin e acetate and counterfeit cartridges the news cycle seems to have washed away the story as we all moved on to more immediate problems which there are a lot of these days but whether you vape or are impacted by stories that have faded from the front page the only way to stay informed is to take matters into your own hands and do what push does google it [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign", "iTGAmHipYL0": "[Music] filling and

youtube career I did nothing but carb like cartridges on raw Gardens sauces and things like that man it was [ __ ] phenomenal so hold on I don't even tell you guys what we were smoking on so right here they feel if that book hopefully that's focused in but we got some gorilla gas berry and this is an indica sitting at 84 point 86 THC men and to pair that up though we got that Relaxo m9 battery right here that's this divot this giveaway for this battery is actually still going on it was gonna be a full month's worth of them it was gonna be a full um a full month that I was gonna be doing it

below man and be subscribed to my page so yeah cheers guys get it crack this sucker open you guys know what a raw garden looks like right you got the little yellowish tint little clearish go ahead and smack this on here oh quick one time and man what saddens me is that I cannot find my green ooze battery I don't know if you guys remember my green ooze battery that um that was the my daily driver for a while yeah that was my daily driver for a while I mean I am ended up finding up about this battery and this battery honestly Chuck's so this has been my daily driver since then I've been using on almost all of my cartridges if you guys want to check this one out I'll make sure to put their info down in description below relax om9 thank you for this battery and it's on the red setting let's go ahead and take a Cheers I mean my cheers hey cheers boys if you guys are 18 and over 21 and over man we back at it with the raw garden videos baby cheers guys I think that might have been a little bit too hot yeah the wrong guy always makes me called you off of that little hit I'm telling you this battery dude the water use on this patty are insane it makes that makes your hits and extremely freakin huge so we're gonna go in on a green I think Green is lowest setting for this so cheers goes whoo oh my goodness that was the perfect hit yo Wow Wow Oh holy [ __ ] you're on e open on my window or something's kind of I'm not gonna lie I'm pretty [ __ ] hot in here so hold on this way for the beep Ian stop all right cool so like I was saying man's been a while since I smoked the raw garden I decided to call a cop went in oh my gosh all for those two to three hits man ah it is phenomenal though that was pretty freakin lame man I finished recording like 12 minutes a 12-minute was supposed to be 12 minutes total of the video and then um it just stopped recording man I was talking about all right so I finished when I checked back the recording it ended off at I was a 2 to 3 hits in and then after that I ended up taking like another three hits and I ended up talking a lot more talking about the battery talking about the giveaway talking about all that stuff so I guess I'm just gonna have to I don't even remember what I said I'm gonna be honest with you guys I don't remember not a damn word that I said B is what I shoot most of these um cartridge videos it's off the top of my head because it's a review video and things like that so it's nothing as planned out nothing is planned out now you guys know that so [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] get into this thing man alright guys so like I was saying two to three hits and deep I mean now we're like 6 or 7 i'm high [ __ ] right now guys we're gonna try to brainstorm so you see where i left off alright so this rock garden cartridge right here that i'm gonna show you guys this is this is the setup that i've been running as of late and honestly this setup is honestly pretty fired like it's it's the m9 Relaxo battery with whatever cartridges but this this battery right here honestly has the best voltages for any cartridges from low temps to high temps it hits all the spots you know and the raw guard you can never go wrong with raw garden man you can never ever ever go wrong with raw garden i think the only thing that i have an issue with with raw garden like i said is like i have an issue with how many times they cross the same strains over and over and over again and i know they're just trying to be like you know creative and trying to find new strains are gonna smack and things like that but honestly do have it's like if you see if you see things not progressing you see them digressing and being the same thing over and over i it maybe you should just try something else you know you're not gonna get better results doing the same thing that's facts this thing gives the fattest hits like oh my gosh that one got me dude I forgot how hard these raw garden cartridges met I honestly I remember I used to freaking get like baked off of like like two to three hits and right now I'm like ten hits deep now I'm obviously frickin blown I'm probably gonna have to just sit here and just be on my phone and chill with the a/c on for a little bit before I do anything but your voice is baked as heck so like I was saying man the my overall experience with raw Gardens I love it there there indica smack all the times for me I feel like the sativas and the hybrids are a no-go I feel like that's not only with rock and I feel that's with all all weed or anything in general men are actually not even but I think with bud and dabs I'm cool with but when it comes to cartridges the hybrids don't do anything for me it has to be a straight-up indicator and that's why I like indicas a lot more than anything oh man this that hate got me bro like I said I'm super baked right now let's give you guys a full rundown so the flavor profile on this [ __ ] already forgot bro [Music] so it has like a little fruitiness at the end when you Excel but a gas the earthy taste when you when you inhale it's pretty smooth it's smoother than most of the raw gardens that I've tried definitely it has a little bit more of a yellowish tint to it also and man it is this is an indica dominant I definitely feel the indica hitting me I'm lumped right now like I said my eyes are actually turning a little bit red so that's actually quite crazy I need a damn very good and then um yeah but like the Tate like I said the taste is phenomenal like every other raw garden that I've ever tried nothing too special but at the same time you know it's better than most of the cartridges that I've tried so raw garden you get you get you get another 8 out of 10 from you man you guys need to make something that's I don't know man you guys need to do something you guys need to do something different for the community I feel like you guys have done a weed thank you for everything that you've done that Bo we kind of want something different man at least from from me man I want something different from you guys so yeah guys I think I'm gonna go ahead and out the video here hopefully we at least reach to 10 minutes so you guys can have a good video to watch man let me know in the comments below what you guys what is your guys's experience with raw garden you know what do you guys like about it what don't you like about it what are your what are your favorite strains above them you know because I know they have some of this like I said they were they have some of the same strains that they cross with multiple times so let me know what you guys is favored right now in them in March 2020 man let me know which one's the best one you saw I think that's for me the best one that I have ever smoked from them I think was a the summer Bubba I think this summer Bubba for me was freaking phenomenal or that one or the LG Chem one of those two so yeah like I said I'm gonna go ahead and out the video here hopefully you guys enjoyed it man hopefully you guys have a positive blessed day after seeing this video man stay motivated like always and we'll catch you guys in the next word", "kMzJvwG2rsQ": "[Music] I'm in the city that used to be called Saigon renamed Ho Chi Minh City after the country's leader during the Vietnam War it's more than 40 years since the conflict ended but its effects I still felt everywhere this is to maternity hospital in Ho Chi Minh City now dr. Furr is based there and she's a tireless campaigner when it comes to making people all over the world aware of the connection between Agent Orange and children born with deformities I'm here to visit something called a peace village one of 13 she has set up she believes many of the children in them have been affected by Agent Orange a defoliant dropped by u.s. forces everybody wants to speak to you this is the peace village would you mind showing me dr. B indeed got Fleur he's internationally respected for her work though she's 77 she feels she can't fully retire she texts me first to meet a little girl called champ you seen cliff valley here south on kaboodle come so this is a child his parents were affected by Asian origin it's flying and these are all signs of children who have been affected by Agent Orange yeah you see five deformities recognized Friday scientific communities versus neural tube defects the quantities of sensory organs the Siamese twins revelation cleft lip and deformities of limbs those deformities are common in Vietnam dr. foie told me that a research study she conducted showed that birth defects in Agent Orange sprayed areas were three or more times higher than other places we take care of many children I think that why the Agent Orange about 60% of them have parents directly exposed to the Agent Orange during war or after but the war was years ago why is it still affecting children now this is third and fourth generation one thing is that they have seen can be transmitted from mother to the babies the Agent Orange used during the war contained a dangerous chemical called dioxin dr. Furr and many scientists believe it can lead to genetic mutations studies where mice were given dioxin showed this it's hard to prove in humans but doctor for herself is convinced that generations of Vietnamese children are being affected some children here were abandoned at birth for some it's a lifelong home like Lloyd okay and this baby very happy you like the big brother yes a big family this your place yes come because Loy was born in an area affected by Agent Orange one of the senior doctors told me they think there's a good chance his disability is dioxin related so you sleep in this room tell me about when you were a baby do you remember much about when you were a baby Keith oh hey mom mom toy yeah Dan boy Hakan young you know none my guy live or die would you rather be living at home with your family no maybe young nothing young a young deputy campaign someone I knew more Gannon woman no getting done are they got and go ahead Jesus am i got em young women damn be this piece village ward is amazing and the work that's been done is incredible but I mean the harsh realities if what doctor first is same about the connection between Agent Orange and the deformities that these kids are suffering is true you know she says 60% of them you know are connected to Agent Orange then the harsh realities they are war victims and war victims they're paying for a war that happened over half a century ago and the sad thing is most of us have forgotten about it [Music] Agent Orange was essentially a weed killer but much much stronger it was used by the American forces to destroy the jungle their enemy used for cover the production process he cause contamination with the most toxic form of dioxin known as TCDD the levels in Agent Orange make it one of the most dangerous chemicals ever manufactured between 1961 and 1971 in that 10-year period the US Army dropped millions of gallons of Agent Orange over jungle like this to strip it of all of its foliage which entire team my mind's eye it looks cool rocky not a youngling oh why am i checking my being it he'd [ __ ] it off dang it that's a take multi mr.

that sooner do you mean that no one I'm not gonna lie I'm not going to corner sons daughter boy who is 41 is severely disabled and is classified by the government as an agent orange victim because of her father's exposure during the war at Eden cause after sir until that night leave that man hangout named Lonnie Jung this I'm opening know so somebody can cause I can unite let the feet whatever sorry mother Wolverine um based on the limited studies that have been done the Vietnam Red Cross estimate those affected by Agent Orange at around 3 million of whom 150,000 are children with birth defects the government provides a monthly payment to over 200,000 families to lift [Music] their son home is 38 and a celebrated monochord musician and composer he's gradually gone blind you and your sister and your parents are known as Agent Orange victims how does that make you feel the final call it is a viola no no cams and he what only family you know what I mean oh I okay tornado clarity already maybe they don't in la fecha de of the cantina cos they play music where confetti hey mi casa Helicon gone in the his own he's a young guy to a Kurumi do you ever feel angry or frustrated that what has happened to you ko-teng boy you guys we need what comes up you love me that's how I mean okay couch in China in Montevideo didn't know class wake up to tempo Conway I knew what what lovely people and you know I'm guessing that when son left the army he was probably hoping to leave behind the war and all the memories of the atrocities but birth of these kids and the fact that they're both disabled mean that his family can never forget Vietnamese doctors are concerned parents affected by Agent Orange are passing on genetic defects to their children but they're also worried about the fact there are still areas heavily contaminated with dioxin one of them is vana airbase which is right behind me and it's been quoted of having dioxin levels that are 350 times higher than the international safety standards now we've been told that there are us specialists in there at the moment carrying out a cleanup operations but what I think is absolutely nuts is that the only thing that's separating the Vietnamese population from one of the most contaminated places on the planet is of why offense then Aang was the main u.s. airbase during the war where huge stockpiles of Agent Orange were stored the chemical residue remained seeping into their names water supply and getting into the food chain the US government has donated millions in aid to cleanup Danang and other hotspots working with the Vietnamese government to Da Nang Association for victims of Agent Orange introduced me to one of the families whose children might have been affected by dioxin their dad served in the Army after the war but went to areas that had been sprayed and he believes that he may have passed on the effects to his young son who's now in Da Nang hospital fighting for his life I'm gonna go and meet him dip has had heart problems all of his knife but was recently rushed to hospital when things took a turn for the worse his parents meaning hai have to take it in turns to give him constant care at the moment you can't lie down because it's too painful he has to sleep propped up he needs a heart transplant yeah and how much would it cost a little at a time so it's about $40,000 and how will you get that money what do you think has caused dips problems even our messenger that I believe in [Music] dibbs heart defect is on the list of conditions that the Vietnamese government associate with Agent Orange but his family could also just be unlucky ir s-- tips doctor what he thinks speaking to his parents they believe that his illness could have been caused by Agent Orange because his father worked in the Army and he moved through contaminated fields anything can happen so until now the exactly cause is not clear the problem is not only have they got to deal with their son who is in so much pain but they don't know the reason but medicine will have a limited yeah so we know what is happening in that body but we don't know the cause exactly there's no tests that can prove a genetic illness has been caused by Agent Orange what is these last few months been like for you calm down calm down the puppeteer they will be home you're done dropped it upon nothing okay [Music] it's not just exposure to Agent Orange in the past that worries dips father he believes his village is still affected by it since our Ming I'd really love for you to show me how this area was impacted by Agent Orange [Music] [Music] Loic on your line oh yeah black on black hmm very cool baby come come come back now so in this area can you not grow any more crops from combat hunger attack do you think the reason for the poor crops is because of Agent Orange I doubt they do come with you know what can we learn techno-pop no can you learn okay no no no tater I'm gonna take these you're gonna Randall don't attack them we were told by the Dan hang Association for victims of Agent Orange that it was stored near here but that no tests have been done to check dioxin levels some men can't know for sure but he's convinced his family have been at risk hello even though it's very sick dippers ask to come home from hospital [Music] EAL my why did you want to come back home I meet the rest of the family I know your son he also has problems as well don't worry about me do you mind if we see your stomach another cookie but you're in porn and after you write because men can't prove he was exposed to dioxin the family can't get any compensation you can see how much they really cherish having yet back home man it was Depp who actually requested to be brought back home because he wanted to be around the people who loved him but what just keeps sticking with me and keeps it means that they will never ever know for sure what has caused their son's illnesses and all they can do is just enjoy these precious moments that they have left sadly just a week after my visit dear passed away it could be lack of funds it could be lack of will or that the science is very hard but I'm shocked at how much still needs to be done to understand the effects of Agent Orange I go to see dr. foot back at the peace village I know you've been working all day today's how do you feel when you see all of these children here whose parents have been affected by Agent Orange and they've passed it on to their children they're people who cause such crimes they don't recognize their responsibilities for example the chemical companies they still there and they don't have any responsibility I think everybody must get angry with them in 2008 dr. four was a key witness when Vietnamese groups tried to sue the u.s. chemical companies that made Agent Orange they lost because the US Court ruled its use didn't violate the rules of war and that the u.s. government and manufacturers weren't aware of all the risks to human health without admitting liability for the effects of Agent Orange the US government has given 21 million dollars to help disabled people in Vietnam living in sprayed areas dr. Fleur would like more and how difficult is it for a family who give birth to a child who's affected by Agent Orange first of all is that to face people living around you see they say that oh you have done something so that that punish you to give you such a child so they get a lot of stigma from the people around because they have very strong they most of them are very poor because they live in the spread areas in the warzone experience if you go for them to take care of such a child before I leave Vietnam I want to catch up with the peace villages Big Brother no no you go to train now yes I now was women he's a fellow athlete I've dropped in on a photoshoot ins friends of doing for noise social media profile less our success story from the peace village took up Paralympics women represents Vietnam and now he's having a photo shoot look at him he's a star with all of this training you're doing do you want to try and make it into the team for 2020 for the Paralympics in Tokyo as I make this what to win gold yeah no no no go oh you got your medals Wow Asian para games my MA yeah my MA all very special I know tell me about your disability your condition you know do you know much about the history and the reasons don't wave and I'ma be Bonita unite he like come be quantum lamp we hang time and gamma qu some powerful there you're really confident smiling all the time in it but do you think some of the other children here do you think they will have more problems when they go out into society when love move yourself a yo-yo like Joker a man so totin man man nice sound booth doing them up and over like quick talk comma like a heavy heart la latina so happy mm I know it's hard it's about who you are as a person not your disability yeah thank you I love Lloyd's attitude he's a huge inspiration and perhaps represents the next generation of you forwards in Vietnam [Music] no one is gonna accept blame for what happened in a dreadful war but if the US and Vietnam got together to investigate the effects of Agent Orange further it might stop more children being born with terrible disabilities [Music]", "whx9ytKios8": "oh hi i didn't see you there [Music] what is going on people my name is chillady back at you with another dope ass video and in today's video though it is nothing like what you thought it was going to be it's interesting it's new not really it's okay anyway today we're going to be talking about the hard truths and negative side effects of delta a yes that is right so as you guys know i have made two videos over delta eight i made an edible video which if you haven't seen go check it out it's awesome and then i made a video just talking about delta 8 the carts those are my two most popular now i don't want to be known as the delta 8 guy but i've tried to get that bag though there hasn't been a whole lot of research done on it and now i've done more research on it myself i've had time to you know use it whatever um and i want to talk about the hard truths now we're going to spark an actual joint of weed of marijuana so cheers boys so the first thing on my list delta a is similar to delta 9 which delta 9 is thc that we smoke the cannabis and the only dif real difference is that literally the chain effect of the cannabis or the chain number 9 or something like that t-god can pull it up delta 8 tetrahydrocannabinol has a lower psychotropic potency than its close cousin delta 9 thc it is known to connect to both our cb1 and cb2 receptors well so they're very similar delta 8 is being discovered as an alternative to 9 since it produces a less intense gentle enjoyable and manageable high when compared well in the aspects of healing and stuff like that but for delta eight even though you can federally buy it it doesn't get you as high as regular weed does you still fail a drug test so like that's pointless wouldn't you rather just smoke delta nine now i know for some people failing a drug test is a really big deal you know what i mean man i had to change my hair i was over here looking like a 13 year old emo kid you can't accept me at my worst you don't deserve me on my back you're still okay with failing a drug test but buying delta eight online why are you choosing that over delta nine you know i would much rather smoke regular weed than fail a drug test over that all right the second thing now if you watch my delta edible video you'll know that at the end of the video i was smoking a joint outside we're gonna i also did a 1500 milligram edible challenge delta 9 thc and i was not nearly as high as i was off of just 75 milligrams of delton delta 8. i mean i was uncomfortable i was tired i didn't want to do anything i got nothing done that day i just was like done i was like all i want to do is sit here and melt on the couch don't ever fit into the quote or the stereotype that you don't do anything but you need to do more when you're smoking that way people know first it was fine i was relaxed but then after like two hours i was like oh man i was like this is terrible all i want to do is like go to sleep i gave these edibles to a couple co-workers they all said that they were just like super relaxed off one but then i gave them two and they were like oh man it's too much my girlfriend could only one she ate one went to work and was like [ __ ] up she said it was terrible she would never do it again if you want to be lazy and like you want to do nothing all day and you just want to sleep uh i definitely recommend it it would be helpful if like at night on to the next one so the next one is the dab pins you can buy all this stuff online okay this is federally legal so just so you know like i'll put the link again in the description i wish they'd come and [ __ ] uh sponsor me man so i noticed though because i i had used two two dab cards i smoked two of them but first of all the price is ridiculous i mean it's like 35 40 and you gotta wait for it and that kind of sucks that [ __ ] was harsh look look look at me moss that [ __ ] was harsh okay like it really like i wouldn't even blow it out my nose and it would hurt my nose which is crazy and like it would make me always cough and it was like a anybody that i let hit it anybody anybody bro they would [ __ ] cough their ass off like people that smoke like what the [ __ ] it's like a really big rush of like this big body high like just right away and it was weird and then sometimes i wouldn't get high at all like one minute i'd be really high the next i wouldn't it's supposed to have really a non-psychoactive effect that's what makes it different from delta nine um i don't know i don't know if that's really true though to be real honestly that brings me on to the next thing is that it has a pretty bad stigma people for some reason thought think it's like that synthetic weed that spice that [ __ ] back when we were like young i can't believe anybody smoked that [ __ ] i did i will be honest i'll if you guys want to do a story time about that it is hemp it is from him it is hun no there's it is not that [ __ ] but it has a bad stigma i mean it's definitely not that spicy [ __ ] though for sure so that brings me to my last point okay so they're already trying to ban it like they're i don't know when they're voting i think they're voting in like november or december somebody told me in the comments it's like to me it's not you know to me it's not fake weed but i think it's still a little sketchy you know it still has a lot of positive benefits as well though and so i'm thinking if you had seven likes on this video if we get seven likes okay you guys have been [ __ ] killing it bro look look you guys been killing it all right i appreciate all y'all for real we're getting more subscribers i'm trying to hit 50 by let's see what is it september i'm trying to hit 50 at least by the end of october hopefully yeah let's try to do that all right let's get 50 subs bro seven likes we will do a positive review because there are positive things about it i know that i've said that the negatives of it but that's from my personal experience from me trying man let's finish this [ __ ] joint holy [ __ ] [Music] so now i've looked and i found a lot of positive things so hit that seven uh hit that seven light goal boy and we will do another review yeah man that's all i got to say about it this joint is pissing me off much love y'all seven likes do it do it all right go to twitch.tv link will be in the description uh go to my twitter man i'm trying to get my twitter up as well like i want y'all to be able to follow me and know what i'm doing you know know when i'm going to make a video knowing i'm going live you know i always want feedback as well you know i want to talk to you guys too that's always awesome so much love you guys let me know what you guys thought about the video i will see you in the next video be safe peace out [Music] you", "UrJJjwEnSeI": "[Music] hi guys I'm Dan Hoff CEO of honey stick and today I'm bringing you guys a video that is based on special requests from a lot of our viewers that want to know exactly how to pick out the best oil tank now this is normally not a video I would do because out of all this assortment of oil tanks that I have put together is basically comprising of about everything on the market on our website we probably sell about five or six of them now I have these in our testing lab because I'm always testing them we do have a lot of extractors that we private label for that we might be making this these cartridges for that might not be available but one of the common questions that a lot of our users are having that really wanted to see this video up is I have a honey stick battery when I go to dispensary and I have an option of picking out prefilled cartridges how do I know which one's gonna be good or how it's gonna work you know so this video here is gonna go through from you being able to eyeball an oil 5-10 disposable cartridge and being able to tell bass have a good reasonable estimate of how it is gonna be able to perform what it will kind of features it's gonna have so that you can pick out the best oil vape tank for your battery now what is a disposable 510 thread cartridge so there's a lot of people out there who purchase these 510 thread oil cartridges to fill themselves and they say but if it's disposable can I only fill it one time so the short answer is no most of these tanks you can take if you're buying them empty you can fill them up four to five times without a problem however some of them you can only fill once and we'll go over that other times when you go to dispensary most of them already have oil in them so just because you have an amazing cartridge if you're buying a bad extract not even the best cartridge can make a bad oil taste good so however you can have good oil where the whole vaping experience gets dulled down or made bad or taste burnt from a bad cartridge so what this video is gonna help you do is it's gonna help you make some educated decisions when it comes to purchasing and selecting either the cartridge you're gonna fill at home or the cartridges that you're gonna pick up prefilled to know how they're gonna perform so let's start off by starting from the very top of the cartridges of how you're gonna be able to start making some identification so let's do a close up here and start off with when you look at the mouthpiece to see what the hole size is gonna be let's start at the tip and work our way to the bottom okay guys so here we have a close-up view we're gonna start at the very top of the cartridge so we can go in and start making some determinations so you can see I put together what I thought was the best assortment of pre fillable disposable tanks so the tops let's go to the very top first things first generally the wider bore you have on mouthpiece which is the part that you inhale through the more vapor you're gonna get the smaller that hole is you are gonna get either less vapor or it's gonna have a smoother easier transition into your mouth so let's let's take a shot from the top here just to show the differences in the size of the bores so basically as you could see from this basic stylus plastic tip car it has a very small Inlet hole even these stainless steel ones here right they have relatively small and some of them are larger when we work our way down you have these wide bore mouthpieces which have very wide inlets if you're a person who really likes to vape like this one is probably the widest if you like to get a big cloud and a massive hits that you can really draw air through with minimal amount of resistance you probably want to get a cartridge that has a wider bore hole at the very top as opposed to having one of the smaller tips that are more focused on smoothness now some people have said that the wider bore the mouthpieces sometimes you get a little flavor loss because you're just going straight mouth to lung instead of kind of mouth to thrill to lung on your inhale it kind of focuses more on just going straight to lung however you probably get better activation and more of a hit now once you've figured out what size borer you want there's a whole multitude of mouthpiece materials as you can see you start off with the basic plastic mouthpiece which is very lightweight and then you have stainless steel and then you have ceramic which you can see here you even have wood and kind of an acrylic resin and then you have not stainless steel but more of a aluminum coated metal so I can tell you right off the bat if you are at or if you like tattoo on your cartridges like in high school I wouldn't want people to see what my pencil number two pencils look like but luckily I grew out of that but you know people sometimes chew on their cigarettes chew on their cartridges if you art or you know you have the plastic option that's not going to break your teeth but you don't want little plastic particles getting into your mouth so you're probably best off going with a natural wood cartridge so this is a natural wooden mouthpiece it's very soft wood it's not even sealed with an epoxy for coating however if you're gonna be refilling this a lot do get new tips because when you chew on them they are gonna get beat up and the moisture sitting on wood does not bode well you also have the acrylic and the metal ones if you chew I would stay far from the metal ones you're gonna end up breaking your teeth the ceramic what's a really unique offering with ceramic style mouthpieces is that they say that it's very clean very easy to get clean it also feels sturdy like the metal ones however doesn't feel heavy in your so it's it's very natural on to the lips and it offers again it's super easy to clean off it's much lighter than the stainless steel pieces and it just feels overall more natural to wear as a stainless steel one you know you are putting a little piece of metal into your mouth and what's unique let's say about the powder coated ones to where it's not like a shiny stainless steel and thick metal it's a much thinner metal and it's coated so it's never you know really gonna be cold to your lips if you pick them up if it's been in the AC or whatnot so when selecting your mouthpiece you have your the bore of the inlet hole and you also have the mouthpiece material now mouthpiece shape also makes a difference generally as you can see you're very wide bore ones are very cylindrical and that is to just allow maximum vapor to come up through them these flattened mouthpieces that look more like black and milds are gonna dull the vapor down condense it and make it a smoother transmission so again we're going back to wide bore more vapor flattened is gonna possibly be smoother if you're undecided and you want in between the two you have these kind of hookah style tips that have a relatively wide wide bore but they don't get flattened too much to restrict the vapor so mouthpiece shape and size definitely the first point of contact with the cartridge in kind of a first way that you can determine it now what we're gonna do is we're gonna take all these cartridges out and we're gonna talk about what the body of the tank brings to the game okay guys now before we move on to going over what the differences are between the body of the tanks one more notable thing about the mouthpiece is if you are buying your cartridges to refill whether you buy to a dispenser buy them from guys like us to refill the one thing that you have to know when you're dealing with tops is there is a new type of top which child safety is really big in the industry right now so there are compression tops that once the extractor or you fill them up and you basically crimp them down right you see there's no screw here once you crimp this down this cartridge is not coming back apart for you to refill so then once you go through your initial extract right on a childproof crimp lock here there's a pop top you're not gonna be able get back into this cartridge without breaking it and so you're not going to be all refilled so if you're looking for more than one use out of your cartridge don't buy the crimp tops this is also crimp top as you could see there's no threading and you can see this is one of the newer resin cartridge is actually very popular cartridge so once you push that down you're not getting back into it now let's talk about the body of these things now you have generally two types of outside bodies or reservoirs which house the oil that you're gonna be filling you generally have plastic and you have glass now things to look for is plastic cartridges generally they're not as popular anymore because people you know they want purity when you fill up a plastic cartridge it sits for a long time I don't know if it's true or not I'm not a scientist but they say they could alter the change the oil if it sits in there because the THC can react with the plastic and also the components in there so they say a glass is much better to store things in because it is going to be medically neutral to reacting and if you are going for a glass especially the Pyrex grade of glass is going to be perfect because it's also not sensitive the temperature changes so if you're going plastic tank where are the advantages well the advantages are is you're never gonna shatter your tank and they're super lightweight so they're gonna be much lighter so if you're taking it out hiking or sporty and you don't want to carry around the tank plastic tank weighs about half of what a glass tank does and plastic with a plastic mouthpiece it does not get much lighter and but if you're looking at already a plastic tank you have different grades of plastic and you can tell that from the clarity you see this is a little bit foggy this a lot of people would think is a glass tank but it is actually an upgrade plastic tank it just has a much higher quality clarity so this is an upgrade plastic tank that just has better clarity and among plastic tanks one of the most popular ones now is you have actually resin tanks which are like this generally they come in mouthpieces like this set up right here this is actually a resin tank you really can't tell the difference between the glass and the resin except the difference is is one will shatter if you hit it hard enough and one will not now if you are buying glass there are different grades of glass you know the company that does cartridges like this I'm sure you guys are familiar brassknuckles is a prime example of somebody who focus on cartridges like this this is a very thick grade of glass and you can tell that by touching it and honestly you can probably eyeball it to tell how thick the grade of glasses so you look at it it's gonna be thicker glass this glass this tank right here which is our cloud tank actually uses a very thick Pyrex certified glass so this is actually a very expensive good glass it's very hard you don't really have to worry about it breaking or shattering it's a very thick and sturdy and other tanks are thinner glass for example this one you can tell generally tell if the glass is very very shiny and it almost looks like plastic basically that is indication without touching it that it is a thinner glass so those are just some things out the body you want to be careful of now when also looking at the body center post that has become a big Arian debate within the market because generally plastic tanks don't have center post so we'll just move those over here if you look at a center post you can see some of them have wide bases some of them don't have a base some of them have rounded bases right they all have a different structure now what's the significance basically if you have a center post that has there's very thin it is more likely that the tank if you are refilling it that the center post will not be secure when you're securing the top piece down to the center post that it could wobble go out of place and possibly leak the downside so then people put in a wider base to make it more stable take up a little more space make sure that you can screw the tank down and you're not gonna have any areas of leakage the thing is with a bigger center post is sometimes oil gets caught on the transition areas or on the hills of the center post so then if you do have a wide center post base you want to make sure it's nicely rounded so you're not gonna get oil or any wastage caught up there that would make your tank less fuel efficient for example our ELF cartridge here in pink as you can see it's a wider center post but there are no slopes in there that the oil can get caught on so you're gonna use a much larger percentage of the oil that's not going to get caught in the center post transition however going right from center post talks down to the heater okay let's talk heaters most basically you have your wick cartridge as you can see it has a wick that stays up that is wrapped in a heating element wire usually those wicks are made of silica and what happens is it absorbs the oils and it burns them and these happen just fine however it's not going to do you justice and accentuating the taste of the oils and especially if you have thick oils that dry up around there you can actually taste the heater and burn the heater before you burn the oil so if you don't have a pre heat function you have a wick you could run into some issues with taste there so a lot of upgrades have moved to wick list cartridges this is a plastic those are beekeeper replacement tank it is same concept however it has no wick and it has a ceramic heating element a lot of cartridges that say they're ceramic and you can see they're ceramic generally with seeing a little white block through the inlet holes so you could see some of them have a little white block that means they are ceramic powered generally ceramic heaters mean that you're gonna get better taste better flavor notes better flavor accentuation now it's become really popular lately is this what a lot of people have coined as si cell style technology in heaters which means that you have a ceramic block inside of the actual heater itself let's find a nice example right there that is a perfect example of a cease tell it's a coated ceramic block they have good heat up times and right now they're probably considered a very nice performance tank on the market however your problems with these are is that once you've run through a filler to the taste can drop off with thicker oils if you do not have a preheat function they can fight they can heat differently so generally you want a more viscous oil with your C cells and if they don't have a wide enough Inlet hole which is the next area that we're gonna talk about you could run into some clog \u00e4j-- issues but these have a coated block it's not no rocket science abouts just a different take on a ceramic cartridge if you look this has a ceramic block however it is forced down so this is gonna use oils very efficiently this is actually an updated version of the cloud tank and half mil so that is a ceramic block heater you get good taste notes on these and then you have units that are wickless but they don't have a ceramic heater that have different sized Inlet holes now since we're talking about inlet holes what's the general rule of thumb on Inlet holes you go to dispensary and see different sizes and shapes of inlet holes as we showed the C cell had a very wide end lit hole and other tanks like a cloud tank has a relatively wide inlet hole but not overly wide so the general rule of thumb is is that the thicker your oil is that you are putting in there the wider of an inlet hole you're gonna need so that the oil can properly have access to the heater and vaporize if you have a thin inlet hoyle a hole a small Inlet hole and you have very thick oils it's going to be very hard for that oil to come in contact with the heater and actually burn so you are gonna want if you have thick oils to have a large Inlet hole so that that oil is always having contact with the heater however what if you have a large inlet hole and you have thin oils well your your possibility of leaking down through the post goes up exponentially so if you have very thin oils don't go crazy and get tanks with really large Inlet holes because then you could have leakage you could have wastage or the oil is gonna burn up very very quickly so I think that about covers what we would talk about with the inlet holes now air flow control air flow control is available on some tanks we have our cloud tank it has an air flow control here at the top this all ceramic tank right here has air flow controls at the bottom this tank has air controls atop certain tanks have this and what this is for is to allow you to control your hit when you open up the air hole it allows you to bring in air it allows you to bring an air from the outside to kind of dilute and aerate your hit if you have it closed then you can concentrate your hit to basically only draw the vapor out of the tank and out of the little air holes are located around the tank but if you open it you can draw more air so you can take a bigger volume hit but it some people like to concentrate their hit and not allow you to do that so what is the downfall of the air control the positive is you can control your hits and really tune in on what intensity of a hit you want the downfall is if you leave it open like it is partially open now then you put it on its side and it's tilted well that's an area where you can experience some serious top leakage out of the tank a lot of measures are there to prevent that but it could happen so if you're somebody who gets airflow control and you don't use it just make sure to always keep them closed now since we've basically covered all angles of how to evaluate a tank how to eyeball it let's go over one more piece that is about the bottom air holes so some tanks at a dispensary you're probably not having to see the bottom air hole so this is probably the least important part of our oil tank analysis here but an important fact for you to know is generally the larger the bottom air hole is okay a lot of these run on a ball bearing system so that when you draw or you vaporize a ball bearing moves out of place and allows the vapor to pass through and when it's not being used it goes down and creates a seal so no oil comes and down through the the tank however if you do not have an air hole it is not going to work with auto draw units and a lot of you guys have Auto draw batteries a lot of people have elves out there so if you are buying a tank for your auto draw battery make sure with your dispensary that you have an air hole at the bottom of the tank and that it is compatible with auto draw batteries we tell people this all the time it's one of the most common mistakes people buy a tank they have an auto draw battery or an elf they say my unit or my tank is a dud it's not it's just not compatible with the two so if you have auto draw make sure you have an air hole make sure that it's a decent air hole as you can see this unit does not have an air hole so it is not going to be compatible with Stylus batteries it's not going to be compatible with our elf you could see our elf replacement cartridge has a very nice pronounced air hole with even some side vents so you want to make sure that you're picking up the right cartridge now for the very last part of this because we now gave you all the tools that you're gonna need to keep in mind when you're out tank shopping now I'm just gonna run through these tanks and basically give you the rundown of what you can expect out of each one of these tanks so that if you see one of these tanks on the shelf you basically know what you're getting into so hang tight while we get back to this final shoot all right guys now we're gonna run through each one of these tanks and just give you a very brief description of what you can expect for usage and the pluses and minuses of them so that when you're out tank shopping and you see one of these things you have a good idea of what you're gonna get so starting off with really the basic plastic stylist tank with the flat head tip you're gonna get this cartridge and it has a wick so you're not gonna don't expect a big boy taste or big boy hits this is really meant to be a light on-the-go reliable non leak easy to fill tank these run on the blue plug fill system very easy to fill very easy to mass fill but if you have thick oils and they get coagulated around there you can get burnt silica taste if you're not preheating properly in here so this isn't really a flavor tank or a monster hit tank but what it is is really an Old Faithful tank that you'll fill super light is gonna take a beating so if you're into extreme sports this is probably your tank if you want to upgrade from that stay plastic but go with a wickless something that has a ceramic heater or beekeeper replacement cartridge with a metal mouthpiece same very reliable top blue plug fill not gonna get any leaking the ceramic heater is definitely to give you much better flavor notes and more smoothness over the traditional wick system and the stainless steel mouthpiece is a similar shape but it's a higher quality fit and finish and feel then we have basically the upgraded glass version this is a childproof tank it will lock in place after it is filled it has relatively smaller inlet holes meant for more viscous oils and it is ceramic so you're gonna get about the same taste but you're gonna have the purity of glass that your oils are interacting with over plastic basically same thing except it is refillable you can unscrew this top okay a lot of flavor rx cartridges come in come into this style it is not ceramic you have some decent sized Inlet holes however not too wide and you have good center post support so there's going to be a good reliable glass tank however the mouthpiece on these things is heavy and it is flattened so it is more focused on smoothness not hits you have our elf replacement cartridge full ceramic very lightweight ceramic mouthpiece that you have in different colors it's gonna feel good on the lips and it has the unique design center posts that is wide so it's still gonna give you good support however you're not gonna have any oil that gets caught up sitting on there you're gonna use a big chunk of oil really fuel-efficient nice power awesome flavor tank then you have basically a gold finished tank that is somewhat popular out there similar square tip design nothing really special ceramic heaters the one problem is is you have this really big flat top ledge a lot of oils can get caught up there that you might never be able to vape so this is kind of an old-school design but it does have good seals it feels good in the hand and its relatively light basically here's the updated version this one migrated actually to a CE cell style so you're gonna get a good heat up time it is light however still not a hundred percent feeling the center post because you are gonna get oils that get stuck up there now this is a more modern C cell with a bullet-shaped battery we sell these along with the ceramic mouthpiece style as our elf replacement cartridge you're gonna get some more performance out of these because they have wider heater holes they have that C cell Center and you're gonna be able to get good flavor hits off of them they have you have a nice air inlet hole so they'll run well with Auto draw batteries you're gonna get some good power out of this tank actually this tank right here is a brand new tank I haven't tested it yet it is a fully ceramic interior so it's good to put its advertising that it's extremely pure taste it also a ceramic heater I'm not a hundred percent sure on the bottom air flow generally to me bottom air flow could leak so I haven't tested this tank yet but my team does have samples these because some of our customers are requesting a full blown ceramic tank this is basically just a 1 mil version a different mouthpiece version of this tank that we were talking about so difference is you can have a ceramic mouthpiece it's gonna feel a little bit more natural and this one no air hole not going to work well with Auto draw batteries here and I can tell you from holding it it is a little heavier than I would like to see a tank this cartridge right here generally you'll see them filled in brassknuckles cartridges very good cartridge works with most auto draw batteries as well as battery-powered these have one mil fill size I like the bowling pin style tip it's not exactly a wide bore but still definitely wide begin nice hits and it is thin down for some elegance the gold finish that these guys have done is pretty cool so if you're looking for a good prefilled cartridge I mean these have generally been pretty reliable I haven't heard any problems of leaking they have good taste they don't really excel so much in taste they don't excel so much in vapor but it's one of those tanks to where it does do a lot of all those right it runs at about 90% ultra reliable I've heard here you have the resin and resin tipsy sell style batteries as you can see really improve the the groove there to burn up more of the oil and again our elf replacement cartridges are similar with the ceramic mouthpiece I like the see-through tops it's really cool when you're drawing vapor out of them and also they're easy to clean they're light in your mouth you don't feel like you're gonna break your tooth if you incidentally bite on them and it's a cool little reliable tank this one however it is a child seal once you push it down you're not getting it open so only buy these for the one-time fill unless you see it's got a screw top so ask him to specify same exact thing just a wood mouthpiece for those people who like the the natural wood this one is the same as the wooden except it has a different has a little air flow control here at the top it's kind of unique you just swivel the mouthpiece and that opens and closes the air flow if you want a little bit more control on your mouthpiece these three cartridges all come from the same factory it is I mean the same family it is basically the cloud tank here and they have adjustable air flow for these two the half mil and the 1 mil versions these are probably one of the tanks that I endorse the most i love the wide bore mouthpiece I like the ability to adjust especially for connoisseurs they have a nice ceramic heater with decent size inlet holes so you get nice big hits but you're not gonna lose out on that flavor I think the center post sloping on these were done right they're very stable I haven't heard any complaints of these things leaking this is the same thing half mil except it has a hookah style tip on it it's kind of like the top of a bowling pin it's like half flattened half widened tip and this is the glass version of the cartridge we showed you with a lock top not a thread you push it down and it has also has a resin reservoir this is not glass I have not tested this tank yet but it is very similar to the the other ones that we went over in that facet so it should be a good one so anyways guys thank you for tuning in I hope some of the pro tips and some of the analysis tools that we've given you are gonna help you make better decisions when you're out there looking for your prefilled cartridge to buy at a dispensary or looking to fill your own now one question I know is gonna be a follow-up is which one of your batteries basically fire everything so let me just come out and tell you our be master battery you buy one of those you're gonna fire 99% of what's out there the way that we designed it check out the separate video we did on that our minimax original with the smart chip the electronics and this thing it is I basically want you to find me a tank that this thing doesn't fire and I want to know it exists because so far I haven't heard one really nice powerful check out the separate video on that also our Gold Line battery these two batteries are variable temperature they're a little different in size and capacity however both really awesome should fire anything that you give it both these tanks three temperatures both have preheat functions easily charge work awesome with all these tanks minimax your definite go to so you buy one of these three batteries you can rest assured that basically whatever you pick up at the dispensary you're gonna be all fired so for this and several other cool videos make sure you subscribe to our channel make sure if I miss anything drop it in the comments

see you next time", "vRjGJm_niHo": "was good guys it's Jay I made he give you guys a little quick cart review or Mario Cart sure bolero I know that something you guys would technically want to stay away from but light has came to the darkness and there are actual real mario karts out there you just got to be lucky as [ __ ] to have one and lucky I think I believe I'm one of the few I'm one of the few to be lucky so I'm going to explain that today alright so in today's video which is my first video ever which is being a car review because these [ __ ] are blowing up like crazy I've already had about five in the last like two months so I'm over here I'm livid right now so the cart that I have today for you guys is going to be the mario cards char bolado it's going to be a hybrid it is a 1 gram of premium distillate THC content would be 83 to 87 percent they claim to be or have no PG nope EEG or VG which means that there are no contaminants or pesticides detected and it's all-natural lab tested so I mean from the jump I can tell you one thing that I like about the packaging is that it's holographic it's also holographic on the front along with the bag and it's trippy as [ __ ] to see Mario like this so I'll [ __ ] with it so why not but as you can tell that I have been smoking on this for a couple of days now I've gotten this Sunday the color has not changed it's been the same color ever since I copped it and of course Tory's gonna move a lot faster once I start you know start to heat it up and smoker for you guys but the oil is so [ __ ] thick you do not understand it is so beautiful and it's just beautiful golden yellow I just can't and has Mario coordinates out of it as a litters hell and so the battery that I'm gonna be ripping from I necessarily can't give you that correct answer at the moment because I got this from our homeboy he's off in the military at the moment but this [ __ ] hits you the highest voltage it has is no 4.1 voltage it does it was 41 point 1 voltage that would have been my ass and I would have been suited for life deuces that was a fun first last video what a [ __ ] so [ __ ] hilarious but here we go I'm gonna tell you guys about the highlight first hold on I'm gonna show you how well a hit [Music] the flavor let me tell you about the flavor you guesses your blotto it's like sherbert and gelato combined that's just by my uh I know it's [ __ ] common sense I guess you could say so server but you could say there's a lot of at the same time I'm guessing it's not really going to be much of a difference because they're both like oh geez someone both of those type of similar flavors combined you're you're most likely they're gonna battle each other you're just gonna get this earthy flavor and so that's that's the flavor that I'm saying right now that it has a pretty high at the moment that [ __ ] really had me ripped this [ __ ] batteries wild I need to figure out the name of this and once I draw that you guys know but then you're just telling my whole mood it just changed the high on this it is like a [ __ ] 10 out of 10 you you get that feeling from like to gelato I'm just like that straight before you you just want to just chill out don't move for rest of the day oh and this month what's a easy to camera can see oh it's my homeboy night it's my first time and this is the newest addition to the family the move oh yeah but that cart so much [ __ ] top be careful of course you know be careful of this other [ __ ] make sure it doesn't go from from light to dark then the next couple of days that's why you don't want to smoke it all in one day just like you can tell to see if the car is a legit or not if the fluid like after a couple of days of you hitting it and you can feel the fluid gets stuck up in the tube that also means that there's something isn't right and that's that's really it you just got to look at the discoloration if that [ __ ] bubbles apparently I've once I've been bubbling a whole lot which is weird as [ __ ] well I'm guessing that that's that's it I don't I don't know it's some gets bubbles some don't but I don't get bubbles with seesaw or I haven't gotten one with this one either so it's the same sighs I'm not gonna fret it's a little bit more but um hey guys I'm gonna take one more real for you guys because I'm [ __ ] stoned for the middle a video for say let's see [Music] when life says that your ambition Carrie", "unXrVMy3uQo": "all right so I got a question right I got me one of these a long time ago and all right so first of all I have a suspicion that they ripped me off actually my dealer I'm a little v crook so I don't know the reality of it but look all right so this is my first problem I feel like the color not too like crystal all right earlier this is worse but this [ __ ] I don't know why it improved maybe because I kept it in a good place but who usually like move around like [ __ ] fast like like almost like water all right that's the first thing then the second thing is like I remember seeing one more you court that they had like actual Mario Cart providing in there this one does that has like some of this you look another company I don't know me I feel stupid now so don't like that this [ __ ] has a hole up here because you could easily just like [ __ ] I don't know to be honest I bought like actual ones before but I didn't pay attention to it like I don't put the tuna to it so I don't know I usually just like rip this off on the top you could just like get that [ __ ] yeah I showed you already you get the point and yeah guys this was my video you're not uh saying no I'll leave a like that that's my question like am I getting ripped off or am I just paranoid", "scWKsa8dbc0": "play some candy yeah man and definitely

gun that I have here today is our fifty CC gun it'll hold 50 ml and it's capable of doing one milliliter shots it comes attached with a heater controller this one currently I got set to about 110 set it a little bit higher because you know you have the heater on the outside that's wrapping your inside barrel and sometimes a little bit of a heat differential I have some prepared oil here I also have that on a heat pad and then I have some cards right here too so just to start with it you can clean your components and all that kind of stuff but it comes with is a 14 gauge tip it's already pre bent and we also have an extra plunger that goes on in the setting gun in the event that may be soaked in an alcohol and you damaged it you replace it shouldn't need to though it's very easy to disassemble and clean you just unscrew from this end it's very simply product so you install your tip it's a little lock tip Luther locks you know we can buy them all different variations and sizes so you don't have to worry about whatever I give you if it doesn't work for your products you can pick them up and get a bag of 100 of them for 6 bucks the cards I have right here are 1 ml they're also sitting on a heat pad I like to kind of keep my tarts a little bit warm when I'm doing this stuff too so to fill it it's very simple you just make sure you plunge it down into your liquid and you pull back slowly as you're filling it the nice thing is this will stay warm why are you using it ok grab my cards here you want to make sure you depress on the handle entirely sometimes the first shot is a partial shot just because the gun may have not been filled up or backed up all the way but there's my full shot there you just kind of keep moving along pressing the handle all the way there's notches on the inside of the plunger and those notches will ensure that you don't over pull it but if you do under pull it you will get a half shot but it allow them make sure you can fill each cart exactly the same every time we will also have these available in point 5 ml increments those will be coming very soon just gonna finish up this last one all right thanks for watching", "tdlUEq5VYGw": "what it

"pgX_844rWyg": "what is up guys they just Turtles 420 roast back again with another video and today we're going to be doing another cartridge review my delivery guy has got a variety of cartridges in stock at the moment and I have been able to try a couple I managed to pick up by dang babes diablo cartridge that i'll be reviewing later on not today and any were getting an exotic another exotic cartridge I got the purple punch pretty cool and then I ended up also getting a Mario karts nerds now I have had Mario karts in the back in the past and I was the Mario Kart that I did have was the two called the banana crush and it was alright it really didn't hit as much because I know that all the cartridges are like a variety you know they're not exactly what they always say and I know that they're anywhere from fifty nine percent to 69 percent HD from what I've seen from people who independently have lab tested you guys I know these guys on lab tests this [ __ ] I don't know I think that batch that I did get was pretty weak like a fifty nine percent or sixty because I've literally finished the whole thing you like two days but this time we're gonna give this a try hopefully we get a good batch or a nice strong magic so far the exotic cards that I have been buying off this guy had been pretty good like in terms of strength like I feel like they're definitely up there in low 70s or high high high 66 69 % but I'm guessing like around 70 because I take like I take like three good puffs of this and I already get a nice like very very nice head changed the dang paper so I have tried that one already and those give you a more prominent head change but they're also a little more what's it called irritating on the lungs so I'll do really honor that you'll see how much I'll call for that so yeah as you guys can see I've already opened it and I've already tried this brand and so I'm gonna tell you guys what this tastes like it tastes kind of like them the flavouring on us grape Swisher like that you know synthetic grape taste that you know that everybody uses for grape flavoring it's exactly what it tastes like so I mean yeah I mean purple punches but it's basically exactly what it Hey market it tastes like like uh something actually doesn't say grape because they say purple but we can all kind of assume that purple is grateful or not because it tastes like grape and as you can see on the cover art right here there's a little grape and then this is just a weird artwork like what I'm gonna sound is supposed to be it looks like the kool-aid man like a picture of grape soda our grape juice my bed and then he's got a mini gloves he's an insider octagon you got the one I this is just the the the signature for this company it's the one I everything has worn I could you know trippy you know saying well now I'm in pretty cool packaging catches your attention very similar to every other exotic arts like the UH strawberry shortcake but yeah so I'm not gonna try this one for you guys today because I've already tried it so I don't really see the point but I will be trying something I can't live that I've never tried before in this to Mario karts nerds cool artwork always like always I'm surprised these guys aren't getting them what's it called sued by the actual Nintendo company I wonder how long it's gonna be for me get sued and then they have to change everything about their their brand because they coming talk about likeness all I know is that they do they their decal illustrations out of the state I mean out of country like in China so that's why they're able to get like certain things on there that would have to be licensed here in the United States due to copyright so that's pretty interesting also I don't know what the [ __ ] nerds has to do with the mario world but they just decided to add it in there why not so yeah the packaging is very colorful oh [ __ ] the packaging is very colorful looks very cool the back is different because I hid in the back just black and this is a Mario Kart so it allows you to see things so these are very very similar they're all taking this type of packaging because I'm guessing it probably is a little less expensive than the cardboard boxes that some people use exactly the same but these are definitely more colorful but I mean almost near-identical some may be the same guys and making you Tzadik carts also make these Mario karts so let's see another thing about this it's kind of putting is I thought that these were all sealed like you had to rip this thing off to open it but I just found out that is not the case you can actually just open it like this so I mean yeah there we go boom open yeah I don't even have to rip it so not exactly like your tight shield or whatever kind of like a ziplock baggie you know kind of this similar reminds me of when we used to pick up bud and people would just give it to you in these bags actually no when you going on dispensaries they give you these like type of plastic baggies that kind of just open up and they put butter in there and they give you the bag some of them even see a little for you they have another machine that seals it up but these guys didn't even go that far to completely seal it up kind of off-putting but you know or whatever win some lose some $20 a gram you can't go wrong right off the bat smells a like candy like a sour candy mmm hey sweetie I like it almost smells like maybe some skittles like ask Italy sour candy type almost Amy smells good smells like candy so if they were going for candy nerds is a candy yes most similar to candy I have not smelled a box of nerds and a long time having eaten nerds in a long time I think not since I was a child around there probably checking those out the actual candy soon because I've really not had those in a long time but I mean it does smell like Cantina I'm if nerds do smell just like Han do you wish I'd bear candy I mean I guess they hit the nail on the head right pretty good right off the bat good smell cartridge hmm interesting I mean the oil looks very nice very golden color they used you like to use the gold so they get the golden tip which is a nice that they come with these these little uh Stoppers so although these lot of cars came with that too and almost all vapors that I've seen come with diesel Stoppers to my guests to keep it fresh and keep it from being contaminated oh no but I mean it is not I think it's to keep it fresher to keep everything in place very nice this thing is kinda remind me of like kind of money was like bullet car she's almost look like bronze Puli card very interesting guys let me show you is this these things are very very similar so in my left hand I have the exotic carts am i right I have the Mario Kart what's the difference absolutely nothing they are literally the same identical cart they even see I crusher on the tank interesting so like I said as I'm thinking maybe the people who make exotic carts and Mario karts are the same people but it's just like they named him differently to open up once I got to reach into the market to open up sales or whatever I don't know but very identical so I'm guessing the potency should be identical hopefully and I don't get a weak batch this time for Mario Kart because last time I had a Mario Kart I got a weak [ __ ] it just kind of off-putting but you know I'm gonna give you guys another chance I got this one for 20 the last one I got I got for 30 some [ __ ] hassle trigger you know duped me on that [ __ ] so $20 this time let's hope it's better than the last time I had it here we go guys first time trying the nerds I do like how we how it looks like with my pen like the gold with the silver often looks very futuristic we've come a long way in the wheat industry [Music] try again kind of candies kind of like burnt candies a little bit is interesting smells more like candy but this one is one where when you smoke it the candy is not as prominent in the actual vapor as your vapor noon not like with the a strawberry shortcake we're through and through like even on the exhale and everything it tasted exactly like candy like this one is like when I'm inhaling I get a little bit of candy but then as I exhale it's just very very piney mmm yeah but not not off-putting at all very sweet very piney my theory on how they make these is that you just get a bunch of trim and like like a lot of trim like they post I'll buy a bunch of trim and then what they do what they trim is they co2 extract you know they put a little money into that and because of the trim you feel a lot of trim very cheap especially in California guys I mean a pound of trim you could probably get for about a hundred dollars you know some you know people so yeah you get a bunch of trim pay for a co2 extraction or buy one most likely people are renting out people to see what you extract waxes them and make it into oils and then I'm my theory is that for like a batch no matter what flavor it is it's all the same weed so whatever weed that they manage to get which is like secondhand weed we did the shops didn't want to simulate that to get all that and then they Co to extract it and then they make different batches of oil with different flavor terpenes because I haven't hearing a lot and seen a lot of um what's it called um advertisements for high quality terpenes so terpenes are being sold like very very prominently now and they have so many different types of terpenes like of your classic flip flavors like Sour Diesel jump gelato what's it called Oh G cush all those and then there's there's new terpenes that are more kind of like designer flavor me like they probably have a candy flavor trippy and they just decided to call it nerds and then they have a strawberry flavor like a Strawberry Cough or bubble gum flavored or whatever right different flavored exotic terpenes and these companies just put these terpenes and these different batches and then make different batches with the different flavor terpene but in the end of the day it's all this from the same batch of wheat so that's why mostly these batches come out they're kind of like the same strength no matter what no matter what pen you use the highs almost always the same unless it's a new batch that was made with a little bit lower quality weed so then the batch is not as strong but all those batches that were sent out of that were made with that same batch we're gonna have the same amount of strength where there's a new batch and stronger that was gonna be the same so you know what I'm probably trying to get at right here but that's my thesis on what or my theory on how these are made and why they're made like so like the mass produced so much and on top of that why they're so cheap cuz these you're literally not gonna pay more than 30 bucks if you're paying more than 30 bucks especially here in California for one of these Mario karts exotic cards the honest and getting scammed I'm getting them for $20 a gram so I'm you know I thank God that I have a good plug but yeah I mean other than that the flavor is not too bad he seemed to last a good while one of these will last me about kind of really depends since I've been working more often I took like a seven hour at least seven hours of my day and on top of that in the morning when I'm before I wake up like wow I'm sleeping that's the time I have right don't smoke other than that I'm always smoking before I go to the gym I take a couple toke so before I go to work I hit a couple of toes right after I get out of work I've take a couple more to help me sleep so yeah I mean I really be using these things and these things are here a full gram will last me anywhere from three to four days depending how much I smoke so I mean yeah not bad not bad at all of this and considering how cheap they are you can definitely buy like I mean I got three four sixty something I'm getting good price on these yeah other than that guys on Mario karts not bad almost takes exactly almost are very very exactly I mean very similar to exotic karts the mario karts so if you've had an exotic cart you basically had a mario kart is what i'm trying to say now but anyways other than that um I'm gonna end this video for it gets too long I'll definitely be uploading a video probably in a week or two of the tank vapes Diablo review and I'll let you guys know how that one is and if it's worth buying or not but as of yet um yeah Mario karts nerds all right try it out if you guys can just definitely worth the price if it's no more than thirty dollars especially depending on where you live honestly you should not be paying more than thirty dollars for this [ __ ] I see some people on YouTube goodness interviews and there's some people have spent like forty dollars per gram let me tell you for that much money save it get yourself something else for that that amount of cash because at least you that much money you want a little bit quiet II you know what I mean like just how it's me and everything so yeah with that being said man this video now cuz I gotta get ready to go to work and [ __ ] been on a six-day bender going on for 10 so yeah so guys I hope you guys like the video hope you guys subscribe hope you gather you continue to stay blessed hope you guys continue to

or CBD cartridges this episode is sponsored by New York vape shop you can find all the devices use in this video at NY vape shop calm and get a free gift with a code rough 2 with a growing trend of THC and CBD oil 510 thread cartridges out there you may find yourself in the dilemma of wondering which is the best kind of vaporizer battery to use for it there's almost as many types of devices as there are cartridges themselves we're gonna look at the stylist type the flat micro a variable voltage a mini compact as well as it box mod vaporizers [Music] first up is the stylist now the stylist is the most simple of all of them it doesn't have a power button does it have any controls or anything like that is air operated and it's just usually a simple stick with a 5-10 thread on one end they are compatible with most types of cartridges and are really really easy to use you just inhale and it automatically works just by inhaling through it the pros of a stylus are is they're simple to operate and usually like I said the most affordable the cons are you have very limited temperature options and usually they're small and they have a small battery capacity next up we have the micro or the flat style and you can see it's flatter it's not round like the other ones and it still has the 510 thread at the top and it fits most different types of cartridges one thing I like about these is that they're usually charging by USB and like I said they are adaptable with many different types of the cartridges pretty much any kind the difference between this and a stylus it does have a power button and many times not always but many times it also has multiple different power settings this is a Z steam cloud micro available at NY vape shop comm and it does have three different settings for temperature the pros are the micro Penzer they're affordably priced usually about 20 bucks for these they usually have micro USB charger rather than the the kind of you plug into the USB adapter they're very compact easy to hide a problem again is that they're usually small and have a small battery capacity next up we're gonna look at the variable voltage pin now much like the other ones this is a style like a pin style vaporizer but the big difference on this is that it has a variable voltage and usually this is at the bottom sometimes it's at the top though but usually at the bottom there's a little dial that you can use to set the voltage at different types and then you could use it for different temperatures different types of cartridges or just to get a different flavor intensity when you use the vaporizer these usually have a power button and rather than having multiple settings it's a variable control at the bottom the pros of these type are is that you can dial in the best voltage for your cartridge that you're using and you can use them with other types of add-ons as well - and usually they have stronger batteries than the other two smaller the cons are is that the height of it leaves the carts vulnerable and they're larger and they're less stealthy and can't really put them in your pocket as easily and this brings us to the compact style pin or them this is the actually of the Steam Cloud Mini 2.0 and these are like a side-by-side the cartridge actually goes down beside the battery they're USB charging usually and you can see that there's a little cut out there where the cartridge will go down into it they do require usually some sort of magnetic adapter that will help you adapt the cartridge and so it'll stick into the device when you stick it in there and they also require or they don't necessarily require but they work better with the cartridges that are a little bit longer and unless they have an adapter that actually extends it which some of them do I really like these kind because they're very pocket friendly the pros are that they're compact and stealthy and that insect connection it protects your cartridge because your cartridges handout in the device cons are it does require a magnetic adapter they're usually included but they're small and easy to lose and it's best suited for the longer cartridges as the small ones might get lost out inside and now we're going to look at the box mod you might consider the Box mod sort of the helicopter uh vaporizer pens it's a little bit more complicated most of the others it has a power button it also usually has a an up-and-down button to control the variable voltage it also has a compatibility with sub ohm tanks so you have a lot of vast compatibility here and you also have a lot of functions on these that you may not ever even need to use with a actual cartridge pin because they work with a lot of other kinds of add-ons and adapters and sub ohm tanks and such like that but they are so very effective for the cartridges they fit most 510 threads just fine and you can lower the voltage down to suit whatever kind of cartridge that you have in the device at the time I really like using the Box mod especially this one this is the steam cloud and it's the steam cloud box mod it's a lot smaller than some of the other ones it's very compact and really easy to use with these cartridges the pros and cons are the sizes 510 cartridges and sub ohm tanks it has most options for the power and resistance and different settings and it usually has the strongest batteries the cons are is that they are bigger and less stealthy although this is a small one and usually they're more expensive than the standard types of vaporizer pins so when it comes down to it it kind of depends on your needs if you really want simplicity and affordability one of the micro or the stylus is probably best for you if you like adaptability then you probably want to go with the variable voltage at the minimum I personally like these compact ones because they protect the actual cartridge itself and they're really really pocket friendly and stealthy and if you're a purist or if you really want to get the most bang for your buck you might want to get with the box mods and use it with lots of different devices if you want to pick up any of the devices that we use today be

oil cartridge purchase all Auto draw batteries need a cartridge with the airflow hole at the direct bottom of the tank if you're wondering why the new vaporizer you purchased won't vape your oil cartridge this is usually the reason cartridge tanks with solid connective bottoms will not work with buttons vapes this is the ex1 plastic wit cartridge with a flat head tip not really known for its big hits and good taste but it's a tried-and-true tank that's lightweight with the leak proof design and they easy to feel blue plug system be sure to preheat properly with this system as sticker oils

fiber heater similar to coils this cartridge gives a unique taste it feels heavy and very well made the big glass surrounding the heater allows for durability and will give you a truer quality of flavor this tank has been known not only to vape oils but ejuice to this tank features two dual Inlet holes for lights and medium viscosity and because of the air hole at the bottom this can be baked with a south draw device the ex4 is a glass tank with ceramic heater it's great because of the rounded base the round base is great so that no oil or wastage get caught up there it has a wider mouthpiece than most cartridges so you'll be able to get more vapor production it features two inlet holes for lights and medium viscosity and yes it's Auto draw friendly as well next is the only tank on the list we need a push to fire base and will not work on buttons as vaporizers or batteries the ex5 ii need each pilgrim or epub done for inlet holes for mediums against viscosity the egg v improves on the cartridge game by allowing you to control the amount of airflow you get great for heavy hits and with the mouthpiece being the largest of the bunch the vapor production is completely customizable to your liking but if you're not going to use the cartridge for a while it's best that you completely close the air vent even more amazing is the baseless center post assuring that you get the most out of your cartridge and that no oil is left behind and last but not least the e a fix-all cartridge this ESL style cartridge is the best fit for even the thickest of oils it features four large two millimeter inlet holes ceramic oven thick glass housing and ceramic mouthpiece and yes it is Auto drawl compatible this glass cartridge is a ceramic oven so you know what's going to give you a greater taste than any whipped cartridge out there all these cartridges are no wider than any CSL cartridge on the market and can fit into any vaporizer with the bore of ten point seven five millimeters or less please keep in mind that the thicker your oil the wider inlet hole that you'll need so that the right amount of oil can reach the heater to be vaporized without getting burned keep in mind that you shouldn't refill the cartridge is more than three times to assure you're getting the best vapor production consider subscribing for more videos like this drop us a like if you

is another reaction video but this one's going to be on the clean cards not the fake carts you guys have been asking for a part four for a few months now you know and uh now that um for tuesdays i'm mainly gonna be doing reaction videos till i can stream again i wanted to do a clean cart one because one of the videos is actually picking up steam right now and if it's picking up steam might as well add another one because that that tells me that people are watching that and i know you guys have wanted this one as well and uh before i start this for any further the clean cards moderators i do not know any of them i don't give a [ __ ] about any of them uh because most of you guys say that they're mostly douche bags and stuff and like self-righteous in some ways but i would like to say that i am in no way affiliated with them it's just me reacting to their subreddit and uh just seeing what the legal cards are in the whole country you know what i'm saying i do have a card for this video you know i've been slacking with cards in terms of you know i'm making a fake cartridge video i don't even i'm not even smoking out of a cart this is actually the moonwalker brand uh video will be out in a few days but you know with these reaction videos i try to get these out the day that i record them that way you can follow along you know while i'm watching the video i guess but cheers for those of you who don't know this is delta eight it's called moonwalker the strain is called grape runts and honestly it's one of the better distillate cartridges that i've tried d8 or d9 it's just really flavorful now you do get a strong taste of grape if you guys are interested in this it will be in the comments below you can actually buy these in 38 states so shout out to moonwalker like i said videos on this product will be out in a few days but let's take another hit oh you can see the clearness in it that was bad so as usual with these reaction videos i like to post the comments from the previous video at least the best ones so here we go right now [Music] all right now that we're here let's just see what the clean card subreddit's been doing since uh since the last video right tnt extra expo in new york is this legit or did i waste 40 bucks [ __ ] come on what the [ __ ] let's just let's just take a look at what people say use your account to rebound or another thing [Music] well if it last time made you sick and you bought another one come on come on well let's be honest washington state bans iso isomerized tse and recreational marijuana system what is isomerized oregon to limit use of delta eight tac and other artificially derived cannabinoids really this week's lineups from com can in millis massachusetts we get the pax error okay okay friendly farms terp hogs so this is clean cards guys so don't be expecting any like fake ass bougie cards just appearing i know there's probably going to be some because people are you know still going to be questioning what card they have if it's legit or not and uh most mostly on here you're gonna see legit [ __ ] and i'm interested to see what's legit in oregon washington colorado all that stuff so i feel like these videos they uh show shed light into that you know ever more dark safety but recently learned about reagents and leeches during isomerization and when i understand the only d8 that steak will be extracted from real cannabis to avoid these leftover cans and crusts however these are sold in dispensers possibly because of height delta 9. what method which method to make delta 8 is used to get a real clean stuff and not bathroom chems or is it all blue also i don't care about your favorite brand coa unless you got tests for reagents and bleaches i like you you get it from what i understand the only thing this is the case which method to make d8 it could be clean but they did a lot of lots of cleanup work after the synthesis but not real rn no one test enough for us consumers to know and worse every time so far that brand has been independently tested it variably turns out to be low potency and contaminated to be considered clean synthesized or hemp derived d8 must have safety tests for each and every of the following solvents metals pesticides microbes mycotoxins and reagents and bleaches block to prevent the chills from the dirty pizza from telling you to smoke their dirty deed so disturb spark or whatever i think i mentioned him in the last video he's one of the guys that a lot of people are saying is a douche bag in some sort of way and um he brought up some really good valid points you know obviously d8 has to be safe when it comes out from what i've tried from delta it seems like pretty good you know this is just some stuff maybe that they write to scare people honestly i don't know but uh it is some good stuff that they brought up because obviously you would want your delta eight stuff tested as much as your delta knight and i do see that um but speaking for myself the delta eight brands that i've tried delta eight hemp moon walker serene tree all pretty good i didn't taste any you know chemically ass taste or anything it was just you know some good old distillate and stuff um but then again distillate can be you know iffy as well you know you really can't tell um but just be safe you know just be aware of certain brands and just look out for your own health at the end of the day um like i said this this guy right here that brought up the d8 very good questions but uh i'm gonna have to say that the guy that responded is a moderator of this and he's been known to be like questionable you know what i'm saying like i don't know garlic cookies life hazard ross or live hash rosin cartridge clean pleasant trees that's a [ __ ] nice name liquid trite okay yeah this is only a half gram too it's probably worth so much we're selling for so much real or fake there's the flare right there it says fake and y'all i need help bought this from the weed man and i can't tell if it's there's no lighting and it came in a plastic bag came in a plastic bag come on can i post a picture of a few raw ground cards to help try and verify authenticity and see the community's minions 99.5 percent sure they are real from this message just am super skeptical about cards given my poor health but lemonade lemon pepper from cookies in there not bad yeah i don't [ __ ] with i don't [ __ ] with half gram cartridges or i mean i do but i don't [ __ ] with companies that only sell half gram questions i think that is some [ __ ] [ __ ] and i think that that's their way of saying hey i want your money and i want you to pay for less or get less from it so to be honest anything any company that's still to this day only half grams and are selling it for 60 to 70 for a half gram [ __ ] you washington dispensary anyone tried 30 a gram put in a card in the skittles tastes like grape soda with the hint of wine that's crazy this doesn't taste like great so this is delta eight as well and honestly this is one of the smoothest hitting cartridges that i've tried are none like for distillate usually i'm coughing well most of the time when i'm hitting this is plug play and those those pods and that battery they'd be hitting of course you'll be coughing but this is very a smooth this is a very smooth experience i believe moonwalker is also featured in high times too so i don't know if that brings you some sort of uh clarity but i mean it's it's high time right cheers all right where can i get this tested i know it's fake but i'm curious just about how just i'm just curious to how bad found it on my sister come on bro what the [ __ ] is this 1.1 like what stop solvent free 97 tac like what solvent free or solvent lists and there's a difference right i believe solvent free is no solvents in it at the end product solvent list is extracting without solvents so what that's at best is going to be distillate uh making my own cards terps plus delta e can i mix tears in delhi i want to buy from natural extractions so i've read something about we don't really know how much terpenes we're supposed to be in taking so it's not really good to mix terps homemade you know you don't know the right amount you're not a scientist you know what i'm saying and most of these guys on here aren't scientists as well they ain't going to be able to tell you how much terps and all that stuff to mix delta 8 with so just be careful with that do your research uh i recently just saw that article so it could be like some brand new study or something but it says something about not taking too much or too much terpenes might be a bad thing if uh paraphrase it oil forms around oils from local dispensary here in miami truly i think i've seen truly videos and they're from florida so that should be good i don't know uh the cartridge scene in florida so if if true leaves are fake then just be careful you know what i'm saying you eat raw garlic let's see peanut butter bread sauce never seen this [Music] looks okay that looks so lame with their instagram handle right there on that packaging it looks so crafty looks good west coast cars real or fake no comment i do have some west coast wax though actually no more but did i have some very popular in my state i mean you know a couple people with them obviously improvement there's no branding and everything do you think it's fine because they're getting high i'm not sure i'm just going to pass that anyone recognize this brand as a fake oh sorry it's fake live terpenes delta 9 thc distillate cartridge live terpenes huh not live rising terpenes just live terpenes how do you spot a fake delta eight disposable my buddy runs the smoke to tell me this but there's nothing but the paper and vaping inside come on bro getting from a smoke shop albeit there probably are some delta good delta 8 products and some smoke shops but are you willing to take that risk buying it no like when you can buy it online these people these are the type of people that want it right now they can't wait they can't wait to order online they want to go to a smoke shop and get it they want a little club and get it they want to go to their buddy and get it no patience on these guys really all i have access is to black market but dispensary or so can i put that rsl on but it's working possibly it was probably going to make your butt taste like [ __ ] i bought rso before and i thought it was just regular dab i thought hey you know in a syringe it it was black as [ __ ] i dabbed it it tasted like [ __ ] rso is for the medicinal side rso means rick simpson oil and i guess that's the guy who like popularized it or made it or so so uh you basically use it to to fix your ailments you know what you're smoking on tonight that is the yocan right i believe okay cleaner trash this brand from a local dealer there yet [Music] keep fake carts it's your plug okay i'm gonna end this like if you're getting it from the plug 99 of the chance it's fake you know there's maybe a one percent chance that plug can somehow get it from from the real [ __ ] but come on from the plug from snapchat like really that's gonna be end of this clean carts video hopefully you did enjoy this one i believe this is number four or so let me know in the comments if you did enjoy it let me know if you want a part five and uh like i said like when you comment and leave likes it it motivates me to do more of these and like i said i'm gonna try and get this out today today is tuesday tuesdays i usually go live but i'm thinking that since i'm not going live anymore maybe just do reaction videos on tuesday and maybe on friday as well but or rest it just depends on my mood i guess that day but hopefully you did enjoy this video uh like i said let me know if you want to part five and i'll see you guys in the next one [Music] so", "Yi3i4F-DBlo": "[Music] what's a bad simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title this is the interesting video this is obviously a cartridge video but this is surprising I've never seen like a cartridge come in this measurement before and that measurement is 0.75 this was only like 25 or something like 25 to 28 dollars I'm not too sure I forgot but you can see right here it says 0.75 milliliters or grams or whatever we want to call it and it is white Walker ology by cruise I've never tried cruise cartridge but I've tried they're there but and it was good you know very very decent flour for decent prices but I believe this is also this is going to be distantly I believe so you know which is still pretty good you know I'm not I like distillate but as you like I really prefer like sauce cards or live raising card some more you know but this split is it bad it's just sometimes it's just like a artificial flavor so we're gonna see what this is and this is white Walker og you see all the specifications right there everything on the back you can pause if I'm going too fast hopefully it's focusing so just like in the other previous videos I like to mention that my merch is available right now I'll post the link in the bond description below this is just one of the sweaters and they have various colors I think I have like twelve twelve designs on there so like if you don't like one maybe you'll like on another one you know so there's one things to choose from and there's a lot of colors on all of them so I got you there and if you guys are interested I'll post a link people been telling me to make merch for a while and these are all designs I've made myself and I feel like it's more genuine that way because I wouldn't want to paste to design something for me I feel like it should come from the content creator you know and not to knock on any of like other content creators but some of their stuff is a little bit lacking I really wanted to like make it known that I made these and also you know I I understand that most people don't really want cannabis on their shirts so that's why I have some shirts that's just it's more about my life you know like how I was actually born in San Francisco I have a San Francisco shirt the bridge is a conic bridge I think we all know even people that don't live in California fall you know about the Bay Bridge and there's a story behind that because like I named that shirt the bridge to the Spencer eeeh and it's because back when Modesto didn't have too much we had to go to the bay and get all their [ __ ] you know and we had to cross that bridge and it's a play on to that one movie I didn't even see that movie Bridge to Terabithia there's some [ __ ] so I thought it was pretty cool but yes you were not inclined to buy any of these things if you want to support me and buy one of these you're more than welcome to but you're also more than welcome to just not buy it and just chilled me still so let's get on with this [ __ ] review what are you doing but link will be in the book down below so this is white Walker og syndicate as you can see right here really really good stuff it looks pretty nice no no way cartridge so far it's a [ __ ] plastic radiator Calvin your sticker our caution sticker whatever you want to call it I'm not gonna lie this looks pretty [ __ ] nice this thing the oil test or whatever this is dumb as hell I mean I've seen some that's very liquidy and you know what that's just it but very thick I mean this just proves how thick the oil is I mean other than it's [ __ ] legit cuz it's not moving no it could still be sure you know trash off the bed notice that there's some like weird like thing on here that I definitely gotta wash off be using it in my as a beauty which reminds me I still need to do that giveaway for this I'm waiting on light so I can do a live on YouTube in choose a winner but guys [Music] Cheers [Music] very small - not too tasty at all of you is that some sort of taste but I'm not really sure how to describe it I mean it's definitely alright I definitely wouldn't prefer other cartridges I mean what enticed me though was that it was 0.75 for twenty-something dollars which is pretty weird for a cartridge like they usually never come in 2075 so I had to get it never tried cruise cartridges soul paper production is there though it's a very like the sensation to cough afterwards is minimal the taste can't really describe the taste but it's minimal as well other than that pretty decent cartridge if you don't really care about taste you're trying to forget about value out of what you buy because it is 80 percent THC cartridge and I believe it as some sort of amount of CBD in it other than that very good cartridge for what it is not a very tasty one in my opinion but that's just me maybe it's just because I brush my teeth no but woman playing an end the video here hopefully you guys enjoyed it [Music] [Music] [Music]", "DrRSLuSShD4": "hey guys this is dab connection we're gonna be going over the difference between fake brass knuckles and real brass knuckles this one on my right is a fake this one on my left is the real one and the first indicator which you're gonna see some fakes with this anyway but first indicator look for is the sticker so this sticker is actually on the is on the front and the back I just put the the probably actually got ripped off with the back went on here for effect but it's a same stick you're gonna see the sticker around and there's gonna be you know that little left this little childproof thing there as well and it's gonna have a this tamper-resistant part so there's gonna be the childproof part the stamp resistant and this strain indicator no strain instantly a fake now here's the other part of the real versus fake that I thought I found was most telling so right there you can see this ring right here is metal so it's metal on metal down there now take a look at the fake the fake doesn't have that metal the hardware is different you can see that's almost like a plasticy rubbery piece there that's kind of covering over the metal over there you go yeah you see that in there that's kind of a clear plastic Ness and then right in there you can clearly see that's metal there so that's a big difference and of course this is the Napalm OG one so it does have the name a little bit different here you know other than that you're gonna see the text is gonna be fairly similar on the California ones on the real ones you'll probably see some type of California thing this also says for medical use and I'm not sure that that's always going to be that way it's probably on the newer ones it's might not say medical use anymore because it's not really just medical but really main things look for is that strain and that Hardware difference so the hardware difference is something I've really seen covered before and that's the main difference I think between fake and real if you're not sure you know submit your pictures to us you can go on our website to next calm on the about us page we'd like to take a look at them and we can try to help you tell if they're real or they're fake what we really hope happens is brass knuckles actually put a solid store locator on there and then it's not even an issue the other thing I should just say is brass knuckles is really heavily advertised and people seem to love it but I got to tell you there's a lot of better cartridges out there if you're in California check out arrow Pro arrow Pro is much better check out select oil select oil is much better if you're in Nevada you got select oil you got roots and arrow Pro those are all better and you know that's it I you know it brass knuckles it's okay I see why some people like it but the hardware is dated and that's part of the reason not gonna get a good hit the other thing I should just mention for people in Nevada you know their grams their cartridges are all one gram and there's a limit it's either 80 or 85 you 5% THC that the one gram cartridges can be so you're gonna see half gram cartridges like select in the 90s and select is in California everywhere it's all over the place those are just some brands I think that are better as well just throwing that in there anyway thanks for watching guys and have a great week", "qUUezMC43Bk": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] you", "gVRdnEq4in8": "[Applause] today an alarming breaking news report about vaping it's a new piece of the puzzle that may explain the mysterious vaping injuries we've been covering here on the show from double lung transplants to even death I mean big complications is the culprit black-market THC the chemical in marijuana that gets you high and listen products are being sold to unsuspecting customers that have no idea what they're buying may be lethal senior legal and investigative correspondent Cynthia McFadden brings us this as an NBC News exclusive our investigation took us to downtown Los Angeles where in a 12 block radius we saw dozens and dozens of storefronts advertising vaping products we're in pursuit of what black market operators come here for the empty packaging and cartridges that they fill with cheap and often tainted substances sold as legitimate THC products within minutes we score we were able to go in one shop one-stop shopping by these dank VAP containers the packaging and a hundred of the cartridges into which you can put whatever you want there's no ID no tax no nothing and it's counterfeit marijuana babes like these that may be making people sick I do believe that I was given black market stuff and I do believe that had a had an effect on me Fabian says his lungs were slowly beginning to shut down he ended up in the emergency room I couldn't breathe I couldn't talk I really couldn't even move my hands so what is lurking in these black market vapes and are the legal ones even safe no one not even the FDA or the CDC had tested the actual vapor people are sucking into their lungs until now we revealed those results Cynthia joins us what exactly is marijuana vape and how do you compare it to the typical East cigarettes or tobacco baby ok so a step backwards vaping is just taking a liquid of the compound heat it up and then that vapor is what you suck into your lung so if it's nicotine like a Joule which has 80% of the market that's tobacco THC the active ingredient in marijuana it's made into a liquid form and then it's heated up and then you suck that into your so again the cartridge looks like this that's what we were buying that's what we were buying on these are the ones we bought on the street so we bought for a hundred bucks we bought a hundred containers and a hundred of these so if I'm a black-market manufacturer of THC oil I'm in business when you walked into that store yeah what actually transpired what was the conversation like you said I got a hundred bucks when you got for me did you have to sort of lead him along how'd you hook that the fish well the first thing I would say is that we had our choice of dozens and dozens and dozens of stores in downtown Los Angeles all of them selling these kinds of illicit products and so we said hey we want to buy some containers we rolled off a few of the illicit names that are popular dank vapes is one you've got it right here dank vapes it is associated with many of the people who got sick it is not a legitimate brand there is no company called dank vapes so the black market on this which is what's concerning to me seems to be dominant there doesn't seem to be any way of digging taking them out less consumers are unsuspecting well even more insidious there are legitimate brands that aren't contaminated of THC oil that you can buy in states where it's legal and these counterfeiters make boxes and carts that look exactly like those legitimate brands so the consumer has essentially no idea what he or she is going to get so the Mac market operators fill empty cartridges with their own substances and then they're selling them as legitimate tested products but what exactly are they putting in there and is it dangerous Cynthia brought the stuff to a lab to find out if the chemist a flabs in Los Angeles considered one of the top marijuana testing facilities in the world can a safe executives Aaron Riley and Antonio Frazier explain they've come up with a brand new test we wanted to design a system that would be able to provide reproducible results to do something they wish the government would do analyze the vapor produced by illicit THC oil Canas they've tested seven THC cartridges from licensed dispensaries and six from the black-market we come back the shocking results from the lab [Applause] [Applause] [Music] I'm back with NBC News investigative correspondent Cynthia McFadden and for the very first time a new lab test is able to tell us exactly what is in the vapor produced by THC oil when you vape what's actually going into your lungs to remind everybody what you tested okay we tested seven legitimate products these are licensed brands from licensed dispensaries and then on the black market we tested six black market these are listen what did the kind of safe lab testing show was in the vapor coming out of it okay there were no contaminants in either the oil we also tested the oil previously either the oil or the vapor here if that was used at the temperature that's recommended we can talk about that let's say that the lowest temperature or lower temperature lower temperature because guess what when you crank the thing up which is what kids do because it makes more vapor Oh carcinogens yeah so not safe anymore not safe anybody know what happened to black market cartridges even when it was turned at the right power setting on the low side okay under the best set of circumstances this stuff is dangerous it's contaminated this is just you're asking for it you vape this stuff you're asking for it well they're stealing your money it's not surprising they would steal your health well what percentage of America is given products that are counterfeit yeah you're asking questions really hard to answer because this is the illicit market the black market it's underground law enforcement is having a really hard time getting a Tanz around this think about it I mean the FDA isn't testing this stuff why it's not legal across the country so the FDA doesn't have the authority to test these brands but you know states are doing the best they can but the best they can it's not good enough in my opinion because we've got a population doesn't appreciate I just the things I've read maybe it's a quarter maybe it's half of all the stuff is counterfeit it's being brought basically from a drug dealer all right the THC oil let's go through exactly what kinds of things were found in your testing by the way it's state of the art and I would applaud you for doing this because our own government is in doing this we've finally got the answers from you well some of the things none of them good carbon monoxide formaldehyde pesticides well we're in the counterfeit stuff the ELISA stuff for rat you find a couple things that surprised you yeah it'll surprise you to cyanide yeah you don't want your kids breathing that stuff you just don't or yourself and vitamin E oil which is a little bit confusing it really sounds healthy but what they want though is the consumer to think it's real THC oil so they mix it with vitamin E oil why they pick that one because the viscosity the thickness is the same as vitamin E oil so these are really crafty dastardly criminals so let's talk a little about vitamin E because I think it's exam it's emblematic of the problem here we all know substances like pesticides and sine are dangerous let me talk about it but vitamin E sounds healthy right but when you inhaled the vapor with vitamin E in it it goes into your lungs right at the high temperature it's converted into an oil to a grease in your body once in a long some say that it coats the Airways and when it does that then coats the Airways it starts an inflammatory reaction making it really hard to breathe the information in the oil get into the tiny little sacs these little sacs alright of your lung they're not hard to treat now the CDC thinks vitamin E is that big culprit behind these marijuana vaping deaths and injuries but we're no unsure and if these black markets your products are being sold like this the question I'm having everybody is what can people do to make sure that they're getting something that's safe well don't buy illicit products buy from a licensed dispensary is one thing I just want to add a little bit to your vitamin E oil here's so the Mayo Clinic as you know did a of testing on 17 patients who had that vaping illness and they discovered that the lungs of those patients looked like someone who'd been exposed to mustard gas so it's why it's important they're only state regulated marijuana dispensaries in states were its legal right to your point the government won't regulate it because it's only in these states so when you look at the country if you're in a red state maybe you're buying marijuana from a legitimate place right if you're in a great state guarantee or not then if it in the red states from Cynthia Stella me is there more of the illegal places illicit places than illegal ones which means you're buying the stuff from drug dealers they're not legitimate sellers I don't see a difference between two groups so you've got another big warning which I wanted to point out which is the temperature warning just make that really clear to folks so when we tested the legal product that didn't have the contaminants that are horrifying the cyanide and other things cranked up higher they produce what the lab told us were carcinogens but you know if your kids are doing it tell them making those big vapor puffs is just not worth it it could be killing them so if you're not buying THC cartridges for a licensed dispensary in states where they're illegal here's the picture again right you're buying them from the drug dealer don't do it and if your vape pen is an adjustable temperature setting don't crank it all the way up because it's dangerous lots of data support in this now use the low power setting Cinthia wonderful reporting thank you very much you can catch Cynthia's reporting on today and NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt and be sure to check out Cynthia's latest report the results of a year-long NBC exclusive investigation where she uncovers an underground army of child laborers in Africa they are digging up a mineral being used in everyday cars planes and cell phones that's where I'll use them we'll put a link to the special report on dr. oz comm I'll be right back [Applause] [Music] be sure to subscribe to my channel so you don't miss anything and remember to check back often to see what's new", "f-DP35X6LaY": "so I'm curious how long does the oil within your cartridge actually last well for our 500 milligram cartridges we'd like to think of it as around 4 to 5 grams of cannabis okay for me it'll last a little less than a week but for my wife it can go a couple weeks okay and for some others it might last a month or two correct right right and - what's the shelf-life of an oil cartridge if I if I happen not to use it right away how long will it last work well with the oil there's not really a shelf-life but sometimes the cannabinoids will degrade over time whether it's with light or heat THC can turn to CBN a CBC can turn to CDL through too much light and that's not harmful but that's not exactly what people might want to have happen correct right so if you have a sativa oil that is high in CBN the CBN is going to make you sleepy which kind of goes against the sativa right and how long would that degradation take to occur it takes a good while at least a year okay so you've got you've got some time yeah it's gonna be gone before that happens and so tell me if I have a oil cartridge and/or it's on the pan or in the package how should I store it storage is probably best at room temperature and you don't want to leave it in your car you don't want to put it in the freezer or the refrigerator just a normal room temperature would be fine and if you live in a hot climate about that if you live in a hot climate it's good to be in air-conditioning if I wouldn't leave it in a car sometimes if if it's too hot in a car the oil will get so thin you're risking possibilities of it leaking got it okay well thank you so much for that answer", "SsC4jaIY8sQ": "[Music] welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and I've got my trusty pour one out 510 vape battery that is finely [ __ ] the bet on me after 15 cartridge reviews or something it finally [ __ ] the bed and my trusty 510 battery has died so I'm pulling out the backup the cheaper chintzy er one here that's okay we'll get a new one we'll get a better one but I'm gonna miss my old friend there has died but outside of the funeral for our trusty 510 vape pen we are here for a joyous celebration and we are here to review the product that I have had to me suggested the most of anything I have ever reviewed or intended to review and that is brass knuckles we are finally reviewing brass knuckles I have had you guys a lot of you recommending me check out brass knuckles check out brass knuckles check out brass knuckles and I've used brass knuckles in the past and but we won't talk about that but today we are going to be reviewing brass knuckles finally found some here in Long Beach and I'm very very excited to give it a review so this is the one gram Gorilla Glue cartridge and it comes in some a primo packaging that I have no doubt I'm gonna have difficulty opening here really nice packaging as you can see plastic on the outside it's got all the information you want on the inside lab tested contaminant and pesticide free that brings me up to the controversy I I know that there was a big controversy with brass knuckles for a while about pesticide usage but apparently that is no longer the case I hope that is no longer the case I I would a vet suggest you do your due diligence and research if you're really worried about those kind of things what you might probably should be maybe so do your own due diligence make sure you know this is something for you but from what I've heard they have all of their problems in terms of having pesticides or whatever fungicides or whatever I was that was in there it's no longer the case so Gorilla Glue is my favorite strain as I have said many a times I have seen it listed as both hybrid and indica this is a hybrid gorilla glue I like it both as hybrid and indica this cost me as you can see $52 at my dispensary which is a bit of a miss which is a bit misleading because really with the 35% taxes it can cost considerably more than that but $52 is the base price so you know pretty expensive but not outrageously more expensive than other cartridges this one just has the reputation sort of throughout Southern California as being the best of the best and I think I actually got it open without too much trouble there maybe here we go here's our cartridge in its little packaging there for medicinal use only not for redistribution and we can see their weed maps all that logos blah blah blah blah blah they have a snapchat how fun alright we have got our standard 510 pen here not our former best friend bottoms cap just like all the others with these little rubber stoppers whoever makes these little rubber stoppers must be doing pretty bonk owes business right now I would imagine let's screw this in ooh I like the color of this oil nice dark golden oil beautiful looking oil there a nice brass tip I guess that's where the name brass knuckles come from and a nice wide intake hole there so very excited to give this a drop let's give it a go oh wow that is a premium experience that is a smooth with smooth draw Wow ignore the cough that's my fault not theirs I'm a coffer this does not burn hot at all you can barely feel it entering along it's wonderful the taste is exquisite and Wow I'm already feeling pretty nicely medicated actually oh wow they use a bad word on their packaging here I'm gonna have to read that for you guys I don't see what their THC potency is listed at on here but I do know that they are among the highest in the state I think I've seen before that it's over 90% it certainly feels that way I'm already feeling quite high after just 3 3 little puffs there one negative thing and it might actually be this pen is I'm not getting this huge a draw as I would want for pulling I like the bigger clouds but it's sort of ameliorated by the fact that even the small draws are getting me quite high and it might actually just be this pen doesn't have the voltage to get the huge clouds I'll double check I'm gonna be getting a new pen before I finish this so I'll I'll be sure to let you guys know in the follow up if that still the case Wow but up into this point brass knuckles definitely definitely earns their reputation tastes great hits like a dream oh man really really really enjoying the brass on my brass knuckles experience here guys if only it were a little easier to draw from it would be perfect but again that maybe the pen and I'll be sure to let you know guys because I'm gonna review this entire cartridge I'm not just gonna take a couple of puffs and say it's good I'm gonna come back to you guys after I finish this whole Graham here to let you know exactly my thoughts let you know if anything's changed if the starting to leak if the oil got tacky whatever the case may be I'll be sure to let you know in the follow up so I'll come back to you guys probably in four or five days after I finished this bad boy off and let you know exactly what I'm thinking thank you so much for watching weeks to this point guys and I will see you in just a bit it has been actually I believe eight days since I last checked in with you talking the one gram brass knuckles Gorilla Glue cartridge so right off the bat I wasn't doing this really any less than any other cartridge I don't feel like but it lasted a long long time I really got your values worth with this one certainly a gram in there the other thing is it is still very potent this is a potent a blend that they've got in here this is certainly as strong as its sort of reputation lends it to believe but all that being said my initial I'm not as emphatically as in love as I was with my initial impressions or as I was when I gave my initial impressions there have been a couple of things that have walnut spoiled me on the experience have certainly damper the experience one is it became significantly more difficult to draw as time went on I did get a new battery to test it with and even with a new battery it was still kind of tough to draw from and it got harder and harder as time went on and which is something I really have a problem with with the VBA I much prefer the ones that have nice easy drawers that you can make nice big you know take nice big inhalations with as the kids call them make nice big clouds this wasn't really that and I'm not sure if it was this cartridge in particular as you can see there's actually some oil left there at the bottom I just had such a tough time drawing from it that I think I'm just gonna have to leave it there the other thing is it did start to get a bit of a burnt taste as I got closer to the bottom the closer I got the more burnt the taste was it for the most part tasted great I really enjoyed the taste but as we started to get near the end or trim it's the end of its life that burnt taste started to amplify so tough to draw from and increasingly tough to draw from and an increasingly unpleasant taste those aren't good things for sure those those weren't those theirs don't keep it and there's hold it back and getting in my highest remarks for sure but I feel like I'm definitely gonna get brass knuckles the second chance I've heard enough about them that I'm wondering if maybe I just got a bad card what the case may be so I'm gonna give him a second chance we're gonna review something else from them in the future but for now between the two because they're so often compared and they're so look alike I actually think I might prefer the heavy hitters to brass knuckles maybe yeah I think in my initial impressions I would go with the heavy hitter of the brass knuckle but let's get let's go ahead and do another brass knuckle review before we give it any the definitive conclusion and overall my impressions are still pretty positive this is a potent a long lasting cartridge that you're gonna get your money's worth from so you know I it's still really positive review it's just not as good as I initially had hoped but we will be examining them and given the future so fingers crossed and that guys is gonna do it for this review but before I bounce I want to share with you a little cherry on top just something I can share with you guys that isn't necessarily weed related but could be enjoyed with weed or with or without weed and so on this cherry on top what I wanted to share with you guys was something nice and simple something nice and easy an 11 minute web clip from the fine folks at where I guess fine folks the mostly male folks over at Adult Swim make Krueger's of creators of chosen Rick and Morty or at least the hosts of such shows as Rick and Morty but that's not we're here to talk about is Rick and Morty we are here to talk about their 11 minutes short too many cooks too many cooks too many cooks it is an 11 minute video and if you haven't seen it a lot of you I'm sure have that sort of tries to replicate many 90s opening credit songs but things go awry and that's about all I want to say because you should know as little about it as possible before going in because it is who it's gonna be one of the most surreal 11 minutes of your life Definitely Maybe recommend if you do have some cannabis on hand doing some before hand if you're not prone to paranoia if you are definitely pass on it but it's gonna be enjoyable I think for you guys again that is called too many cooks on Adult Swim I'm sure you can find it on YouTube just search too many cooks so guys that's gonna do it for this review here on wheat sand that's gonna do it for this cherry on top as well thank you so much for sticking around to the very end here guys I appreciate it as always and we will see you on the next review peace", "4zbdNGlCHpE": "hi this is Joe doing a voiceover PowerPoint on a 114 slide PowerPoint that will be doing on the subject of medications now this one is due September 17th although I'm expecting that on the 9th which is Monday we'll sort of start dancing around the idea of nurses responsibility for how to do medications but this one is a major step in understanding what we do and what it's all about because well first off because there's actually an exam based on this exact PowerPoint so you better study but then also this is what nurses do every day and we have to be thinking about it ok so now here we go their medication safety exam is divided into two parts one is how to do medication calculation the other is nursing implications of medicine delivery and that's what this one so now the thing to know is this is very heavy on the definitions of words try to bold them all but I couldn't put them all in bold print but this is one more PowerPoint that probably has a hundred very specialized words where it comes to pharmacology and medication so my advice to you if you're weak on vocabulary is to make a vocabulary list use flashcards all that stuff watch the videos listed elsewhere and we'll see it when we're talking about drugs and medication a drug is something that you can take and it includes illicit drugs but it also includes things over-the-counter as well as prescribed drugs and a medication is something that specifically told you take it by a doctor usually and excuse me one of the confusing things about medications are any given medication can have more than one name due to the history of pharmacology might have a scientific name and that might have a name that everybody knows that by and an example would be Tylenol Tylenol is the brand name acetaminophen is the name of the drug they're the same things now you can look all these things up in the drug book and hopefully before we get to this PowerPoint we would have looked at how to use the drug book and kind of just as poking through the pages of it but now this will kind of fill in some first just because the medicine has the name on it doesn't mean it's pure or that it was came from a reputable source and what happens is in the USA that there are agencies that regulate the purity of manufacture of these the USB or the National formulary and drug companies are regulated by the federal government Food and Drug Administration as to the standards of purity and quality that they have okay next is we're going to define this early on because then when we get to it you'll understand it some more but there is something called a controlled substance which is a subset of all medicines and a cruel controlled substance to make a long story short a controlled substance is one in which if the wrong person takes it it can lead to addiction and or poor judgment due to altered mental status and for that reason the federal government or the state's police not just who is getting it but who is administering it and how it's handled throughout the whole time that it is in the hospital whether it's in the pharmacy or in the drug drawer or being given to the patient so when we're gonna be referring to controlled substances later have to keep that in mind they get special documentation and handling as to how they were checked along the way what was done if there was any left over when you opened up out of the vial all that kind of thing and the prototypical controlled substance would be any opiate like morphine or valium or whatever next is well back to continuing on controlled substances here's the actual 6/10 five categories now guess what we are not Tet we are not going to at any time say oh this person gets hydrocodone with acetaminophen which category of controlled substance is that or that kind of thing but you have to know what's kind of on there heroin LSD morphine codeine diazepam etc and that's beating down the left hand list as we go through any drugs when you read the drug book it will say whether that what any given drug is a controlled substance or not now here's the next thing is ya back still on the whole controlled substance thing every hospital or agency that handles controlled substance is going to be required to have very specific policies and procedures as to what the documentation is and if you divert a controlled substance for your own personal use due to some substance abuse issue that you have you will come into the view of the law enforcement authorities which is not something you want to have happen but anyway so that's why you have to be aware of that now so we're going to switch around and we have to make two definitions you won't often see nurses using these two words amongst themselves but when you read up and study up on any given drug you'll see that they describe the pharmacokinetics or the pharmacodynamics and these a lot of times our important concepts when you're trying to figure out if a person's having a medicine medicine side effect or whether it's working or whatever pharmacokinetics include such things as whether the you can swallow it or whether it has to be injected in order to maintain a blood stream and how it's metabolized which is usually either the liver or the kidney then pharmacodynamics is the way a medicine interacts with body cells and for example certain medicines build up in adipose tissue fat tissue and when you first take them you can't get a good amount of medicine in the bloodstream because they are diverted into that tissue in the case of an obese person consequently when you stop taking it it it takes a while for the reservoir of medicine to get out of the person's adipose tissue so that would be a pharmacodynamic role now next we have the therapeutic effect which is the fancy way of saying what does the medicine do and this is number one thing for when we observe we are trying to figure out what the do we know what the medicine does theoretically we want to know how how it's working on this specific person which is why you're going to end up studying all the side effects and intended effects of medicine and in the long run during the head-to-toe examination of any patient when you meet them you would know the typical medicines they're on and check over certain things that go with that medicine like for example if you know your patient takes lasix which is a diuretic that makes them lose fluid volume in their body we would make a special note to check to see if they were dehydrated and/or later when we get to lab things what their potassium was and so the therapeutic effect something we have to know for every medicine we never give a medicine unless we know what the medicine does it's like basic basic so now in these are four definitions of things you'll read about in the drug book and it's absorption distribution metabolism and excretion and at some point these can be important looking at some specific patients response because there might be some reason that your specific patient isn't responding to these the way you think now there's a few things to know is I'm gonna skip through this a little bit but generally speaking pregnant women we try not to give them any medications whatsoever because we want to make sure that any medicine will not harm the fetus infants or children require smaller doses older adults may have me metabolize things differently as far as gender most medicine studies are done on men not women so women might not react the same way to a medicine that a man does and then cultural factors says herbal medicine herbal medicine is growing in popularity in the USA but if it's herbal then it's not regulated by with the same stringency for what's in the content that say an actual medicine would be so that can sometimes be a problem if you have a person especially if they're from a culture known to be using herbal medicine ask them whether what they are using and where they get it and all that cuz that could be important he was to live in Honolulu and we would have people who from Chinese medicine would take black cohosh trying to even know that is but it's associated with liver failure so herbal medicines are not without their own side-effects next is and we're still on the list of definitions half-life of a drug is how long it takes the emphasis exit the body onset of action is when you take it how long before it shows any effect now peak and trough plasma levels refer to a lab test that can be done when the person is getting intermittent doses such as certain kinds of antibiotic like gentamicin is the typical one so in pharmacokinetics sometimes you do have to take frequent lab tests to determine what the blood level of a given medicine is because it's more likely to have side effects if it exceeds the range of blood level it might not work if it's lower than the expected range of blood level so these are a bunch more definitions this is definition heavy now they are you need to know the difference between a side effect an adverse effect and a toxic effect a side effect is something that the medicine does that how would I describe it's a side effect is something that the medicine does it's not directly related to what the purpose of it is for example with lasix which it makes you pee a diuretic the side effect is that it causes your potassium to go low if you that's not the same as the medicine effect the medicine effect is to decrease volume and hopefully to lower the person's blood pressure usually but then you can be doing fine with the effect but have a side effect that's unrelated an adverse effect would be something such as an allergic reaction a toxic effect is what happens if you get too much of the medicine in your bloodstream and it builds up and acts starts acting like a poison so these would be things now the typical turvy I'm trying to think of the first example of a toxic effect is if you overdose someone on morphine or an opiate and they stop breathing that would be a toxic effect because it will kill them and that's not what we want okay back to some of these adverse effects if the person is having an allergic reaction you need to know what the signs and symptoms of an allergic reaction would be because in order to save the person's life during allergic reaction you have to stop giving the drug start giving very specific drugs to reverse the allergic reaction usually epinephrine corticosteroids antihistamines and that kind of thing along with IV fluids in order to do it and I should say most often people who have an allergy will be wearing a medical alert bracelet or something that says what the allergy is an allergy is so important to know about it's like one of those things you must always check a lot of times in a hospital if you have an allergy and they tell the nurse the nurse will put a special band on their wrist right at the name tag saying allergic to penicillin or whatever the drug is that you basically would notice whenever you were barcoding or checking the idea of the person that's how important it is to do this and you have to get in a habit of knowing always to ask about allergies before you give the first of any drug that the person is getting alright so and this is sort of like some of these are in the categories in the drug book which I hope we already would have gone over but there's such a thing called an idiosyncratic reaction which is completely out of the blue nothing you do expected that the drug would do then a lot of times if the perk you give the person to drug nowadays many pop people especially older people are not just on one or two drugs they're taking ten or fifteen different drugs and some of the drugs can cancel out each other or add to each other and you have to be able to know what the interactions would be and whether they're even compatible sometimes if you get a drug say you're taking the drug that absorbs fluid in the stomach in a certain way and you're taking another drug like an antibiotic that has to dissolve in the stomach if you give the two of them together then the first drug absorbs the antibiotic and it doesn't work okay next we have to define what over-the-counter is and ie OTC and over-the-counter means stuff that you can get at CVS or wherever without a prescription you go up and down it says the pain aisle or the let's see now what do they have the cold and flu aisle or the constipation aisle I don't think it usually says constipation aisle or the laxative aisle and there's all these choices of things that you can get based on what you think you need and usually in order to be allowed to be over-the-counter it usually has to be something that's relatively benign if you overdose yourself on laxatives it's pretty hard to commit suicide that way if you think about it that kind of stuff but in the meantime you have to be aware of what over-the-counter medicines the person has been taking and when you're trying to ask about pills on a given person ask him what they take that you know whether they are taking something over-the-counter next so and this is also called non prescription medicines the next category of non-prescription medicines vitamins and vitamins are dietary supplements so the production of vitamins are regulated by the FDA FDA although we'll get into the minute now so on this slide here what we've got is a list of all the different by a lot of not all many of the different vitamins that people might take vitamins are divided into water soluble in fat soluble the fat soluble vitamins can actually build up in your person's body like I once met a lady who had taken too much vitamin K and her skin turned like orange color like a carrot and in the news there's been this thing about people who do vaping and vaping is really not as regulated as some other things but they were doing like not even over-the-counter they were buying Street vaping cartridges that were available on the street that they didn't really know what the heck was in them then it turns out a whole bunch of people died and when they analyzed what was in the vaping cartridge somebody added vitamin aid to an in vitamin a is not good to inhale it's something you can take as the vitamin looks like what's up with that out of that end up in the person but I mean it's just one of those crazy things right so kind of one of the general things about this is there are lots of people who take herbal supplements when we are talking about herbal supplements sometimes it's a combination of herbal supplements and you have no idea of what exactly is in the herbal capsule that you think they are and there are many herbs that have properties similar to prescription drugs for example if it's a if the herb is to prepare from the newly sprouted seed of a growing plant a lot of times the Fertile growing plant will have estrogen in it that's similar to the estrogen that might be part of a is a female hormone and it might be part of birth control but it's a potent kind of steroid so some of these herbs have steroids in them and like for example now we don't think of beer as an herbal supplement but in order to get beer you have to have something called hops which is a kind of clover and the best cops are from like springtime hops as I understand it and for those of you are beer drinkers you can tell how much hops is in a given beer because hops impart a bitter taste of the beer with some beer drinkers love now one of the things about the bitter case is it's an indication of steroids in the beer from a biological source but then if you ever have the opportunity and I hope you don't to be taking steroids such as prednisone prednisone also has bitter taste are quite hoppy but because of the bitter taste is from essentially the same category of organic compounds that you'd find in beer if you're not a beer drinker ask find a beer drinker and ask them about what hoppy beer tastes like okay so now we're still on the herbal exploration of medicines and this is a table that says different names of herbs on the left what it might be used for if you if someone says oh you should be taking ginkgo biloba and actually probably 15 years ago there was this huge marketing thing about ginkgo biloba is way to stave off Alzheimer's disease but then for each of these things on the right-hand column it says oh but they the marketing commercial doesn't tell you about the side-effects of too much stuff and for that matter you know coffee and tea or herbal supplements they come from a plant and they're used to make you awake you can overdose on coffee and tea yes you can right so now we're gonna be talking next about prescription medicines and as we said like on day 1 of class nurses do not prescribe medicines and so that means that you can't if the person says they're having this or that symptom you investigate it carefully and if the doctor ordered some medicine for that symptom fine but if they're if they have it you can't just say oh take this cough medicine that has codeine in it no no no that would be administering a prescription medicine without the prescribing ability or a medical license you can get in trouble as the saying goes if you give two tylenol to a patient with a headache but there's no doctor's order for it then you have violated this laws of the great state of Florida in every other state now when we have a medication prescription written by a doctor it has to be very very clear because there's thousands of possible different medicines and some of the names all sound alike and all that stuff so that's have name when it was started what the drug is what the dose is intrusive administration how often and then who ordered it so well when we have their prescription there's a format that the person who prescribes it is expected to follow now after you give it to the person there's a format that you're expected to use when you record it and there is something called the M a R and on this slide it says Mar and a R is the medication administration record which can be electronic like because they'll have electronic systems in the hospital or it can be done by hand on a piece of special on a special document that your agency uses which happens in long-term care but we have to be able because of the prevalence of side effects we have to know what was the doctors intention and be very specific about what the medicine will the dose was but then when it was given who gave it and how did it go and how long is the person on it's because tracking how this I this whole thing about the medicines is a very important responsibility that they have the person has a adverse reaction to the medicine we want to be able to identify the adverse reaction but and part of it is how long were they on it when did it start and stop have they had it before who gave it where wasn't giving properly all that stuff so if it's not if there's some problem with it you have to be alert that this is something that we have to deal with and grapple with every day alright so next is so nurses do need to know why and how the things get ordered and also when you observe the side effects or the effects and you know about the medicine just because the person is on a medicine doesn't mean they'll always be on it sometimes for example with high blood pressure medicine once they're on it a high blood pressure can only be control the medicine and the person has to take that medicine until they die other times in the hospital like for example if you have surgery the doctor will just give you antibiotics for a week after the surgery and then you're not on the antibiotics anymore so now at that what will happen is when the person is admitted to the hospital or discharged or especially if they have major surgery at those times someone reviews the whole list of medicines that they're on and records it and compares that what what they're supposed to be on and also what they should be on so that's something else that you'll be participating in now when we talk about times and frequency and all that there's different kind of orders of medicine the doctor or prescriptions of medicine one is and this is kind of restating the other one if the person is getting a heart feel like digoxin and they take it once a day by mouth around breakfast time that's a routine order there's something called at pete-r in order which is PR instance for pro renata which is a latin term although I've heard some people say it stands for per RN and it's true the RN decides what to do with it but a PR n order is one where the doctor will order say oh AXA t'v and say if the person is constipated give them milk of magnesia 30 CC's orally times one and so that's like okay we only give it if the person's constipated so that means we can either ask them if they are or they'll tell us then we see that the order is then we see if it worked now the example is pain medicine morphine and that's also true the person is not having pain we don't give it if they are having pain we do give it you'll see something called a one time order which is give this person a sedative prior to surge one hour prior to surgery only once in the case of an emergency or a new problem sometimes the doctor will order what's called the stat order or a now order which is designed to deal with whatever emergency situation there are which is in which the doctors not waiting for the the usual procedure of starting it you know next you know starting it the next time that the typical morning orders would be giving those now we're going to start this don't wait until if it's a once a day medicine don't wait till tomorrow give one dose now and then we'll start routinely every day for example now you're gonna see about 50 slides here that reiterate this point and at some point on a bunch of exams there will be filling the blank things that expect you to say what are the six rights of medication and you have to be able to regurgitate this when someone snaps their fingers because that's just part of the whole thing okay so now we start off with the routes and when we're saying their routes we're saying how do we get it into the person is it oral is it put on the skin is it IV or whatever and you can't just simply say oh I'm gonna change the route of medicine without checking with the doctor because different medicines even the same medicine will have different mode of onset of action based on the route that you gave it so you have to make sure that you are very much informed as to what that would be now we're going to go over each of the possible routes and in detail so you know how to give each route or at least have a little bit of guidance but then the key thing is like for example person normally takes a bunch of pills by mouth every day what if they're having nausea and they can't hold down anything that goes in their stomach without throwing it back up well in that case it doesn't make any sense to give them the pills by mouth because they won't do any good that way so how do we choose a different route to still get the pill into the person this is a big question now the most common route is the oral route be oh and it's very easy to just get the pill out and have them swallow it although of course you got to make sure that it did actually get swallowed so you stand there while they're swallowing and and you look in their mouth afterward if there's any doubt whatsoever as to whether they are there is something called sublingual and and in which case it's a tablet that's easily dissolved and you tell the person to hold it in their mouth under their tongue until it does dissolve so they have to open their mouth and lift up their tongue while you like plop it on there so that they know where it goes and you usually have to instruct them how to take sublingual there is something called the buccal route and I'm trying to think I can't remember the last time I gave a medicine via the buccal route but the idea is it will be absorbed by the mucous membrane of the inner lining of the cheek and they hold it in their mouth till it dissolves not on their tongue but against the inside of our cheek next is there's something called topical medicines topical medicine is that is put on the skin or mucous membrane and a lot of times it's for specifically for skin or dermatological problems although certain topical medicines will be absorbed into the person's body which we'll go into in a minute and even if it's only intended to be superficial a lot of times some portion of it still gets absorbed so like if the person is getting topical medicines just like once every day you slather something on there when you do it so now a picture this here is a picture of a fentanyl patch strictly speaking I guess this is a transdermal medicine it's put on topically and it is expected to produce an effect on the entire person's body in terms of pain but by now we would have had the pain medicine thing and the thing about fentanyl is if it's if you see one of these patches on there leave it on there because these ones get changed every three days not every 24 hour years the more prototypical talked topical medicine for diaper rash or skin breakdown we would put desitin over the affected area this is not a pediatric class I think at least a few of you have small children at home now the thing about these sort of one thing about medicine like this is when you put it on you don't have to smear it a half inch thick just has to be enough to cover the area of the body without because if you put it on if you put in a half age thick layer of it a lot of it ends up in the clothes or the diaper or the bedsheets or something it doesn't really help the person so you're just wasting it and usually if you're going to be applying this you should also put on a blue love because your hands will be all greasy when you're done - and in some cases if it has medicine in it you're getting exposed to that medicine in a small dose if you don't put gloves on and sometimes what happens is you get like a wooden tongue blade and you goop the topical medicine on that and use that to apply it so that's something to think about the next is there's inhaled medicine I will show you inhalers of different kinds over the next few weeks when we do oxygen equipment we'll show you the one in the upper right on top which is a nebulizer and then also we'll pass around one of these buffers which is the metered dose inhaler along with the spacer so you need to be able to know what they're talking about when they say this or that inhaled medicine for the route this is usually used if the person has lung problems especially if they have what we call reactive airway disease like asthma where there's some irritant on the inside of the lungs that causes wheezing and swelling and if you give the medicine then it's usually reverse as the wheezing or swelling and that's the intended effect now we're going to be talking about parent overall routes when we talked about oral medicines that is actually called an internal medicine because it goes into the enteric organs ie esophagus stomach duodenum small intestine etc and parenteral means it gets into the Purdy's person's body but bypasses the digestive system so we when you might hear the term parenteral medicine and that's what they're referring about now the tricky part about parenteral medicine and there's more than one route but these get the effect of these is much more immediate mediate then if you took the medicine orally and we'll talk about this more but with certain medicines if you give them into the vein intravenously you will start seeing the effect of the medicine within 15 seconds of administration which is different than if you gave of the exact same or a similar preparation of the same medicine by a pill sometimes you can give a pill to a person and it doesn't really work for half an hour or an hour but then you can give that same medicine to the person in 15 seconds later it's there so it's one of the reasons why the interesting students are never allowed to give IV medicines ever ever ever because if you're not good at observing medicine side-effects if the medicine side effect happened within 15 seconds of administration's that means you might be getting toxic dose of a medicine and not even be able to recognize what's happening so it's important to be able to develop observation skill of regular meds before we start given IV met now we're gonna have a whole special lab in which we handle all the medicine administration equipment but when part of the one of the things will be how we use the sterile syringe and a sterile syringe has different parts to it that have specific names very similar to the way any tool or that your automobile would have or an engine or for that matter a handgun and so we'll see this and we'll be talking about what what is the names of the parts of a syringe next is when we're on specific to talking about power interval medicines if it's an subcutaneous intramuscular or IV medicine means that in order to deliver it to where it's supposed to go we have to pierce the skin using a needle and squirt the medicine into the person via that needle now this is going to be something you need to memorize in the long run needles are categorized according to the length and the size so the length is in inches and then the size usually uses what's called a gauge and the typical needle for subcutaneous is small like 25 gauge and the typical kneel for an IV is going to be a 21 or 22 on the left hand side of this you'll see an 18 gauge a lot of times they'll have those out in the medicine preparation room because sometimes in prep repairing the medicine you have to transfer it from one vial to another and that it's easier when you have a bigger needle to do that with you would never give a shot to a person with an 18 gauge needle and there and the thing about it is this the doctor will write a very detailed description of the prescription but the nurse is expected to know which needle they will deliver it with and choose and like if you have a person who has insulin it gets an insulin pen the fancy needles for those are like a 31 gauge needle which is really small and practically like a mosquito needle and hurts less now one of the things you're going to be expected to be able to do this semester is to name which needle you choose for certain different kinds of situations so well and we'll talk about that will actually pass them around and you'll get to actually physically see them and all that but if you're not aware of the idea that you have to be the one who knows you know about needles to choose the right equipment well now you know now here's a more specific way of looking at I showed you the picture a minute ago but when you're if the doctors specify sub-q intra dermal intramuscular intravenous then you get to be the one who picks the syringe you get to be the one who picks the needle and you also get to be the one who picks is a site in which it's going to be injected so learning the needle sizes learning how you would decide which syringe and then also being very specific about your strategy for which site you will use is all part of it and we'll go into the site selections more in a bit so now there's something called a filter needle which filters out microscopic particulate matter from the medicine and you need to know when those are used like for example if it's in an ampule which is a glass thing when you break the ampule very small microscopic shards of glass get mixed in the medicine you don't want to inject those so you use the filter middle when you're drawing them up now the next thing is there's something called a needle less delivery system I'm so old I remember before needleless during delivery systems where we really used a lot more medical medical excuse me we use more metal needles to hook up IVs and things then we really needed to that meant when you threw them away a lot needles in the trash and people could accidentally stick themselves if they didn't handle the trash properly so that's a no-no due to blood-borne pathogens but then the next thing is even with a needle s device you still dispose of the trash the same way you would if it there was a needle because even with a needle s device you can still have the patient's blood on them ok so now the next thing here is this you need we will be studying and practicing all aspects of handling medicines by the time we actually get to the lab where we do this everyone's usually pretty hyped up saying oh my god I've always known this is what nurses do I'm gonna give a shot to a patient now because people visualize they said what is a nurse doing so the nurse gives the patient pain shots well we don't use as many shots as we used to we give more things through the IV but we still are in charge of giving medicines to whoever we're there if they can't take them themselves and all this so there's a lot that goes into medicine just because the doctor ordered the medicine does not mean we go give it all the time without checking the patient we have our own responsibilities there might be some reason why the doctor ordered a medicine for some valid reason but then things have changed like for example if they're in a broad-spectrum antibiotic for four days and then they develop c-diff diarrhea then that's time to re-evaluate which antibiotic the person is getting and the nurse is the one who checks to see if they have seen diff and calls up the doctor and says oh your guy's been on antibiotics for five days and now they have see diff now what do we do so now we do have to only follow written orders in order to make sure we have the track of that next year is and I laugh when we do this and I think the next slide is about handwriting I am so old I predate the use of computers in healthcare and certainly predate the use of computerized physician order entry where everything is legible because it's essentially typed out or data entered people would do all this by hand and that meant that reading the written order was an art all into itself and the idea that if a person's if the doctor was in a hurry when they were writing their handwriting might not be legible and this is like a whole genre of jokes about illegible physician handwriting but it is and was true that physicians of a certain generation were famous for sloppy handwriting or four distinctive individual handwriting so what would happen would be we would sometimes say the doctor would write something out and you would read it and you'd say I don't know what this is and then you'd get another nurse to read it and say oh you're familiar with doctor rain for his handwriting what does this mean and the nurse would say oh it means bah bah bah bah bah or else it's like I can't understand it either then you'd call the dark and say what did you order or in the old days they would write it down and before they left they had to read to you the orders that they had written to make sure that there were no questions so part of the thing is when you read the order you have to decide for yourself if that meets all the rules for a correct order that was backed by about 10 slides now here's an example of what we're speaking about here is an old time example of a prescription it actually says the date on there six 23:05 well that isn't that old but here's three medicines on there ferrous sulfate three hunger that's an easy one humulin and thirty units SC SQ QAM that's the one on the bottom that's an easy one but what does that first one mean right below address and above no refills well the place where I got this off the website said what that was the supposed to be was ice or nil 20 M geez Pio Q six hours but then if you didn't know that it was I stirred it's like how the heck did they come up with that there's another medicine called zest drill and there might even be one called Zen drill and it's like how do we know for sure it's not zest drill or some other thing and does that look like ice our deal to you and the answer is no that used to be a way that medicine heiress would be made the doctor partly writes it out scratches out something says oh yeah they'll understand it no they won't anyway next is you need to be familiar with what the how to do the ma are and what the vital signs are now there's two kinds of ma RS out there one is what's on the Pyxis machine which is an electronic touch screen that you can use to look to get medicines and somewhere on there is a video about a little bit of an introduction to Pyxis pyx is is the brand name of the company it's all medicines supply chain management but how that's that has that requires the specific documentation system but then you might have these little sort of cardboard e documents that are used when you have blister pack and long term care now the next thing about administering any medicine is you must be aware of what the recent vital signs were we already talked about this thing if they're on a heart pill we take the pulse apical e for a full minute if they're on a blood pressure pill you take the blood pressure before you give it if they're on morphine we check the respiratory rate and pulse ox before we give it that kind of thing because what happens is this we want to make sure that we don't create a medication error and in judgment meaning that we do every possible thing to give medicine safely and there is such a thing as a medication error and it can happen anywhere along the way and we need to prevent these errors from happening now this book I have a personal copy of this in my office because this resonates with me I don't know if you recall which movie this comes from dark arts defense basics for beginners but this is a text book from Hogwarts Academy the place where a Harry Potter and Hermione I forget the name of the other characters all wait to learn how to be Wizards what they were doing was they were learning about bad spells bad things that can happen how do you prevent yourself from becoming a victim of an evil spell cast upon you by a wizard that does not have best intentions toward you and one of the things that we're going to be talking about and so the reason I mentioned it is this we do have to tell you how you do medicines but because there is so much emphasis on preventing medicine era Wars we do have to be very clear about telling you how not to do medicines normally in nursing education there will be people who say well if you teach the students what not to do that confuses that just focus on what to do that's not what I believe I will go out of my way to tell you don't do this don't do it that way when I'm telling you how to do something because skills performance is partly what to do and it's also using the best technique which means partly what you don't do okay so there are a variety of medicine errors and we'll spend a lot of time talking about these but one of the things is as soon as you determine that a medicine error has been made the first thing you must do is to protect the patient from adverse effects of that medicine error which means notifying the doctor in examining the patient again and doing what the doctor tells you you need to do now as I said before we have what's called a computerized order entry system and barcode system that prevent a lot of medicine errors from happening but they're not the only parts and we'll have to make sure that you're aware of how we find a computer order for a medicine and and how you actually use the barcode scanner just like at the checkout counter at the bedside when you're giving these methods now there's two things on this slide one is the picture which is a row of slices of Swiss cheese I don't know about you but I love Swiss cheese and Swiss cheese is the kind of cheese that has the holes in it and if you slice it one of the things that will happen is as long as the slices stay in order the holes don't go all the way through the cheese so if you decide that you are gonna hang up the cheese by sticking them on like a barbecue skewer you would find you have to line up the holes when we are talking about medication safety there's the whole series of systems in place to prevent medication errors and 99 of the percent of them have already been prevented before you even get on duty but you do have to be aware of what those are and this is called the Swiss cheese effect of fail-safe mechanism after fail-safe mechanism or what's called idiot proofing medication delivery which means making it so easy that a fatigued nurse will give the medicine properly at 4 o'clock in the morning after they've been having a busy shift and their dog tired now the other part of this slide is talking about Sentinel events and you do need to know that sometimes the medication error can be so bad that it does kill the person the person dies because of the medication error and what happens then is that's called a sentinel event because death of a patient is the worst possible adverse outcome you can have and that's the kind of thing that makes the newspapers or and I can example classic Sentinel event is person goes into the hospital because they need to have their left leg amputated they go to surgery and they wake up and realize their left leg is still there but the surgical team amputated the right leg wrong site surgery is like a thing of Sentinel events but another Sentinel event would be giving a dose of penicillin to a person who has penicillin allergy and previously had a full-blown and \u00ebif\u00ed lactic reaction and then they died with this new dose someone should have known enough to check about the allergies but obviously didn't that's those are examples of the worst possible kind of Sentinel events so when we're talking about the defense against the dark arts we want to prevent something that's obviously stupid so next is one of the issues for medicine is going to be actual calculating the dose now in the hospital you're going to find that the majority of medicines are actually ordered to what's called the unit dose system when you go to get the medicine for your patient the dose that is available to you will mostly always be the dose that was ordered in its own container so we've already taken big steps not to need to do last-minute handling of the medicine that alters the dose to the largest degree possible but sometimes you have to recheck what the dose was or you still have to double check to make sure that the dose is what it is now in the olden days before we had what's called a unit dose system what would happen would be it was much more important to know how to do dosage calculation and it still is important when we're drawing up sub qim or IV medicines but we do it less than we previously did now the thing you need to know is you cannot pass this course unless you can pass the the drug calculation quiz and because that's how important it is to be able to do dosage calculation that's the bad news now the good news is you get three tries at the quiz after each go-round if you don't get it and we'll coach you but those that calculation is a big piece of what we do and essentially throughout nursing school there's a rule that says there will be two dosage calculation questions on every exam once you get to this point of fundamentals so back to the slide where it says metric apothecary in household metric system is in universal use these days 99% of the time so you have to know how to do metric stuff and somewhere I have a handout on metric system which I'll give to you and then there's the metric song and every other thing if you still make medicine errors with the metric system for example if it's if the medicine is supposed to be 0.1 milligrams but then you put down zero point one zero milligrams if the person reading it doesn't see the little decimal point they give 10 milligrams don't do that that we never do a plate a trailing zero after a medicine now we used to have the apothecary system where we would say the minim and the grain and that kind of stuff every now and then with aspirin aspirin has been around a long time the grain is actually 60 64 or 65 milligrams and sometimes even with younger doctors they'll say ten grains of aspirin for a headache which is 600 milligrams and yours and which means the usually comes in 300 milligrams of capsule so that means two aspirin and you might see that is brain X ten grains and Roman numeral system that still is used sometimes now one related to that one of the exercises I should have you do is to go down to CBS and just look at typical medicines that you might see like for constipation or diarrhea or cold medicine and just kind of read the labels to get an idea what the typical doses of some of these drugs are and we have a special game will play in class now there's also the household system which is stuff like tablespoons teaspoons drops ounces that now this next slide is still about dosage calculation and you have to be able to apply a formula for how to do dosage calculation there are dimensional analysis and racial proportions etc when you get them at if you if you get a medicine calculation book they will always go into pediatric drug dose calculation and or body surface area calculation or IV drip calculation or IV calculation now this semester we are focusing on calculation of oral drugs subcutaneous and intramuscular drugs and we are not doing pediatric or body surface area or IV drug calculations period that will be for a future semester but you have to know how to do it now typically you always have what was the order and what's available so like for example doctor says 600 milligrams of aspirin you pick up the aspirin bottle and it says each tablet is 300 milligrams and the question is how many tablets do we give I'm gonna give you a little minute to think about you have 300 milligrams cap tablets but the doctor wants the patient to get a total of 600 milligrams how many tablets [Music] do dddd dddd like hopefully you should have come up with the answer which is two tablets was that so hard but yet you know there's typical that's an e that's a relatively easy one but then you know like if we're drawing up a liquid to give us a shot to a person it gets a little more company now this slide here kind of goes through some of the steps and I'm not really going to give examples of this here's my take on this it's like I've got 29 people in the class probably 26 of you can already do this without extra coaching so you should kind of review it then take the quiz and then maybe there will be two or three you need to go the second time or whatever when we do it in class why should I spend three hours going over this laboriously when most people can already do it so the idea here is I don't I don't spend a whole lot of time in class doing this you need to identify yourself whether you can do it and get help we will get the SNA to come help us do it for those persons who want to work through more problems or whatever but it's just not it's a it's an arithmetic algebraic mathematical skill that's not the best use of actual class time but we identify the label look at make the equation convert units cross off labels numerator and denominator now we always do the six steps and we always carefully make sure that we are looking at their record and reading it a couple times their studies have been shown that when you're doing this you should not be interrupted does it take sponsors concentration and actually there's some hospitals where if you're giving a medicine you wear a special vest like a Walmart vest and that's meant to be a signal to everybody else not to bother you when you're giving medicines now at a prior clinical site where I always supervise students giving medicines I had a rule which is that if I was with one specific student giving a medicine and other students were around and they saw that I was standing right there but they had a question they used to come up and interrupt me and ask me this or that question I had a rule which is if I'm with that student I'm not going to answer your questions don't even come within 10 feet of me because I can't help you go get the staff nurse that's how seriously we take this because getting distracted this is like texting while driving you don't want to text while drivers you've been in an accident same thing here you don't want to have three multi tasking conversations while you're trying to do a medicine calculation because that is not going to be helpful okay so then when we get the medicines you don't document them until after you gave them now this is where we're going to be going they do have the barcode system you can't even give them to the person till you scan them with the barcode and then when the person gets it then you scan it again because you're standing right there very easy to follow that rule and then this other used to be you have to go to the bedroom get the pill paint give it to the patient then go back to the med room and chart it so it's much easier if we have everything by the bed if you have paper charting there are very specific documentation rules that have to be followed okay next is says this slide says computerized charting or whatever and usually computerized charging charting nowadays means the barcode system at Lakeland anyway you have a barcode thing in every room every individual pill is individually wrapped and it's got a barcode on the wrapper and you barcode the patient's barcode from their ID band then you barcode the individual medicine on the wrapper and discuss it with a person and put it into the cup so it's kind of hard not to documentation that's that system makes it very easy to make sure it's properly documented if the medicine comes up and it's not on the barcode that's a sign that first you won't be able to get it out of the machine but then second maybe there's a medicine error don't give the medicine that kind of thing now I want to say that there is a group called the Institute for safe medication practices and I got the lab I got the web link right here used to be they had a free nurse free newsletter just for nurses that was kind of your monthly reminder that shows every three months your quarterly reminder of safe medicine practices used to be free and then it turns out then they decided they'd be better if they charged you for appreci a subscription to it which is expensive but you should go to your site and browse around when you're working at a hospital what will always happen is there will be updates we're doing a new medicine here's the safety we're changing the way we always give an old medicine in years what we have to do now so the group learns how to do the policy and procedure at the same time so you're still doing adult learning while you go a lot of there's an awful lot of Medicine since I started nursing practice that are either obsolete now or where we understand it better and we don't do it the same way we used to now we have a quick quiz here if you're having a problem with a medication order especially a written order what's the best action in it did you pick out your one like next clue now it's long this is a big list of things you need to do if you follow them these are safe practices so they should be your customary practices and you gotta get in the habit of always doing these and you'll see nurses who always have a way of doing this and including if the person's conscious discussing the medicine with them before you give it you know they're Auto laxative well how was your bowels if the person says I've been having diarrhea well then don't give the laxative because diarrhea is too much laxative that kind of thing next thing here is another one here this goes back to something we already said doo doo doo doo doo doo that it anyway now we're going into this next whole bunch of slides talks about ADP ie how do we apply the nursing process to the medication process so I think there's something like 40 slides here that talk about add PI as part of this whole deal and so we're a bunch of things about assessment and the IP areas baseline assessment and medication specific assessment so this means you need to know the effects of side effects and reactions to each of the medicines the person might be getting because you're going to check them for each one which like I said before don't ever give a medicine unless you know what it does and both Cindy and I have an ironclad rule which is if you're giving a medicine or even if we're not giving the medicine but we know what the person is on we will ask you to describe in five words or less Oh what does this medicine do what can you check if this person is on it like for example if the person is on a high blood pressure medicine what do we check do de do de de da we check the BP before we give it all right so do next serious some medicines are associated with changes in lab results that require periodic blood testing this is a list of things that you could sing down for labs that have something to do with what the medicines the person's on next is will we when we will incorporate our knowledge of the medicines based on when we're reading up on them what it what it tells us we should check and then also the vital signs now this year is the very very important slide because there's a beginner mistake everybody makes deep within your art I know you don't want to make mistakes I know you're a good person I know you have the best intentions for your patient and they're honorable and lofty and Noble but when you're looking up what we'll do is we'll actually have you look up your medicines and jot down a few things so that you can remember what they do ultimately you remember ultimately you memorize a bunch of minutes but while you're in the process it'll say something like check the vital signs before you give this medicine now here's the thing is we don't just give the vital signs then give the medicine you record the vows sighs when we check the vital signs there will be something that we're looking for that will tell us not to give the medicine and those are called the parameters and sometimes the doctor will write out the parameter in the doctor's order but then sometimes the doctor expects you to use common sense to determine what the parameters are and like for example we already said if the person has a heart pill we check the pulse beforehand and we do it ethically for a full minute that's reasonable and what-have-you but the question is what are we checking it for and the answer is if it's too slow or too fast we want to check with the doctor again and so sometimes the doctor will say give digoxin or lopressor hold if apical pulse is less than 60 per minute but you should know that even if they don't specify it 60 is the lower cutoff like for example respirations less than 10 if the person receive 14 15 minutes ago and now they have respirations of 6 per minute that means we have that's too low if they're on any blood-pressure pill for a high blood pressure you check the blood pressure beforehand but if their top number is 90 that means they're getting too much of a good thing and you should not give the pill and check with the doctor to see what they want you to do because if you're if they're on a blood pressure pill because their blood pressure is 160 you buy 100 but then you take it and it's 90 by 60 you give that next dose of that pill you know it's gonna happen their blood pressure is gonna be 64 the top number and they won't even be able to raise their head off the bed without fainting because they'll have such awful postural hypotension that kind of thing so that's when when people are submitting their care plans and they include list of drugs I will always expect that you write down what were the parameter this drug what are we looking for that might indicate to us that we don't give the drug all right next is the person is on oral medicine we have to decide if they can swallow and for that matter we have to decide if they're taking oral things let's say they're going to be having surgery and the doctors said do not eat or drink anything for 8 hours prior to surgery well does that include the meds or not that's the thing but even if they can eat or drink can they swallow a pill if they can't swallow the pill you might have to crush it or a lot of times people will mix it with applesauce to make sure that they can swallow it okay and for that matter sometimes people take a whole cup full of pills and they took them down with water but then there might be you might meet people who have to take one pill at a time and taking a sip of water after every single one because that's how they take pills by the same token when we're giving a medicine by a shot into a muscle if the person is really thin like a cancer victim and they have very very skinny muscles and they might need more than one shot it's not a good idea to use that route because that'll hurt the muscles a few muscles they have left if it's an IV medicine we have to make sure we have an IV in a good vein and for any topical medicine we look at what the skin now so we're on ad buy and on this one we're on nursing diagnosis and there I can think of 50 possible nursing diagnoses that a goal with medicines but here's three common ones which is deficient knowledge you're getting you need to know what the Med does but that does the patient know what they need does the patient know what it does that's always fascinating to find out constipation is another one constipation is a side effect of morphine use or any opiate never give an opiate without asking the person when they move their bowels now the next thing here is a nursing diagnosis of non-compliance now we'll talk more about the non-compliant label there will be people who don't want to take their medicines even though they need those medicines and they make a conscious decision not to take them we call them non-compliant they may have a very good reason for not doing it and you can't just lightly say oh you're being a jerk by not taking the medicines the doctor wants you to have that sets us up for an argument what's the purpose of that we have to be able to figure out how we'll help them understand what they need to do or find some solution that's acceptable to the patient that get meets the goals the doctor might have for that patient so next year is planning when we have when we decide that there's an actual nursing diagnosis associated with a given medicine such as deficient knowledge then we plan out how will we teach them what will remind them of stuff they add by includes implementation and evaluation so this is some of this is duplicating what we said earlier but the implementation is you get the doctor's orders use the six rights and for each route you use the best known available policy of high-end procedure for added from for oral medicines we assess the ability to swallow we make sure the person did swallow it we use special techniques if they're having big pills and one thing to know is certain medicines will be called enteric-coated and if they are in Terry Cota they should not be crushed it's just a little factoid we'll get to later there will be for oral medicines sometimes the person will be on a liquid medicine and liquid medicines come in their own pre-measured packet like if you get a condiment at I don't McDonald's or somewhere a lot of times it'll have a pre-measured amount of one of the condiments in this small package thatis actual liquid medicines come that way too when you actually have if you only use the partial dose of such thing you don't save it you throw away what's left over now sometimes you'll see medicine given through a nasogastric tube if the person's GI tract is intact but they can't swallow in that case they crush them and they put them and they dissolve them and then kind of administer them through the small funneling to the end of the tube and that's that requires there's actually a video on how to crush meds somewhere on the calendar next is a few considerations this is reviewing the different reps so this is for sublingual that were buccal medicines you don't want to touch them if you're putting where a glove if you actually have to place the medicine in the person's mouth don't reach in their mouth with your bare hands put a glove long and hand weight topical medicines says clean the skin clean the old dose off use gloves or applicators so that you don't get any of it on your own thing oh now I almost I should have had this earlier in the slide thing here's a typical topical medicine that's used in with newborns for diaper rash smear it on the affected areas under the diaper interpret Asus barrier effect we do actually have barrier creams that we can use for adult patients that are incontinent to protect their skin as well and right now I'm blanking on the name there's two kinds the people always use I can't remember the name of I've ever I'm right now we'll get to that if there's a CNA in the house that can it remind me let me know when we have a topical medicine long times it'll because me because of some kind of skin rash we know where is the skin rash is it better than it was yesterday is the medicine working is worse than it was how does that work next is there's transdermal medicines which I think we already kind of talked about some medicines will be done and like one is the nicotine patch and they add TV commercials for the patch back along get the patch if you have a person who's a real nicotine addict sometimes they'll go crazy with their nicotine withdrawal and you could go up the doctor and say hey listen this guy normally smokes two packs a day he's having anxiety attacks and he's thinking of signing out of the hospital what about getting him the nicotine patch there's Rex's oh that's a good idea I'm glad I thought of it then you get the order and then that helps the person calm down now back to this one here here's an example of a transdermal medicine if the person's got one of these don't take it off just like when you're bathing them if you're getting a new one on like the fentanyl patch is going to last for three days so that means they'll get a couple of a baths in between they're always put them in the same place and typically fentanyl goes on the back on the upper part of the area between the shoulder blades where it's harder for the patient to reach them and every three days you put a new one on so that means you have to take the old one off and just both of it properly and one of the videos is what is the proper way to do fentanyl patches so go see that video right next is there are ophthalmic medicines which is the route of giving eyedrops and there's two different kinds one is if you give eyedrops don't actually touch the dropper to the patient's eye because that'll contaminate it but there's more than one kind of eyedrops first in some cases the eyedrops are meant to dilate the pupil and release the pressure if that happens when you drop them on there you don't actually drop them on the pupil you drop them on the white of the eye but there's this interesting thing which is if it's a pupil dilating eye drop it means that we'll have autonomic nervous system effects and you need to know that it can't get absorbed in the whole rest of the body and the way that that happens is through the tear duct that empties from your eye into the nose so there is something called the lacrimal duct Oh what is the other name for this the inner canthus of the eye there's a medical term for that too this which you would never use to a patient as it's too confusing but basically if you give the person the certain kinds of eye drops you should pinch the bridge of their nose to prevent them from just going down into their nose and tear duct that's one thing next is certain other kind of eye drops such as for example an eye ointment that might be used if the person has had cataract surgery and has the lens in place you don't put that over the pupil of the eye either you kind of pull down on the lower lid to expose more of the white eye of that I can't remember if I got a slide on that or not but so you have to figure out what is the best way to do it antipodal problem with eyedrops is the eye drops end up on the patient's eyelash and not in the eyes eyelashes are protective thing for the eye you have to get kind of get on the other side of the eyelashes to make sure it goes in the persons are okay so this is thing make sure you have six rights the person gets eye drops so it's gonna seem weird but sometimes they'll have different eye drops for the left eye than they do for the right eye so you have to be clear about which eye goes into or both or now here we go with the dark arts and if you ever see this on any place where we work come and get your faculty immediately because this is a big no-no and let me tell you the kind of the story of this if a person has blood in the stool that's kind of digested it's not going to be obvious blood so there's a bedside test you can do called testing for occult blood in which you put this developing solution on a smear of it and it turns a certain color now the solution is made of hydrogen peroxide I think it's 3% this is what the developing solution looks like now you wouldn't believe anybody would be this dumb but it looks like an eyedropper container and on more than one past occasions somewhere in this great land of ours somebody has reached for the eyedrops and either they weren't paying attention or they didn't read it and instead of grabbing the I drop thing that has the patient's name on it and doing the six of writes they pull this out of the medicine drawer and drop it into the person's eye which will cause immediate pain and burning and which can actually develop long-term scarring of the cornea and now doesn't that sound awful it should so now here's what happens there's a rule from the Joint Commission of hospitals that says hemoccult developer should never be kept in the medicine room and should not be available on the nurse's ward because of the danger that somebody will mistake it for eyedrops so if you ever actually see this in the medicine war on the carp if they use a cart system or in the medicine room if they have a medicine room it's like tell Cindy or me and we'll say we'll find them and tell them this is a no-no which everybody knows anyway but like this is an example you get a medicine and you think you're reaching for the right medicine because it kind of looks like that if you get sloppy and you don't actually read the label this is an example of a mistake now you would think that this is such a dumb mistake who would possibly do it and yet somebody did somewhere along the way more than one time more than one location different nurses involved so like that's an example now there are ear drops will tell you about ear drops if the person has whatever if you're giving ear drops make sure you do the heights some people will get nasal medicines like once they Visine but that ain't it a free nasal spray to prevent nasal congestion and the thing is there's procedures for how to do this we'll do all the six to give nasal spay now we sort of showed a picture of inhaled medicines back along when we were saying there's metered dose inhalers which are handheld and there's also nebulizers which are hooked up to a gas source and they kind of produce a smoke kind of thing that the person inhales so if the person is getting a fabulous or we check their breath sounds and pulse ox and pulse before and after the treatment to see if it improve things and that would be one thing we do so we'll show you how to do nebulizers at a future date in the class now there are such things as vaginal medications of various kinds or for that matter if the woman is having their menses you know putting up using a applicator for a tampon those require different things most often if they are in the hospital setting and you have a younger woman it was not postmenopausal who needs this people usually will use whatever system they use at home and it would be unusual for you to have to help them with their menstrual supplies I don't know what to say I just I usually hand that over the lady nurses to deal with then rectal medicines now rectal medicines can be used if the person cannot take Bo when we do it we put a glove on we still do the six rights a lot of that rectal medicines come in some sort of waxy thing that dissolves when they get up to body heat so they're refrigerated then when you get them out of the refrigerator get them into the person before they warm up and then have the person hold on to them until they until it dissolves make sure you under a pit and then it has to when you put a rectal medicine and you have to go far enough there's something called the internal anal sphincter you just don't put it in a quarter age and call it good you have to pretty much reach your whole finger in there there's a certain point where it gets past the in your anal sphincter it kind of floats away out of touch always use the six rights for rectal administration that would be good now next thing we're coming up to his actual administration of parenteral medications and we're going to spend about a three-hour lab doing this and this is described in detail in Pearson vol 3 so I kinda will go over the high points about nursing considerations and we'll also end up covering it in lab and so psychomotor skill you'll practice this and you'll watch others do it because you're breaking the skin and which is an important part of the chain of infection we have to use aseptic technique and we have to use sterile technique for the medicine so that we're not injecting bacteria below the skin along with the medicine and because these medicines act much faster than oral medicines we have to become expert at observing the patient for medication responses when we use these routes then we have to properly choose the equipment we have to observe safety and requirements so that no one gets punctured with a needle that has blood on it after it's been used on the patient who may or may not have hepatitis or HIV disease okay so parenteral medicines include things that come in either vials or ampules and on the right this is an ampule and a vial the the caption of this is exactly opposite the vial is on the left and the ampule is on the right a vial is the plastic or glass container holding more than one dose sometimes what happens is you get the vial and the medicine is a in powdered form and you have to add liquid to dissolve it and that's referred to as reconstituting the liquid and there are if it requires reconstituting that's a whole different set of rules for how to prepare the medicine which we will have to go with you as as the occasion arises weary consequently reconstitute antibiotics but those are also more often given intravenously so we'll deal with that probably more in a future semester now you can have a prefilled cartridge or a prefilled syringe that and which the pharmacy supplies it and you don't have to measure it or whatever that makes life easier there's rules about parenteral medicines especially I am sometimes the doctor will order a combination of two different medicines and if you don't if you're not clever you'll say Oh golly that means two different IM shots and then the patient will be there saying why are you giving me two shots at the same time and certain medicines can be mixed so you only give one shot others cannot next is now here is a handy little thing that tells the difference between different kinds of injections on the left says I am usually I am injection goes straight in and it goes deep so that it is administered into the muscle which is read and more vascular and and I am injection will work more rapidly than the other ones on this page because it is delivered more closely in approximation to the bloodstream of the recipient then there subcutaneous met embeds and subcutaneous means you're putting it in through the skin into the fat tissue and you'll notice that one is that an angle and the other one is straight and weather which one of those two you use is going to depend on how much body fat the person has if it a person has a lot of body fat we find an injection site where the fat is located we can give it in straight you even if the person has hardly any body fat we can still give it subcutaneously accurately if we kind of fold up the skin like tenting it up and then give it it at an angle we'll teach you that technique then there is something also called an intra dermal medicine such as the PPD shot which you all had we're a certain kind of allergy shots that's given very superficially and hopefully the day that we this I'll remind myself to buy a pound of hot dogs we previously we went through this period of time where we would teach people to do intradermal on each other well that's found upon for liability reasons but then if you have a hot dog it has to have the hot dog with the skin on it you can learn how to do intradermal injections that way so if you happen to view this the day before we do the lab send me an email reminding me to buy some hot dogs okay intradermal medicines would be like for PPD or for allergies and that kind of stuff back to that subcutaneous medicines and the prototypical subcutaneous medicine which are guaranteed to give the subcutaneous insulin that says insulin and heparin people use lovenox these days instead of heparin but there are six possible locations for subcutaneous injection and you will be required to memorize those as a matter of fact we'll probably do this in class every sign we meet for a few weeks until we absolutely can say what they are anterior thigh abdomen two inches away from the umbilicus or any smiles or any scars upper iliac crest between the in the back between the scapula and the spine but two inches away from the spine or over the triceps muscle on the posterior arm or I forget if I sit anterior thigh already three four five so that's that's about there when we give insulin you're gonna see a particular insulin device so we got a bunch of these will pass around people don't if there's fewer times when a person gets insulin by a vial syringe these days they're more likely to get an insulin ban which usually will talk that is if they're getting insulin ban that usually has such a small needle and a spring-loaded device so that when you inject it in you squeeze that it doesn't all go in immediately it takes 10 seconds to squeeze through this small needle so you have to leave it in place for a minute or 10 SEC now we have there's a question here you're caring for patients diabetes and kidney disease we need to make a detailed assessment or administering patients because this patient may have problems with absorption biotransformation distribution and excretion okay BDD do you need maybe new dddd next year we're gonna be talking about I am injections and specifically these ones are about the sites says one more thing you have to memorize will show you in class using a skeleton that we have in various mannequins but you have to be able to find the bony landmarks to use for reference for determining the site of a nyam injection when we're giving I am injections one little problem we have is the muscles have arteries in them and the muscles also have nerves running nearby and so we have to make sure we give the medicine into the muscle but that we avoid an artery and that we avoid the nerve that's running nearby so it's very important to memorize in the exact way that you would determine where to actually inject an intramuscular medicine we'll go over this in class there's I think there's videos on this if you get you can give it in the vastus lateralis erect it in B it says vastus lateralis or rectus femoris we don't use those sights that much as we do with the ventral gluteal or the deltoid but we'll go over this in class and you can read the description you're gonna actually have to physically demonstrate that you can find these without prompting it's one more thing to remember when we met it when we are looking up on intramuscular medicine and we look at in the drug book certain intramuscular magnet medicines have pigment in them which will squirt back out the injection tract and cause a small tattoo or else which are kind of irritating and painful when they they're fine in the inter muscular area but they're irritating to the subcutaneous error --air of slayer and so for when we have those we have what's called the z track technique and we'll teach you the z track technique as well I'm not going to go into as much description of it right now we're getting closer and closer to the end but we've got 20 more slides to go I believe but we'll be talking about z track method in the lab when we get there and as I say the bottom line is when we have the medicine the pharmacy will send a note saying Z track this or we look it up in the drug book and say Z track is recommended for this medicine now if a person has an allergic reaction and carries an EpiPen we talked along it seems like days ago that we discuss the idea that a person can have an allergic reaction either to a medicine or to a bee sting and if they are allergic to bees for example someone will have them carry an EpiPen in case they get stung by a bee and and this is what an EpiPen looks like and a lot of times the patients learn how to give them themselves but if you happen to give one you should tell people where you should document where we cite you you know we do have to mention the intravenous route of administration we are setting the stage for future semesters where you will in fact be more associated with IV medicines but you aren't there yet some people there's there's widely varying skill level and awareness level in the class you don't know how to evaluate whether take giving the patient to aspirin help them or not then that makes it complicated in case you give them an IV which can have immediate fatal side effects we have to be good at doing side effects we have to practice being really good at physical assessment of the patient we have for all medicines because especially when we're giving IVs if we don't know what the medicine does and what we're looking for then we're just asking for trouble now IDs can be used for like giving antibiotics in which case you might take you might put it in a small bag administer it in over an hour long period and now even such a net even even though it's an antibiotic they can have systemic side effects like seizures or whatever but then when we get to the point of giving IV heart drugs and stuff if you give it improv really you can stop the person's heart which it's like oh we need to know how to not do that so this is that I can't emphasize this enough we will not be using this route you can observe the nurse doing this if the nurse says to you I've drawn it up here's the IV I want you to give it you tell them that Cindy you tell that Mister Cindy dubs will make your life difficult if she finds out that you actually did it and no ma'am I'll watch you while you do it a very important bottom-line thing okay and this is just another way of doing this when we have an IV sight we need to make sure that it's in the vein and not fell out of place and that the vein is not infected in some way or irritated so even though we're not doing IV meds that doesn't mean we can't examine where the idea is to look like whether it's okay and we'll show you how to do that okay so now we're still on we're doing a bunch of things we're getting close to the end but we're also still talking about add PI we're on implementation and evaluation after you give the medicines you observe the person to see if they worked you have to know which questions to ask in a general way about medicine effectiveness and adverse effects and in some cases what the lab tests are and then if you notice that there's something wrong or unintended then you check back with the doctor and say oh your patient has this or that what do you want to do that's kind of the collaborative interaction between nurses and the doctors that we spend time talking about now I know how we got back here on oral medicine administration we use the six dot writes of course I thought we already talked about administration okay there's a few things about delegation that's where we're going with this we've talked about delegation since day one of this semester we said nurses work with doctors but they also work with nurses aides you are the one who gives the medicines you never hand the medicine to the nurse's aide and say I'm busy go give this ampule of pills to mrs. Smith and I'll target later if you do that you can lose your nursing license and you'll get fired from your job that is a no-no because we're teaching you all these assessment skills for a reason so the I but that doesn't mean you can't tell the nurse's aide to come and get you if there's a problem like for example person is on insulin we're gonna give insulin so that they can metabolize their food you should tell the nurse's aide mrs. Jones gets her insulin so she has to eat her breakfast if doesn't eat breakfast she might have hypoglycemia so when you're done giving her breakfast and you take the tray double check to see if she ate it all and come and get me if she didn't that would be an example of a way to work as a team so that they're helping you to make sure that you're giving the best care we can tell the nurses eight things we want them to report to us so we can investigate because we have a lot of details who are keeping track of next thing here is this is about the 50th one here where it says two six rights of Medicine administration close your eyes and say out loud what are the six rights do it oh that was so good reading within hail medicine and what ends up happening is sometimes people will be allowed to have their metered dose inhaler with them sometimes what will happen is respiratory therapy gives all respiratory medicine according to hospital policy but they should still work with you as to what we want to check the person's symptoms and vial signs before then we give the treatment and we check the symptoms vials person symptoms and vial signs okay so now and this is kind of the repetitive part six rights of administration four injections all right so next is reconstituting medicines the idea is if possible we mix medicines to minimize the number of shots the person needs to have or sometimes if it's IV we have to time the medicines in a certain sequence or take other things to make sure we're not having reactions due to incompatibility still on delegation now insulin is another one where we and we're really getting to the end of this year but if the person has questions or the person hasn't been eating then we need to make sure everybody who might be involved in the food for that person works with us because we don't want to give insulin to a patient who has not been eating because they will bottom out their blood sugar for sure and that's a complication we could try we want to try to avoid all right so generally other pigs here I'm going to go quickly through these and I think we're within just a few slides at the end and these kind of do get repetitive do not give do not delegate medicine administration everybody bring the Med into their own somehow stand there while the patient eats it in your presence the person says oh no just put it over there and I'll get to it don't trust them use your best persuasive skills to get them to eat while you do it because you don't want to come in two hours later and then the person hasn't taken them or worse yet someone visit and the dog took them that", "76etd8Ye6BA": "[Laughter] [Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title it is another nug product video so yeah we got an authentic bag right here i paid 41 out the door for this shopping mall so yeah let's just see how much should i pay yes 40. 40 99 you see that for a full gram cartridge not bad not bad so this is ambrosia this is their nug live resin line and uh yeah as you can see in the back all that good stuff the the percentages i believe it's uh eighty percent exactly well not exactly but that's what they put it and also the manufacture date and all that stuff is uh fairly new about three three months old so not bad date of manufacture is a bit older i think april so but got the nug family i haven't had a nug cartridge in a while i've only had one of their cartridges i forgot what strain it was but i just remember that it was a actually a pretty pleasant experience um i did enjoy it and it lasted pretty long so i'm excited to try this other one and uh let's just see if i can find my battery all right so if you didn't know by now i lost my chill battery i dropped it in the hole when we went to sf you should have seen that video by now but it's unfortunate but we got the press slide right here so you just okay well it's a ceramic heating core as well so that's pretty dope and also nugg.com if you guys want to check them out so just pull it out to use attack wow okay you got the logo right there let's do a little box little thumbnail action hopefully it's getting it go up go down right there so we're going to be hitting it in my dash vape retro you guys already know the deal and uh yeah this is looking pretty good i'm not gonna lie screw that bad boy in let me know if you've tried nug before like i said i've tried it only once and i really enjoyed it it lasted really long compared to these other cartridges so uh i'm pretty excited let's see i haven't used this battery in a while i've been using my chill one so cheers boys oh very very smooth you can you can tell that ceramic heating oil works because i do not taste no burning sensation very very smooth hit it's very very comparable to an erza i'm not gonna lie wow let me take that hit again this is the ambrosia by the way cheers boys that's a blinker for a blinker it's not as fat hits that i'd uh i'd normally see from other live resin cartridges um but the taste is there wow i feel like i could probably like do a five second hit and then a blinker and that will do a pretty decent size hit which is what i'm gonna do so hold on oh there you go wow that is really enjoyable so would i like i said what i remember from the other nug is that it lasts longer than other cartridges so i'm hoping this one lasts just as long because i'm really enjoying the flavor here uh for 41 dollars is generally the price of what you get from typical live resin cartridges uh except for the exception of urza which is like 55 to 60. but this is good i'm not gonna lie like i'm honestly it's one of the better tasting live resins that i've tried lately lately and uh i don't know where i'm gonna be placing this but i know it's on my top five nug is definitely on my top five uh from my last top five video i said i believe it was four or three um i just feel like maybe buddies edged it out a little bit because they had more of a selection and it's a bit cheaper but this taste like i've been on a bad roll right now of buying products and not liking it and honestly i'm kind of happy that i bought this uh this was like the only one in the display that they had left that authentic so i knew that maybe out of all the strains that they had of the nut cartridge that this one was the one that was chose the most and honestly i'm glad i chose this wow i'm really enjoying this and look at it i think i barely even touched it and i just did maybe like two three blinkers maybe two let me take another hit for you guys so like i said the hints aren't going to be as fat for you know blinkers on other live resin cartridges but not [ __ ] bad not [ __ ] bad i'm probably gonna take two more hits off of this and then and then we're just gonna end the video here hopefully you enjoyed this video if you haven't tried nut cartridges i've tried two out of i've tried two of them so far and it's been two out of two [ __ ] a hit so uh i'm gonna take two more hits like i said cheers boys enjoyable so also i'll post the link to this battery if you guys are interested in that i believe the cheapest that i've seen it was like 15 to 20 i don't know and then there's obviously uh shipping involved but nonetheless very very good battery from daz vape shout out to them always supporting me um yeah just uh i don't know i'm happy about this cartridge right now i'm ecstatic that i bought this cartridge i was gonna buy another buddy's cartridge because i did lose my buddy's cartridge i was gonna buy another train wreck but then i was like let's just try something new and a nug well it's not totally new because i've done a video on their their uh i forgot what strain it was but it was a good strain i'm gonna take another hit for you the last hit and then we're gonna end the video here hopefully you enjoyed the video you know like it subscribe if you haven't already if you want to and yeah i'll take this hit cheers boys all right guys peace out [Music] [Music] you", "ehOJ0SKS_Ys": "[Music] Wow [Music] party what is up guys and welcome back to Chris Kyle's TV this 21 / channel dedicated people on marijuana music sports the eMeter very much more so today's episode of coach Cal's TV we're gonna be doing a certain view on Agent Orange so hope you guys at home every smoking device alerted and be joining cannabis related products throughout show Andra of the age of 21 years older so went to the recreational pot shop today picked up a couple different things one of the things I picked up was a gram of Agent Orange here done by Willie's reserve so before we get into the strain of you here look real quickly show you guys the packaging and getting to the stats of this Agent Orange so it says here on the front that it's a hybrid it's done by Willie's Bazaar which is Willie Nelson's company agent Barnes grown by Stone Age gardens go to the back here THC says 0% CBD says zero percent THC a is twenty five point thirty two percent total titi is twenty two point twenty one percent one gram of cannabis in a mile are back stone-age Gardens synergy brands is more likely be packaging and locals canna house is where we purchased our cannabis at get down here into the pesticides we got some green cleaner and Newcombe neem oil all that good stuff so let's go ahead and give you guys a close-up shot of this Agent Orange here as you can see very light green bud there dark amber orange hairs super-trike tout manicured job gets a four out of five as you can see a little bit of leaf here and there on the butt of it for the most part pretty good manicured job on it density four out of five a little bit of flex but for the most part rock-solid nug and then on a scale too fresh to dry we'll give that a three out of five is definitely on the pressure side it could use a little bit more drying before it was cured but 385 are three out of five for the front or on scale to fresh to dry for the agent or injure so let's go ahead and get into the smell test the green stays test after taste test and the high of this Agent Orange Terkel the small tests on this agent orange here gets a five out of five get a very strong earthy floral smell mixed in with the sweet pie definitely very strong very loud Rakesh even just back aways with the package open here I can definitely smell the candies you could still smell that very strong earthy floral smell mixing with that sweet pine so very strong very loud package as well as great smelling wheat so if I were out of five for the smell test greens taste test Churchill so the greens taste test get to four out of five that it does taste the same way it smells you get that earthy floral mixed in with the aftertaste of a little hint of sweet pine in there it is definitely very strong in the flavors but they're not very long-lasting so I definitely give the green States has two before are five after greens taste test Churchill after green CSS gives a 2 out of 5 after the third hit it really does not taste that great you can't get any of those earthy tones that floral taste any of that sweet pine it just kind of tastes like some already burnt mid grade weed it is not the best tasting so I definitely give about two green sage tests of a two out of five for the agent orange here so the high for this agent orange hair gets a three out of five I got done I just got done smoking a point for Doug smokes the whole thing and I have a good decent 7230 split sativa dominant high right now it's definitely a very heady sativa dominant hybrid here and I definitely felt in my head but I had to smoke a whole bowl just to kind of get stoned and I'm not fully stoned yet so it's not very strong it's not very powerful you definitely have to smoke a good amount just to start feeling it it's not like other top shelves where you take a couple hits and you start feeling the effects immediately this one you're gonna have to smoke a good amount and got smoke a whole bowl just start feeling the effects but once you do you just start kicking in it does take a couple minutes to kick in it is some creeper weed but for the most part it doesn't hit you that strong it's not that potent but it's definitely a good sativa dominant hybrid definitely something they're gonna want to smoke in the morning or something in the afternoon stuffy not gonna be a evening or nighttime strain if you're trying to go to sleep or if you're just trying to sit and relax stuff you're gonna be a strain that you want to smoke and then go out and get something done it's definitely a active strain and yeah that is the 3 out of 5 is what I give the high and then my official review here of this Agent Orange I'm gonna have to give it a 3 out of 5 it looks okay smells alright it smells pretty good brings taste that's not too bad but after greens taste test yeah and the high like I said it's not very strong it's not very potent definitely not like top-shelf and it's definitely you know for 14 bucks a gram I was hoping for something a little bit better and after green seis essence well something a little bit more strong a little bit more potent and the high but my official review is definitely a 3 out of 5 for this Agent Orange it's basically just a mid-grade we've some average weed you know it's not bad it's not horrible but it's not the best and it's not great it's not good just kind of average wheat so that's my official review of Agent Orange and guys have any suggestions of strains you'd like to see me do your interview on definitely drop it down in the comments and also don't forget to check out my stern review playlist and don't forget to check out some past episodes as well and definitely guys make sure to have a great day or night all around 24 hours stay high stay mighty KD sail it didn't always enjoy your herb peace and see you guys next time with Chris Kyle's TV with one more agent orange cloud and normally you would just take a hit you know out the pipe or up the bottom whatever smoking out I just just go ahead and take a hit but this one here you actually have to smoke the whole bowl something we usually don't have to do here on the the strain reviews across TV it's strange but that's alright crack up little little snapper there little point one me I probably point to because it is pretty dense put that right there in the orange E and PC got next time I'll crush calls TV with a little more angel orange cloud out of orange e peace and Churchill oh please", "aUCXLWXolRY": "good evening my name is Ilana Beto and I'm the director of mark Florida and we're coming to you live from medical in Winter Garden Florida where we're outside the NOx medical lab and nursery for part 2 of our medical cannibis all-access webinar on August 30th during part 1 of our series we took you through a behind-the-scenes look at a medical cannabis dispensary showcase different product options and answered your questions regarding the current laws regulations and procedures related to medical cannabis tonight we are bringing you to the source of it all Alex Carol Knox medical lead chemical engineer and Bruce Knox founder and owner of Knox medical will be taking us on a on an exclusive tour of where medical cannabis is grown cultivated process and created from plant to product very few individuals get to see what you're about to see tonight so I want to thank Knox Medical for sponsoring tonight's webinar and welcoming us into your facility with open arms and all access to so let me tell you a little bit about our to our guys as long as Alex can remember he wanted to be a doctor aside from maintaining a 3.96 GPA at the University of Florida he was elected vice president of the largest American Medical Student Association chapter in the country during the second semester his involvement carried over to Tufts University where he breathed new life into the program by cool founding the share wood project which provides free healthcare services to underprivileged people as well as organizing field trips such notable medical conferences throughout the Northeast however it was only after applying to medical school that he realized his - true passion was research after graduated from Tufts in 2007 with the vouchers and biomedical engineering and biopsychology Alex relocated back to Orlando where he was fortunate to join a team of prominent scientists performing research in immunology which led to his interest in alternative medicine his thirst for remaining on the edge of alternative medicine had loved Alex into a direct shot with cannabinoids it wasn't long before Alex discovered how powerful the chemicals Staton Ameri marijuana plant are in treating some of which are very personal to him Alex hopes to bring his scientific expertise and charisma to promote and advance the research of cannabinoids in treating those between his own mother who is struggling with early onset Alzheimer's about the safer more efficient and cheaper way of treating their disease Bruce Knox is president of Knox nursery which is a second generation family-owned nursery based here in Central Florida schnapps nursery the classic American success story established on the family porous references parents in 1962 the company was built on the bedrock values of hard work and integrity a successful small business owner employing many Floridians Bruce has steadily expanded over the years today the nursery is one of the largest in the United States means maintaining over 700 thousand square feet of greenhouse space producing 30 thousand separate lines of items there are no tractor trailers on a property as the facility is administered in an environmentally conscious manner Bruce's OS put the consumer first and it's constantly working toward improving and streamlining operations to ensure maximum customer satisfaction so tonight we want you to please remember to consult your doctor regarding any and all of the information discussed in tonight's webinar the Epilepsy Foundation of Florida does not support or endorse any specific treatment or company but rather is an advocate for a strong doctor-patient relationship okay let's start the tour I'm really excited to go meet with Alex the chemical engineer and who's not the founder and owner of Knox medical let's go take a look we're really excited to be here today I wanted everyone to give Alex and Bruce a nice Facebook welcome with lots of likes shares and comments about the whole lemon I'm sure we're in the the mother stock house and basically we maintain the genetics of all of our mothers we only want to have mothers in our entire facility and no males we don't want any pollen or facility so what do you say mothers you're talking about the plants the plants yes okay so these are all the plants where all the rest of the plants are cloned from that is correct so we would come in here and we would take a stem cutting off of this plant so we would just take this plant and cut it right here and then stick it in a product called le pots to make it easier for the plant to root okay I'm so yeah so just explain to our viewers plans have gender yes yeah let's have gender they have males and females and when you're in a breeding program you of course have to have males with your females but for everything that we do here we only want ladies you only want the ladies the only other females that's correct they produce the most potent medicine and if you have males you're gonna have seeds okay so to create the plant use a male and female plant and then you only keep the females and continue to replicate those that's correct okay interesting that's awesome okay and so are there only one type of female plant in here or different strains of plants no we've got lots of different strains in here most of them are experimental we only have nine different strains that we are working with on a consistent basis to produce medicine with but we're always looking for what is the the next best strain that's going to give us the cannabinoid profile on the terpene profile which we feel is going to produce better medicine than will be okay and the nursery that we're in right now is an outdoor nursery is the reason I know some people some other companies may do indoor growing is there a reason that you guys elected to do outdoor growing well let's just clarify the description a little bit we are an indoor grow as we're inside of a greenhouse so a greenhouse is a greenhouse that's covered with a light diffusing polycarbonate but it is different than what most growers even here in the state have gone into an indoor growing which is inside of a warehouse type grow and they don't get any benefit of Mother Nature's provided sunlight so myself is a long-term grower here in the state of Florida believe in the benefits of the Sun let's talk about a little bit because you are second-generation farmer yeah correct and so how long have you guys been here in Winter Garden Florida we've been we've been in business since 1962 and we've been on this location since 1996 yes so you have a lot of experience with plants yes and with this industry in our regular business we grow over 30,000 lines of inventory different types of plants and colors of plants and what not so we have a lot of experience with growing many different types of plants and growing them here in Florida so we understand the challenges of growing in Florida and how to you know who are the best highest quality products for a regular customers and then on this side of the business is about producing the highest quality medicine for our patients and getting back to the mother plant how long does one particular plant live for we keep our plants you know approximately six months so you'll continue to clip it replant it and continue that process correct alright guys we're gonna go to the next room of the nursery to see the entire process which the plant grows from start to finish let's take a look first can you tell us a little bit about what we're looking at here yes so basically here we we again take the the cutting off of the mother plant like we saw in the other room and we just stick it again in a proprietary product for a rooting process it takes three to four weeks to root and after that point then we transplanted into our final container size okay now we're gonna go over to the flowering room and take a look in there okay so we're in the flowering room right now why do you call it that well cannabis is very similar to a poinsettia it is a photo periodic plant and it requires 12 hours or less of sunlight to initiate flowering so in this room we have in all of our flowering rooms we have the ability to adjust a length to keep it under 12 hours of daylight so the flowering will commence and then run its course and then ultimately get to harvest and so how long does the plant typically spend in this room before it's completely flowered generally it can be anywhere from seven weeks up to eleven weeks okay and then where does the plant go go after it's in this state or at what point does it move after it after it finishes here it stays in this one place until harvest and then it goes into the processing building where it is harvested and then dried and so you call it a flower because it's kind of like creating a little yeah exactly you can see the flower here and if you pull in real tight on that shot you can see the trichomes of the flower it looks like crystals all over the plan so we've brought forward a a plant that's getting ready to be harvested very soon and you can see all the trichomes on the plant which is really where the bulk of the medicine resides in it so we have brought forward a plant that's getting ready to be harvested this is one of our proprietary strains called sajida it's actually going to be a new release for us but as you zoom in on the flower you can really see the trichome development the trichomes is really where the bulk of the medicine resides add in a cannabis plant and when you say trichomes are you talking about that little white fuzz yeah the the white crystals that are on it again Alex talks about it they're like the water balloons of the plant and so our trichomes like this going to develop on every the middle of every single one of these leaves yeah there is trichomes on the leaves but it primarily resides in the flower so so this is the flower of the cannabis plant and if you had a magnifying loupe you would just see trichomes everywhere on it when we keep before we came in you had us disinfect our hands and put on gloves why do we do that before we come into the greenhouse sanitation is very important to us and so we are very precautious about sterilizing you stepped into foot baths which have a sterilization solution as well as for your hands as well so we're constantly sterilizing our tools feet and hands periodically effective plan correct for us to use any type of chemicals on the plans to protect against fungus and bacteria or insects that's a really great question here at nocta medical we only Omri certified chemistry's basically Omri is an organic organic material review basically and they serve it by all chemicals all of the chemistry's to be organic so basically we use only beneficial funguses or we use only oils and things like that so we grow our product with only organic chemistry being applied and all of these techniques that you use to grow and maintain the plants is this something that you've learned over you know having your own farm for generations or that also research-based based on other countries that may be have been growing cannabis for a while for us here again it's about creating the highest quality medicine for our patients and we don't want to go to a spray cabinet and just use any nuclear options so for me it's caused my background to really expand in understanding what our safe chemistry is that using what or not safe products to use so we we look for again that Armory certified products and they have been reviewed and deemed as organic so that's what we look for in any now we're gonna head to the processing room to see the next part of the process okay so now we're in the drying room which is in the cultivation building and as you can see behind there's a bunch of different plants kind of being dried out can you kind of talk about where we are what's going on here yep so we have left the greenhouse again we went through the mother stock house we went through the clone process we went through the flowering cycle and again after seven to eleven weeks of flowering we then cut the plant off and hang dry it so it's very similar to like how a tobacco plant is processed so it's cut off at the base and then hung dry and hang dries for three to five days and then when it's at the proper a humidity level inside of that flower mass then we go ahead and process it okay so when do you know once it's finished and ready suppose it just but the time limit or does it look indifferently it feels differently okay yep so you know you just touch it and you know how crisp it is and and whatnot is how we determine that at this point okay and then once you take it from this room where does it go well it goes into a process where it's decarboxylated we decarboxylated all of our product and Alice is going to talk more in depth about that and then you know the lab process really starts but one of the things I really do want to mention is that again to produce the highest quality medicine for our patients the we do potency testing and analysis of our plants at every step of the way so even in the greenhouse our lab determines when we process and forest a plan okay and so Alex we'll talk a little bit more about that so can you tell when it's in the plant state whether it has higher CBD or THC in the plant itself or is that only in the lab that's that's only in the lab primarily but of course through our own genetics and our staple of proprietary genetics or Knox medical we know what a strange should produce we should know that it should produce 20% CBD and less than point eight tenths of a percent of THC okay and so you have those percentages for each strain and you already know what it should be building exactly okay here is where the processing gonna begin so we're going to go meet palak so the chemical engineer here not to medical so he can walk us through that process alright so now we're in the kitchen and we're all geared up with left and Cabos protective purposes right so this is a industrial kitchen here still in the development we're basically going to be utilizing this not only for decarboxylation process of our product we're also gonna do the lights in this kitchen which were edibles in the near future right now we were utilizing the oven back here for decarboxylate of the product the carboxylation basically is known as an activation of the THC and CBD molecules in its natural state in the flower those molecules have an acid branch of passion which makes them highly colder gives the molecules a distinct head and a tail and by being so holder those molecules have a difficult time leaving the bloodstream into the necessary organs in fact THC a molecule is the natural form of THC found in a cannabis plant will not bypass the blood-brain barrier so it does not whereby the psychoactive benefits of that medicine so by simply applying heat to a product you actually break away this acidic pain the carboxyl group of the molecules converting that into carbon dioxide and what you're left with is a more spherical radially symmetrical spherical molecule that has an easy time bypassing the phospholipid violators of the blood system by passing the blood-brain barrier and providing the full medicinal properties of the medicine so it's an important component of the operation and we do a before any other process in our processing department so from in here the plan is still in the bud and leave property we'll then line it up and we'll get ready for the extraction component the operation that's great so once you grind it where does it end up then it goes straight to the extraction room which will tell you guys a little bit about the technology replying and and why we feel is the best in the state and arguably in the country you know Florida requires that we do everything the right stroke oil because it's the only way that you can accurately get a concentration of your product when you're dealing with flowers you can have flowers that are located in the top of the plant that come in at much higher potency than those located in the middle and specially those located in the bottom of the plant so when a doctor now tells you take 20 milligrams of medicine today it's impossible basically free to do it utilizing a flower however when you're extracting the oil which I'll show in a little bit you can then just take a single drop out of that oil and you can get a pretty accurate representation with it this is a custom-built supercritical co2 extractor you know you guys constantly throughout this presentation have been we have been using the term proprietary but it really is true we have set out to do a lot we want to make sure that we're providing the highest level of product to our patients and we've invested money to ensure them using the highest technology component of the operation on only in cultivation as well as processing and whenever that technology isn't still sufficient out there well we then put more funding behind and make sure that we have zero obstacles when it comes to for example our extraction component so this system is the one-of-a-kind system there's none like this in the rest of the world and the reason why we chose supercritical co2 is because even though it's most costly proposition to having a large-scale production it is a little that highest level or purity that you can get you know a lot of our competitors we know are using things such as a hydrocarbon extractions some are using alcohol extractions and you know the solvents that they're utilizing can be toxic amounts now there is a purging process required for them to purify the oil but no matter how much they attempt to purge it there is molecules of those hydrocarbons specific butane or or you know alcohols that are tendon balance of the CBD and THC molecules and even though you put it through the rigors of a process for purging it out there's a distinct taste and smell to that whale we're not in the recreational market so for us again we're not adding any artificial flavoring or anything that doesn't mean the all-natural standards when it comes to for the production of our oil because as I mentioned earlier having the highest quality oil allows us then to have the highest quality of medicine you know if you start you can make gold you can turn swivel but you can't make gold out of garbage so that's the kind of foundation we use here so you know you guys saw a lot of really advanced technologies in our greenhouse well you're gonna see that it carries on until the package is finally made so you say you co2 what is that really in regard to this issue right when it comes to extractions of oil you need to use solvents which will basically a nature just pull the cannabinoids terpenoids out of the plant material so the winterization process entails the addition of ethanol to the product the reason why everyone you susceptible for this process because it's non-toxic we humans its president everyday items like toothpaste less Iranian compost and things of that sort and ethanol actually in its new temperature has both work a nonpolar properties which needs to directly homogenizes with anything that's introduced to it right so just like with the carboxylation process everything is that function that older you apply a temperature to this process the shorter information a kind of a wire so we have applied one of the coldest temperatures you can get in a commercial speed up this process we're not only doing tests like homeless and turkeys or analysis here but we're also testing for pesticides even though we don't use any here we are testing Florida and we've invested in the highest technologies we handle that says we're also testing for residual solvents to ensure that things such as the ethanol this will be purged from our system we're also testing for microbiological we're testing for mycotoxins and we're testing for heavy metals all this laboratory here there's multiple equipment that allows us to perform each one of these steps it's actually a it looks like a scale it's actually a magnetic burning platform it heats up the oils Tibetan into teachers imaginative but it also starting the product is holding a long time this is the part of the operation that we're running animal testing and most importantly this is what we start forming the medicine for the different products at this step here that the product is in a tiny concentration so we're going to have any issues such as Pacific solvents or potency of our Andy battle anything this will be the time that it will display that so we will start Anna Anna left anima and analyses of all our products in this state once everything passes muster we can then continue on to the formulation or choreography they are to the right side we have one of our bestsellers the Ordre here with some constant strain that were constantly pushing out as Bruce mentioned were developing multiple strains here though we're focusing on nine intense rains as our primary strains we want to provide multiple strains under each umbrella hybrid SOT above in a CVD because we understand that every patient has different body chemistry's because a particular strain that terpenoid profile by the beneficial for you and effective for you doesn't necessarily mean it's done the other person so unlike a lot of our competition we're actually providing multiple options within each other problems [Music] sure we have in the CBD category which was the primary terrible category for the office compassionately this program here in Florida really efficient category for you know treating things such as outside mr. Parkinson things of that sort he provides no psychoactive effects so it's really appropriate or you know healthy is pelipper you know there are some of the symptoms that do require a little bit of a sighs aspect to it and that's what the TC products really provide that relief within the THC products we have sativas we have indicas and then we have a hybrid which the material the sativa Xenakis hybrids those are really dictated by determinately profile so terpenes are basically molecules that are present in the cannabis plant they're actually present in numerous other plants as well such as Coco oranges lines and things of that sort indeed he provides some of the effects that the medicine contains so whether the medicine is going to be a sedating medicine compared to in foreign medicine that will be dictated more towards its RB profile rather than a cannabinoid profile and then you also have other effects that just be a appetite stimulant percent appetite suppressant creativity inducing you know things of that sort are more degree in importance and again we have multiple strains of it each one of these categories to ensure that mutation has the best medicine that works for them right so you know when a patient cracksman doctor is the doctors responsibility and talking communicating with the patient's determine whether that patient is going to be receiving a CBD a medicine or a TC cannabis medicine and the doctor that is all diligence will recommend a specific dosage to the patient where it's early age they should start off at the system that works properly that's a number of days and the patient will come to our dispensary or call our call center with us amount of a balance basically that they're entitled to receive that recommendation and last I believe now it's a period of 70 days so then the patient has to track in with offer to review that we filled that balance that's all your doctor you know as I mentioned strong doctor-patient relationship information [Music] so at this point here we can not say maybe half a day to what they and once again was the test passes muster we then started moving our product down we only use medium chain triglycerides as our gilliland which is a coconut source is basically extra-virgin olive oil when it what that is - olive oil MCT oil is - coconut oil and you know the entire industry even the recreational market we started seeing the benefits of MCT oil compared to things such as probably by fall or vegetable glycerin they started shipping to where it's only utilizing for us as it stands right now the product form that's whistles we're not using any artificial flavoring our product is all natural from beginning to end of the extraction formulated and [Music] we are you know it was one of the benefits of not suddenly hiring people such as myself and Jimmy in large we have over 40 years of experience in chemistry coming into the laboratory and we're operating our extractors and hand in our control oscillations of under the operations so we're flying the scientific method everything that we do here we're really logging all the parameters down to the spring ways you know temperature earth pressures everything and we're looking at trend analysis by proprietary software so when sharor as specific strains should be looking for and other strange anomaly everything is done in a house and then you can have some feedback programs at our bases where they all communicate some of their effects and everything [Music] for the operatory doesn't wouldn't change much you know this laboratory is uh certified to the FDA compliant was again one of the reasons we scored the highest license in the state the highest-scoring licensed in the states because of the level of compliance that we were applying to our 270 operation so this laboratory we are you know going above and beyond and making sure that everything is FDA approved even though the FDA has no other industry again we're not recreational industry here to state when I'm looking to provide the most potent product innovation we are more concerned providing and ease without needing all our product we would provide one milligram or two milligrams occasionally singing as 300 on the print cartridge or 600 grand park has therefore [Music] [Music] so we're taking this level of diligence outside of state borders and it strengthened our when a piece of things about fermentation in Florida and for some reason that Basin was to relocate to Texas they can expect the same of that [Music] and [Music] correct all are paid that's one of the biggest questions we get our agent says which one's strongest one and we then start educating them and telling them that regardless of the strength regardless at the policy of the oil that is extracted out of our machine we normalize all those forces across the board to provide a degree under force on the milligrams of medicine [Music] right where does somebody will drop to the beginning we're gonna provide the graduations and we got a lot of feedback once again from basic basketball on definite date 20 props or 30 props at a single-dose can you provide a graduation on your proper and was a no-brainer for us we got started mean that it'll be for six months now and we got a positive feedback that just you know it's some patients really have us really small doses depending on the symptom than they have and then have patients epilepsy patients which require much higher doses so we want to really provide support to all parties all its place one of the ways of they know it's unimportant so from here we completed all chemical testing that will accept work to do Otis ether patient signal solvents Machpelah with nitrous oxide and heavy metals and pesticides we then will package this well in America Maddox whinges then we ended up with aggregation that exploded on from their cartridges or something will cross and these are what this product forms look like we were actually the first in the state to provide team same CBD and CBN contents of every it is now part of the regulations so everything about Spence organization to provide the sensations but this is again one of the ways of what we're doing things that have a tradition and ahead of what was asked to us because we knew [Music] so speaking as one of the 11 and 13 different categories so they're made to be higher than at every weekend late supper you know the teas and the CVD are the smart players narrative is prevalent cannabinoids present in the flower they're also the ones that have been known to eat research to provide the most medicinal relief however CBN I would say the third most women can betray and where it provides a lot of sleep for example has a very swamps and main event the indica strains for velocity M and naturally and all the springs that eats actually will convert itself into CBN what's the plan is rightly so Bruce mentioned earlier how we know the plan is ready for harvesting and a lot of people are looking at the physical characteristics of the plant so they're looking at the trichomes to determine tailgaters website your knots were actually taking it to another level was living in microscopically and looking at CBN's proliferation of the men or sedans are coming in that's indication that TMC is being sacrificed at that but even though we don't really that new your product for CBN's or cpgs or CD beats we are testing for all those other animal woods for nine of them in-house and we are people have to follow them and we provide a consolidated certificate of analysis would all inimical testing where every batch here is available to doctors and patients a lot so they can see exactly how much of what is up [Music] testing means the analytical analysis of the provided so whether we're doing cannabinoid profiling utilizing high pressure liquid chromatography or we confident in the libel gas chromatography context the symbolizes in a specific type of testing [Music] for you know the maturity of testing we're basically just getting a small amount of it sometimes 100 micrograms or 1 ml depending on the type of testing that you're doing and then you're diluting that the specific concentration and putting it on your system for analysis unfortunately there's not one system that handles all the analysis that require each system whether it's a mass spectrometer and those a specific level of molecules and any dust you haven't asked for the top of the equipment which happens a lot a range of molecules so each system is really good at doing a specific type of analysis so we utilize four systems here to handle all the 7 mm until we get to these final forms of medicine so currently were selling us vaporizer cartridges and we're selling sublingual drops and we wanted to come up come out of the market something juice two types of medicine because they're both behaved very differently in the body the vaporizes Archer provides an immediate effect and immediately high passes the blood-brain barrier so it allows the patient to have an almost immediate effect and relief from their symptoms however it has a much lower absorbance rate which then means that it stays in a system for fewer onset times we're going to maybe an hour of too many three hours in a week it is a liquid drop for example now you're having a longer onset time so it takes anywhere from a half an hour to an hour depending on the patient and that's these an assistant for a period of four six hours so depending on the symptom that the patient has one form is more ideal one other lepsy date is for example they really gravitate to or some people drop some type of an ingestion about the medicine where they're going to have a longer presence of those cannabinoids in their system because they're not looking to lead me in a seizure have prevented that secret occurring India to do that if I haven't specific CBD molecules presentation we would steer them away from a price market isn't more toward to sublingual drops or capsules or things that's worth however have been in a symptom some PTSD patients for example we have on closes these stations that were part of a private market where they can do some stuff and provide them something to leave for two specific commodity [Music] sure these are our vaporizer batteries they're provided free of charge to first citations and this is the apparatus that they would utilize with our vaporizer cartridge it's just a simple matter of screwing on their cartridge who provides the oil support into this chamber here and then pressing the button as they're inhaling again we got Lube all our products we're not trying to sell the most potent product out there we're selling a consistent notes so that when you can hail for a period of two to three seconds you're receiving either one milligram of Medicine or two milligrams of medicine so we normalize everything in dosage for inhalation this is also available for sale at our dispensaries beneath there and I know [Music] oh yeah we're current development of capsules of lotions we're currently development of suppositories prinstone patches in the work we're almost closed capsules we didn't want to use the public ever anything you know much like our something with jobs in cartridges we really wanted to iron out all the kinks and issues that it comes with it's where we start pushing more product colleges pages but we're really close as we will be soon having emotions available for topical relief or itching believe or arthritis and things of that sort we're also living close to the final exam suppositories which are very popular medicinal forms of West Coast we're currently developing new things and once we're satisfied with the result then we invest the packaging that sort right so you know the CBD products that you get over a counter or a line for that matter are comprised of strains of cannabis and those strains even though they're in the same family of plants they're really low almost non-existent with other cannabinoids specifically I see the end and as I mentioned earlier these other cannabinoids they provide an entourage effect without them the molecules themselves it's almost better for you to have come from a cannabis plant it's more effective than you have practically trace amounts they're still there ending maximize miss ecstasy you know a lot of people are using CBD products to provide relief from things that you know asleep things of that sort turkey for a huge contributors in that and again in Turkey profile is not nearly as rich as those sure so what you guys have seen as a state-of-the-art facility really applying a lot of unique and the highest most robust technologies and each component of the operation and I saw our greenhouse you know the direction of going to the house compared to indoors because we do it provides the richer plant nothing to develop the power of the Sun as was mentioned then of the diligence that we're putting it through you know how the carboxylate the product of the technologies that were applying extraction by suitable supercritical co2 over here to hydrocarbon alcohol interactions and then all the analytical testing that we do here which again is not only unique to that will be distinct but really to the entire market a lot of analytical testing that you we mentioned here are something that other markets will actually independent laboratories to be able to provide that level of analysis we're going everything out of this laboratory alone so that's something I think I really wanted the patience to the public can see that we're really applying on the highest level of technologies and we're not really skinny any corners to be by the highest level of Medicine they just want to thank everyone for joining [Music] [Music]", "uQwJaf6TPzc": "what the [ __ ] is going on you [ __ ] bunch of stoners my name is Jay one two four one five guys and in today's video Agent Orange strain review a little bit reluctant to upload this video purely by the name but we've had a lot of you guys asked what it's like how it hits what does it taste like and how does she look so we have set up the tripod me you've got some beautiful shots to show you today I've got a session ready we're going to be smoking out of the power Boog today hope you're all enjoying yourselves and have been having an absolutely awesome day and you already know how these strain reviews work guys we're going to take a rip prior and after we get some close-ups so like I said I hope you're all having an absolutely awesome day there is no down in the comments what beautiful strain you're smoking too while you watch this strain review let's get into the first rip of the video Agent Orange Cheers Oh we're going to get into the taste in just a second but oh my [ __ ] god one word amazing okay so like I said tripod is ready to go we've got our tray we're gonna get some close-ups and we're going to show you this absolutely beautiful beautiful medicine up close and personal let's get into it so I just wanted to point eight before we get into this that other than the gelato and the sunset sherbet this is the most amazing an attractive smelling bird that I have gotten in a year and three months of being here the smell coming off this but at the moment is the most citrusy thing you could smell it it's like fresh-cut lemons it is absolutely amazing so this is a hybrid it's a cross between the orange velvet and the Jack the Ripper as you can see some of the close-ups here really really beautiful nice frosty nugs gonna break open here and show you those undisturbed trichomes so the effects of this strain include uplifting and motivating effects serving as a great mood enhancer if you are feeling lethargic or depressed so definitely a strain for you guys out there you know that ant going through the best of times at the moment definitely something for you to try eight I highly highly recommend it so breaking open the final nug here to show those been disturbed trichomes and let's get back into another fad bong rip of this absolutely beautiful medicine so as you can tell by the close-ups absolutely beautiful beautiful nugs and as I said the smell that is coming off this bud is almost may flooring it's like like lemons very very very very citrusy kind of like the the tangi a little bit if you have tried tangi you will know what I am talking about but we're not gonna babble on anymore we are going to take one more rib to sign eight this video I hope you all enjoyed guys make sure you smash the like button if you haven't already let us know you do enjoy these strain reviews okay so packed ready to rock and roll hope you got your jet packs we're going to the moon Cheers now when tickled me nose a little bit whoo so there you have it guys a nice little strain review of the Agent Orange that is no doubt in the comments if you have personally tried this strain before and if you have what you personally thought of it so we're going to sign an eight here you already know guys if you can't cope don't mope there is hope smoked oh I will catch you all in the next one you [ __ ] bunch of stoners peace out everybody a much love take care of yourselves [Music] [Music]", "iNcCGMXn2bA": "[Music] we're here with bloom farms and we have some trinkets that you can smoke we here my man my somebody we live in a time right now we're portable vaporizers are in everybody's pocket why not add some style add some fashion add some class to it for every product that we sell we donate a meal to one of seven food banks in California Nevada well we've donated about 1.2 million meals over the past few years really we just try to bring awareness to it so that you can make it positive impact and I'm think you guys are doing a great job you know you got some of this for the host of the show a couple of these to take with me couple of these and y'all are doing good this year I'll tell you the truth the first one right here this is our high THC version we call this highlighter Plus this is about a 80% or more THC right next to it is our rose gold highlighter that's pretty it's pretty right yeah it's beautiful it's a it's a one-to-one CBD to THC ratio and then on the right side here we've got our highlighter uncrate special edition we only made a few thousand of these things a nice matte soft touch finish it's also a one-to-one CBD THC ratio [Music] that's clean give me some pricing so these are right around $100 a piece well I guess the show is the most expensive it's right sighs I'll pull up here how many how many how many pumps in this thing uh well it depends on how big a puffy take yeah so this is the most expensive is tech break and this would actually be smart the great way to check", "E23eThJHapk": "guys welcome back it's tony here from vape thing always mega store um today i have something

let's do it first let me tell you a bit about the juices this is prime's wrath of the grape mtl juice it is a sour grape flavor and it's absolutely delicious i won't be doing a finger taste on it because it is a 12 milligram and yeah the other one we have here is mango to the max also 12 milligram and this would be similar to a um a ripe mango that you can just jump into on on a hot summer's day both of these do contain a little bit of ice so yeah all right let's do the box the luxe bm40 i already have one of these but i love it so much i want to show everyone um this color is known as the j color and uh yeah it's gonna live up to expectation let's see let's see what's in the box all right firstly yes couple of user manuals in here i don't need that um it's got a usbc charger again it's a more accurate charge it's faster charging as well okay right off in the box you can see two coils going in and there are two parts and that is why i'm going to be doing two juices because this device allows you to do two different juices if you want a different flavor in each all right a closer look at the device itself five clicks to switch it on one two three four five it's got adjustable airflow as well i do like it open if you like it more restricted close your airflow all right there we go so as you can see it's got a maximum of 40 watts the range is from 5 watts to 40 watts if i press this three times i'll be able to set it manually but uh vaporesso has made this so special with the smart mode on your is that you don't need to set it because if you use a 0.8 coil or it'll automatically detect it for you and if you use a 0.6 ohm coil it'll automatically detect that as all right so i've been vaping mango mtl for quite some time and i actually love this flavor in the 0.6 ohm so i'm going to be setting this one up with a 0.6 and the wrath of the grapes will be going with a 0.8 version all right so first quail now priming the quill is very easy it's five drops down the center see one two three four five and it just slides in here any way you want it to it'll work either way all right then to fill it up we are just going to open the pot it's very simple you can do this while it's installed on the pod or if you take it off you'll see a little rubber on this side this is anti-leak it just fits right in there and then you can fill it up there's a maximum line so don't fill it over that line and there we go now i'm going to show you a close-up of when i actually put this in when i put the uh the pod in the device it's currently set on 22 watts but i know this pod this coil can run a bit higher so once i put it in that 26 watts automatically all right you can see on yeah i've got 85 battery power it detects the coil as a 0.6 and there we go just underneath that is a little buff counter as well all right let's try it out 12 milligram prime i know what this tastes like it's amazing oh what a hit i love it ntl gives you a hit in your throat um it's not as much nicotine as what salts is but it does give you a more satisfactory hit all right one more it's not too icy and it's such a sweet flavor i love it it's delicious it really is i've literally been vaping this for years all right let's do the other one okay then the next one we're going to do is of course the wrath of the grave now i am very set in my way so i love the manga so this is a treat for me i've never tried this 0.8 ohm coil for a bit more restriction five drops down the center one two three four five and this also just slides in anyway there's no dif no wrong way of doing it open it up fill up your pod and bam we are ready again i'm going to do a close-up to show you how the smart function works on yeah again currently it's on 26 because the last coil it detected was the 0.6 now the 0.8 cannot run at 26 watts and it needs a bit lower watts so it automatically jumps back to 18. they just did this this is the easy way here's the other part again 0.6 bam it's there and i want to switch back 18 watts all right let's try this oh much less of a throat tip that's delicious that is that is a whole lot of grape right there and i'm getting a sour sour taste on my tongue as you can see it can handle quite a big pool as well this is still 12 milligram nicotine even though it doesn't hit as hard as the mango in the throat i'm still getting the nicotine in i can't do this too much yeah importance of having this smart function on you is that if you are switching between a 0.8 and a 0.6 ohm coil it won't just burn your coil out it will just run it where it's optimally designed for right sure that's all from us and we'll see you next wednesday", "3qqP7SXaAVE": "hi tim here i just wanted to talk about one of the new cartridge products that we got called core pods this is the core pod hawaiian haze is the flavor of this one these are a little different than all the other cartridges that we carry and that they're not actually a cartridge they're a pod system so it's going to use a different type of battery than the standard c cell that the rest of our our cartridges use but i really like these they hit really well they have really good strains this one is hawaiian haze it has like a really nice smooth coconutty flavor really smooth hits really strong and it's from the brand core which if you tried any of our tiara grow flower it's the same same company that's making these core pods really high quality i just really like them be sure to make sure you have the right battery to go with them if you do get them but it's definitely worth the investment to get the battery because they're great great price great effect i really like", "HPeCUvEf2XA": "I have five of them right here we're gonna go through every single flavor individually I've been smoking on them as you can see if you've been in the streams you know what's up its up everybody youtubes and really busting my balls about their Community Guidelines recently so if you're under 18 [ __ ] off thanks oh yeah what is going on everybody and welcome back to another episode of free [ __ ] / I've been asked this question like a million times over the past couple days because of my most recent video so knock him out both in one episode you know what I mean before we get to that this video is sponsored by my goddamn self so a lot of you guys have been asking for merch specifically merch that doesn't say hey I'm a [ __ ] pothead on it because I understand that right you guys are like yo man I'd like to merch I want to support you but I don't want a pot leaf on my back and I respect that so just for you people I've dropped a piece drip tea it's pretty much the peace tea that we did before it says peace right here on the breast and then a peace sign on the back but it's like dripping it's like liquidy it looks really cool it's probably only gonna be available for two weeks let's make it two weeks so if you guys want to check that out link is in the description make sure to check it out by yourself one two weeks very limited they're [ __ ] awesome doesn't really scream that you smoke weed and yeah pretty cool so ever since I released that video a couple days ago which by the way he's doing very well the most common question that I get asked is Erik if you're not smoking these boo fast carts then what are your favorite cartridges if you know anything about the channel you know that these have been pretty much my go-to for the past couple weeks couple months I don't even know how long but it's usually the Moonrock carts which this one's empty and thus tizzy I found that these two right here are kind of the cleanest high and they give you the best high for sure like one or two hits out of these I'm not gonna lie that I've tried plenty of carts have tried kingpins brass knuckles like legitimate kingpins legitimate brass knuckles and there's a whole bunch of different brands out there for the most part it takes you like what two three hits and then you're like all right now I'm feeling good but with either of these with one solid not even a blinker with one solid hit like five six seconds I'm feeling it and that's that's kind of tough to do with a pen for me right cuz you tolerance just goes higher and higher and higher after every time I'm not sure how much is left in here it's a strawberry Nana car it's pretty much done tastes very good no best thing about cz see like a not a lot of pins make me cough bro I'm not gonna lie after a hit like that but the thing about susie that doesn't make you my daily driver is one it's only available in california and to its proprietary little battery so if this dies i don't have any other device but i have like a million 510 thread battery so that's mainly why this is nice don't get me wrong and they recently remodeled other package its new packaging it's higher THC percentages and there's no pesticides so sissies your thing then go ahead and check it out man but because of those two things it really just i don't really hit it every day you know i mean i don't get the opportunity to smoke bcz every single day however alright the game has changed man dr. zodiac who usually makes the moon rock cartridges said [ __ ] that i want to branch into other things [ __ ] the moon rocks and we got ourselves i'm not sure he's coming out with anymore but we have ourselves six different cartridges six different flavors six different strains from dr. zodiac himself the maker of the moon rocks and they hit the same bro and it takes a lot for me to say that about a cartridge bro there's not many cards out there that hit like a moon rock car but from the [ __ ] himself obviously it's gonna be pretty dope man have five of them right here we're gonna go through every single flavor individually i've been smokin on them as you can see if you've been in the streams you know what's up i actually gave Kyle one of them which is why one of them is missing so it gives me an opportunity to open it up so packaging is on point first of all you have some crazy I there's so much going on right here there's like a lion's a spaceship in the background there's like a little spiral galaxy right there like this is tight I've got to open it up and inside you'll see a battery a charger and your one gram cartridge I think they also sell them in half grams yeah yeah I've never seen him in half grams but there's a little spot right there for a half gram so I imagine that they do now the [ __ ] cartridges a low charger and we have ourselves right here what is this one the Lion Heart clear so a lot of these don't have the strain actually on them I'm not exactly Lionheart distrain I've never heard of it but the other ones I'll go through and tell you what I think this train is but I guess that's part of the fun man little guessing game so very first hit off of this cart by the way as you can see right here we got a little bubble right there and as you guys know I said in my last video I said hey the bubble moves it's bunk so let's go ahead and see if that bubble is moving I'm not even seeing it but I know the bubbles not moving beautiful beautiful man let's go ahead and just give this a nice low trip blinker yeah we'll get a nice rip and then we'll give it a blinker [Music] goddamn bro [Music] [Music] I couldn't even blink it man okay mm-hmm so I'm not gonna lie Lionheart was my least favorite which is why I gave it to Kai but after that hit man I don't know I might have to reconsider lion-hearted clear very fire next one up I think we're going to go through for my favorite to least favorite right now just as we got that one out of the way my very very favorite out of the six new ones that he has is called this Linwood lemonade clear this pen right here straight up tastes like I'm taking a [ __ ] dab bro it's ridiculous like it tastes so much like lemon like I have lemon gene aemon's right now and I think it kind of reminds me of that but every time I rip this it's flavor town and it's high town baby [Music] that's not saying that's insane man I can literally rip these off a pro I mean that would probably be really bad my tolerance but dude god damn I'm eyes and look [ __ ] all right yeah Lin would absolutely fired next up we have a Bobby blues clear which I believe is Blue Dream or something of the sort tastes very much like Blue Dream and it is the second most delicious one oh yeah that's blue dream for sure next up we have the silverback clear which i think is the best look and artwork in my opinion it's my third favorite and this is guerrilla glue like I said these are just assumptions I could be completely flow going wrong about all these but this is this is generally what I'm tasting what I'm getting the effects that I'm getting from these pants man every single pen also has the little logo or the little artwork on it instead of the little doctor zodiac bunny but we do have the bunny right there and we got the bunny right there as well mad goddamn I love these bro I don't know there's just a look about these you know I mean like every single cart looks the [ __ ] same man and at a certain point like when you're getting really high off all the cards still you look for a little something extra right you look for a little pizzazz you look for a little like all the cards are the same I need something that stands out oh wow all right that second hit was a little different hang on that might bump up man I don't know that might bump up to number two right there goddamn that silver bag is why you're next up this could actually this is up there man I'm not gonna lie next up we have the razzle dazzle clear there's a little berry hitting a cartridge right there which is very clean this color is nice I don't know there's something cool about all these like it's one thing to color one things the flavor when things like the plugins and say you should make it I don't know man one's a real bright pink with all the colors on it I think this one really reminds me of an actual moon rock cardiguez which is like a berry flavored moon rock art tastes very similar to that it honestly tastes like a DAB like I don't know man like not a lot of dab cards sometimes dab cards will just be Tudor P if that makes any sense like oh dude this doesn't even taste like weed this just tastes like like a [ __ ] candy cart or something you know what I mean and I don't really [ __ ] with that but these have like it taste like wheat like you know you're getting that wheat I don't know if all of you are under that there's probably gonna be some people that bro I just smoked with a flavor like alright these cards aren't for you then I'm not gonna lie these cards are for getting extremely [ __ ] medicated and a hint of flavor that's like enjoyable but not too much I don't know but it's some good stuff now this last one here is called Frosty's snowcone again don't necessarily know if that's strain or not um but this little it's a little Frosty the Snowman guys looking evil on here what is he I like that a little logo man it's looking [ __ ] cool there's color by the way purple is probably my favorite color like probably a lighter shade of purple is my favorite color but this is solid right here Wow okay wait I feel like I'm cleansing my palette between each of these hits it's kind of a long time and usually on the streams I'm just like so I'm getting a decent amount of time to actually taste these do why is it so [ __ ] hard to rank these bro that's unnecessary like these are all fire five had however much these retail for like fifty sixty seventy bucks I don't know how much I I wouldn't pick one [ __ ] wait hang on if I had people are gonna ask me but they're like dude I only have enough money for one which one should I buy hey I think I'm buying the lemonade yeah that's a no-brainer I think the lemonade ones like no-brainer no-brainer kind of number one there and then number two bro it's like but just pick your poison yeah I mean goddamn everyone's probably gonna ask for this part no we're okay there you go durability tests on the spot [ __ ] beautiful everyone's gonna ask for it Oh first of all we need to get this thumbnail hang on let's get a bang and ask them no going right now oh not today son not [ __ ] today try to do this on stream and it was rather difficult so we're gonna see what's good right here it's just a little difficult because like it's hard to create a seal around so when you're inhaling you're just getting a lot of air all right so if you're not in a state where you can get dr. zodiacs and Moonrock cartridges and you're like damn I still want to have a little so wanna have a little swagger so we'll have a little what are your favorite batteries Eric I can get my own cartridges what do you like to smoke the actual cars use em so great great move question bro I actually have a little something right here it's like a part to a cliche bro personally I like batteries that don't have a button I don't know what it is but like yeah it's an added luxury that you can change the temperature but give a foot most of the time like I just want to hit it take out of my pocket inhale put it in and then we're good you know I mean I have to like click five times turn on and then like one two three and like change the temp and then like all right you know I mean it's just like those added seconds it seems like some [ __ ] but it kind of matters I mentioned this battery and all of these batteries made by Batman on a video before they're on the one gram in one sitting video but their website only sells wholesale they only sell like two dispensaries and stuff you know what it means so you couldn't buy it individually however I've helped you out don't even worry about it we have found an online head shop that was willing to work with us they even gave us a discount code so head up J vape industries it'll be in the description down below and you can use code Eric 10 for 10 percent off I have this battery and all of the magic Bab ballad batteries they're [ __ ] late all right I got you guys don't worry I got you guys take the lemon one of course slide in there and they both have this magnet [ __ ] that's like I don't know why that's so sexy like I don't know why I meant these are both the same color - damn in here I like this little midnight look look that's not coming out man you got a oh you know what I mean like that's [ __ ] tight you don't getting the only gripe on the see cell palm that I like the VAM on better is obviously this one's smaller this one that's a light so you know when you're heating it you know what I mean this one oh there is a light on this one never mind [ __ ] I don't know man look bad the stick one might hit a little harder than this I'd say if you're buying a dr. zodiac pen and you got the battery with it there's no need to upgrade but if you in need of a new battery these are the movement especially if you don't have a proper battery and you have one of those stick low eight dollar ones at the local smoke shop get rid of that [ __ ] it's gonna die in like a month month and a half get either one of these batteries men Eric 10 for 10% off by the merch first but like a if you want to check these out too if you need a battery a go ahead and check them out man I hope you all enjoyed hope you all learn something this wasn't a drugs 101 I don't know why I said that but like I don't learn something about batteries or card in my favorites hey you know what I mean let's get let's get a solid little double hit here going both batteries actually get something cool willing you know yeah when you have three you can actually like hit it properly you know what I mean I'm like yeah look at this cloud that I made my opponent it's just like alright you won't turn it so I have to do it like this I got to hold it that's gonna be the video guys I hope you all enjoyed make sure to check out all the links in the description make sure to share the social media do all that [ __ ] like the video comment a subscribe do all that [ __ ] I'll see you in the next video we're just gonna be on I'll see you in the next video which is gonna be on Wednesday maybe even sooner [Music]", "Y3vRyew74g4": "[Music] what's up Isaac Lucic here back with another new Intel entitled this is going to be another cartridge review and this is a pretty new company I've never heard of but this smell free cannabis company and they were kind enough to give me a voucher to purchase one of these for $2 and they actually let me try some of their stuff to they have live resin cartridges and they also have cured resin cartridges and her cured live resin cartridges mind you man from what I remember when they let me sample both of them I definitely remember that the cured lie breath and tasted so so good I believe this one's going to be there their live resin one another thing that they mentioned to me which was surprising was that that they're live resin cartridges also has distillate in here so I'm not too sure I mean I'm pretty sure they said that about that but I could be wrong so correct me if I'm wrong the free canvas company but we're gonna be using the pocket you guys already know I will have the link and the one description below if you guys are going to check that out this is a pretty expensive batteries so please check your other alternatives or other options before you finally decide on this because what I like does not mean you like it you know I'm saying I like it because it's a very I it's just a smooth sleek design and build it has a nice feel to it but it is pretty pricey so like I said please just uh know what you're getting into know what you're buying I'm checking all other alternatives because this channel is cool about cannabis content and all and stuff but it's also you know save you a few bucks let you know about the products and always trying to save you some money guys always at the end of the day money is how you gave [ __ ] so I'm trying to hit you I'm trying to help you guys get the best [ __ ] that you can possibly get but not to talking this is going to be strawberry [ __ ] guys very very good stuff [Music] yes I do in a car cut and yes this is the new bandana I'm actually washing the other one so like I got sick of the skull the skull is actually better than polka-dots only have this one because it's black and a black bandana is less is non-threatening at least the gang members you know if I wear a red bandana I could get a shot blue shot black maybe not so much you know so I'm going to open this by the percentage of THC is 86 percent guys you can see right here I'm going too fast and I am sorry right off the back they use the same as select you can see very similar to the select plastic kit from iceless leg and right that kind of smell strawberries so this could definitely be mixed distillate [Music] good yeah [Music] before I get into the review or talk about that hit you might be noticing a faint man noises because I got a fan outside the window so it mentally it's better my room has been getting hot lately it's just because there's probably a lot of electronics there's a lot of people in my room constantly so a fan that attaches to the window is pretty good and it's actually going outward so it's sucking all the hot air out and uh yeah getting into the cart it taste like strawberries not too much I can say about the flavor other than if it tastes like strawberries not too overly powerful you know I do it does fade away quickly just like this lid does you know you but this Li exhales you get that full flavor boat it goes away pretty quick I'm not sure if it's just this lip [Music] so free cannabis fun so like I said earlier there live present and then have cured live resin and their live resin is mixed look a little bit of distillate is what I remember them saying and let's be real like come on this is the way and it tastes like strawberry I mean like live resident tastes like strawberry there's got to be some sort of like terpenes or strawberry terpenes in there that they put in there you know that's definitely not from the plant that I feel like you know some people like the discreteness of oh this guy's just smoking strawberry vape or whatever you know but yes it is good but yes guys this is a legit company okay I actually went to come all the flowers and picked it up I will post their information right here also in the description below and I'd like to mention you know guys just be careful with the cartridges that you were smoking I've been smoking cartridges for a while and nothing has ever happened yeah I always buy cartridges from the dispensary never have I I mean I've tried a few but I don't really buy them like I've tried my homies he usually goes to the sessions and I'm not gonna like I've tried you didn't really like it but I've tried you know yes free cannabis company guys I really really am enjoying this cartridge I'm not gonna lie but you guys already know me I like that I like the cartridges that taste like so but like I said they're cured light resin has that taste so if you do see this company try their cured live recipe try both it does matter try them next to each other and you can actually tell the difference because that's what I did at the booth and yes hopefully you guys enjoyed this video this brand is not bad I don't know the pricing of this I actually have not seen this at my local dispensaries or on weed maps and malls are selling it pretty cheap at the Hall of flowers by a walrus it won't reflect what you're going to be seeing at the dispensary so I can tell you the price $20 for a program $15 $15 I believe it was $15 for the regular live resin cartridges this year and then $20 or the cured live resin but like I said these prices won't reflect what you will see at the dispensary but I am liking this definitely like the cured resin better but I'm not gonna clean about this one if you guys like strawberry taste water looting stuff I really really would recommend this we'll take one more and then [Music] [Music] and there's cloud Stephanie cloud but yeah other than that I'll see you guys [Music]", "bcvJBXr6bSU": "[Music] what is going on youtube it's your boy turpatom coming right back with you guys with a nice awesome medical cannabis review and this one i'm going to be doing a dislike cartridge durbin poison you guys know durbin poison is one of my favorite sativas right so as soon as i get out back in my little spot we're going to get straight into this derby poison the cartridge all right i'll see you right back so like i was saying this desolate durban poison grass root cartridge half a gram i believe it was uh 50 bucks and it was like 15 off i believe yesterday on their their sales they had so uh look at the numbers here guys real quick hopefully it focuses for you right you know i'll do my little zoom in thing give you guys all that nice info all right you guys remember uh it's a south african land race variety right uh energetic uplifted happy euphoric and creative well it's supposed to help the stress depression inside chronic pain muscle cramps and uh fatigue a similar strange like i was saying is jack hair super lemon haze ghost train haze uh j1 jack the ripper j or xj13 and clementine all right so i got my nice [ __ ] ooze stainless steel battery here i'm gonna hook this on it should be nicely freshly charged um there it is unopened all right let me get the sticker off um i haven't had a distillate cartridge for a minute um i mean if you consider co2 cartridges distillate then i guess that's a dislike cartridge but yeah i haven't had this cartridge in a minute so let's see hopefully the headspace is [ __ ] minimum probably won't be uh that's a [ __ ] man dude look at that headspace that is just crazy i feel like i get raped every time and i buy from them at least it's not 60 dollars for the [ __ ] sauce guard i guess i mean but still 50 dollars for a dislike cartridge bro i like the color on it but grassroots y'all really gotta gotta do something with this and i see that you actually changed the plugs up here so i'm sure it's going to be yes a hell of a lot easier so thank you for thank you for changing the plugs up on these things because my last video uh maybe the last few videos of the the uh grassroots cart like this i had a hard time getting this little piece out so thank you for that but man that headspace that headspace is just craziness like come on guys all right my dog's gonna bark so i'm stopping and i'll get married the head space yeah i'm really disappointed in this head space here guys i mean you're spinning 50 bucks even at 45 for a half a gram it should be [ __ ] full you know what i mean that is that's just it's just ridiculous it should be full i'm out back guys i'm sorry i can't i can't help the dogs bark in it and stuff like that uh it is what it is right but yeah let's hook this guy up to the [ __ ] battery and uh give it a go first i'm gonna do a dry test like normal all right it has that it has that super lemon that like uh lemon sweet a taste to it that taste word just wouldn't come out of my mouth there so yeah here we go once again thank you shout out to mark and uh young crews thank you boys here we go cheers that is definitely tasty you could really taste the lemon in this one guys this is really tasty and i was i was really expecting the distillate um the distillate tastes like like straight up um i really wouldn't say like a burnt cartridge taste but most thistles kind of have that burnt cartridge taste at least in my opinion it does right and this one does not have that burnt cartridge taste right now and for being distilled that's really good like i said this is a pure [ __ ] sativa guy so this is a good one for the morning it's a good one to smoke when you want to get stuff done yard work uh on a job site whatever it is and you got to get some [ __ ] done this is a good one to have on deck like i said they're really convenient they're really uh you know sneaky you know what i mean like like the smell on it on this one the smell is going to be like like lemon hazy kind of a smell sent to it don't smell like weed at all so i really love it i love these things and with the ooze batter it's nice slick too so uh if you can make sure you guys go pick up one of these nice slick batteries i think they're like 12 bucks 17 like that and they got the adjustable uh things too so i'm actually going to turn it up a little bit at 3.8 and start at 3.3 i'm going 3.8 and give this one a a hit a little hotter and see if i could get a little more uh terpene taste out of it let's go cheers all right so i had more of the lemon taste and had a little earthy taste as well uh so i'm guessing the hotter you get the more terpenes you kind of bring more to taste out and distill the carts some cartridges are opposite the less heat you have the more taste you have uh yeah so for for being a distillate cartridge after hitting it two times i would definitely call this one a win like i said i'm not happy with the headspace and uh normally most grassroots cartridges have that headspace it just the [ __ ] is there i mean what can you do about it you know what i mean besides [ __ ] about it and hopefully they fixed it they fixed a little cap issue so that's cool but yeah man i'm um thank you grassroots this one isn't too bad for being adjusted to the cartridge the taste is good the effect is good as you tell me i feel like i'm just just chit chatting away my eyes definitely feel a little low but they're always [ __ ] low right uh because you know your boy turbo tom stays turkey stays medicated uh 99 of time besides when i'm at work now with this new job but yeah anyway uh mama i love you guys make sure you smash that like if you want to leave a donation you guys know in venmo uh smash that like share subscribe all that good stuff yourself up money's durbin poison grass root this with the cartridges you won't be disappointed i'm telling you for being desolate you won't be [ __ ] disappointed alright peace out", "rJMjnifYgts": "hey guys what's up my name is Mary I look like [ __ ] right now so I'm not really going to show myself but hello I'm here anyways so I'm going to be doing a quick little review on the King pen cartridges the strain one is trainwreck and let me just firstly say how disappointed I am I tried their cartridges before I didn't have that big of a problem with it I thought that the concentrate thought was in there was kind of thick that was kind of I guess a little indicator that there was something up with it but this the current time that I needed another one alright this is only one I could find so this is what I was dealing with and it was a lot worse than last time so mmm let me just show you I guess what this looks like as you can see instantly this looks just absolutely disgusting this is something that you clearly don't want to smoke let me focus game clothes do you see what is in there can you guys tell me what you think that is I mean this is clearly some type of like DIY cartridge or something that someone have [ __ ] me over on like Ivan like look at this color separation right here in this like air bubble that's neither floating up to the top may I tell you like this has been in the year for about nine hours and it has not moved let me flip it upside down nothing you can see it is slowly hardly moving at all but it is just so so alarming this is clearly my fault that I purchased this I got it for about $50 I don't know I'm just very upset about it I don't really know what is in there like I said if you guys know if you guys ever seen thing like this please tell me what you think this could possibly bleep like be cuz I'm actually scared too I smoked it a couple times clearly not that much because it's uh I didn't notice it until it got down to this bubble like how bad it was so yeah guys please be careful with the stuff you buy you never know what's really in it and that's the truth so yeah if you guys can just comment down below and let me know what you think what is in there cuz like I said clearly it's some some [ __ ] and I'm trying to figure it out yeah yeah", "etoR5ts-y-Q": "[Music] [Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video it is another reddit reaction on fake cartridges this one's number nine i actually thought this was 10 and i was going to say it was a milestone you know 10 of like this series but i'd like to thank you guys for making this series just well received and well well liked you know if you check my most recent videos like the most that the most views and most like likes and everything are the ones that are reddit reactions so you know i figured it when they're this easy to make i mention this all the time you know i'll do it for the people you know right after i did number eight some guy was like where's number nine uh well two weeks later here it is i'd like to mention that today is wednesday i'm going to be uploading it on thursday and also on friday i will be uploading a video and going live so you know there's a lot scheduled but i'm planning for this one to go on thursday and uh yeah let's get started with a hit so let me tell you five i like to mention that i did do this earlier in my car but then the footage got messed up and none of the audio saved so i'm stuck here like with the dilemma i was like about to edit that video and i already got all the like comments and stuff down that i usually do and uh turns out that the the second [ __ ] video file doesn't even have [ __ ] audio so but this is the pomelo clouds just going to take us some hits here hopefully you guys are smoking on that good stuff and uh like i said earlier i'd like to thank you guys for just making this series just i don't know it's just dope you know what i'm saying so you know the the stuff though just the love and support i've been i've been receiving over these the this series you know i'm saying this i'm truly grateful and uh yeah cheers let's take another hit just for safe measure you know what i'm saying but since this video is going out tomorrow let me know who you have for the fights you got the flyweight champions defending their titles i honestly think that they will defend their titles and there will not be no new champions but there will be good fights so cheers so there we go so usually with these videos i like to post like the previous comments or at least the best ones so here it is right now [Music] so [Music] all right we are now on the fake cartridges subreddit and let's just get started so we've got i just got this today and they're amazing has anyone ever tried hollow tubes haven't smoked in a weekend this hit me like two like a truck after two rips i still need to get this i know you guys have been requesting this i still need to try it uh i did i did notice something peculiar about this or very interesting is that this is cat 3 or c83 distillate which apparently is like one of the highest quality distillates you can get your hands on so be pretty interesting to like you know try that you know i'm very interested very interested the snap plugs back at it again okay so these we're still doing mario karts in 2020 i guess so [ __ ] it my cast on me for buying a black market and cat knows best you know what i'm saying choices booth cards is that a vessel so my last reaction video uh i think it was the wax pen subreddit i mistaken the puffco for the vessel they all look the same to me you know they look stick battery that you put your cartridge in you know oh wait the puffco is not actually that it's a wax pen but very similar and been looking i look for these for so long i know they're not a real brand but still better than a tank would so you guys know my opinion on choices i think they're very innovative in a way of them providing two strains in one product you know packaging uh but you know it's fake you know i'm saying like they're not a real brand but like i say i say this multiple times many many [ __ ] times on my videos that just because they're fake does not mean they're bad but that does not mean they could they're good you know what i'm saying so it's like it's like a 50 50 chance you know i'm saying and it's even i don't know it's just it's crazy it really is crazy and you're gambling with your health here and the chances and the probability is not good not in your not good in your turn in your terms you know what i'm saying so we got rip lungs see this is the dank vapes packaging right here look at this stuff what the [ __ ] oh tracks oh extracts glow extracts is it glow extracts another brand you guys have been asking me another brand is muhammed's all those brands are just questionable you know what i'm saying this brand i don't know 24k solutions and like to say like i don't know all brands okay even all legit brands i'm not gonna know of you know i'm not i don't study like legal brands from every [ __ ] legal state you know i'm not gonna know i'm not gonna be familiar with washington brands i'm not going to be familiar with oregon brands i'm not even familiar with all of california brands and i'm in california you know i'm saying so as far as fake cartridges go you know they're spawning like every [ __ ] two weeks so it's hard to like really keep count and uh i feel like these videos like someone asked me what's the use of these reaction videos this way i can kind of give you my opinion although you know sometimes like i said i don't know too much about the cartridge someone in the comments might know so this is just basically spreading information and it's just easier for me than just post processing putting all the stuff on the computer that way you know reacting is just so much easier you know it's like my dad says work smarter and harder you know what i'm saying so one of the better black market parts i've had what do you think what is this this is what they say trash there's no good street cars i like to mention that the people on reddit are hilarious i'll tell you that right now like they got they got a sense of humor i'll tell you that their sarcasm sense of humor is just you don't find that anywhere else well maybe in the youtube comment section but some most of that shit's toxic you know obviously uh you know what i'm talking about it's like the trolling and stuff but you know occasionally you do have some uh [ __ ] needle in the haystack comments you know what i'm saying so we got cbx cartridge highly recommended for anyone who gets their hand on this i don't know did they fake these because this is fake cartridges right i definitely gotta try this this guy's like lucky as [ __ ] this real so i don't know i'm not too familiar with stizzy i've only had them maybe like two or three years ago i would say they sent me a care package i did the the video at ben's house i remember and occasionally i'll try a friend's dizzy but yeah i'm not really familiar but everything looks right when it comes to you know the sticker with all the information is the sticker and not information that's printed on the box there's a scratch and sniff and it looks legit to me but at the end of the day i feel like stizzy is one of the most copyright like counterfeited products uh plug and play raw garden dizzy the big three you know what i'm saying so this spectrum this is friendly farms and their friendly farms is fake too so my club usually gets hurt from alcohol [Music] yeah i've never like i've been to a lot of dispensaries for a while now maybe like five six years no seven seven years of experience non uh when it's medical and recreational i've never received anything with a [ __ ] up box you know what i'm saying so fake right plug sent to me no batch number so i'm gonna say fake yeah you're probably right fake legit someone else posted this and my friend has helped as a couple and i'm trying to help i don't know about that one that looks cool though you know they have their own thing going a little stizzy battery i like to mention that uh some of you or someone mentioned that you know i've been receiving love on this subreddit in itself and uh for those of you who watch or are in that subreddit i'd like to thank you guys i didn't expect for you guys to talking about me on here you know honestly i just wanted to do a video it seemed like an interesting video idea and uh you know i'm saying i've been well received and i appreciate the [ __ ] out of it so if you guys are from there i truly appreciate it this is pretty much the best that you can get here on the streets here in new york city honeycomb clears do you guys think this is good quality oil or what and have you guys ever tried honeycomb i've been smoking these for about half or a year and a half never heard of honeycomb exactly but um i mean it looks fun looks decent looks like some stuff that the like with oils you really can't like tell you know based on the naked eye you know it was back then you know when we're getting flour and stuff in the street it's easier to tell you know you get like shitty looking like if if it looks like [ __ ] it probably is [ __ ] if it smells like [ __ ] or hay it's probably not good right but with oil there's just so many things you can mix with the oil to make it smell good and it's really hard to tell you know things to thicken it things to thin it things to just [ __ ] color it it's it's just it's really not worth the risk of your health you know what i'm saying meds are fake i bought one from a plug i had i never heard of the brand so i figured i might as well try it i knew it was fake after one year they don't even get you high if you ever see those or these don't bite so like i mentioned well i mentioned muhammad earlier i i really don't know too much about it but with all these black market or street brands you you just really can't take that [ __ ] risk you know it's i couldn't bring myself to it you know a lot of people are requesting me to try them or whatever but it's like i have only just i have all these dispensaries near me and the prices are are crazy crazy affordable and people are still like amazed that i'm able to get legit products for that cheap but i'm like there's no news for me to get any of these you know what i'm saying but we got my first real uh stizzy pot okay looks legit like i said i don't know too much about stizzy but i've tried some glow extracts as well um i don't know man just be careful we got krt this is this donald trump [ __ ] cart and [ __ ] man this might be the thumbnail that's some crazy [ __ ] so this is safe to smoke i don't know it's very clear you tell us it's like you've been smoking it oh my god like i said people on reddit they they have a sense of humor their sarcasm level is just top notch it's just yeah i just wanted to see what you all thought you can't tell based off just departures that could literally be anything in there like i said that's what i was saying there could literally literally be anything in there e-liquid [ __ ] paint thinner [ __ ] bleach [ __ ] nose you know what i'm saying when it's down to like a chemical or liquids and [ __ ] it's nearly impossible to tell you know what i'm saying we got himalayan eyes this looks like some liquor store [ __ ] oh yeah they're bad not even touch that and we got the alien slimes people are reaching nowadays alien slimes straight from cali hell no that [ __ ] was from baja california mexico i picked up this half gram for 40 dollars what do you all think is this it looks like a dope cartridge very disruptive if you have batteries like like the uh the dash vape or you know this couldn't even put that [ __ ] in there but i figured we're at the end of this video i'd like to thank you guys for just making this just an amazing series we're at nine now almost [ __ ] 10. you know what i'm saying i was planning on ending it at 10 but if you guys really really like this series you know what i'm saying like i'm more than willing to just make more for you but you know like like i said like when i just released eight some guy was already asking for nine you guys have been showing me love in the subreddit as well and i just appreciate the [ __ ] out of you guys everyone thank you guys for being a part of it and just making a very special special series you know what i'm saying and uh yeah subscribe like this video and i'll see you guys in the next one peace out [Music] you", "qrSDFZNt-to": "there is no denying the growing popularity of vaping pot in fact it's so popular the sales of marijuana oil cartridges used for vaping they've soared 400 percent between 2015-2016 so in one year quadrupled vaping has made marijuana use more discreet it's more convenient and it's free from the STONER stigma attached to smoking weed but and this is why we're talking about the jury's still out when it comes to the safety of vaping marijuana some studies suggest doing so may be toxic dr. sue Sisley the president of Scottsdale research institute they do conduct clinical trials on marijuana she joins us now on these findings and I'm glad we're talking about this because I will openly may I don't know about the three of you but the whole concept of vaping with cigarettes we understand but I am oblivious to the health consequences benefit whatever it may be when it comes to this so people think it's healthier but maybe not so fast you're right we don't have any data about the safety of using or vaping these marijuana oils and those cartridges up there are great exact Emma Colette when exposed to heat these chemicals can turn into formaldehyde so you talk about propylene glycol yes so you're more concerned about the additives then the marijuana oil itself exactly right yeah these chemical additives have never really been tested for safety the FDA has confirmed that they're safe for consumption but just because it's safe to eat doesn't mean that it's safe to heat up and inhale it's a different story and the fact is if there's all these flavoring chemicals in there as well you know these they try to add flavors to the cartridges to make them more palatable but what happens is that those flavoring chemicals have also never been tested and for heating this is part of the concern as well is that they look more glamorous so again it really reduces that stigma it makes it seem like it's a really fun kind of upscale thing to do right safe um and it popularizes it which i think is part of the problem right until we get more data I mean what's the take-home here for for people that are that are vaping on a regular basis the good thing is you have all kinds of other options now in these regulated markets we have the opportunity to vape natural flower so if you can find you know the the actual plant material that's not been grown with pesticides which is a common now because we have the the newly legalized states I'll have you know required lab testing so they don't allow products to the shelf with with pesticides or other chemicals but the problem we have is these older states you know the states like California Arizona Michigan that legalized marijuana years ago they did not require lab testing that's why it's so important that you're notifying your viewers about this issue because they can still find these vape cartridges so I just so I understand this if you're in say Colorado and you are a recreational marijuana user where you can go into a store in virtually any city and purchase it vaping there is in your opinion probably safer because they've actually tested the chemical additives that's right yeah and that's what we're trying to do with all these legal medical cannabis states is force them to lab test all of their products so that we can make sure to protect patient safety because you know the issue is that they could be picking up a product that does have these chemicals and and so I'm grateful that you're alerting your your viewers to this because they can avoid this they can pick up a vape cartridge that contains nothing but the what nature put in the plant now that would be the ideal situation pick up current and eventually these cartridges will not be bought by people when consumers get smart about this they'll bypass those products and eventually they'll go away I want to ask you this off the cuff because marijuana legalization is so new people who are naive to it maybe they go to one of these states where it's legal and like you know what I want to try it and they have the option between smoking marijuana the old-fashioned way they have edibles of a whole host of different types of edibles they now have vaping as an option in your opinion what would be the safest method well you touch on you know two big public health problems right are the overuse of edibles and the excessive vaping of these oils I mean the truth is these oils are hyper potent some of them contain 70 to 90 percent THC so people can easily get intoxicated on them so the key is always start low and go slow yeah - and that is buyer beware", "Pm_MC3QLa10": "[Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title it is another reaction to fake cartridges video this is part 10 we finally got to the double digits not sure if i'm gonna make any more after this but i know you guys have really been [ __ ] with it and you know from the bottom of my heart i just really like like to thank you guys you know what i'm saying for just the constant support and this will be the second video i upload today the other video will be um three blinkers in one breath and mind you that these reaction videos they're most of the time their current day or at least a day behind but when my regular uploaded videos you know like that blinkers video that was filmed like two weeks ago so you know i'm saying people are gonna ask me if i still have that cartridge from that video i don't it's long gone it's out of here you know i'm saying so i figured you know i just get that out of the way when i do reaction videos i try i tend to at least uh upload the same day or the day before or a day after so when people watch these videos they can still kind of see the most recent posts you know i'm saying uh but yeah let's start this video off with a [ __ ] hit and i got the plug and play i do have videos that i already edited but they're scheduled on a certain day but this is what i'm on right now that mango mang that's just the preview but i do have a dedicated video that will be coming out in a week or so um but yeah let's just not take a regular hit though you know what i'm saying let's add this dab cap or dab cap i'm sorry [ __ ] up but uh video will be on this as well because you know you know i had to like just make a a video on this but look at it look at what i'm able to do now cheers boys i actually don't have any like wax to dab off of my b nails uh wax pen so i'm on this but you know what i'm saying we're making it work cheers don't have too much left of it but you know i'm saying it's all good i thoroughly enjoyed this but you'll see the video too and take another and let's start this reaction video right so cheers [Music] oh oh yeah so with these videos i like to post the best comments from the previous video so let's go with that right now [Music] now let's get started so we got tea savage salty's on ig shake my head let's pray for all the lungs about to get these are those robes those are okay i know these are fake as [ __ ] but my homie is saying they're good and from michigan dispensaries what you all think i've never seen that brand uh let me know if you guys any of my you know subscribers from michigan let us know are these on the street are they sold in dispensaries you know because i mentioned this many times many many times you know i don't know all the carts from each state you know some of you guys are from michigan and you guys can like shed light you know i'm saying in the comments below because you know a lot of these brands are coming out of the woodworks you know left and right it's it's really hard to keep up with them even if you're in just one state it's hard to keep up with all the [ __ ] fake cartridges or the legit cartridges in your state you know what i'm saying so just be safe at the end of the day and uh you know i never claimed to be like an expert on anything these videos it's just me reacting to it never have i said that i was a car expert you know i just smoke a lot of them you know i'm saying at the end of the day i would say that i have some knowledge in it and you know you don't have to take my my uh my words you know what i'm saying like it's far from that you know i'm saying i'm not your parent i'm just making these because some people you know i'm saying they're not as aware and they're very gullible especially with high school students you know they're getting this from their their homey you know i'm saying and they probably think it's legit so it's good to make videos like this to spread awareness and like i said i am no car expert people are always commenting another guy that thinks he's an expert i've never even said that you know what i'm saying so at the end of the day i do have a pretty big following on youtube and i feel like not a lot of people go on reddit frequently you know i'm saying and there's a lot of valuable information that could translate or transfer into a video therefore you know get more exposure and you know people know more about like these certain cartridges that they should steer away from or certain cartridges that they should buy you know i'm saying because this is some valuable information this could possibly save someone's health you know what i'm saying and i've had comments say you know you saved me from smoking fake cartridges and all that stuff it's very rewarding in itself but in the at the end of the day i can't even monetize these videos you know i'm saying like there's no gain in it for me other than to just you know get views and spread awareness you know what i'm saying so that was a little random sorry posted about found out it's fake now i'm sketching now that one i've been hitting for about a month had one just like it already finished it might be fake too don't have a box anymore in my experience most of the time when i see in rove they're very light and yellowish that's a very dark amberish color what do you all think about this hoe know what brand that is let's see what they think fake no leave it known as a cart it's definitely not a guardian what thoughts filthy laboratory [Music] it's a booth card a pretty decent boot looks like a normal display that [ __ ] looks like the craft ship but it's crave it's a distillate i don't know if you guys seen my cure company it was a premium distillate in a ceramic cartridge or some [ __ ] i think that's what i titled it looks the same like that the oil color and the cartridge so glad i moved to a legal state first part in the audience tastes like kool-aid rape dream great dream sounds pretty fire you know i'm not a fan of blue treating but grape dream sounds delectable can be very salty when you post up the real [ __ ] is that the canadian uh warning label damn stuck up on me those buttons like blinkers man even with that bubbler that [ __ ] top off my dick with a butter knife and set myself on fire than take a single hit from any of that garbage damn now tell me why you would want to cut your pp off rather than take one hand over yeah he's right you know i would i would probably not say that yeah that's funny raw garden cartridge cloud chaser review fan got one on a fake damn anything vape you know i i have bathing ape shoes i bought them like 10 years ago no like 15 years ago they're they're silver ones i'll show you right so these are mine these are so old i mean the [ __ ] shit's cut peeling off but these are real i'm saying i've only worn these like maybe 30 times in my lifetime i actually uh so me and flynn or calamity as you may know uh uh he had the spider-man ones and i had those grey ones and he spent like 300 bucks on his and i remember the uh the packaging it came in mine's different mine's the regular ones mine's not the superhero ones because the superhero ones come in those like you know when you get uh action figures they come in that cardboard box on the back and then there's like a like a plastic thing over it you know but bathing bait come on [ __ ] all that [ __ ] never become your own [ __ ] stop stop it cheap blackberry and the black hole scout cookies black is black market but it's rather because i saw evans farts smacking on them honestly not disappointing okay so a lot of you have been telling me to try big chief and you guys know my opinion on big chief but if you got it and if you stand by it by all means you know what i'm saying like i said i'm not anyone's parent in any way this is just information that i'm spreading you don't have to take it you know what i'm saying so just be careful with the big cheese because at the end of the day gambling with your health like that like that is not good and i've heard good things about big sheep don't get me wrong i've heard many good things about big chief but i've heard bad things about it and you know what i'm saying i'm really i wouldn't take that risk you know i'm saying but you know that's just me uh stay big chief stay big chief and then this fool bought nine of them he really loved that blue dream though yeah be safe man be safe horse head man toxic turtle so like like i said with the big chiefs i heard they're actually going into the legal market now so maybe things could be looking up for them i i don't know myself so like just be careful [Music] what the [ __ ] is crooked that [ __ ] ben [ __ ] that i think this plug i mean [Music] i'm still recovering from those hits anyone ever heard of gg organics i have not no no that's a big cartridge wow when the phones are obviously happy to see it ff is active on here so i hope you know comment to let me know crossing my fingers that is real since i live in south carolina and simply can't go to the store to buy one south carolina is that south carolina i don't know that's a my family don't look like that but they're also bought on the street most definitely fake like most wait so yours is fakes but you're still hitting it appears to be fake i can't bear 500 but it doesn't look like any friendly farms car ipad and the liquid is way too light for care resin plus 90 percent would be extremely high for pure aggressiveness face paint hopefully she's okay i live in south carolina and that part has a rod that's way too big to do this sorry we didn't lose yeah that [ __ ] damn man be careful [ __ ] you doing they doing family friendly farms like that now appears to be fake what do you think about buddha bear look at them i've seen a video about the boxes but these backfire will last me up to two weeks what the [ __ ] who the bear [ __ ] don't know i don't know this one took a picture of it on a door handle that's funny real or fake cookies watch full video dude like i said they sell fake cookies bags at smoke shops now like they encourage dealers street dealers now at stores storefronts that's just crazy be safe out there guys like you don't even have to order it from dhgate or whatever the [ __ ] anymore you can get it from your [ __ ] smoke shop [ __ ] bags i've seen alien alien labs or whatever i've seen all that [ __ ] i was like what the [ __ ] so are big chiefs really fake or are they real see that is that is the age-old question you know what i'm saying flat thoughts [Music] oh since you guys since it's the 10th um fake cartridge videos i'm going to show you something let me show you something [Music] all right put this over here we're going to end it right here but uh just hopefully you guys are subscribed because i will be unboxing these and doing videos for these but this is just a preview and obviously i don't need that much i will be taking some of them though but i might possibly be giving some away in the future uh but we got a pipe thing it's gonna be dope another battery oh wait this pipe is for uh cartridges and then this is another battery i think and i'm gonna see how that is you know what i'm saying make videos for all these so hopefully you're subscribed and i could possibly give one or two of these away because you know what i'm saying i can't but obviously i have to do a video on them first but possibly this one this two battery one just two cards your battery one this one seems like uh i don't have to clean much after using this end and then this one is an eight bowl pipe possibly gonna give this away to someone that i know personally because you know what i'm saying this is dope actually i might keep this because there's eight bowls in it just for the tenth video you know i decided to show you guys a little preview of what's to come these are you're not gonna see videos for on these probably in like a week or two plus because like i said i do have a lot of videos that are scheduled i do have plug and play videos that are coming out like i have a lot of videos coming out but it's a shame that i can only upload one per day to get the most reach out of possible but this one's a special day i'm gonna upload this uh on sunday but yeah hopefully you did enjoy this 10th one um possibly the last one of this series i do sorry i do have uh other videos to make of i mean other reaction videos to finish but uh you know i don't know if you guys really want it i might make one but uh you know 10 i feel like is enough hopefully you did enjoy it and i'll see you guys in the next one peace out [Music] you", "10U46Jb7XvA": "[Music] hey what's up guys it's your boy Freddie and today I'm going to be reviewing a product so probably that you guys have been actually texting me about and but they've been asking me about this right here it's called red sky and of course you know it's a marijuana product weed whatever you want to call you but I'm not gonna lie to you guys I'm not really a big fan of vaping or you know anything of that nature I'm really just an old-school smoker you know give me a [ __ ] join or whatever not smoke it real quick this product like I have never seen like you see you see a help this is fancy you know like of course is here in Oklahoma that's why it has a little symbol right there it's pretty cute I like a cheap at all and this is the product that's in it that I will be reviewing this right here cost me about went a $50 honestly $50 you can get it for like 60 in some places if you find it for 50 then it's a deal if you get it for 45 and that's all those posts over so of course it has this little protective I don't know what you would call this but when you what you do just take it off course and with mine because you know some people do have the lien all this straight pin I wish I had it but this cost me $10 and I was like I'm not about to know you know I mean like smoke I can taste up to 99.99 of can of orders so it's very very high potent I will say that and that's what I like about these okay so the one main thing that I really really like about like making is the fact that you know when it comes to smoking like we bow or whatever you have this awful awful order and you just don't like it you know some people when you're walking down a store you can make a smell you they start judging you you know how people are whatever well with vaping this doesn't leave a big big big smelly they're down on again this is by Leafly it's kind of you know it's a little cheap I wish I had a different one but it's whatever so what I did is just put the little thing on there twist it on there pretty good and then you're gonna just stop it in there and this is just for the airflow and yeah let me just go ahead and take a rip and I'll let you guys know what I think and of course I already tried it honestly guys I mean I really really really enjoy it I'm not gonna lie to you guys that's one of the things about that I don't like about vaping it doesn't give me my like smoke cuz I'm used to smoking smoked smoked and this is just like a little smoke you know I'm saying of course you can hit it for a longer period of time hold it now you know for a longer time and the thing is like with these if you do that and you don't take the right hit bro like you're gonna be dying you're gonna be on the floor choking coughing your lungs out so it's really really important on how careful you are with these because of course it's not meant for everybody this is really really high ponen that's what I like I've been smoking for years and you're not smoking flour whatever it doesn't do it for me no more I need a little bit higher of concentration I'm [ __ ] it the only thing I do have a problem with the angle I cuz I told you guys that it's not the first time so yes so anyways so this is one thing that does kind of kind of rub me the wrong way but like when you bind these capsule even though they're like fifty sixty dollars you don't really use up all the product like this is an old one and I know it's a little dirty and all that has hair on it but you see how much it left over and like all this I could smoke I guess you could say but it just tastes so disgusting after you know being that like you still have a good amount but like it tastes nasty you know and so I had to just go ahead just get rid of it well that's it guys thank you so much for watching don't forget to like and comment down below and hit that Bell icon for instant

popcorn welcome back to my channel if you've been here already if you're new make sure you subscribe got a lot of different videos on the left and today we're gonna be talking about this little guy this is a live resin cartridge the strain is purple haze and it's from Prime Wellness this is the craziest card I've ever seen you guys it is not like a normal live resin cartridge when I posted this on my snapchat last night there was a lot of confusion from people that didn't know exactly what this is this is a live present our trajactory at this is pure live resin when you look close up to it you can actually see little PACA rocks in there like little diamonds floating around it's basically like the concentrate sugar in a cartridge like nice flavorful intense clouds every time it really tastes like a DAB and it also feels like it's AB you do not need to keep cheeping on this like you do some cartridges it goes a long way since the little rocks in there are so small they should be able to just be consumed right through those coils there might be a little bit left over smoking on my Paquito from cloud products I really like this battery it's a magnetic over ring bottom so you just screw a little overhang into your battery plug it in and you hit it I really just like how small and discreet it is I've had a lot of lab resin cartridges before that say liquid lab resin on it and it's like actually liquid it looks like the same consistency as a normal car but this is totally different this is like something I've never had before when it comes to price it wasn't too bad now when you buy a cartridge no matter what it's gonna be expensive when you're buying it legally to restore there's just a hefty price on in my state cards go for forty to seventy dollars and this one was fifty five so it's actually right in the middle of price I know a lot of people are like shocked at how much I pay for weed sometimes it is extensive but honestly like you have to pay for freedom and I'm an estate that just recently introduced the medical bill so the fact that I'm allowed to legally buy this and consume it like I'll pay the extra money I'm happy to help you'll [ __ ] for those of you who don't know what live resin is it's basically just a concentrate that has an extremely high terpene profile the way that it get to that terpene profile is from the way the plant is cured typically when weed is grown they cut it then they cure it in a room and then let it dry and then they process it with live resin once it's cut they instantly freeze it then that fresh version product gets processed and turned into live resin since the weeds frozen the turkeying profiles are way higher think about freezing a banana if you kept it frozen it wouldn't ripen in the freezer it would stay how it is when you froze it so in that drying and curing process there is some flavor lost in cannabis should still taste good but it just tastes better with live resin because it has all the terpenes yet try different battery freshen unboxing got a break it you know this is the poquito push it's basically the big brother of the poquito definitely larger but what's cool about this one it probably conceals your cartridge so there it's like what is this portable charger what the [ __ ] no it's my cartridge if you can watch my videos for a while you know I love my Terps which is why I'll address is definitely my favorite form of concentrate I just love the flavor you get it really can't be lied resin except if you're talking rosin which is super crazy I've heard of some people doing like rosin karts but they are not cheap and like I wouldn't even consider buying one at the price that they are but these lab resin karts are the [ __ ] move I really like how convenient cartridges are which is why I still buy them but I have to make sure they're high quality ones and I just wish that there was a higher standard for cartridges as a whole like I don't get why it's that rare for me to find sugar and a cartridge like I feel like that should be somewhat easy and common of people to do like ethos incarnate oh yeah the beginners that I didn't order crazy how many people were telling me to like take back this cartridge and like this isn't a normal cartridge and that should be concerned as I'm describing it as a languorous and cartridge I feel like a lot of people just thought it was distillate and honestly guys if your discipline cartridge looks like this do not smoke black resin can have a file you look to it but this look and not like they're two totally different concentrates honestly guys just to warn you no matter what company or buying it from no matter what brand it is if you're buying it this little cartridge it's probably shitty even if it's fire like every company I've ever heard of puts their bottom shelf product in their distillate no matter what it's going to be there trim and they're like worst looking nuts the reason for that is all this tool it looks the same when it process the matter what the butt looks like it's clear and tastes like nothing so then companies add terpenes if you're lucky to the distillate to make it taste better for your enjoyment sometimes they don't even have real turf there's so many random ghetto [ __ ] that's been added into cartridges and that's why all these people are dying because of shitty black-market cartridges like dude these hits are so amazing it tastes so good I hate to be the person to say that even the most top-shelf brands of distillate are shitty but ultimately they are even when I'm smoking into the cartridge I know it's the company's bottom to your product if they added into Italy it just has to be there's no way around it every company has trim every company has dirt product that they have and the company's mentality because they're trying to make money is let's turn it into distillate they like actually hit you in the chest like a bat and you have to really think of breath like and it hits you definitely going through this cart look at a little diamonds whoo if you ever get the opportunity to get ladders and cartridges that actually have some live resin in it go for it there's actually like a lot of liquid ladders and cartridges but this is even better this is like a whole nother step ahead I would love that this became the new standard for cartridges just because it's not only a pleasurable experience for like the casual smoker that likes cartridges but it's also an enjoyable experience for the avid smoker that since all the time because I know a lot of people that just like won't even hit cartridges because they just don't feel like they get them high the people that have known that there was something wrong with these that were just like no I'm not even hitting that because so many people have had shitty cartridges they hand me a cartridge and they're like yeah what do you think and it's just moving faster than a lava lamp and they're just like bro what did what are you doing or you just see the tank big box and they're like no it's legit my boy told me I'm like yeah you hit that over there I'll follow the ambulance for you if you got something out in this video hope you guys are smoking with net let me know what videos you want to see in the future make sure you follow me on snapchat and Instagram and everywhere else to see everything I'm doing I'm only supposed to on snapchat whatever new stuff I get first so especially if you live in PA and you want to see like what new fire stuff is around I'm on it like a [ __ ] so follow me on snapchat pipe underscore porn I'm at popcorn pretty much everywhere else things are about half the car that's impressive pitting about a hit that took I've been cheeping on this all day too I'm gonna be going up to Colorado next week so I'm gonna see how the lab present cartridges are out there pronounced you got a bunch of videos lined up around them out there let me know if there's anything you want to see probably me doing mostly vlogs so keep posting I can't do it I've never really been the big trick guy I'm gonna get to look cool to do babe tricks and I feel like I don't really look cool enough that just feel like a little nerd out there blowing little starfish or whatever they do thank you so much for watching click like if you enjoyed make sure you subscribe my name is Jeff peace [Music]", "iYW3J0AD9MM": "how much delta a should i take if you ever ask yourself that i'm going to be answering that question for you in this video maybe not fully because it really does like vary per person but i'm going to talk about in general like how much delta should you take for certain desired effects normally in my videos i'd be vaping a delta eight cars open but for this video i don't have any delta eight cards because i'm all out so so i'm gonna be vaping a clarity instead because it's like four in the morning and i want to go to sleep after this or shortly after this so it makes sense gotta have some trouble smoking the video you know can be a dang frank video with no smoke what i mean they can't because my shorts last tick tocks some thomas might have smoke in it because if i because if i blow clive they'll say on tick tock i'll get the video taken down if you're taking delta edibles i recommend starting off with 25 milligrams most daily gummies i see is typically dose at 25 milligrams so i would just assume if most companies dose these gummies at 25 milligrams it's probably four reasons probably because that's like a decent amount for like just a little show effect everyone racks yourself differently plus tolerance exists so 25 milligrams so one person may not be that much better another person might be a d like a good amount if you're worried that 25 milligrams may be a little bit too much for you then i recommend cutting that gummy in half or only in half of it and that would be like 12 and a half milligrams and you may not be feeling a whole lot because for me personally when i eat 25 milligrams i don't even feel a whole lot so i feel like if i ate half of that i really would be feeling a whole bunch but that's just me you know everyone is different for me personally i like to take around 50 milligrams every time i use silty edibles because for me that's definitely a decent amount because whenever i eat 50 milligrams of delicious bowls like i'm definitely feeling high like sometimes if i eat like 25 milligrams i mean of course i'm already feeling like a little high but like when you like 25 milligrams it may be like just like just a little high but like with 50 milligrams it's like i'm high you know like i don't know if you know what i mean but like i feel like you might when i get to higher doses just like a hush milligrams or over it that's when i'm like uh i i may fall asleep you know after just a couple hours because it would definitely make me like a little bit tired and just because i ate a hundred milligrams of delta thc does not mean i have to go to sleep and being that high may entice me to take a little nap and everything i'm saying about eyeballs can pretty much be applied to tinctures too i never used the delta e texture before i've used a cbd tincture before but i never used a delta a texture before but if you don't know what these tinctures are this is just all that you can put under your tongue it's like a little dropper that you like you take off the caps a little dropper right here put it under your tongue like sit there for like 30 seconds and you just swallow the rest of the older the distinctions just like this with delta a and i'm pretty sure will give you similar effects to those variables but in a quicker amount of time because since it's absorbed under your tongue it absorbs pretty quickly almost as quickly as you smoke and you're vaping it don't know if it's like just as fast or faster but pretty much around the same time frame it would be you know relatively fast and because i've never used a delta a tincture i can't fully say the effects would be the exact same as an edible but i would assume it'd be similar and i'm kind of curious how similar that is because adultery edible like the effects are pretty great and if i can get those effects in like minutes from just pruning under my tongue like [ __ ] i might have to copy in some delta a tinctures another common way to consume delta hc and i think the most common way to consume delta thc is through vapes those are just for vapes it's like it's kind of hard to speak on it's like most people don't even like care about the dosages of vapes it's just like they just take as many hits they want so you know they feel whatever they want to feel definitely going to be taking a few hits or sometimes most of the time a lot more than just a few hits but that's that's just me [Music] thanks to dang frank you now have some idea on how those you dealt athc and if that was beneficial or helpful to you or if you just enjoyed the video drop a like on it it will really help me out and it only takes two seconds and if you enjoyed this video then you'll probably enjoy this video right here so click it and go watch", "GGGW1xP3Uyg": "[Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video and if you couldn't tell from the title this is overall garden video I mean got the sweater on as well and I got the cartridge as well and yeah like the title says this is basically like a video just letting you know that there are fakes when it comes to raw garden it's it's so stupid in the cannabis industry once you've been like once you become like an established company people are just trying to like make money off your name they're trying to sell fake products under your name and basically with your heart the hard work that you put in for your company is just easily easily used for another person's gain you know and that shit's not the business you know and we're gonna be talking about the fakes when it comes to raw garden I have a few pictures that was taken from raw Gardens Instagram let me just pull them up right here so I'll also be putting it on the screen right here so you can get a better look of what I'm gonna be talking about and another thing I'd like to mention is that I guess my packaging is a newer packaging so it's not gonna be I don't know like here's a thing with raw garden and with other companies that do the same they're gonna constantly keep updating their packaging because like I said people are onto their [ __ ] and they're they're gonna just keep you know they're gonna keep at it so you just got so we're gonna bring it up right here and right off the bat you can see that the font is different and actually the color is a lot different especially the the font on here it says like I'll post on the screen don't worry but basically you could tell from the font and where the positioning of the flower is I guess so right here I got the tray clip good I bought this from flavors I'll post it right here I mean they have it on their website as Walt rock garden if you go it on raw garden the raw garden up farm you can actually search up all the dispensaries that have it there legally so I bought mine at flavors as you can see right here all that good stuff let me just so I'm guessing that they had to update this because they just pulled over the QR code but I mean you can go and check all these I actually don't have a QR code like scanner oh I just download one real quick so we'll see this [Music] basically running the same but the numbers are a little bit different I mean it says right here eighty one point zero three zero five and then this one's eighteen point eight six so I mean you gonna have to take my word for it I bought it at flavors I do not have the receipt on me but if you didn't see that video previous from this I showed the receipt in there exactly not bad just gotta be careful with the raw garden you should go on their Instagram also to basically check out how to tell the real from fakes you know this is it right here very very clear stuff and yeah I mean I've been hitting this already and it tastes very very good it does not taste like it's some fake [ __ ] you know and you guys know me I've been I've been getting raw gardener for years now and honestly like I would know if I had a fake [Music] good stuff this is the chill battery very very good battery for itself for what but like I said check out the photos or the pictures that rawr and put on their Instagram yeah it's a little bit different actually it says four right here it actually has the percentages right here as well but I guess they switched up the new sticker so yeah I don't know they just keep changing a [ __ ] every time so at the end of the day like unless they update those pictures it's gonna be hard to tell you know because they gotta keep switching their packaging because each time they [ __ ] get settled in these [ __ ] people just trying to fake the cartridge fake the packaging and all that stuff another thing that I've noticed from the pictures is that that ever should be on its own column or its own row so the other ones they actually has no additives ever in one single line so that's another that's like the biggest difference that I can notice just by you know looking and scanning at the box ooh and if you guys haven't seen Shaka x4 20 video on the subject already please check it out it's a dope video I posted it online community posts so if you guys haven't checked that out already you should really check it out does good content similar to that of mine so you know if I don't upload you know I'm saying you got more other content creators to go and check out them you know so shout out to you Shaka X 420 shout out to you your boy should be some cool collabs if that were to ever happen but yeah I'm gonna take one more hit and we're probably gonna end the video here be careful with the roll of iron cartridge you know I like when they was first brought into my attention that raw barn has fakes or had fakes and stuff I was really like hesitant like I was like no I'm gonna copy raw garden you know because like I don't know I just I just didn't think that they would and sitting here now knowing what we know like anything can be copied it's crazy so if you're an upcoming like cannabis company [ __ ] I don't even know how to like avoid this you know maybe like some really intricate into your kids ass packaging that is alike cost a lot so therefore they wouldn't buy it because it costs a lot I don't know who knows but I'm gonna take a million hit for you guys and we're gonna call it a video and uh I just had plumbing service at my house and one of the plumbers actually watches my videos so whoever you were I forgot your name but it's a small ass world and it's crazy like he came up and he was like it simplistic you me what you do videos so I was pretty interesting but yeah shout-out to you thanks for doing a good job on our plumbing you know I'm gonna take one more hit for you guys and we're probably gonna end the video here [Music] these are guys [Music] [Music] you", "_0NhC3W_nkc": "[Music] what's up guys is I burn thing 420 and I'm back with a new video today's videos not even a review guys I just wanted to give a little more talk about real and fake carts I'm just gonna show you a couple examples of the real carts I have or had and the fake carts I used to get from around these plugs and where I'm living at with all this [ __ ] they've been giving you up the only reason one coming back with this video guys is because I noticed a lot of y'all still to this day are smoking on these [ __ ] as carts and these people that are selling them to you are charging you what a real dispensaries cart will charge it will cost you you fell me so I just want to get the news out a little bit more so you I can feel really informed and know what this is doing let me show you something here's my my last rock garden cartridge I have and it's afternoon delight I'll be doing this review this weekend during paint giving holiday I'll be doing a review for this one but let me show you something this right here I know I keep bringing these out but this is what I this is what I used to smoke you see that back one that that [ __ ] a supreme is what I used to smoke look at this period banks cereal carts oh thank vapes like all this that I used to think was real but it was because they were so common in my area you found me like everybody had him everybody was having him they were easy to get and you know I did at some point when I went to LA last year I did bump its database and in a dispensary but let me tell you more about it so I kept or I kept getting cards from Cali I kept getting cards from Cali after and they're like you know cuz I ain't gonna lie when I was smoking think babe guys if you just heard me call from my cuff did not sound like this when I was smoking them cuz I was smoked so many my cough got really bad I would feel like I feel really congested and it would hurt like I wasn't able to take like the big bong rips I used to take that's all we're taking like little baby bong rips cuz my throat would hurt but I really never knew what was the reason for it until you know I started looking into these and so these dank bits a little bit morning that I'm finding out that a lot of people were just filling the [ __ ] up with a whole bunch of [ __ ] and I was still paying thirty five or thirty dollars a card like I ended up bumping into one of my homeboys that was selling these too and he told me that he was putting honey like actual honey that you would you'll probably eat with like something else or you used it to cook or something the honey he would use it and put it in the carts and fill him up with honey because the color of honey compares to the color of a real cart like a real THC distilling cart so he was selling people cards that did not even have any THC inside of them and was still selling and selling them for a profit of like thirty-five dollars a person everybody that was still come like I didn't even know I kept like ever since he told me I was thinking how the [ __ ] where people still going back and buying from you like they're not getting high they're not feeling any buds or any like any higher any medic at all but you're still going back to go buy your cartridges like what the [ __ ] so we all really gotta be careful with these cards cos you got really gotta be careful with these cards most of these cards we'll all these cards you see right here sadly to say yes I did smoke them looking at it now yes I do regret it but there's not much I can do it just stays how it is and I smoked them I smoked them that's it but I don't want any of y'all anybody that watches or anybody that has seen my dink babes reviews I'm telling you now just just don't even don't even watch him anymore I'm already thinking about just taking them down yes I know think babes gaming my views I know think babes blew me up a little bit but I'll feel like a piece of [ __ ] if I would just tell you that these were good for y'all that these religious and if I if I kept telling until this day right now if I would tell y'all that these were good that they're healthy that they're smokable that they're not dangerous I will feel like a piece of [ __ ] so I'm telling you right now that I care so much about you that I don't want you how to keep smoking these don't buy them your plug hits you up and tells you hey man I got the new thing vapes just delete his number delete his texts don't even ever hit him up again like any plugs that are carrying cartridges right now the most likely fate like I have right here look these are my dispensary codes this is a carvanha candy Jack from the Cavanaugh's sand editions look at these guys look at the quality of the packaging the quality of the packaging and look how it comes with all these seals and all these dates and manufactured dates and everything and explains you like the childproof seals and everything look at the boxing link it's such a strong box like there's no way you're just gonna open it and get your car and look at the cart you can't even see the car in these boxes and the way you do it is you you slide it open and the cartridge is right there I know it still has a little bit I tend to store my cartridges for later on when I don't have any because you know right here it tells me that I still have until four four of the ninth of 2020 so that means if I didn't finish it I can still go back these right here another hand when I would get these cards guys I would smoke a whole gram of these in less than a week like the whole cartridge from top to bottom and I would never understand like you know why it would go like it would it would be a week or less than a week probably like three days and it would be almost done like I would be right at the bottom of the coil but when I've been giving these dispensary players ahead I got the moon rock clear grapes gone bananas there's their old packaging I know they changed your packaging this is like tough like months old but that's why I still keep it because you know it was like one of the best ones I've had I've had to carve oh no sense this is the northern lights from kavana as well look at this same packaging same version look from a dispensary these cost me this half gram of Northern Lights cost me $35 with taxes and everything came out to like 40 something you know you got to pay the taxes in LA but why not like it's better than getting some bull ship in somebody you don't even know what the [ __ ] they put in it so you might as well just pay the extra money like I don't know why some people be like oh like you know I wouldn't pay that much money for a cart you're paying $40 or $35 or 20 finalist for some [ __ ] hot dog water like people say you don't even know what it is it could just be some CBD while you're over there vaping it cuz it's it's thick and like people say but we ended up finding out that some people were using thickeners I also had this qivana there's the Quranic apron I had somebody jump on my arm for my video and saw the video and told me that the kimono was fake I'm sorry to tell you the person who said that but it's not fake I got it from a dispensary these aren't these aren't even made anymore like like days they jumped onto these kimonos of sand and there's this other curve on I seen they start making these because they have problems I think with the with the cartridges themselves but this was a real cartridge I paid $35 for this at a dispensary and it did well until I cracked the cartridge you see look I still have half the cartridge right there it's been sitting in here for months it's been like it's been like 2 months now oh oh yeah around 2 months the oil has not changed color the oil hasn't changed color nor has the flavor I can't hit it right now because the the glass cracked and I just don't want to inhale if it has like glass particles inside the hole but it has it hasn't changed there's no there's no oil change it hasn't got darker there was somebody show me a cartridge and that [ __ ] was black the oil in the cartridge was black and they said they had lost it about two months ago and then found it and that's an oil look if y'all [ __ ] sat for two months you telling me your oil looks black that she literally looked like old car owner when you're supposed to get an oil change and they change the shin that [ __ ] falls out it literally look like the ashes discussed like and that's why I start thinking Beckett imagine all the [ __ ] that I was putting in my lungs which I'm not doing now because I'm never going back to this [ __ ] if you don't if you can't get real cartridges guys just did you saw some little handy dandy regular herb rolled it up like I just did right now and just smoke and get high like don't buy no [ __ ] cartridges and be careful if your plug hits you up and told you he has roam cartridges or he has dr. zodiac Moonrock carts or he even has a carvanha or what was this other brand damn I was thinking about if he has any dispensary card that you can think of that looks like this packaging or anything but does it have what I just showed you or if you didn't even get it from a dispensary don't buy it it's not real guys I've I've had the other plugs where I used to get my my dang swing you know they've hit me up before there were a whole you know I have whole carts don't buy them they have the whole carts friendly farms the green little boxes that come with the you know you press the two sides and you slide out the thing you get the cartridge don't buy them they're not real I've already seen Rove's cartridges if you do not have the QR code and it does not come with all the seals and they're the seals are different and it does not come with that your cartridge is not real if it's not from a dispensary guys your cartridge is not real wait if you don't have a car to get to a dispensary I definitely recommend to go on weed Maps and use the delivery service that song cushion Graham cuz you're Graham that's right that's where I got my which one was it my first song rock garden cartridges these older ones right here I ordered them from Costa gram they cost me these was like $40 a card for each 0.5 and then the the full gram was like $70 but the $40 already included the tax because they're supposed to be 35 but you don't have a car or you're not you don't have any vehicle to get around I definitely recommend to use cosa gram I think if you spend like a limit of like $75 you get your delivery for free and they don't take that long you take like about an hour and you know they get you like they give you the JIT [ __ ] you're not getting is not a company or a delivery service that sells you think vapes it's not a company that's gonna sell you this old moon rock packaging right here if you're getting moon rock karts and you're still getting this you're getting some [ __ ] this is not real no more it is real because this is the one I bought in Cali but there's so many people bullshitting packaging now that you don't even know what's what to tell you the truth and you just gotta be careful guys like I'm just giving you a little bit more explanation I noticed that there is still people reviewing ding vapes for some reason I don't know why they're not they haven't stopped they just just notice that this [ __ ] ain't real but if you're watching your videos and you're still getting think vapes I don't know what else to tell you just be careful be safe and I mean you know there's some people that say oh if it's getting you hard like you know why care but that's not the whole point you know you're supposed to be able to be medicated safe safely kind of like not risking your life for risking like something about it so that was just like my little explanation maybe I want to notice as well like if I pull this cartridge out look guys Khurana comes with a with a childproof steel at the bottom of the cartridge you have to press down and unscrew to actually be able to use the cartridge and I remember when when we are when we're going through a dink dink bait space I will tell you a lot about like the bottom of the cartridges would be like CA something came to find out a lot of cartridges do you see so don't even use like the CA or whatever their imprints are usually like see and like four numbers and then it says C cell and a whole bunch of em and that's about it but if you're like you know Dow that C sell [ __ ] I mean yeah most of them you see cells but all those little barcodes and all those cartridges that you would worry about like the CCA serial number anything that [ __ ] ain't real guys like most of these cards I've been getting like the UM like this one right here purple honeysuckle when you look at the raw garden cartridges if I have it in you know the music a rock garden card you just guys I'm gonna show you something there's serial number their serial number is for this one purple any simple is C 1 4 9 0 and then it says C so that's it no Kate for cushion or whatever brand I made this [ __ ] none of that and it comes with this little seal like this the company's brand is imprinted on the bottom of the cartridge right there come to the ceramic tip and very clean oil very goldish piss color looking oil but that's how it's supposed to because this is like resin and it never changes color hair doesn't get darker I haven't I've seen none of my cartridges that comfort dispensaries get darker over time my bad guys I just got a phone call but like I was saying if you're not getting any of these cartridges I'm showing you right now I know there's other companies that there are legal as well but we're not getting like

nice intake yo the flavors are right on the lemon head you kind of get the lemon head flavor on the exhale but on the inhale you don't really get no flavor it tastes kind of like the lemon peel to be real job but this one I'll have to rate a 7 out of 10 and definitely more of a body high type strain pretty tasty on the exhale besides like the lemon peel type vibe but I mean you still get the lemon flavor in there in general but yeah similar 10 body hi let me head right here by dancreep your boys gonna go ahead take another hit let's get gang [Music] getting nice and medicated right there yup I

pretty [ __ ] good excuse your boy I think that definitely caught up to me I'm definitely faded tarentines stone to the boner no y'all but yeah this mojito the flavor on this one is pretty good it hits you instantly I would say way quicker than the lemon head I would say this one hits almost immediately up definitely hits me in between the eyes definitely in the face I would have to rate this one a high almost 10 you know almost like a nine point seven five or nine point five almost a 10 this one's almost perfect Joe y'all can tell the liquids nice and thick right here let's go ahead take another [Music] the flavor is definitely really limey on the inhale definitely extremely like kind of tangy kind of sour on the exhale you definitely taste it in your mouth definitely a hard hitter this mojito right here I would definitely ready to nine point five out of ten it's pretty clean ding Fame seal your boys opinion king-chavez trash or gas I would have to say gas you know depending on who's making them who's filling them because they are being filled by somebody in your guys local area if you guys don't know you can buy the packaging online and stuff but huh make sure you guys check him out make sure you guys go ahead and like try to get to know who's actually filling these holes that's all I really got to say about them but I'd go ahead and rate these gasps right here my

y'all should boyfriend Travis hope you all enjoyed this video right here I'll see you on the next one peace", "EdoUnJuENuQ": "I'm gonna meet up with John Dawson from kung-fu dates to make some custom flavors of hash oil but the guests can consume music bait pens this is what we call soil tool rental product and what we're doing here is instead of taking oil and putting it on a hot nail and ad average or digitally dabbing write this is the wave of the future well let's make some vape pen cartridges dude let's do it awesome I can't wait to mix and terpenes so give you some blanks all right so this is my blank right here Glo empty cartridge right and this is called a removable center post and urine and screw the top you find your favorite oil people go with some raw okay great I just want to fill it up to this line right here right sure okay so looks like that's almost up to the line there don't want to add terpenes what flavor do you want to do so let's try Wi-Fi OG yeah sounds good to me so for that amount of wallet you need such a small money like a half of a micro drop okay gotcha I'll just put a timer all right okay so I've got that in there and yeah so I could feel from this arrange that that wall was pretty warm so that'll mix up quickly and sure I'm already getting a crazy amount of aroma Wow yeah that's incredible so now I stick my plunger stick your plunger in you kind of move it around you're gonna tear that shirt and just push it down it screws into the bottom there we go how many hits of cannabis are in one of these so you figure when we're at a half you're looking at 500 milligrams of THC now 500 milligrams in the cartridge for average everyday users that'll last a week let me say this real go sit with epic hits man I mean the flavor on this is uh it's pretty epic yeah but like I said we're travelling around the city where we're going to and from this is how everybody's going to be consuming thank you so much for showing me this up I think it's gonna be a great complement to the dinner party absolutely [Music]", "VthK8TnAf3s": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] your was popping is your boy mr. THC man I'm back at it with the banger now look you guys this is gonna be part of my cheapest versus most expensive series where I go to different dispensaries and I try out different products right so last time I tried out flower I got the cheapest eighth and the most expensive eight in Washington State today I'm in Las Vegas so I visited planet 13 which by the way if you're in Vegas and you have to choose between reef and planet 13 I highly recommend you go to Planet 13 I felt like it was a way better dispensary they had a lot more options it was a lot more open and you were able to really move around and look at everything they had I went down there and this time I decided that we're gonna be reviewing their cheapest versus the most expensive cartridge now before I show you the product I just want to give him an understanding of how much everything came up to okay so for the half gram the most expensive half gram it was priced at $100 before tax right now I bought let me see how many items you got we got one two three four or five how about five items here that I bought and it was $55 in taxes so let's just give it you know let's just say that every item had $10 tax to it right just the same so that means that that $100 half gram is now 110 dollars because of the tax not to mention that this half gram didn't come with the battery so I had to buy a 15 dollar battery now the fifteen dollar battery doesn't really have a ten dollar tax to it but just because I'm dividing up the total tax that I was charged for everything that I purchased I just thought that I would throw it in there and had another $10 to the battery to substitute for the tax so now we're at a twenty five dollar battery and that a hundred and ten dollar and a half gram so that puts us at a hundred and thirty five dollars in total tax included battery included cartridge included with a half gram which is really pricey if you ask me and for the cheapest cartridge it was fifty five dollars which was a disposable cart which means that he already came with the ability for you to use it you didn't have to buy the battery on this I was fifty five dollars but now adding the $10.00 tax that I might need to all the items it was about it $65 cartridge right there now this is pretty expensive this is a Las Vegas prices I know Cali would have been wait jeepers like never in my life have I paid over $100 or even a $100 bro for a half gram of distillate like what the hell because I'm pretty sure this is just a little right I don't think it doesn't say anything about like live resin oh it is live resin my bad so not for distillate its life resin but still man this is an expensive cartridge right here you guys so this is what the expensive one looks like right here it comes in this fancy box which I'll give it to them I mean at least they you know they message some of that money that they're charging for this product into the way that the box looks now I'm gonna break down for you guys the whole entire like THC percentage etc etc you know what I'm saying so so the THC percentage test at eighty two point 61% CBD is zero there's no that there's no CBD and there there's cbn 11.1 total terpene so the terpenes is actually like the flavor profile to your product right it's gonna determine how the product tastes and all these flavors and aromas also play a role into how the high hits you so the terpenes are actually really really important this has an eight point zero five percent terpene base which is really hot especially for a live resin so this is supposed to be really gas that's actually what you're paying for when you're buying this product you're paying to get more trips to get more flavor and more quality out of your high and since it's life present it's gonna give you a way better higher than the distillate I personally hate hitting distillate man like when I first started I just I didn't know any better so that's just what I would do but after trying like the life resident I was just like all bro you can't go back to just regular distillate now look I'm gonna open it up and show you guys what it looks like when you open it a little box in here you see that boom Wow what look at that you guys it's like sick now they have their logo right in the front it's crazy because the guy at the shop was like just smell it smell it oh my god it smells so good it just smells like strong strong concentrate now if we look at the back of the box once it opens up that's how it opens this is what the inside of the package looks like so they're talking about the philosophy provide only world-class cannabis products for customers our state-of-the-art production process utilizes THC distillate and cannabis derived terpenes coupled with premium hardware is simply unmatched this technology consistently delivers an unparalleled vaping experience where elegance meets perfection hmm okay so again 110 dollars right here after tax 15 dollars but since we divided the text evenly do all the five items that I purchased we're gonna add another ten dollars to it and just say that it was a 25 dollar battery after tax 135 dollars right here now I was told that this battery was already gonna be charged and ready to go I believe this is Planet Thirteen's like the branded batteries that they have there we're just gonna go ahead put this on here and take off this top rubber piece now before I go ahead and try this project I'm actually gonna open up the other product that we got and talk about the cheapest wax battery that we got so this is roots I got the cush mango and this one I have a believe all the testing for it I got all the testing right here so mango Kush oh you know what I'm so sorry on the last one oh I did tell you guys the TC percentage tripping I'm high you guys I'm already late alright so for the mango push this one tested really high in THC percentage so THC tested at ninety one point ninety seven percent again this is the cheap one this is the $55 sixty five dollar after tax cartridge right here okay um let me see CBG which I really don't know exactly what that cannabinoid is and test that twenty four point forty nine milligrams look at the terpene percentage though the terpene percentage is at one point zero three so basically this one has eight times the terpene profile than this one so this should make for a way more better quality experience and high but this was more convenient you know this one is just you open up the package right pure and simple you got everything right here in the back okay now when you open up the package this side right here is empty I don't know why but everything is on this side so you can just like use your finger to you know slide bad boy out there oh now it comes like this right you just pop this open and you're ready to go wow that feels good at the finger okay is this what is this what is this okay so roots this is I know these are disposable but why is this like this I don't think that you guys is logo this is basically their local you guys look look at this I don't think you guys just logo should be able to come off that easy I mean I'm pretty sure it wasn't meant to happen like that I'm gonna just put it back for sure it's meant to look like this but first impression mm-hmm you know but yeah guys here you have it to my left side we have planet 13s cheapest babe cartridge that's disposable so you'd have to worry about buying a battery and to my right side their most expensive premium $100 bro 110 after-tax 135 after we add everything up with the battery 65 over here on the Left what do you guys think would you spend over $100 on a oh you guys say [ __ ] that I'm spending $65 after tax out the door and now I don't got to worry about the battery I'm just don't listing away what I'm doing I don't know hey guys we're gonna have to taste them and really see how we feel about them we're gonna go ahead and start off with the roots all right let's go ahead and give this thing a shot now we're gonna try to complain I really want a good to flower look we're gonna do a blinker out of them and if we're gonna do like you know shorter pause and we'll do longer pulls we're kind of play with it a little bit to try to actually get the flavor flavor you know put it down for a second I was like what does it think don't blink Wow dude the room just got foggy my eyes bro my soul left my body okay that was strong that 91 percent THC dude it's different however though it reminded me of like when you hit a dirty Punk no offense I'm not trying to talk [ __ ] you know what I'm saying because wasn't that bad okay hitting a dirty bomb it's a lot worse but I still reminded me of just like when you take one of those rips that just leaves your throat oh you know tasting all nasty and [ __ ] I think that I got really hot too like the disposable battery it took a really long pull so I kept I was feeling like the mouthpiece getting hotter and hotter so maybe it was a little too hot for the product so now we're gonna try small pools medium pools and longer pools to get the flavor out of those but I need to get some water bro god damn alright so there's been a solid ten minutes right off the bad guys the flavors wasn't there dude like I'm sorry you guys can improve on the flavor you know what I didn't write this thing just to lit oh this is hash oil posh this side of that let me see and this is the mango cush I believe is what this train is called the other strain cold it's called medicine Chloe I believe is with this one here is called a hundred percent pure cannabis oil no additives no fillers no synthetic terpenes okay so maybe that's why it has that flavor because it doesn't have faked our booth actually it's obviously pretty good cuz fake Terps or [ __ ] you know you don't want a bunch of fake Terps like dis lis it's just a bunch of fake chirps but it says it's hash oil I don't know is that like I really don't know all right but this is its hat it's premium hash oil so the other one is like resin let's take a short poll and see I'm saying a couple straw polls and just see how like it tastes and stuff yeah I mean now that I hit it more the flavor isn't really what's off-putting I think it's more like it's just a very dry throat it tries to throw up quick we take like a medium part of it man but you know what gets you so bad bro I started to explain something to my go downstairs and now saying all kinds of things well always like do so look the highest am i high is no joke this is not this isn't for rookies right here bro still knock that ass out you know you guys $65 brothers a good bang for your buck for real now I want to take like a longer pool just to see at what point I feel like it's you know it's too much or it just makes your throat too dry or whatever yes definitely with like the bigger pools that it leaves like that burn and your throw afterwards you know maybe it's just like the temperature because I'm just something that longer you're hitting it the harder it's getting because it's just on and more consistent you know but median to small hits on this thing is to go to to enjoy and if you're just trying to get like super medicated I guess like you know a long a long rip will do it for you oh I am eight to 10 out of 10 I'm out of 10 for real and I was the cheapest one now we got you guys the medicine Chloe and the medicine is spelled like M EDI Zi it's full of fun easy all right I guess we gotta turn it off with the blinker just like we do the other one so cheers you guys Wow there's some of the cleanest I've ever tried I'm hurt I'm hurt I swear by the end of this video I'm being so sleepy hi guys so the flavor was phenomenal it's like when I coughed it didn't burn my throat so I kind of like thought it was like what what my throat didn't burn it tastes crazy I don't even know how to explain the taste it tastes like when you hit a really really clean joint with some good flour you know and you just hit it and you just tasting the flour me like damn this flowers clean and the flavors on point that was crazy yo what the hell damn I'm up to highs on for myself don't be like here babe you have this one it's kidding all right let's take a small rip a medium rip and then a long rip I'm really excited for the small ring because it tastes so good Wow you know it's crazy and I don't know why this is what it tastes like to me but it tastes like a lemon raspado which is like just Google that little hemming dress bad I'll put a picture you you know what I mean that's what it tastes like it is delicious who this TT is crazy I don't know I mean this is more for like the premium smokers you know I guess this is more for like the people that are like I need quality every single Hey which I understand yo cuz even though the THC percentage is lower you're still gonna get just as bait you just gotta hit it maybe a little bit more but every hit can it be more enjoyable so it comes out to like some people might rather be like buggy I don't really care if the taste isn't as a1 as long as it gets me more late which I'm not saying this one won't get you more loot to this because you just got a pie smoked out of this a little longer but the quality of it I mean you're ingesting into your body so I guess at the end of the day you gotta make decisions sometimes young but I think it would be worth paying a little extra to go for like quality but that's just my preference medium pool do like the flavors still consistent and it's crazy how these trips like play a role with your mouth huh pause right they like they don't dry your mouth up you know I feel like this is over the battery it would get hot really quick and dry my mouth up now I'm not sure if it's also because it's a disposable that the quality might be a little different on the battery I'm not sure you know but dowsers my experience I'm gonna take a long pull out of this I'm so baked I feel like all right it's gonna pull down this fire this fire so I would definitely say they're both really good products because at the end of the day even though this one doesn't have like the best flavor in the world it gets you so big I was like baked out of my mind earlier what this was like uncomfortably be do you know what I'm saying this one however gives you a better experience like it's more premium it's probably way better for your lungs and it just tastes better all around I feel like the high is really good and the more you hit it too higher you're gonna get so it's really up to you what you want but yeah your boy mr. THC if you guys enjoyed this video because you got smash that like button let me know what you guys want me to do next on this series cheapest vs. most expensive out", "JFpLUTbWBw8": "it's a fantastic day it's a good day to be alive come to think of it every day is a good day to be alive what's up guys back here for another [ __ ] video and today you guys already know you can tell from the title today i'm gonna do another informative informative video um if you guys clicked on this video it's probably because you guys have bought a select card and you guys are wondering is that thing real or is it fake because select had a lot of fake cards going on back in the day but that's back when that's back before they had live resin guys back in those days they only had distillate but now guys man they faking they faking the live resin now guys so today your boy is about to put them on blast because um i recently got a select from flower co and um my friend he recently got a select off the streets and he came up to me with it and it was pretty much the same box but totally different and you could just tell it was fake and i felt so bad for him so he let me borrow the he let me borrow it i got the cards and i'm going to show you guys the difference between the real and the fake you probably could kind of tell already from the box which one's real and which one's fake but um before we get into this guys hopefully you guys can hear me it's kind of windy today actually but um let's take a freaking bong ring boys all right guys so to start off off the back we're going to do a little close-up you feel me so you won't see my face for a little bit we're going to do a little close-up talking right quick so check it out all right off the back this is the real one and this is the fake one and let me tell you guys why this is real and this is fake off the bat you can tell it's fake by the colors all hybrids are in the orange box and it's a dark orange it's not this light orange you see the lettering the lettering it's in light orange um the name of the strain the thc content and the amount in there is a lighter orange as you can see also let me get a little closer this color scheme thing right here the yellow orange red pink purple the color scheme is lighter than the one on the rail box those are off jump ways that i knew as well as you could tell by the print they're using different fonts as you can see it's more bold up here is more popping on the real one more plain it's more pop it gives it more of a pop like it's coming out at you you'll see the difference okay and then another way you could tell guys is the real one off jump a real one's gonna have a bar code there you go barcode fake no barcode no nothing sealed up nicely it almost looks almost looks real another way you can figure out that this is fake guys is when you push it out to open see at the bottom you could see that it just pushes straight out when you push this button in on the side guys that i have my finger on right here that i'm tapping you can just push it down and then push the cart straight out you can see from the bottom the box comes straight out on a fake cart it's just a flat bottom you just pop that off this is a flat bottom this has no use maybe after you pop it off you can slide it but it has pretty much no use as you can see the difference the actual box pops out from the bottom when you rip this tape off another way i could tell guys is also from the bottom it's a hybrid and it says indica on the bottom it could obviously be an indica hybrid but it just says hybrid on there and if it doesn't end like a hybrid it will say indica hybrid like this one says sativa hybrid it's a dominant sativa because most you know strains you get these days they're hybrids so um usually they're either sativa dominant or indica dominant this one's a sativa dominant as you can see but this one it just says indica on the bottom and just lemon hash diesel so that kind of threw me off that new that that's what made me know that it was fake basically a lot of things did but also you could tell by the font the font is different as you can see it's a light orange color just the real one's dark orange feel me and the font is way different guys this is a fake just look at the font you know give it a couple seconds make sure it's hd now look at this font you could see that it's much different font but it's very similar they did a good job on it but some of the font stuff is different like the warning sign should be yellow there's no yellow and you can see that the font is different boom boom all right guys those are the ways you can see just by looking at the box this is the real one the tropicana and this is the fake one it's too light like you can tell it's fake guys come on now um another way you could tell is um by the actual oil you see the lemon hash diesel it's a little too light you feel me you can see how light it is i'll take it out the package later but your oil is going to want to be dark like this like the tropicana cookies you see that dark consistency you don't want that you don't or no you want that sorry guys you want that dark consistent you don't want the light consistency you see that it's too light you want that dark because live resin is usually darker but yeah let's pop this open but yeah guys you know there's a lot of you know fake carts out there that are easy for you to you know realize that they're fake because they're mario karts they they got fruity pebbles on it they're named after some kind of cereal brand you know different brands that are trying to entice younger people to buy it basically but you know select it's a little harder to um just drop the box it's a little harder to tell because you know they try to make it look as legit as possible and select is actually a real brand mario karts and those luigi's and all those other carts that are out there the skittles and stuff like that those aren't real brands nintendo is not gonna let you put theirs name on a car guys let's be real so we're gonna open up these boxes real quick there we go so it pops right out guys the real ones you can actually use the button and it pops right out there's no cardboard on top it's just like a plastic thing you have to cut off and then boom you got a cart the fake one as you can see you have to actually peel back a box you feel me you have to peel that back and actually open up the box [Music] then you can slide it out after you already open the box [Applause] the real one it's already out you can already push it out the fake one you have to rip open the actual box bam so like i said guys look at the oil the real one is going to be much darker than the fake one as you can see the fake ones are super light it looks like fake wax usually fake wax looks like this looks like this or clear this is real it's a live resin this looks like a distillate this looks like this joy with this live resin baby so make sure you know what you're getting guys the last test honestly the last test to know if your cart is real or fake is to taste it but i know for a fact that this one's fake as hell so i'm not gonna be hitting it let's inspect the cart see the fake one the fake one sorry guys i'm not even done yet the fake one as you can see has no stickers or nothing a real one is going to have a ca sticker on it my guys as you can see let's see what kind of cartridges they use the c cells look a little different too hopefully i can zoom it in good enough the c cells look different [Music] way different but they're both cell i guess but the writing on this c cell looks more bolder as you can see the writing on the real season looks way smaller but either way we know we know that yellow stuff is fake in that dark stuff this is the real this is the real deal guys fake real you can just look at it and see the difference ca dark color no ca light color looks like a disc joy all right so thank you guys for watching the video though guys more content to come i had to get you guys another fake card review and i felt like select one of the biggest like companies out there other

vape cartridge operation busted in Kenosha County investigators say they saved about a half a million and a half dollars of illegal drugs our Hanna Jewell is live with what's been found so far and how this all started with somebody's worried parents yes is this one of the largest drug operations you've had in Kenosha I don't think it was but of this type it's the largest we've ever had and as far as I know it's probably one of the largest in the country Kenosha County Sheriff David beth says the THC vape cartridge operation was being run out of a house and paddock Lake and a condo in Bristol Beth says they seized THC products with a street value of 1.5 million dollars focus was on making money sheriff Beth says two brothers 20 year old Tyler Huff Heinz and 23 year old Jacob hoppings are both facing multiple charges for illegal drug violations that's just the tip of the iceberg in this operation search warrant served at the residences last week led investigators to find more than 31,000 illegal THC vape cartridges almost 100 thousand unfilled cartridges and dozens of mason jars filled with THC oil imported from California they would take a syringe and they inject it into the cartridges the sheriff says they also found guns marijuana buds cocaine pills and $60,000 cash investigators say they may never have uncovered the covert business if it weren't for a couple of parents in Waukesha who tipped them off to a THC cartridge they found with their son I asked all parents out there this is a perfect opportunity and a friendly reminder to have that conversation with your kids six deaths have been blamed on vaping nationwide many more injuries federal investigators are stepping in here now to see if any of those cases are linked to this case here reporting live in Kenosha Hanna Jewell Fox 6 News", "2TfecBnTUZ8": "all right so we're gonna go over fake West Coast cure now the easiest way to tell if it's fake if it's not a pod it's fake now here's the distill it pod here's a live resin pod libraries and sauces on the bottom and it's gonna use this cure pod battery okay kind of looks similar to a Stasia pod and here's what the fakes look like so here's from our website and we'll have a link to that below all these cartridges all the cartridges are fake if you look on weed maps there's no cartridges for w-c-c it's all pods okay and here on DHgate they're selling the cartridge so basically as long as it's a pod you're good if it's a cartridge it's fake now here's some identifier things to look for on the pods because inevitably fake pods are gonna come out now the battery being faked there might not be much to get around that and the fake bad reason might just end up working too but when it comes to the pods you definitely don't want to be doing fake oil and my head THC in it but we don't know the quality the hardware that's being used even if the oil is good and that's one of the things about fake cartridges or you know that the counterfeit of brands that is important to know and here we'll look on some things on here so this is probably a store sticker right here you're gonna see this button on the side so this is like a you have to hold that button down in order to open the pod open the box that has the pot in it you're gonna see test results on the back and it's gonna have all those numbers on there and it's possible in certain areas maybe in Northern California they might have maybe a different sticker on the future I've seen that with select elite that's been real but these look pretty uniform for now so there may be some changing in the testing sticker but this is we're in July of 2020 and this is what it looks like and if you go to another area it's possible make sure make sure you had a registered store when you're buying them but it's possible testing stickers might look different in some areas and I've just seen that with the other carts so there's your logo that's what it looks like yeah so just to avoid the cartridges it's really that simple if you avoid all the WCC cartridges you're avoiding all the fakes because they don't make cartridges they just make pods and we'll also have a review coming up in these pods and down below we'll have a link to our guide on the fake WCC items but it's all really simple and that's it thanks for watching and y'all have a great week", "8lxTLkdniLc": "[Music] we

half two whole gram that oil is very clear this oil it looks very similar to likes a heavy hitter will also talk about heavy hitters the hardware that surplus users now on their carts is exactly the same hardware as heavy hitters used so it's a good high quality very low fell rate with a green metal top so the blackberry cush values okay good these have a lot of Turks in them this was the create by the driven that one this is also fairly good if you want to try that one have to smells good supposedly excited turbine they're great on price $50 for whole gram once again indica sativa hybrid that ones as flavor Bowl is like a malibu OG from heavy hitters who tried that one was a really good flavor it kind of reminds me of that a little bit i mean different taste but like kind of a sweet cush like that they're both google call it quality parts for a great price the surplus it looks like the clarity the oil is a little clear oil and the turbines clear - just slightly darker like a honey the surplus is like good like a cooking oil color as summer time gets here in your car try not to keep your carts or your brake pins and your car when it gets really hot because you might find out when you come back to my league is tendencies when it in excessive heat and cars have any before left and a new glove box or you know cup holder or something and it's a sitting in the Sun and Bates and it leaks it makes a big mess so you don't want that so keep storing up correctly and you won't have a problem and even at home a lot of times just take your card out while you're charging your battery just it keeps it from firing accidentally was charging and burning at her quell some don't have any problem with that but some do if you end up coming back to your cart and checking on it

these cartridges then any other ones out there I mean achieve they're real and they're no no boof carts you know I mean but yeah guys that's gonna wrap up this video subscribe", "HxbthKzHWNE": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title this is another fake cartridge video I recently came across this fake cartridge if you're curious about the title about fake cartridges evolving let me get to that first of all my homie my homie comes up to me and asked me if this cartridge was legit or not not like actually physically coming up to me but like through a facebook Messenger and this brand the so-called brand that he brings up is can i clear he tells me that the oil was slightly pinkish which was like a red flag right off the bat you know you never oil that's pinkish come on like bias the the branding question is called can you clear and why ice titled this video fake cartridges are evolving I mentioned it in my lives recently so if you guys were in there you probably know what I'm talking about but basically when you think about fake cartridges you think about think face or supreme babes and a really good indicator of them being fake is that they're using copyrighted material maybe like cartoon characters from a beloved cartoon series or smartcards you know taking a brand's name and running with it with their own thing you know basically taking the brands likeness and applying it to themselves anything with Bank faves just their names already give off a red flag but this one can a clear I'll post it right here it's probably the most out of all the fake cartridges the most legit looking and I'd like to mention that you can just tell by the box shape that is very similar to the box shape of dang babes mind you that the packaging outside appearance is different it's still the same box shape everything's still the same and before I start this any further I do not have never tried a canna clear I've never heard of canna clear some people probably would assume that maybe it's a real brand then then they kind of just you know the black market kind of just took their name and went with it in the into the black market that could be the case but as far as I know my friend came up to me with candy clear said it was pinkish oil and it was like 30 bucks okay first of all you know I told him go to the club you know you can get a cartridge from the club for $30 now you know I'll be it's not gonna be we're all guarding quality but it's still gonna be good I got the free cannabis cart for 2350 at one point you know I just want to make this video you know I know a lot of this debate related deaths have actually been slowing down now that coronavirus has been here I don't know if that's uh actually like you know goes together in any way but I'm pretty late with this because I went to read it and they said kind of clear six months ago was faked so this is something new to me like I said my friend brought it to me I was unaware of a brand like this existed I know there's other brands out there but I feel like this one is probably the most dangerous one because it's it looks [ __ ] legit you know so as I'd like to just make this video and you know tell you guys let you guys know beforehand like myself you know I'm know probably some of you guys have probably heard of this brand already but like I said I only heard about it just a few weeks ago and I figured some people are like me as well and don't know about this brand so it's good to spread awareness for those of you who tried canna clear let me know your opinions in the comments down below you know did you have a good experience where'd you get it from did you get it from the club but just be aware you know that there are fakes out there and that's the thing when it comes to fakes you know it really just makes you paranoid it's kind of like this whole coronavirus thing where you don't know who has it you know and I don't know it's just just be aware guys you know I'm not saying all of them are bad but like I said there's fakes out there what raw garden is kind of different because raw garden if you go to a legit Club you don't have to worry about fakes at all you know so I know some dispensaries have had fake cartridges and I would assume that those dispensaries were either non licensed dispensaries or that they were just ignorant to the fact that maybe they just bought stuff thinking that it was real you know but like I said can I clear it's crazy it's dangerous you know I'm saying can it clear it's a very dangerous fake black-market cartridge because like I said it is it looks legit you know it really does but like I said the box shape is still the same as database very same [ __ ] all you're gonna see pink oil I mean need i say more oh yes I'm gonna take a sip of this t be aware of can of clear guys okay so if you enjoyed the video or if this helped you in any way you know please feel free to like it if you want you know I'm saying but other than that have a nice day [Music]", "DKOD64GSTvE": "I got blueberry strawberry lemonade and sweet melon shot - Ronnie ray and his grandma I love you guys [Music] [Music] [Music] this is for educational purposes only don't watch this video olestra over 18 don't smoke marijuana less you're in a legal state or have a medical marijuana card I don't know my personal information I know what's up guys running right back at you so this video I got another card review for you guys if you guys like these like car reviews and like weaved reviews uh videos like tell me down below in the comments so I know to keep doing them otherwise I won't make these videos anymore and I'll put more effort and content that you guys might put out content that you guys do enjoy watching so yeah let me know down below in the comments if you guys like these or not so I know what to do but this video I actually got a cart review like I said in the beginning a detective a few different strains from this brand ego lapse Evo lab I got blueberry strawberry lemonade and sweet melon so we got a sweet melon blueberry and strawberry lemonade this is the one that we're gonna review today in this video so uh yeah if you guys want to see a review for these two stumbled on ball I'm gonna do that the reason why I actually like got three of these is because they had like a fire eyes do they actually have it thrown off the next week's that's [ __ ] dope um we buy two of these for $29 each so I'm down to like 60 bucks they give you a free one it's like a free car and a free battery with it so this is the battery I had to open the battery to charge it when I made this video so a PI two cards you get a free car and a free battery so 60 bucks you end up getting three carts and a battery that's the [ __ ] CEO in my opinion um yeah that's the [ __ ] crazy deal so though they're only half gram cards obviously so but still 60 bucks for 1500 milligrams and a battery I mean you can't really beat that and this from a dispensary so you know it's like I leave some quality [ __ ] you know what I'm saying so the battery I had to open it up so it looks just like a simple stick battery it comes in here this was the box this is evil lab a battery that's pretty much all that says it's evil evil a battery that's what it says that's pretty much all the box that and then um inside there it came with obviously the little stick battery no little stick battery the charger for it I think it's just a regular Android charger the charges with and then it comes with a little instruction paper so it says uh to charge the voltage this fate battery has three temperature settings low is the green green light medium is a blue light and then the high temperature is a red light to change the voltage setting click the button three times quickly quickly preheating your batteries key to a quality burn to preheat the battery turn the battery on by clicking five times then press the button two times quickly to preheat for 10 seconds the user can stop reheat in my press in one time so so I guess I supposed to picked up the temperature you want low medium or high obviously and then a preheat it and then hit it I don't know that others like pain if you guys see my last couple reviews I didn't have to preheat it you literally there's no button or not and you just [ __ ] hit it so that's a little bit different oh I see myself with that in a second so the bag that I opened this up already um even like all I did is just slides up you see that's all I did I didn't really take it out of there but this is a really [ __ ] sick packaging I can look at this for how cheap this [ __ ] like how for how cheap they're giving this away like three cards for 60 bucks for the battery they look [ __ ] fired - like watch so this is the packaging obviously yeah let me show you the packaging yeah so this is the package in one more time for you guys evil lab strawberry lemonade down there contains marijuana keep away from children contains 500 milligrams and I believe these are called the Cuomo colors that's what the Spencer you're saying if you see you right there I hope that label doesn't have any of my personal information I'm not supposed to be showing you guys on it hopefully it doesn't and if it does please don't [ __ ] me over but yeah so 500 milligrams it's also a hybrid are you guys that are interested it's a hybrid cart so it's called a chroma colors by evil lab that's the name of them and actually I think these cards are extracted with co2 like in the house some companies a cracker or you know like there's a million different ways to do it now but I believe that these are these are co2 yeah I believe it you co2 come correct but don't quote me on that but I'm almost 90% sure basically everything thirty years ago so I guess it's tested at 80 percent THC yeah there's test results for you guys very interested all that [ __ ] and then I'm what school you just slide it out of here and I think this is though I haven't seen anything past this part I just let it out of here and I seen this oh yeah so right here I saw yeah you see this college car or co2 card you see what I'm saying so yeah I'm pretty sure it's me I co2 here's the little bum tube inside a box I don't know what the [ __ ] we want to call that so you pull that out nothing really inside there it's empty now evil laugh this contains marijuana keep away from children basic [ __ ] then again up their CEO - like I was saying before so yeah all you guys see this if you guys want you can pause this and read it I'm not gonna eat the whole thing it's just kind of going over the brand some of the other products they have and just some information if you guys want you can read that I don't feel like reading the whole thing right now do you guys yeah posit if you want today I came with that that was inside the tube and then besides for that use the cart so every they called what chromo colors or something like that I said every flavor cart so the strawberry lemonade is lemonade is obviously yellow no I'm saying blueberry is a blue the sweet melon is I got green I think and like just all the different flavors on the cartridge in the color so I think that's just like a little cool thing they do a little small detail that you guys really though the actual oil itself is really really really clear actually but you guys can see that tell me your opinion down below in the comments also there was the bubble so you can see I think it is the oil for like 10 bucks a car basically I mean I'm not complaining and I know it's my dispensary not I mean so I has to be safe so tell me what you guys think down below in the comments for sure definitely interested in knowing what you guys think but um let's just pop this [ __ ] off throw it on my new battery and see what happens sorry so we got those two yellow things a lot this is what it looks like without that yellow tips so I'm not gonna lie um this looks pretty badass like all black battery with a few labs and black card with like whatever color accent flavor you got and not I'm saying this [ __ ] is actually pretty doh so I guess we're gonna go medium so it's about to click it five times real fast one two three four five all right so it's on I don't know if you've seen it blank so let me wanna so click it three times one blue that's green ice oh I'm blue I don't know if you've seen it we're on medium set medium temperature so now I'm preheating your battery is a key to a quality burn to preheat turn the battery on my collecting five times and press the button two times quickly to preheat for 10 seconds all right so I'm supposed to preheat it before I hit it I'm supposed to I don't know I never had a car was supposed to preheat it before you hit it but no one to the red light came on that's a preheating it's bubbling up now I hit it I got you so it preheats and nothing you hold so obviously that strips I don't think I hit it all the way I don't know what the [ __ ] it felt like um I wasn't getting like at all like the curette airflow it wasn't hitting correctly that should hit smooth as [ __ ] um I definitely got the long expansion it did oh I did like hurt my chest a little bit like that just do you know I'm saying I have a high tolerance if you guys didn't know by now but this is a far as Cara I can taste the lemonade a little bit I don't really taste the strawberry lemon at least the regular lemonade really else I'll call it not a strawberry lemonade and they're gonna call it strawberry lemonade I really do they should have put like a pink color on it not [ __ ] yellow strawberry lemonade is pink not yellow but just my thoughts and opinions um I first said I mean I liked it it was dope $10 card pretty much I'm not complaining at all the battery into this [ __ ] looks sticky ribs I'm not 10 bucks I'd buy if these are in stock for 10 bucks for like every I would keep on buying these forever because you can't go wrong with this [ __ ] his fire was [ __ ] 500 milligrams I only hit it once but it's 10 bucks for this what the [ __ ] is definitely weird there yeah so 10 bucks for this [ __ ] is definitely [ __ ] worth it in my opinion um if you guys ever see that the owner area Duncan Copp lemon hey if you guys ever tried this brand and we don't belong the comments what you guys think of it let's hit it again real quick [Music] so that tasted like it was a little bit burnt I thought it off you seen that but I'll put it back on the low temperature heads up on the medium temperature I feel like that was I tasted a little burn so let me hit it real quick on the low temperature your sleep affects it taste or anything at all you know I mean you guys are smoked off I didn't say in the beginning in this video I always [ __ ] forget I should have edited it and don't watch this video Lester 1821 whatever the legal age is in your state or you have any medical merit or you have your medical marijuana card like I do myself um yeah just gotta say that [ __ ] to cover my ass I can't get this channel to lead it don't want a copyright strike you know how it goes so yeah long time that's it I was a lot Betty whoo all right so definitely got a lot more flavor on that um definitely got the lemonade tastes a little bit more tasted I think that I don't know if I did something wrong when I preheated it or well I don't know because my first time using this battery I have to give it a little bit more used to it but it does taste a little bit burnt um but I think I might that might be my fault I think I did something wrong but for 60 bucks for three cards 1500 milligrams and a battery I'm not complaining at all that was a hundred percent where is it the cart I'm gonna give the cart the oil I'm gonna give me like a 3.5 out of 5 it's not the best oil if you guys you guys seen my own select elite premium court views um those half gram carts are so [ __ ] fired but they're 40 bucks a half-round recipes right here these are [ __ ] fire this is actually pineapple Express I dropped the review on this I'll go watch that video if you want these are actually 40 bucks for a [ __ ] half gram that's [ __ ] expensive but these are so [ __ ] fired for the basically like a little bit more than the price of one of those cards you could get three carts of these with a battery you know what I mean so just personally my opinion I like saving money I like ballin on a budget you know what I mean so I would go with these but the oil is in the best I'm had better like I just said I said 3.5 on the oil quality but the looks like the aesthetic just like everything about it like just the way the battery looks the way they carved like looking complements the battery that [ __ ] gets a 5 out of 5 a [ __ ] it's sexy [ __ ] like you got a mitt but it's it's not the worst though so it's like I'll definitely wait rather I'd pay 40 bucks for one of these before I pay 40 bucks for a [ __ ] Mario Kart or an exotic card [ __ ] those so yeah that's that's one thing never smoked one of those so yeah overall reading the battery before I rate I mean first impressions on the battery I like the battery a lot I don't know if it's the car or if it's the battery that has that little burnt taste like I'm talking about so I need to try the battery on a couple other cards first before I can really give it a full rating you wanna mean but I really like it I like the way it looks like oh saying and I like how it has that pre he said and how it has three different temperatures that shit's all badass that little like burnt taste I don't know if that's coming from the car or the batteries I need to figure that out so I don't know right now I'm gonna give the battery a 4 out of 5 but that's really because I've only hit it 4 times maybe maybe once I hit it a couple more times might give it a better or worse rating I don't know yet the evil labs oil overall I'm gonna give it a 4 out of 5 - because the oil wasn't the best quality yeah I've had way better quality [ __ ] before in the past I've said but compared to some of other exotic all that [ __ ] this is some stupid fire compared to that [ __ ] for the price too though like at least I got a for 60 bucks for three cards and a half I mean for 60 bucks for three cards and a battery that's a [ __ ] stupid steal like you can probably find that [ __ ] unless you are you're getting some fake [ __ ] you know I mean like at the dispensary you're not really fun and you always like that of us it's recreationally legal in your state but that's the reason why I'm [ __ ] with it I like the price point on it some people it's like for people that are ball on a budget that don't wanna I don't have 40 bucks you spend that I have you know I'm saying so I think that should Stoke and they just look sick you know what I mean how everyone's a different color and the pack you know they just for and for how cheap they are to all the small little details they have that shit's crazy but if you guys ever tried the brand like I said time we don't blow in the comments what you guys think if you guys haven't just putting a video I guess tell you how many of your opinions and if you guys actually like like these reviews I might not blow in the comments like I said so I know to keep doing them not I won't okay so if you guys want me to all review these other stream cards the blue baby and a sweet melon so I'll get these out of five um I guess massage for that if you guys like this video big thumbs up comment like subscribe do all that good [ __ ] follow me on my Instagram at all money read please I'm not the hit 10,000 subscribers really really want to hit 10k you don't have to do but it'd be [ __ ] greatly appreciated so I visage for that peace out", "42txbxXlkEw": "what is up lady Pham lady gang what is go chief I'm stony Birds my name is

Apollo grown this was in the last video so we're not gonna talk about um these carriages today cuz we never had these trains before the first one is black mamba and the second was a polyp I think we tried a polyp I so sorry I'm sorry for the lighting guy is really important in a car cuz there's another end car review we just wanted to make this quick little video for you guys before we forget and throw away the boxes and if you guys ever like come through with these carriages we're gonna give you guys a little review on them but this is the cartridge that I'll show you guys for your eyepiece hi chicks right there supreme this is not the courage and here this is the Apollo grown cartridge but we have it plugged into our mods already this is what it looks like as a clear tip oh so apparently they're from the car we just are from so we're apparently when we're in Cali we're supposed to buy these cartridges from my homie that we matter and beyond wonder man yeah that's what don't go out raves to meet homies from now you stay with forever cuz social media you always see what what they're doing in life updates on them and yeah we were supposed to buy these from my home in Cali 35 bucks for gram Courage's but you got them as half grams of course why is there a little bit more they made you got them for $30 so it's not that bad usually they're around 40 or 50 bucks here I'm pretty sure if you get this in the mainland it's probably 15 bucks for their half grams but the first one I got here is al canvas old G it's indica dominant and Adrian God huh tangy haze it's Teva I'm pretty sure that's what we got at the dispensary yeah we got the 710 one oh yeah I'm gonna try test tasted Adrian you wanna go first [Music] Chavez sample sample that kind of burnish but not really this reminds of all-first Graham Tories I think these kind of remind me of no one dispensaries on the cartridge yeah I'm pretty sure do you have these cards in the mainland so well I know there's a lot of Hawaii guys people peeps tolling birds out there that's following us and I know it's very very limited here in Hawaii so I just want to show you guys these Courage's and give you guys a review because we're pretty sure they had this a lot in the mainland and count yeah do they are do they feel like cheap cartridges or yeah they definitely do they do yeah you can honestly kind of difference between when you buy high-end versus like black market I don't know if we're black market like that should burn smoke the rope like really bad and it as a dispensary like that shit's super smooth oh yeah yeah I think right now my throat is like Bernie but the brass knuckles smooth again but I really like eight out of ten not that bad yeah it do a lot of smoke yeah we got a long car down in the past that oh my god yeah the one I have actually [ __ ] up on me because I was so bad dude I was saying at work and I have my courage it was me working like I literally had Google I was like Hawaiians a microchip battery where key are like the pen and I look at YouTube it and then like this guy said it might be your courageous another battery because my my battery's like fairly new and then so I fixed it so if you're in cartridge does it like come out you're gonna have to wiggle that middle part you can see like a rubber band in there and move away and don't work ready in there yeah so yeah

know but get these cans gonna end the video off here check all the links down below in the description follow us by for my amazon store we see you guys tomorrow in the next video peace [Music]", "0V9NRRk0FQA": "hi I'm Dan Hoff CEO of honey stick and today we're going to be talking about the fastest booming trend which is concealer vaporizers for cartridges so let's say you're on the market for a new concealer first of all I hope you stop by vape honey stay calm to check out our selection because this is something we've really been working on and making sure that we innovate but you're on the market you want to know what the differences are what the categories are and certain things that you can go through or buy to make sure that you made the right decision for the cartridges that you like to purchase so today we're going to take an in-depth tour and talk about the differences between our concealers to make sure that when you buy you buy the perfect concealer okay so there's two general categories to these concealers you have ones that have the cartridge exposed and ones that have the cartridge is completely hidden okay these are kind of a way that we like to separate the vaporizers and then there's differences in between them as well so let's start off with the ones that keep the cartridges concealed so you cannot see them now most of them that on the mark and all of ours are powered by magnet adapters so you can simply pull the cartridge out and you have a magnet adapter now why would somebody want a concealer like this well first of all it looks cool second of all it keeps your cartridge completely hidden for discretion and it also protects it from anything hitting it or possibly breaking it and they fit and sit up right in the pockets they're very very sleek in size so that they will easily fit into you know the small pockets for women's purses and the small pockets you know the upper pockets on your jeans like so it stays completely head so first thing for people is size I want to show you guys this is our beekeeper model this is our latest elf model and this is our phantom model so everybody knows what a sip we're not promoting combustion here guys we are vape company but just to show you how size pairs up everybody knows what a standard sized Bic lighter with the size is so to take our beekeeper for example they're actually very close in terms of width as well as height for the body now we move on to our elf and then last our phantom so let's start off with our first model the beekeeper the beekeeper is a very good unit it was actually our first model that we launched in this concealer category and it has been our historical best seller it comes with a magnet adapter simply drop in the cartridges and it actually has a push button operation so you would push and hold this button throughout the time that you inhale and you also click it five times on five times off this unit produces about 20 watts of power and it also has a a 300 milli amp hour battery so it's gonna last longer than the standard batteries and it's also give you more consistent power it has a micro USB charge also that you can just plug right into the side port right there and then when you get a new cartridge you can just take the Magna DAP tur which if you lose it try not to lose it you can purchase more online you just screw it onto your cartridge and you drop it in so then once you hear a click and your unit is on your rate of vape so well we get from a lot of people is that there's a variety of cartridges that are on the market and some of them are wider than others so some people are concerned to order a concealer unit before you know when they have their cartridge to make sure it's gonna fit so what we're gonna do here is we're going to measure the openings so that you know how wide our concealers are before you make the order so let's start off with the opening of beaky so in millimeters this is exactly a 10 millimeter opening so if your cartridges are wider than 10 millimeters in diameter they will be too wide to use for the beekeeper now let's move on to the elf we just launched this unit a couple weeks ago it's something that we're really excited about it's available in five colors give you a brief little look the only one missing from our display is the white one which we do have available what makes itself unique is that it's not only a little bit smaller than the beekeeper it has a little bit more capacity so it has 350 milliamp hours so the battery's gonna last a hair longer it has a really nice texture to it I would compare it to if anybody has ever had a like an iPod Nano it has this very um the this this kind of grippy thick metal you just feel the quality when it's in your hand you know completely solid unit what makes it unique is that it is completely buttonless so it's Auto draw so people who really you know have been holding on to those pull through batteries this is the evolution the next step and the way that the technology is is you are just gonna get effortless draws on this vaporizer it is gonna be much smoother much more powerful and it's gonna fit a larger variety of cartridges that those auto draw batteries cannot fire now the kick comes already with a glass really high performance ceramic cartridge with a ceramic mouthpiece so if you are not buying prefilled tanks and actually filling them then this is like an awesome tank to get started with and all you do to get this thing fired up is its there's no clicking anything you just put your Magna adapter onto your cartridge drop it in and inhale and you will see it light up very smooth very good unit charge with a microUSB and again it's a little bit smaller which brings us to our ultra premium unit which is the Phantom the Phantom is not only for cartridges it actually comes with a wax concentrates adapter which is dual quartz it is our largest unit in terms of size comparison but it also has a thousand milliamp hour batteries so it's gonna laugh last about two and a half times what all the other concealers do now one unique function that this unit has is when you flip it open it has a squeeze action trigger so you just squeeze it to inhale and it also has four different temperatures that allows you to dial in to what intensity and flavor you really prefer and it ranges from 3.4 all the way to 4 volts it has a advanced preheat function and the unit also comes with two magnets a longer one as well as a shorter one so all different sizes of cartridges you can have the perfect magnet for it so your mouthpiece collar will sit flush and you will keep your cartridge completely concealed now what the beekeeper and elf do have in common is they both have windows so you don't have to excavate your cartridge to see what level it's at but they do do a good job of keeping it concealed so that is really a rundown of these cartridges now let's get into the width testing for these two these we've made slightly bigger as the cartridges have gotten bigger it is a hair under 11 millimeters we're getting 10.9 so most cartridges are labeled 11 millimeters are actually a hair under 10 point 9 so this will fit a standard 11 millimeter cartridges which actually does fit into the wider category now let's check out the phantom the Phantom has a slightly skinnier opening than the elf and it comes in at ten point eight five millimeters so that will give you a good idea if you already have a cartridge that you are buying prescribed to to make sure that the unit that you get will fit so to recap the beekeeper has a ten millimeter opening the elf has an 11 millimeter opening and the phantom has a ten point eight millimeter opening that will drop cartridges in but let's say you have an extremely wide cartridge what do you do well that brings us to our second category of concealers which is found in our mini max line you can check out a really cool in depth review done by a high-rise on our mini max to show you just how powerful it is which is our smart tip key fob vaporizer it's very light and with this line what we want to do is make them very light concealable and make sure that these units fit onto your keychain this these units both have 500 milliamp powered batteries the difference is this one has a variable voltage which is our minimax Pro and this one is a single voltage but it automatically adjusts to whatever cartridge you put on it it has a smart chip in it this unit the minimax Pro has three different voltage settings with a maximum output of four volts the minimax what you would do is when you purchase your cartridge it could be as wide as you want all you do is you take it and you screw it into the 510 threaded opening and it's similar to a standard battery but it is a little bit smaller much lighter and you have a charging port right here so the cartridge is exposed when you have a cartridge on it however it is a device that is designed to look like a key fob or a clicker which does make it discrete when you don't have the cartridge attached to it then we have our minimax Pro which looks a lot like a key fob and it even has a deluxe keyring holder there and a micro USB but what's cool about is you don't see the cartridge because it's actually folded in there and then you push this button at the top to flip it open and what we did is just to show this flip open as we use one of the widest cartridges on the market which is a Liberty variable air flow model and it actually does fit in here so this will fit cartridges and we'll check the size of this opening right here this will fit 11.6 millimeter cartridges so the mini max pro and the mini max if you're buying extremely wide cartridges are your best bets to making sure that your vape pen is gonna deliver power concealability and stealth-like options if they're very wide if you buy skinnier cartridges or are filling your own cartridges

again everybody this is Ken eccentric films and I'm excited to be back at you with another legal cartridge review here in Illinois as you can see this is a Lemon Drop disposable point three Gramm yes point three gram cartridge I didn't know they made them that small but you know it's a nice little disposable cart the first disposable I've tried here in Illinois and you can see it's in the matter line of products by far McCann which is a cultivator here in Illinois now in this instance I believe Lemon Drop is not a strain specific flavor but instead it's a kind of laboratory infused combination of terpenes for a sort of confectionery flavor I would say that flavor is definitely achieved it's got a delicious almost like that lemon head candy if you've ever tried those tastes just like that to me kind of a harsh hit but I really enjoy the high from it it very much that put me in a cerebral headspace where I was like really productive for at least felt like being productive and didn't want to sit still very sativa dominant in terms of the high for me but yeah great taste like I said a little bit of a harsh hit but I do like the disposable convenience and as you can see in this video here no external battery or charging required you just draw and you get a nice hit out of it and this stuff is good medicine now let's talk about price so pretty much the standard recreational price I'm seeing after-tax there's a little bit of give or take to this depending on where you're located in Illinois but pretty much to give in to price after-tax for these point three gram disposable carts is about 50 bucks which is an unbelievably horrible deal I can get full Graham carts for considerably cheaper that are just top-shelf quality from the black market which is the case for most people I know but nevertheless why I'm here is to document this legal cannabis situation here in Illinois and it's gonna continue to progress hopefully and hopefully prices will be less [ __ ] but hopefully this painted a good picture if you're interested in picking up this cart I would recommend it for it's great lemon confectionery flavor and its really awesome sativa dominant productivity inducing buzz that's all I got to say today though guys stay safe", "rjba4nR5NF4": "YouTube what up we have a grassroots pound cake disposable pen point three grams cannabinoids its THC

it's it I see you know this why I put it so you know if you could mind it ignore it it's all good so before if y'all haven't checked out my videos uh I like to do we sit and game and sometimes it like that going to check out my videos you know boom about of being two times one to you give me like just go check them out real quick ain't nothing big but pretty much before I start off my videos I like to take it here easy so let's just get one get here real quick still hit a little bit so these are my kind of like mmm am I gonna say five cuz I really know how many I have but i'ma just kind of list it so most of the time people can't really tell if their cards are fake or not you know most of the time people are like oh I think oh yeah my cards real my card real you can't talk [ __ ] about my card like I'm sorry if he's really had does not come straight strictly from the shop it's most likely fake but I'm gonna give you guys a little bit of tips a little bit of like you know a little bit of background maybe this will help you so first off this is tip number one any exotic and any banks are 90% fake exotic especially especially exotic some Danks are real I mean I've missed them I've seen somebody Oh take that back my thought you guys but I've seen a couple of real banks and I've seen a couple I've seen a couple real days I've seen a couple real of real exotics I mean you know there's not I'm not gonna say they're all fake but most of your time those are the carts you gonna stay away from especially cuz I know they they're super cheap you get one for five bucks you won for six bucks and people are sending for $25 like people are making money you could really really just like look these I know I sold off a lot I've been selling out I literally just read I just read up on a little funny piece about it being quick to make my money Katie's never go wrong Kathy's so that's my tip number one n\u00e8 Azadi any banks and really reason why I say DS is because sometimes they're not always dark sometimes you don't get them dark first off if you ever see a dookied art cart throw it away throw that [ __ ] away that is fake don't even smoke it just cuz you've got it just don't do it you're gonna thank me tells me you're gonna wake up ooh wheezing in your throat you're gonna hard to breathe you know it's just it's just trust me it's not worth it you're gonna feel sick you're gonna throw up you're gonna have the shit's you know everything is it's just not worth that's all I personally don't like like my team member to it so at the bottom of each of cart he usually has these little look okay I wish I could show you guys pretty much if you look at the bottom of your cart it's a pretty much say C so like C so that pretty much is like the factory that they come from it's pretty much that's like like where a lot of carts no I guess you know that's just like what my [ __ ] has been feeding me and he says that he where he gets him from he gets him from this premises factory where he like his plug is he's super big super blah blah blah so boom that's pretty much my tip number two they said have some type of engraving at the bottom or some type of like something something like you could even see like with this one like it literally says charity babes you know it says C so has like the factory card number under it you know it has it has it like you

bubble is not moving I promise you you see that you see I know it's kind of blurry but that bubble is not moving I just hit I just took a nice little fat hit and I that bubble is not moving that's how you know it's a good car is when you heat it up and it doesn't start sluicing around alright and it doesn't do that hard my tip number four would happened to be watch where it comes from so well I'm I've sewed it up before carrot ease boom it comes with a little seal my other video if you ever see that move our meds if you ever if you know the car you know if you check that out those cards um

know just whatever I'll see y'all it", "7jTt35Eu8cE": "[Music] [Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title it is another Ursa cartridge you know I'm very very happy although I did spend a little bit more than expected because I went to fee knows and it's not authentic and authentic when they had it it was $40 but at vinos it's 55 but I really wanted a cartridge so I was like [ __ ] it I'll pay $15 extra and you see if I'm not lying right here I mean the tax is killing me it was the one it's $41 without the tax but then it was like 54 with it so yeah definitely one of the the pricier cartridges I'm actually at a park right now I'm actually gonna hit a few in the car just because you know it's easier that way and then I'm gonna walk around and hit the cartridge - just to prove that I'm in a [ __ ] park okay guys [ __ ] Park [ __ ] park brother so let's just open this thing like I mean you guys already know the deal bros like I've opened this not this one but okay okay [Music] I didn't want to [ __ ] pull out the cap you know accidentally Laureus yes dope or battery I do have my dad's mate and do not have the magnetic piece on it so I'm just gonna use the side where it's cruising cheers boys who that wasn't even a blinker right this is a blueberry muffin in oh my god that show taste a pretty [ __ ] [Music] god damn holy moly cracker mode damn [Music] this is probably the the smoothest cartridge I've hit in a while if not the best or the smoothest the taste is there everything is there like I liked when I tried the first person car it was from the homie Chiron and he had ice cream cake which is a strain I didn't really enjoy as much this one has a sweeter taste of more blueberry taste obviously it's blueberry muffins and it's actually quite pleasant what [ __ ] it was just like [ __ ] the stats let's just read this [ __ ] right here so we got THC we're coming in at seventy two point one two percent it was packaged and manufactured on the channel on January 30th 2020 Best Buy same date but 2021 one gram all that good stuff not gonna lie it [ __ ] this [ __ ] hits so what I am going to do now pocket this water you can see right here guys very nice Park it's very nice outside I was actually getting pretty [ __ ] hot in that car I'm not gonna lie I want to go over there and smoke you see that boys that little stairway [ __ ] let's go there no one there and we can take some hits on the way to boys that's the thing about cartridges you could bring that [ __ ] anywhere and take a fat hit and especially with a cart like this that hits like a [ __ ] dab rig like it's a game-changer it really is you know like I honestly can't stress that enough you know cartridges are getting better just like technology with the mores I believe it's Moore's law where technology gets better every six months and technology is in everything when it comes to vapes computer it's anything you know I'm saying like the hits aren't that fat right now what you just take off let me see if I can take you about that the camera turned off let me see if I can take a little a little fatter hit damn well yeah I wanted to do I wanted to get my own orsa you know after Chiron showed me his I was just like damn there's just no way I cannot just try this muhfuckas and not buy my own it did take some a long time I would say about a month or something but it's only because Ursa hasn't been that much available in my area and it's probably something I won't buy that much often you know because $55 for a gram cartridge I know it's a it's average in LA but in Modesto that's not average that's a above average so you know I do enjoy it though I really really do enjoy it very very tasty you get the whole terpene profile of the of the strain which is good you know I wanna take one more hit for you guys I'm probably gonna call it a video hopefully you guys enjoyed it you and also in the car you could actually see the smoke thickened out here it's very spread out it's not a really good visual representation of actually how much I'm hitting but these are fat hits don't get me wrong but other than that hopefully you guys enjoyed this video I really enjoyed hitting this to be honest and making this video it's a nice [ __ ] day outside and hopefully you're having a good day so far peace out expecting company but that's ok cos don't try to prove", "kU-ZCOrrbck": "hey folks eric here whatever guys whatever me and do you folks want to know about this lemon skunk uh delta a cart i got from

whatever guys shop.com or whatever guys shop at gmail.com or the whatever guy handyman at gmail.com all right so moving on from that as you guys know today's tuesday man and we're moving up on this ship man shipband's coming up march 27th um and like i said we're still not 100 sure other than the fact that we know that the end consumer is going to have an issue getting uh stuff shipped to them through usps fedex or the postal service however we do know that the one way to get around uh this shipman is to be a business have a business license and get wholesale accounts now for you folks out there that don't know you can easily apply for an ein with the irs which is totally free and get a business license or you know if you've got these convenience stores or these vape shops around your area and you'd like you know go ahead and combat this uh vape band from the get-go because really the vape band was designed to it was not designed to touch delphi really what it was designed to do was to touch these e-cigs and it was designed to put the onus on store owners to check um the ids of these guys coming in and getting these uh vape products but with way the way they wrote the law of and they stuck this in the pork of the stimulus bill the first year um but the way they wrote the law it actually extends out and touches everything bait and so as of march 27th um i've heard march 27th april first april 26th but on this channel we're going to talk about march 27th is the closest day uh you know uh you know prepare for the worst and hope for the best um but the the but the deal is that uh you guys can get those get those people to get wholesale accounts contact me at 334-830-8151.com let them get a wholesale account uh if they've never had deltae products in their store before they will not have created any bad habits by starting you know to get stuff that we've reviewed on this channel uh but if they have delta e products in their store um we'll send them out free samples man and they'll find out that what we're talking about on this channel is the real deal and they'll also find out that the prices are much better than what they're getting from those distributors off the truck you take that m a smoke shop or any of these uh just you know these local convenience stores around here they're all dealing with the same distributor and they all have basically the same stuff in their shop and that distributor doesn't know anything about delta a doesn't know anything about cbd he's just looking for a mass-produced product and that comes at a price of low quality and and you take uh you know her down there at the mma smoke shop she's got everything that she ever got off those watered-down delta a carts off that distributor truck for 35.99 and you got and she's got delta farms and blue moon in there for 34.99 personally it wouldn't matter to me if it was 45.99 because like i said before the purpose of this channel is to find the best lda products we can and um obviously you know my goal is to hope you know is the hope that you guys don't make the same mistakes i can if you see a you know you see me do a review on here it's a crappy product hopefully you guys will gravitate towards something that's a little bit better so moving on from that um uh talking about just letting you guys know i got a letter from a guy today or uh talking on youtube and he's over in the uk and we're talking back and forth and he's trying to get some stuff shipped over to him and he asked about this notice to law enforcement now there's a lot of companies out there that are putting this notice to law enforcement in their um in their packages when they send out usually it's a piece of paper as you can see blue moon is a little bit of cardboard box but basically this is just a letter to the law enforcement man letting them know uh that this is a hemp product that is you know it's totally legal totally illegal to buy over the counter to any at any business in the united states i think there's a couple states that actually do regulate it like three or four five i believe but either way uh the majority of the states this is this is legal all the way around and i think those states that that don't have it in theirs because they haven't figured out how to regulate it yet but the fact of the matter is the 2018 farm bill makes delta eight a hemp derived product totally 100 federally legal okay and that's what this card is and for you folks out there that are riding around and i'm guilty of this too i've been preaching this for quite a while you should have one of these in each one of your vehicles just throw in the glove box um you can throw in your centerpiece or whatever the case is uh the ones that are pieces of paper like i said you go to my my site which is whatever guy shop.com and you can go down into the blog and you can find notice law enforcement and download that okay and just keep a copy of that in your wallet man you know if you're walking around hanging out and then it's let's be honest man if i was to roll up on you and you were smoking you know you were vaping this or you were hitting on any of this stuff here i know for a fact you know i at least in my mind i think that you were smoking pot so let's be honest man in a cool way now and again this might not save you you know i understand this is a market employee but you know but why not try it you know what i mean it may save you some trouble at least at least add a little bit of uh uh you know genuine uh what you're telling is the truth when they pull you over and they get this we had a guy out in north carolina got pulled over for and i haven't still heard the end of this yet by the way but i got a message from a guy over north carolina he gets pulled over and because his delta farm stuff smelled like him and they thought it was uh and they thought it was weed they took it from him and they were going to test it for uh i guess stealth and i thc i'm assuming that he's okay because it obviously doesn't have any delta knight toc in it um but the fact of the matter is it smells like it it looks like it and you and it does the same effect some of the same effects as delta intc so why wouldn't it be that you know so if you're a cop you know i get it but if you're if you're the end consumer man it's just cool man to keep one of these in your car man unless you just be safe all the way around okay so as you guys know i'm in my location down here in pine hill alabama and we've been remodeling this place for a while uh running up on a deadline for myself you know basically and like i told you guys before i've been doing a lot of handyman work i've run hand-in-hand business and i had gotten away from that recently uh more or less you know doing stuff online but as i need the money to remodel this store here i've been doing um some handyman work and so the lady missed carol smith over in sweetwater alabama that i've been working for the last couple weeks and i've got some other work scattered around but she's she's my main focus of work i've been looking for some kitchen cabinets for a couple weeks and um i had went to meridian and bought some kitchen cabinets and they just weren't the right ones uh you know i ended up keeping them from my store but the fact that matters i ended up running over montgomery alabama um uh yesterday to pick up uh a drawer set and another kitchen cabinet for her and was at home depot over on east boulevard in montgomery alabama now when i left when i went in there i had a certain amount of money that i was going to spend and i ended up getting the drawer cabinet for like half off because it had this little damage on it that i could easily fix and so i was you know when i walked out i was kind of stoked i actually had extra money in my pocket the first thing i did was got on and started looking for vape shops so the first place i went to i ended up stopping at the only place i ended up stopping at because i got what i needed right there at haiti's apes uh this place is a heavy base in montgomery alabama so 505026 vaughan road uh the phone number is 334-398-8691 i went in there yesterday and i walked in and immediately somebody said hey welcome to heady vapes and so i got in there and i got to talking around and there was two guys in there one was a big round one was a skinnier guy i could tell that the bigger guy was really not happy with me asking questions that i was asking i was probably asking some questions uh that were probably more designed for the owner i just felt like you know with them being working in the store that they might have a little bit more knowledge on it i think the one question i asked him was if he had because they actually have their own brand of delta eight in that place and i was really interested in that because as i said before we're talking about this talking about this vape man and all that coming up you know i wanted to go in and see if they had some flowers and vapes and stuff like that and i actually ran across some good stuff um so i was asking you know what i asked you was i said if you had one product to put forward and you know you know for your brand what would it be and of course the guy was a little bit edgy about it now the other guy he was extremely knowledgeable um both of them were knowledgeable but one guy i think was a little bit uh you know and i recognize it because i get it myself had a little bit of anxiety about me asking me questions and stuff like that i get it man because i'm in the same boat that's why i do the uh delta eight in the first place and i apologize for that um but the other guy uh actually the first guy that i talked about that i thought maybe was getting a little anxious to be asking questions he introduced me uh to their flower they have they have their own flower at uh heady vapes in montgomery alabama uh this one is the kush and then one is the diesel they don't have it's not og kush it's just kush and diesel what i did was they had one gram uh cups like this for ten dollars a piece and i was able to pick each of those out because that's what he recommended and then the other guy apparently he might be the vapor out of the group he was the one that recommended this earthy now uh vape card lemon skunk vape card that i got so uh this is their brand and heady vapes now i don't know if they have any um wholesale accounts i don't know if they're doing any mail order i know they don't have a website um i i go into these stores and i wonder you know what they're thinking about you know it's almost like they're trying to hide a secret but the fact you know how you know secrets bro i mean here's the deal if you had the secret to cancer why would you hide it i mean my but i you know everybody thinks i got like corn on the market you know you could fill these up in your own backyard if that's what you wanted to do folks so you're not cornering a mark or anything like that um he's got this guy here man this earthy now is a really good product um there's a couple issues about it that i don't know i can tell obviously that he's not trying to ship these out he's probably not trying to get any further than what he's got going on that little corner market he's got going on um i i you know i think that's a a mistake you know by not branching out that's just my opinion um i'm gonna try to contact this guy later on and find out if he's got wholesale accounts any type of affiliate things going on like that because uh really what i found was between these two flowers um these are really good flowers that they've got infused with delta a okay and this car is a really good car before i even made it to the interstate i knew i had a good car uh as you can see it doesn't have any coas on it okay but um i'll read the back of it here and it says this is earthy now and it contains less than point three percent delta intc uh for ages 21 and over do not operate machine or vehicle while under the influence of this product consult a healthcare professional before using effects of hemp products may be delayed after two hours do not consume more than once every 12 hours this product may cause you to fail a drug test that's true all right and if you look on the side it's uh says lemon skunk and then the other side is from cannabinoid rich organic hemp but again we don't have any uh any milligrams of delta atc we don't have any coas on or anything like that um there's uh really nothing else on here it's just uh in a sense i mean other than the fact that this is a really [ __ ] good car this almost looks like a garbage like a like a gas station car like if i had walked into a gas station and saw this i wouldn't buy this at all um so the packaging is a little innocuous um i think that they could probably do something better with the packaging but that doesn't take away from what's inside this car man this is a really really good card the only down draw the cart that i saw um that i as you can see i've used i'll put my hand up behind it it's got a nice gold tint you can see there's quite a bit out of it because i've been vaping on it um you know all day yesterday or at least half a day yesterday and you know and some this morning um and i've baked on it pretty good uh it's a really viscous liquid as you can hold it over i'll hold it over where you guys can see um and obviously it's not moving hand behind it again this is a white ceramic tip with a metal core uh these look like viton seals um and this and let me tell you something the little skunk's got like a like a earthy lemon um almost like like a pine tree set next to a lemon tree like like if you could combine those smells that you know that that taste um that aftertaste that's what you get with this lemon scum but the effects man the effects are like way way up there um these are this is right up there with delta farms right after a blue moon um as a matter of fact um i would i would suggest to say that this is probably a little bit you know as far as like delta farms goes you know they got that totally they kind of lend towards more the the earthy flavors and then you got blue moon that kind of lends towards more the the discrete buyer this one sits slam in the middle because you got the earthy and the in the in the like fruity added together in in one cart and um this the effects are extremely good the only down draw that i saw this card is like after a while when i vape on it it did the tube in the middle did get a little bit restricted but it never got stopped up so and i'm going to continue to vape this and obviously when we do the weekly app on saturday maybe i'll have a little bit more information if i get down towards the end of the car that's had any issues or anything like that that's kind of what the weekly rap is designed for this is a really good car like i said you guys can contact teddy vapes over at 5026 vaughn road in montgomery alabama the phone number is 334-398-8691 you guys give him a call see what he's about and have that and tell that dude that you saw his uh reviews on the whatever channel on the whatever guy and that you want a code of whatever to get some percentage off when you walk in that store down there or possibly um get to the point like i said i've got this uh cush in this diesel and i will tell you this the kush is a really good because i've already had some of my pipe i'll do a review on it either tomorrow the next day these are really good delta eight infused uh hip flower i told you before um i this i probably rank this right up there with the moon rocks of uh hometown heroes so we'll talk about that later on i didn't open up the um the diesel yet but uh because i wanted to wait for the end but i couldn't wait to do the kush um so i'll talk to you guys about that probably tomorrow hey folks it's tuesday it's whatever guys signing off i told you guys to stick around the end i'll tell you how you can win yourself a brand new bottle of these nasa softgels from over at leafystock.com don't forget you can go to leafystock.com use code whatever to get these soft drills all day long for 20 off but borrowing that on cinco de mayo uh we're going to be giving away one of these nasa delta eight soft gels 15 milligram there's 50 in a bottle beginners ray on may 5th hey folks whatever got signed off because whatever me i hope everybody's having a great week see ya", "Bq2J1yIaXBU": "so lately I've been really into these um THC C cell cartridges and there's been a lot of stuff on the news saying that a lot of people are breeding these things in getting permanent lung damage from these bootleg bunk carts you know so I'm here to kind of show you what a bootleg cart does look like these cards fit 8510 battery you know you guys are big bite and you're in your seaso palms that's a distillate right there when I got in there anyways these ones

show you Brendan this hood right here you see all the markings on it I've tested no pesticides but what's funny is this company doesn't even make these things anymore they went out of business for being you know testing too high in pesticides and and all sorts of stuff so they don't even make these anymore I'm hearing and only people that are making these are filling them up with fake distillates or whatever and making people real real sick because these are the ones my god they totally fake the strawberry cop hybrid that's a sativa it's not a hybrid it's more strong see so I thought oh it's California tested you know California that's some [ __ ] dude um the only way to really make sure you're not getting bunk carts like this is to just go to a dispensary and buy them and and even even then it's still kind of a fee like let's say look I got these buddy's brands that I've been smoking all these things are pretty good yeah you can see that they've been you know even with those markings right there you wouldn't even be able to trust it you know but uh it's but hey it's on there look there's the percent look here's a navy x1 this one co2 but you can see right there I've tested this one right here I got for all the cheap right there the dispensary here locally and kind of iffy what you can see has the real testing on it and whatnot these ones on the other hand they don't they have the steel you think it'd be real but you can get them on you know th Gator I like expressing and get these and fill them up with whatever you really want and people would think you know did you go to the clubs and you think the packaging is sick looks like one of those high-end ones look it's even got thick thick oil in there but bogus is [ __ ] did I never seems kind of expensive you're like Oh for the price of one of these I can pick up a [ __ ] grip of these but it's any worth it dude any worth getting sick dude you know just pay the money for it whatever you know you have a good hook up and good for you but you know just stick to these or get yourself a Carta just quit [ __ ] with the distillates altogether but you know I like my [ __ ] on the go too so it's whatever dude she so don't smoke this [ __ ] let me better look so you could see what they look like you know here's a bogus one not open here the one that I did open I kind of [ __ ] you fake-ass a

you're on your money back at you so this video I have another cartridge reveal for you guys but first off um I'm sure you guys like all heard about like cartridges getting like um like banned in certain states by now and like people getting lung infections and passing away and like all that [ __ ] you know what I mean so I'm just like really curious to know what you guys think about like all that it's like go look everything going on I'm curious to know what you guys think so tell me down below in the comments um yeah I'm thinking about making a video on the subject myself so if you guys want to see a video about me talking about that subject let me know down below in the comments - yeah I don't know that whole thing is just like crazy and I just wanna know what you guys think about it so but besides from that um in this video I don't know if you guys seen it or not but we're going to be reviewing the branch rib and I've actually reviewed this brand before if this [ __ ] wants to focus please yes I've actually as it upside down yeah it was is I've actually reviewed this program before in the past but I never reviewed the own the live resinous aren't sauce cards so this is sounds fire especially this rate I got too banana and cream sauce like banana and cream sauce I don't know that just [ __ ] so inspired at least to me in my opinion like banana and cream sauce live resin sounds fired as [ __ ] so if you guys seen that it's tested at seventy seven point four percent THC 0.5 percent CBD at point almost point one for almost one percent CBD m5 CBN which I'm not going to familiar what that is if you guys want to educate me it is leave a comment down below some will be some over the packaging real quick I won't waste too much time on there and then we'll open this up we'll get to smokin on it if you guys want to see more reviews I like these pods let me know down below in the comments too cuz I was looking spots heavy um besides from now yeah just happened to the snow so the front of it is said um this drip or nose extracts live present sauce bait my huge five point eight milligrams suppose that happen yeah it's a half a gram part I don't know why this [ __ ] doesn't want to focus right now there we go just so yeah drip see it decide take this little sticker off its own on this time she said some premium quality drip extracts and oils so a pretty simple packaging you know to me the bad just has like the Arizona's Department with that department of health warning all that good [ __ ] that they had to put on it you know what I mean test results on this side you know I mean then you just pull it out like this yeah you just slide it out like that and you're greeted with this so the first look at the cart of bananas and cream sauce [ __ ] this sounds fire to me my opinion so I'm expecting this to taste like so yeah I'm expecting this to taste like [ __ ] amazing so the way I usually like your beauty videos is I'll go over like the packaging to the packaging I'll give this like I actually like to like this package in a lot is just like not too much details on the package and like about the actual oil itself not I mean if you guys want to you can go on the website and check them out whether it's social medias right there yeah go check them out if you guys want you definitely have some fireeyes products but I wish you just have a little bit more information about the oil one strain on the packaging but besides from that it's I like it on least like I like how they put like the shiny letters and I don't know it's just it's dope you know I mean I don't know I just like the package inside if it had more details on like more information about the the strain and like just the oil itself I'll probably give it a 5 out of 5 but but since it's like lack and the information a little bit I'm gonna give it like a four and a half out of five but that's just like the packaging so the packaging pretty dope next we're gonna go over like that the looks of the oil slick not like that the quality or taste there anything you're gonna mean just the [ __ ] the looks of it so this is looking a little dark but not bad I mean it could be like that the comodoro could be big but it could be due to like this trillion it could be good like how they like so many [ __ ] fact there's there's so many different variables I could look at that the color the oil but the clarity in like the assistance these like the most important or everything else this oil is a little bit art I'm not gonna lie the consistency is like fire though this it's not movement as you guys see the clarity is there I mean you can see straight through it there's no like fogginess or no white [ __ ] in it you know I mean so that's a good sign they mean it someone it's medical dispensary I buy [ __ ] drip products all the I know about fishes I know this is some fire I know it's not no like booty juice in here so I mean it's just I never seen like the oil this dark or that's interested but like I said I never had those sauce cards before but besides from that [ __ ] to my battery um there's gonna be smoking this off of um my CB v so yeah we're gonna be smoking this carted off my CBD 5-pin there were nice too nothing to send me this pin and actually [ __ ] with her a lot whatever pens I had yeah um the looks of the war dodo one out of five the consistency is definitely there like I mean like this [ __ ] is like no I'm moving at all that's not for have an hourglass right there the clarity is there you can see it like how dark the oil is you can see straight through you know what I mean but I don't know I'm not really liking the color too much I wish it was a little bit lighter but everything else about is fire um I was gonna say 4.5 out of 5 but if it's only because like the strain that is this color I've learned I can't really give it a negative rating because of that so I don't really know yet maybe I'm just gonna say 4.5 out of 5 when it looks a bit so now we're gonna do a little taste test so I'm gonna turn the song I happen in the lowest temperature so I'm gonna take a couple small hits real quick see what this tastes like and do all good [ __ ] I'm gonna put it like a little high yeah I'm gonna put on the higher temperature take a couple of batter hits do my little smoke test and like a little high test yeah they're not available I'll go over like the price point with you guys a little bit and then um we'll just to like overall review and then I mean so yeah stuff you guys are smoking along I hope you guys have spoken up the bank and you guys are Cheers let's get it again we're just I'm gonna taste this first so Cheers yeah yeah I barely hit that [ __ ] that [ __ ] ripped that [ __ ] like definitely has that lung expansions in yeah so that should definitely if you like one one expansion in your chest um yeah blow me going for another hip dose I don't really get too much taste in that here so um yeah Cheers so it tastes more like this like this strain I should have expected this I don't know why I was expecting to taste like some like them what does it bananas and cream yeah I was expecting that tastes more like the flavour bananas and cream rather than the strain that doesn't cream um if you guys know that the strain but how does in cream it's um that's a cross between like blue dream banana hoji and like a Ocean Beach oh gee it emits like a strong note of orange and like experiment in this thing yeah so has like a like I'm strong like a orange and experimentation know what I mean and that's definitely what this tastes like you can definitely taste like that um the orange you like it's like minty flavor I don't it's like definitely like a weird unique taste kinda hard to describe let's think I guess that's the best way you can describe it it's like an orange like mint taste kind of it's not the most tasteful I'll give it like a three-and-a-half four out of five that's not the worst tasty car it's [ __ ] fire it's definitely probably um I'll be going from one wearing it don't put on higher temperature and do that little high test so Cheers yeah definitely fire though but I definitely taste like that strain more than my passion but and isn't cream flavor but yeah I'll give a like a three and a half or four or five somewhere around there but let me put this on the medium I'll put on the medium temperature in the middle temperature so I'm gonna take a couple fatter rips now I'm probably thing up when hearing it this time so so yeah let's see all the smokes now and then we'll do a little high test to it so Cheers if you guys are smoking along again let's go that's definitely fire ooh when you think of that rip with that you can definitely feel that in your chests like almost like a [ __ ] tab like um um definitely [ __ ] fire um let me go for one more hit and then I'll give the higher a little taste but let me go a little bit hit you know I'll get the higher reading but the way this smokes I think I make of that like a 5 out of 5 because I just moved wow you guys seen issues so the way smokes 5 out of 5 I guess that also kind of depends on your battery you know what I mean and the temperature and a whole bunch of [ __ ] but the way I'm talking it's 5 out of 5 but let's hop back into this so I'm gonna do one more hit then we'll do a little high reading and then we'll go with the price point [ __ ] so series and let's go oh definitely a fire card here's another look at the oriole focus there's no last look at the world pretty far I mean it doesn't look like the most potent oil with [ __ ] away trips yeah this is fired it away smokes think I said 5 out of 5 at least for the one smoking for me right now but the high test I mean or the high reading I should say I'll get the high up for a car that's fire I'm not gonna lie I'll give it like a four point two out of five it's a pretty fire car but I've had better parts that were more potent obviously out there so it's not like the best part I've ever had but it's up there with some of them the price point it was $45 which is a little pricey for a half ground cart but considering this is like made without real live resin I know there's a lot of brands out there that claim to use live resin but a lot of them really don't I know for sure this is this company like they actually ain't there one of the friends that actually like they do that they actually do use live resin you and I mean so for the quality you can justify paying a little bit more but forty five bucks for a half a gram or that's kind of a lot you know I mean I can get almost like two to three brands of wax for that price so the price point I'm gonna give that like a three and a half out of five maybe three-point-eight out of five I don't know it's somewhere around there I still I've been saying this forever but I feel out of cards need to get a little bit cheaper they just they're good for the convenience II like the portability and how easy they are the smoke but like I feel like to put the price point on them grow like I mean if you did it like if all you do is smoke cards like if you bought it's like a half gram card last seems like a month when you buy a half a gram of wax that [ __ ] will probably last you twice as long as a cartwheel and it's pretty known it means so that's the one thing I don't like about cards when I go to a concert or something like that you know I mean all right did he discrete that's when they're like really really helpful and like come in handy I still feel like I'm gonna get Reapers you guys agree with hear it disagree with me let me know down below in the comments but the overall score on this car 45 bucks for this own Nana cream live resin sauce card reading on this like a overalls for a four out of five a fire card but the price point is a little bit expensive like I was just saying um there's a couple of other brands out there that are around the forty five dollar price point out honestly me I'd prefer to kick over this court but not to say that this part isn't fired but I just I don't know these brands that I'd rather have in this brand but it's still a fire car you know that means so I'd still be picking up I mean I don't know the main I saved on a lot of videos but mainly only pick up arch and a half I won't get one free Thea was going to me because I feel like that's when you get the best bang for your buck not to keep this video stretch um yeah I don't know if you guys want to see some more car reviews and videos like this we've spoken and [ __ ] like that I'm gonna down below in the comments and you guys are you know I'll do that ship uh besides for that I feel like the Lighting's in a little bit [ __ ] up in this video I apologize for that but give the video a thumbs up comment like subscribe like that's [ __ ] you really know what to do spend your money ready peace out", "Tz50RBGv2xQ": "I must show you this real try some more the strawberries taste like strawberries the snozzberries taste like snozzberries what's going on everybody so I want to do this review it's just some stuff that just came into the dispensary ride from down for me this is by the the clear concentrate confidence it's called to clear this is a banana cream these are for bait cartridges they fit through your basic 510 thread so the two kinds that I've tried so far from them have been the banana cream which I pretty sure I think is I'm pretty sure is banana OG the strain but it does taste like bananas and the blue razz is is that as blue dream that tastes like raspberries and then it does have the taste so first of all let's talk about content and medicinal as you can see it's definitely been refined it's a nice clear color that you know so it's not dark and gar so it's got a nice clear color I will tell you this the first few times that I hit it again this is your typical wick cartridge system but they have fixed the cartridges a little bit better on these to where there were used to be a problem down here at the bottom with the metal which would be a they would leak and be they were really weak so they kind of sucked like as far as if you put them in your pocket or anything like that so they've kind of worked a little bit on these um I was able to put them in my pocket and my jacket and I didn't have any problems these ones the banana cream and this one the purple Rhys I can tell you this it took about let's see I would say five really really good drawers and I was like stupid medicated to just basically it to me basically just to kind of get doing what I needed to do or go around about my day that kind of stuff I went talking basically it took me just a couple drawers I used one of my other another one of my attachments which is kind of like a cigarette thing where you just pull on it you don't have to push a button or anything and I still got huge huge drawers out of this so this is a this product right here so FAR's medicinally as far as taste and everything else I would give it a big thumbs up this is pretty good now I want to tell you this these are $60 they don't specify how many milligrams was in here or any that kind of stuff as far that kind of stuff so I would assume that these are a grand they look like they're about a gram so anyway but these are sixty bucks apiece I don't know if they're nug Ron trim Ron's or the devil se but one thing too is that there's some of the other ones really you know the terpenes the flavor and them kind of burns the back of your throat well not these ones these ones it's very subtle you barely feel it and anything but so if you get a chance to try these out I would definitely highly recommend them it's the clear they have about 15 or 20 nor 20 other different flavors so if your dispensary as the opportunity to get them in you might be able to get them cheaper in your area so close to live in a prohibition area so again check them out the clear cartridges for vape pens awesome Lumpy's chicken grease amen try some of this it's absolutely dynamite", "ZEhgLC8pOVs": "[Music] it's got to do with cartridges and I just wanted to say I'm in Orlando Magic yeah anyways so cartridges we're gonna be talking about cartridges so I've been getting kingpins and kingpins have actually been pretty decent you know I know

down on exotic cards do not buy exotic cards bro and I know you can fight kingpin [ __ ] this and that whatever but like kingpins they hate up their game and they have a better seal so it's a lot more

looks like it looks alright it's a little bit orange this one there's a little more orange you know the oil is kind of thick but this one's a little more golden this this one was pretty good this one what's a wookies this one hit really nice I just want to hit really nice - this one is a new one it for me oh no this is the one I just bought the Bruce Banner it's kind of that but yeah the it takes a really long time for the bubbles to move some pretty thick oil tastes alright this one tastes a little different to me this talking about takes a little like chemical kind of taste to it you know I

vape pen products woohoo hey pen I've got these great products right here 1:1 ratio THC CBD I've got Durbin poison no that's the gelato so there we go again I've got gelato and I've got Durbin poison Durbin poison is the sativa the gelato is the indica I have what do I have in here oh oh do I really oh okay well I guess I've got the gelato I've got the indica in here right now I'm surprised I thought I had the sativa see what happens and you don't pay attention anyway excuse me on piece canyon a month anyway so a little while ago I did a review on a vape n CBD cartridge and I was not happy with it at all and not only was I only happy that the CBD vape pen didn't work for me I really was hoping for that to not have the THC and to just use something that would help alleviate my pain but apparently I'm one of those people that I do need the THC in the vape pen along with the CBD which I've discovered from these I got these on 4/20 and this is what I purchased they had a buy one get one so I thought I might as well take advantage of it and it's this one to one ratio I was really hoping for because again I want I want that pain killing effects from the CBD so anyway again going back to what I was saying I'm so distracted there's people playing acai and I keep looking at them so I should probably stop doing that okay they all have no distraction um okay so I was really looking forward to doing another review of a product cuz they pen was kind enough to give me this battery when I saw them when they were doing some biomass their stuff they were there at the Phoenix dispensary and I mentioned I was looking for some CVD babes and they gave me the battery and so I came back gonna try that product and it was really kind of crappy that I didn't like it it was like oh thanks for the gift oh yes garbage I don't like it so I'm happy to review something of the vape pen for the vape pen battery that I actually do enjoy and both of these are great for different reasons of course I use the gelato in the evening time I'm pretty active person mentally very active and I have a hard time shutting down at night and sometimes again there's children in the home here and sometimes I don't want to go outside and smoke and when I'm really having a hard time sleeping if I'm not using and edible I definitely need to smoke it in to kind of go to bed so these are really convenient I really like using them before I go to the gym especially the sativa this Durban poison was great at the gym because I never felt that the yucky illness you know how you get a little heavy sometimes when you smoke this did not do that at all I was able to make it through my workouts even through yoga and then just some weight training and I had no problems at all so really convenient the smoke is nice I will say though the the gelato the indica is a lot smoother than the Durban poison the Durban there's a bag stuck to a tree and I thought it was a squirrel okay see how easily distracted I haven't hold on a minute I need to bring myself back to what I'm doing hold on get some of this indica gone okay the bag blew away that's good I love blowing smoke at you I just want to say no it would be cool if you sent me videos of you receiving this that would be great anyway okay so even though baby lungs do-do-do-do-do so even though excuse me while I wipe away my cry baby tears okay so even though gelato is smoother again it's a vape pen they do kind of cause me to cough it's a lot smoother than some that I've tried I have had some some big products but I've tried of other people's know something I'm gonna try that and see if I like it they made me cough a lot more so this is definitely smoother maybe it's the battery maybe it's the way it burns it I am looking to try some other one that you can set the temperature and because this one does get hot and I'm wondering if maybe one my oil my my cartridge will last longer if it doesn't burn so hot but also maybe I won't get that burning sensation that I get in the back of my throat mainly from the Durbin poison a little bit here umm so keep that in mind when you're getting them certain ones do burn a little hotter than others I'm noticing so some you might have a little more discomfort and I think it also depends on the way you hit it if you hit it really hard it's been gonna burn a little hotter maybe it's cuz I'm searching sit up straight sit up straight head up and beat into work I know I'm not even funny I'm just gonna smoke this okay see today's a day that I need the in the cup when that stuff to do that requires me sitting down which is pretty much what I've been doing the last few days and it helps curb the I need to get up and do something else thing so big help for those kinds of situations again these were I believe 300 milligrams I'll correct that on there if I'm wrong I don't believe I am though whereas a 500-mile against Amador I knew this before I started anyone it was $30 for one of these 0.5 grams anyway $38 I got a buy one get one free so you know what is that $19 I guess piece and in that sense from the Phoenix dispensary I'm just gonna end up cutting all this stuff out because I'm [ __ ] all right so so these cost me $20 so these cost 38 dollars each except there was a buy one get one so you know game II and the DL they lasted a while I mean you could see how much I have left and I've been smoking on this all week I've been trading off with the sativa but the Durban poison and that's how much of that I have left um so it's been again since since April 20th so since 4/20 I've been smoking on these and I have flowers so I've been smoking my flower to again I'm not real thrilled with how long these cartridges last for as expensive as they are but they are convenient and so I guess you are paying for convenience again if I found the battery that maybe control the temperature there by controlling how much of the oil I was using per puff maybe it would help better I don't know maybe you guys know again you know this is not one-sided I'd love to hear some info from you maybe you've had different experiences or you know certain tricks of using these things that I don't know because I really don't I'm really new to vaping if you have favourites let me know so also if you like my videos hit subscribe this is a rambling one I hope I'm able to edit this together to make it somewhat entertaining because I really like this so that's that's how I'm gonna summarize I really like this of a pen cartridge I really appreciate both of these for different reasons so gelato the turbine the gelato and the Durbin poison they both work different different times a day it's like oh this is the morning and this is the night time if you can do a buy one get one I definitely suggest it as the way to go for trying them out because you can try different products I can't wait to try other ones not just buy a pen but definitely I want to try the other ones like a pen yeah like my videos subscribe say hi talk to me every now and then I'm so long", "tiim9sMnWuM": "what's going on guys it's Lia welcome back to the channel today I got a dr. zodiac

gram challenge but I don't know I feel like that'll be a lot and I should wait till like 100 subs or something like that if that happens I'm whenever but maybe we'll do like a half gram challenge or something like that but this right here is a full spectrum distill it it's a full gram it's the same distributor the so like the dispensary doctor Rosa dispensary way out shits build Deer Valley and then it's not that far so the last one definitely [ __ ] my ass cheeks up so I think this one will to that select cart by the ways I have it in my pocket actually I really hope nobody drives by cuz this will be weird I'm just kind of out in the parking lot little Chipotle because I wanted to get Chipotle but I don't think I'll have time after this video unfortunately you guys always come first up the nice elect cart that shits got a little bit of wax but you know that that stuff does not ever get hit ever I don't know why but it says nom we were hitting battery juice before we didn't that stuff so this card is completely dead I threw it on the anodized battery because this one died and I had to charge it and I didn't want to wait so good as Carter went really fast I did feel like but you know it's a half gram and I'm a little [ __ ] so I probably complain a lot it so we're gonna just jump right into the review yuuji strobe I kind of looked at me a little bit anyway like I said for probably the 15 millionth time z skittles blah blah batch you don't need the badge number y'all don't want that crap let's go ahead and rip this bad boy open boom there she is mmm not even open yet

oil I don't really have a white background per se I mean I kinda have to book this thing but it's the wax it moves it does move but not tremendously fast so that's good as it gets hotter obviously don't move quicker and quicker but you know no dang fades no PG no VG none that [ __ ] so we are chillin hard with this stuff and well without further ado wait it's important important hydration time

say except for that's a big-ass list a truck cheers guys oh [ __ ] that brings me that taste brings me back to like when I first started smoking didn't like carts like when I first started getting some real gas not from the dispensary but some real gas from a whole meet up that's ooh hell yeah that tastes real good guys I'm not gonna lie that gives me some good good good good flashbacks hydration break you know honestly out of all the carts I've had oh no we have another car dude I spilled water on my old bro this car out of all the other ones I think so far this is honestly like the smoothest hitting I mean it don't get me wrong this [ __ ] like hurts you know it hurts inside right but it feels good I don't know what else hurts inside usually there's so many people around here it's like everybody's just staring at me like I don't really mind I don't really care I just think it's weird then again there's only two people and they're like 100 feet away that way and then there's like one more person wait that way and they're like 300 feet away I know cheers let's do another one I hope you guys haven't been able to hear my a/c going probably coulda heard it more so in the Jesus Christ you probably conquered it more so in the beginning of the video I turned it down like a couple minutes ago you might have noticed a difference in white noise I hope not but maybe me bring it up you probably do notice it now a [ __ ] terrible person I'm sorry what kind of cars you guys in doing I'm just looking at like these cars around here so many kids at my school like have these lifted trucks bro I don't know I don't know where their parents get this money like I had to buy my own car I have to pay my own rent you know like these kids are showing up in like $35,000 lifted trucks and there's 17 I'm like what the [ __ ] you know I'm 18 driving a Mazda 3 hatchback shoutout to you if you like the hatchbacks you know I like to call her the panty-dropper the panties drop because they're so wet you know why they're so wet cuz me just kidding cuz my car just kidding it's not has this has not got me one car anyway I like this card a lot so far guys um I tried telling you to taste it's kind of like a fruity plunging almost taste it and you definitely taste a lot of cushion there as well it is honestly I don't know if I'd call it fruity actually it's it's got some taste in there of fruit but it's not like super strong it's more of like a pungent cush kind of taste over anything and I'm usually like a fan of fruity flavors I guess when it comes to courts but but this one is definitely a great contender for what I'm gonna top tasting karts I've ever had if you like that the less of the terpenes but more of like the cush the pungent like wax taste I guess if that's what you're looking for then what strain was this jungle last one was jungle juice this is the skittles I guess this is the one to go for it I don't know how closest this will be to like other ones you know obviously but if you're going to dr. roses and you want one that tastes just like I described go for Zee skittles for sure and like I said you do get that you get a free half gram select cart which was my last video if you haven't checked that one out go back and look at that for being a first move a first time patient there and then I think if you refer somebody you also get another half gram cart as well for free and then they get that first time one and then if they refer blah blah blah keeps going which is actually stupid cool I don't really know a lot of homies I have their medical cards but you know if I did I'd be getting a lot of select cards you know I'm saying say I say we take one more one more good one right and we call it there right is that

other three flavors of peace tea but not peach am I the only one in the world that likes peach or what I don't know what I got to do but I'll do it I don't know if I gotta slide him a 20 under the table and put that [ __ ] back on the shelves or if I got a light not gonna dance for somebody maybe you know it's not not up to my morals but that tea have teas worth a dancer till you know I'm

later guys I'll see you all in the next one deuces", "cior4pVoKCA": "hi guys I'm Dan HOF chief operating officer of honey stick and today we're gonna give you guys from popular demand a little tutorial on 510 thread stick vape batteries now we've been getting a lot of questions on what the differences are between different types of stick batteries so this quick video is gonna give you guys a nice little tutorial about what the key differences are between stick batteries and a lot of these we actually do sell so the first question is what is 510 thread 510 thread is the actual thread adapter that is used by a majority of vape cartridges these are cartridges they're prefilled with CBD or different medical oils that you can pick up at your dispensary and what companies will do is they will pre-fill these so that you buy just a cartridge and then you go and purchase and attach it to your own battery in order for you to be able to vape so 99% of the cartridges sold in dispensaries and CBD shops use what is called a 5-10 thread which is actually just the threading of the cartridge now not only do prefilled cartridges use this but a lot of just vape products like even slim wax adapters like our silencer they also use a 5-10 thread so they can appeal for the dabbing crowd so once you've figured out what you want to vape then it comes down to picking your battery and what the differences are between your batteries and what i've done is i've narrowed them down to four main types of batteries the first one and one of our most popular ones is the twist style battery so it has a 5-10 thread which will allow you to screw in the cartridge like for example our performance cartridge to screw that into the battery so it has a 5-10 thread adapter there or an end right there it has a push button which means that you have to push hold the button throughout your inhale and because it's a twist battery it has a little twist knob here that allows you to adjust the intensity of your vape and this one goes between 2 volts and 4 volts 4 volts being higher giving you greater intensity now how do you turn this battery on once you have your vape Karcher attached you simply push this button 5 times to turn it on 1 2 3 4 5 and you see it's gonna flash and that means that you are ready to vape once your cartridge is on there now most of these twist batteries ours included does have a preheat function on it for when you're using a cartridge for the first time there's thick materials in there that need to be preheated before you can vape and that's achieved by pushing the button when it's on twice in succession so you push it twice rapidly one two and you see the LED is changing colors there that means there's going through a low voltage preheat to get your cartridge right of vaping at any time during the preheat you can push the button to exit so that is our twist battery it is very simple to use not a lot of clicking adjustable power there nice 510 battery these are a high capacity and they come in several colors I brought along the multicolor in the red and we actually even just launched a brand new carbon fiber version which it uses real carbon fiber so there's a real carbon fiber version right here the other battery is a 5-10 variable voltage non twist battery so you have your 510 adapter here that you can screw your cartridges into or of a products that you buy like for example your prefilled cartridge show you guys we're prefilled one looks like so here's a pretty little prefilled cartridge simply screw it on in there this one is a variable voltage but it's a non twist this is actually a pass-through as you can see a pass-through meaning that the charging port is here at the bottom so you can actually if you're vaping and it's running down or you're one of those people who works at your desk or in your car you can have it plugged into microUSB have the battery on in succession while you're charging the battery which means you don't have to take off the cartridge to screw in a charger so this one does not have a twist function on it this has just a button but you still have variable voltage and preheat the difference is is that you would change the voltage by clicking the buttons and Wogan that so to turn the unit on you click the button five times rapidly one two three four five as you see it blinks right there now it's on if you wanted to go in to preheat as we do it the other battery same thing push the button two times one two and you can see the LED again is going into the color change mode you can exit that at any time to get out of preheat mode and if you want to change the voltage what you do is you push the button three times quickly one two three and what you'll notice is that the LED changes different color now what that signifies there is that now you're on a different voltage level so your power intensity has been adjusted and this battery actually comes with three voltage settings three different intensity levels and you can cycle through them by just clicking the button three times one two three now you see the LED turn blue so blue red and green so that shows your variable voltage nan twist five ten stick battery for your reference the other battery that I've outlined is a 5-10 thread a lot of people refer to this as a stylus because it has a little stylus tip that people used to use for their Palm Pilots and you could use for your cell phones and touchscreen devices but as you will notice this battery is a standard it's a buttonless battery so it doesn't have a button on it so what you do is when you put your cartridge on there you don't have to turn it on or anything like that just make sure it's charged all you have to do is inhale so it's a different action you don't push and hold the button throughout the duration your vape as the other two batteries we showed you you just simply inhale and it will turn it on a couple of things to point out at this battery so a lot of companies do sell batteries like this we don't because for auto draws to fire ceramic cartridges they have to be much more powerful and we offer auto draw models like our elf concealers and elf twist but they provide a lot more power so they can fire ceramic cartridges that have thick heaters this little battery doesn't have much power to fire some of the more modern cartridges the other thing is it to be Auto draw it requires your cartridges to have an air hole at the bottom like this one let's see if we can zoom in to make sure people see that there's an air hole here so this cartridge has an air hole which means that when you inhale it lets the air travel through the cartridge which then reacts with a little sensor microphone in the battery that signals the battery to turn on into vaporize now if we take a look at these two cartridges we'll notice that they don't have air holes so you would technically not be able to use these two cartridges on this Auto draw battery stylus battery when you would be able to vape them just fine with the twist batteries I showed you before or the non twist variable voltage battery that I showed you just before that so that's just a little bit to keep in mind when you're selecting your 5/10 or your perfect 510 third stick battery now the last battery that's pretty popular is this ego style battery now this is a 510 and also stick battery and I see a lot of people carrying these with cartridges that ask however you'll see this is a little bit different than this because look at the the difference this this right here is flattened flush where you screw the cartridge in and this one kind of pokes out and you have this exposed piece that's because there's two different 510 threads is your standard 510 cartridge thread so it's your 510 C thread and this one is your 510 ego thread an ego thread means that there used to be cartridges for a liquid that would screw on to the exterior of this and make an interior connection so you can use it with the older style eliquid tanks as well as with prefilled cartridges well you'll notice is if you're really into just prefilled cartridges is when you screw it into this ego tank it this transition looks a little funky it'll still work and they work good but you'll see that this just doesn't look that nice it looks like I need like a transition piece of metal there like a skirt or something like that and you know this is a fatter battery so as you could see the widths don't exactly line up like other tanks like this you'll see it's a much smoother transition it looks like they're all one piece versus like this now there's lots of ego batteries on the market there's ones that have twist knobs there's ones that are longer the thing is that you can these are about 500 milliamp hour batteries for so that's a pretty good decent capacity for a battery these ones are usually between 350 and 650 they're this size you can get longer ones or all the way up to 1200 or 1100 milliamp hours so you can get ultra high-capacity powerful fat ego batteries like this but one of the trade-offs is if you do use a lot of cartridges they're not gonna line up they're not gonna look a hundred percent with these stick batteries they line up so you can use all different types of heating materials like ceramic cartridges standard a stainless steel or organic cotton coil cartridges you can use high performance ceramic like our performance tank you can even use wax tanks like our silencer with these little 510 thread batteries so we hope that today's video was useful in showing you guys the differences between the different 510 thread battery types and we familiarize you with some of the pros and cons are of each one so when you are on the market trying to pick up a 5-10 thread stick battery you can see some of these differences and figure out which 510 thread stick battery works perfect for you for lots of cool products

that condo they found an operation that really is incredible sheriff Beth says Tyler Huff Heinz had an assembly line putting together tens of thousands of THC cartridges over the last two years but it

the city of Waukesha Waukesha County that led us into Kenosha County they say these were found in all of Waukesha high schools many of the packages had popular candy logos and fruity flavors kids find appealing but they're far from harmless on the back it does say that it has THC in a very small amount and they're actually packaging these or filling them with 1000 milligrams of THC because of the size of this bus Sheriff Beth thinks it goes much bigger than just Wisconsin he's concerned it's the center of the vaping epidemic that's caused a half dozen deaths and hundreds of injuries across the country this is not recreational use this is a major marijuana operation that deals with probably distribution across this country and people are getting hurt and dying from this every single day

is the open reserve sfv OG the co2 oil cartridge this is a half gram cartridge that tests out at 89% THC and zero CBD I picked this up and connected cannabis and Stockton the link to their read maps menus in the description now let's get this cartridge out of the box once I get this out of the box the first thing I notice is this beautiful amber color of the soil now let's see how that bubble

so we're going to be doing another strain review this time it's going to be another $10 cart review now I had a number of people complain that I don't show my face here it is now happy alright moving on so this is purple punch this purple punch right here [Music] that's better people were complaining they don't see my face alright so this is Delta 8 in case you don't know it's a cannabinoid that appears in in cannabis and can be scraped from the industrial hemp that's been federally legal in all 50 states due to the 2018 farm bill this so this is a precursor to the Delta 9 that we're all accustomed to but because there are regulations on Delta 9 and in in in in hemp where you can't have more than 0.3 for industrial hemp federally in the US and I think it's point to in many EU countries so so yeah you can get this Delta 8 cannabinoid that that is THC as well in a lot of states I mean there are some states you can get it like believe I mean I think I think Mississippi you can't get it Montana you can't there's a number of other states but but Delta 8 does feel like tape see does feel like the high for the most part just for me when I vape it it tends to be shorter lasting than a delta 9 cart equivalent right now let's try this purple punch I've tried purple punch from 3qi I'll link to that review in the description and I want to see you how tend all their carts renditions of purple punches so now you'll get to see with me alright see that you you I think the taste is slightly more subtle than the 3qi purple punch the 3G purple punch no pun intended packed more of a punch in terms of flavor this one's a bit more subtle but it still sort of does the job definitely does taste like purple punch for sure you know I just prefer the three chi flavor just slightly more but this definitely tastes like what it what was advertised so this was the second cart from this is the second cart that I've tried out of the out of many of them this is the second one where the flavor actually matched up my I know in a number of videos I've done with regarding Delta B regarding ten to all their carts Delta nine cards I had said that the flavor while the flavor is still good and many of the carts it's not exactly at spec with some of the with the advertised flavor they said it would be but with this what you see tends to be what you get which I like and the effects feel subtle I mean I don't feel like woohoo but my limbs do feel a little bit heavier than they felt before using you yeah I'm gonna film that limb yeah I'm feeling been like my limbs are a little heavier than they tend to be don't feel pretty functional it's sort of hitting me more like a hybrid than a full-on indica like like advertised but I mean but if if you need sort of because some people need a mixture of CBD or THC or some need THC sativa you know so they can sort of focus and get stuff done and I feel that purple punch the or at least this rendition from $10 cart I feel that that could fit the bill so if you if you got stuff you need to get done you can get it done you're calmer you're it slows the game down a little bit but not so much that you feel like like you're being flown to the moon or anything so I would say that this is a very sort of versatile strain if you need versatility during your days and what-have-you but yeah it's such a good taste it's really growing on me I'm almost I almost I almost think it's as good as the 3G but I do think that the 3G was slightly stronger in in taste but it is growing I mean it does taste very very good like I would say it's one of their better tasting tarts from $10 cart but overall I would I would say I would give this fives all around it's you know it hits well the flavors good the drawers aren't too harsh I know I tend to take pretty big drawers and you know that's my fault I've seen that I've seen people comment that on videos but you know it's go big or go home baby alright but so that sort of wraps up my review of purple punch from ten dollar cart compared to the one I tried from three Chi the three Chi one a bit more powerful and tastes and kick in effect but this one the taste and the effect pretty good this purple punch I would say in in lower doses and even with the three Chi one is good during the day but I think as you use more of it I think it's one of those strains as you use more of it then you start really feeling the traditional indica effects and that's what I'm feeling with this right now but I hope you guys enjoyed this as always I can be found anywhere you find podcasts

Medicaid my friends", "Q5xorweaNTU": "So you want to add terpenes to your THC\nproduct. Well how much terpenes do you use? That's called the dilution ratio. My name is Drew, owner of MrExtractor.com, and\nI'm here today to tell you the truth about what dilution ratio you should be\nusing in this week's episode: \"Terpene Dilution Ratios\" from The Terpene\nInstitute. So you want to start mixing terpenes in your product, and you don't\nknow how much to use, and your products are expensive, and you don't want to mess\nit up. I totally got that, all right. So what I'm gonna do, is there's a whole\nbunch of different products that you can mix terpenes with, and I want to do a\nvideo on every single one. I'm gonna give you a tutorial, whether you already make\nproducts, or you're just thinking about it, on how to make every single different\nproduct with our terpenes. But the fact is, I just don't have time right now. So\nI'm gonna give you a basic understanding on how much you should use with all\ndifferent products. And I'll skim through it, and hopefully this gets you going, and\nlater you can watch a full tutorial on each individual product. I'll just give\nyou a walk down on how to make it. Make it, sell it, knock yourself out, alright? So\none of the main things that people are doing right now is they're taking our\nterpenes and they're mixing them with distillate and they're making a vapor\npen. So how much do you want to use? Now, always, every batch of distillate is\ngonna be different. And all terpenes are a little bit different, but they're all\npretty much the same. So I tell everybody; no matter how professional you are, no\nmatter how big you are, no matter how small you are, you always want to do a\nsmall batch first. If you have a thousand grams of distillate, and a big jar\nterpenes, don't just mix the two together because if you blow it, then you're\nscrewed. Start with the 1 gram batch. Get your\nratio- I do that on every product I ever make and so do large companies. Small\nbatch testing, that's the term for it. So what I recommend is that, well first off,\nyou need to understand that the ratio between terpenes and your product is\ngoing to differ every single time, because your distillate will always come\nout a different viscosity and it depends on what pen you use every different pen\nand cartridge that you use has different hole sizes in there and burns\ndifferently if it likes specific viscosity that it works best at\nknow your cartridge first and make a few different samples and see which one\nactually tastes best and smokes with the biggest clouds in the cartridge that\nyou're using and then don't switch because you're gonna have to do it all\nover every single time so basically with distillate you want to start out at 10%\nof terpenes no you take your distillate say you got 100 grams of tur picking a\nhundred grams of distillate 10 grams of terpenes now you're gonna want to mix\nthat heat does help the smallest amount of heat quickly mix it and make sure it\nemulsifies all together now if you heat something at a low temperature for a\nlong time at darkens I've personally found that if I heat it high really\nquickly and stir it and then cool it down I have less darkening because it's\nreally like a baking effect in my opinion high heat doesn't always like\ninstantly flash it everyone's got a different opinion on it so whatever you\ndo you have to heat it up a little bit make sure that it emulsifies in and take\nthe heat away from it and then you want to let it cool down to room temperature\nbecause your client is gonna be using that pen at room temperature you want to\nput it in the pen while it's still warm check your pen at room temperature not\nhot see how the bubble moves see how it smokes and if I were you I'd make a\ncouple different pens at different rates and find out what works best for your\npen like I said it's gonna be different there's a million types of pens out\nthere you may live in Arizona where everything's 100 degrees you may live in\nAlaska you're gonna want to make it a little runny or in Alaska and a little\nthicker in Arizona so all custom work here so you've mixed in 10% this works\ngreat it's probably not gonna be too runny I could pretty much guarantee that\nbut if it's too thick still then you can just add a little bit more terpenes and\nstir it in being that the terpenes have already emulsified in your distillate\nyou don't need to reheat it at that point it will mix in just by hand just\nfine now if you've made it to a thin add more\ndistillate in there stir it back up until you've got it the right way you'll\nnever really ruin a batch if you're doing that ballpark ratios for\ndistillate 10 to 15% is what we recommend now like I said we work out of\nLos Angeles we supply some of the largest pen companies in the country\ndown in Los Angeles and we always talk with their R&D teams what they're\nfinding is you can get the amount of terpenes to make it function in the pen\nbut customers are actually just getting more flavor they you know they\njust really want to taste some things and that's what we're just seeing across\nthe board always work with what your clients want because that's your main\ngoal not what you want nobody really cares what you like just remember that\nyou got to keep it in perspective you may be the owner of a company nobody\ncares customers want what they want so make sure to give them choices and let\nthem choose you know it's one of the fallacies that we all have as\nmanufacturers that everybody thinks like us so give them a few options let them\nchoose if they want a more flavorful pen or a less flavorful pen cannabis\nprofiles flavor profiles whatever remember 10 to 15% is a ballpark in Los\nAngeles in the major areas we are finding that they like a little bit more\nterpenes for a more robust flavor in their pen thistle it tastes like crap\nanyway I think it tastes like plastic and I don't like the taste of it I'd\nrather have a little more flavoring a little weaker pen and take an extra hit\nof something I liked then one less hit of something that I don't now when\nyou're dealing with shatter and hard extracts you have to remember there's a\nwindow here the scale you've got liquefied oil down here you've got solid\nshatter over here you are taking either end of this spectrum and you're trying\nto get it into a liquid obviously this oil over here is closer\nto a liquid already so all you have to do is add a little bit of terpenes if\nyou're over here in a solid state you're gonna have to add more terpenes so on\nthe hardest shatter we've ever seen just like some glass the most we've ever had\nto add was 50% by weight cool thing about my products which makes them\nbetter than other people's products as other companies give you a max dilution\nratio of 5 to 8% because they do not know how to blend their terpenes watch\nmy other videos on how to blend terpenes and why our products are better\nscientifically our products will taste fine at 50% you try doing that with\nanother company your throats going to get all jacked up because they don't\nknow how to do it they're just reading a piece of paper from a lab we don't do\nthat we handcraft our blends so that regardless of what product you're using\nit's gonna taste good and it's gonna taste the same and it's not gonna be\nharsh so for BHO some solid shatter you're gonna want to use a up to a 50%\nratio we can pretty much guarantee that all of our products will taste good up\nto a 50% ratio and it's kind of unheard of other companies require the use of\nMCTS or polyethylene glycol as a cutting agent I don't like it it's not how we\ndeveloped our product so one gram of BHO shatter 2\nthe half a gram now our terpenes are about 48 drops per gram so if you don't\nhave a scale and you have a gram of shattered what does that 24 drops will\nliquify that down so what about wax isn't crumble well that's just in the\nmiddle of the scale so you know you've got 10% over here 50% over here you\nwaxing your crumbles are going to be at about 25 to 30% those things usually\ncome out fogging when you stir them up if you have an extract and you mix them\nterpenes and it's kind of foggy hit it with a little heat those are your waxes\nthat are showing the waxes loosen up they melt and then they emulsify\nthemselves back in there and then it stays clear it's a really cool process\nso what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna do demo videos on each one of these I'm\ngoing to take some distillate I'm gonna mix it I'm going to show you the\ndifferences in everything I'm gonna take some BHO it makes it teach you how to do\nall that and another time right now I've just got a lot on my plate so hopefully\nthese basic ratios help you out in your products and go try it out start with a\nsmall batch always make sure it functions at room temperature always\nscale yourself up there's companies out there making millions of dollars that\nstarted in their garage and so can you alright so thanks for watching the\nterpene Institute was created just to give you a simple common-sense\nunderstanding of terpenes and the cannabis industry make some money help\nsome people trying to help you guys out alright thank you for watching go to mr.\nextract or calm I will see you in the next episode take it easy",

what is going on ethan here today we are going to be smoking on some maddie labs cart so here is the card itself it is in a pocket vape like cartridge so it is um good hardware battery so that is the cartridge on my environment so you guys can get a better view and then here's a box it got freaking squished so that's pretty much all i can show you oh and then there's front and then there is top but yeah there's all that so i know it's a bm brand but from what i heard the oil is pretty good so that's why i want to go ahead and give it a try so let's go ahead and take it so it does taste like a regular distillate do you eat the little lemony taste let's go ahead and take another so i'm hitting this off of the toki 510 thread battery and like i said the lemon haze not elapsed cart so i'm probably going to be doing a couple videos i think i have four other flavors so i'm going to be trying a couple other ones but yeah make sure you guys like leave a like on the video because it really helps me out so when i'm not uploading make sure you guys check out some other some other people i've been watching such as shock x 420 simplistic just a couple other people um let's go ahead take one more hit and probably end off the video so like i've said already subscribe comment leave a like because it really helps out the channel and i've you know it's really good for my channel more [Music]

legit and we got nikki in the back you feel me and uh yeah if you can tell from the title this is a cartridge that costs nine [ __ ] dollars you know and uh someone mentioned to me to actually try it and also shout out to my boy shaka he also has been [ __ ] with these he said it's good and uh yeah we're just gonna have um uh be legit open this so i could film him no i'm saying hey definitely but yes shout out to the homies for helping me with this review all right papa or this video um papa it looks like randy's daddy [Laughter] we're gonna be trying it in my tronian battery is gelato 33 you know gelato 30 oh [ __ ] it's child proof oh no i can't open again [Music] and you said you wanted a cartridge and that's what it looks like uh um for this lit i would i would expect it to be lighter uh but it's um it's kind of got that like uh brownish tint at the very top too maybe if we swirl it around oh let me get a thumbnail with your shoe holding it from the top with the proper herbs hold on my [ __ ] fingernails kind of dirty so i'll like not get it in there there we go all right so that is the pop of herbs it does have like the the tint but i heard that's actually the the the terpenes that they put on the top of the distillery or something so you can smell it how's it gonna get smell ooh it's like a i don't know what it is as usual we're going to have the person to my left take it first yes you know then hopefully it works with this battery it should sounds like a wrist movement [Laughter] i was but they said they can have this deal for a while it's yeah well as long as it's there you know i don't think it's really a deal it's just it's just price that low because i've had this brand before guys you you know it was a eighth or i think it was like seven grams or like an eighth for like 10 bucks or something that's how cheap the flower was and that car's pretty smooth let me show you you can't really go wrong with the nine dollars unless it's off the streets of course yeah but for nine dollars nine dollars this is this is hella worth it definitely wow what the [ __ ] yeah it tastes good bro good flavor good flavor it's not like a special flavor it's gonna taste like seven dollars but with the tax yeah it's gonna taste like your average cartridge but yeah it's got a lot of a lot of flavor yeah it's a very candy like flavor yeah yeah that's not exactly candy nine dollar [Laughter] shout out to the homies for helping me but i also have the cure company you know that this you guys have been requesting so this will be in its own video obviously it deserves one right but we got the papa herbs so i'm saying ben ben's liking it you know so i'll your typical weed flavor you know it doesn't taste like weed to me it's more of a like a sweet candiness with a little bit of a pineness towards the end i would say but you know i feel like it's not gonna get you caught up as much as maybe live resin cartridges would um but yes at the end of the day for nine dollars for a half gram it's really uh a win-win you know at the end of the day like if you spend nine dollars on it and it's trashed you only spent nine dollars on it right but you spent nine dollars on it and it's good so that's like [ __ ] amazing so i'm gonna take one more hit these guys are gonna take one more hit after me and we're probably just gonna call it a video but uh i don't know if i mentioned that the back i believe it was running at 85 thc so it's definitely still wow a whopping amount of or percentage right so possibly does budget cartridge yeah falling on a budget i'm not really a cartridge guy so i wouldn't know but that definitely seems like a good throw right there would you say it's probably the best budget cartridge that you've ever seen from me uh honestly i don't remember when i hit your cartridges bro i just hit it yeah i feel it you know not everyone's gonna know as much about cars with me you know yeah because honestly some of some carts they all taste the same to me sometimes yeah no i feel it like a lemony-ness yeah yeah that's most of the time it's gonna be sativa when it tastes like that okay yeah like the the super silver haze that i had recently of buddies like that lime salt and taste yeah yeah yeah but yes uh other than that it's been a really really good product review and we've been hitting it and look at it it barely moved and uh i'm definitely gonna be enjoying this on the next coming days hopefully next coming days not just like one day um but yeah do you guys have anything to say [ __ ] why didn't i buy one you

way Corin C&I are some people like super cautious steel stick another wine but it's not as bad as when we go ahead last night he is why it shouldn't be much of a late a wait they got it like a little thing going on right now when you just you order online and then you get a time where you come pick it up at so I'm here at my time right now to pick it up I got the cards this is Ronald like I said wedding cake I'll just do some b-roll but another one ghost train hey that's what I got ghost train Hades I know something but I think welcome got like 81 percent to eighty seven percent I got both of them it was overall pleasant experience with the city Canada so give it like two thumbs up pretty simple I know this really fight doesn't matter to other people in other states it should like that because they're dispensaries aren't like that they don't operate like it's a banking [ __ ] but out here in [ __ ] Illinois act like the Spencer is our bank and you know there's like a security door behind a security door behind another security door what is good YouTube and we're back like I said I just got back from Windy City cannabis right now I got so this is what I miss using to smoke this is not a really cheap doesn't cost much at all pay my five bucks for it like I said ended up getting two carts I got like I said got wedding cake and the guy goes try and I used about 500 milligram how finally just short of what I usually do but this joint called and they don't costing me 65 on top of that I ended up paying my 75 attacks in other words so and I know what in other words robbery bro this is it right here waiting cake do some b-roll [Music] [Music] again this is Verano now use this sticks hit this [ __ ] that's that join us is it right here or on tone beep anyway this little thing screwed a [ __ ] in here reason why I got this one in particular could this convene I could just stick this in my pocket I'll take it with me looks to go it's smaller but yeah hey slow bro it's a smooth pen I just probably last me a month I use mine tickling too however they have much for you as far as like a player for flavor program which I taste this [ __ ] one more time I can't really taste much out of this I'm not really getting like a cake taste oh no matter like look up and let you guys know like whether that actually works I don't really taste nothing cake wise as far as like wedding cake but uh I do feel something is usually pretty instinct with cars it's just like this literally just like smoking flour which has been my experience still early just like smoking flour so yeah I just be starting to feel some already that first day I took what was pretty was pretty damn massive but yeah and that man I'm gonna let you guys know I like I said hey buddy taste it tastes just a bit sweet but I outside of that any taste nothing I'm for real but eighty percent THC it is a hybrid I saw an indica and sativa and yeah other than that miniature boy man I appreciate you guys supporting the content two channels still steadily growing steadily growing and I'm just nothing but appreciated appreciate it to you guys and I've been in my experience that Windy City cannabis I give it two thumbs up as far as like I had like a bad experience I went to security guard but outside of everybody was cool most people was cool just like one little bit it didn't really blow it I still recommend though they're cheaper than the ones are that's gonna say that cuz they have yeah overall great experience I give this to thumbs up with them filling it for sure outside that man

"yYmEmulc4QQ": "[Music] yo guys what is going on ethan here today we are going to be reviewing the half baked extracts live resin batter so here is a better picture hopefully it is focused on the camera but instead of using my other glass for the video instead of using like the actual rig i'm just going to be using the puffco peek pro just because these different videos even though the rig is fun to use it just takes a lot of time for videos and this is just more convenient for videos if you're just going to be tasting the flavor anyways because it keeps the same temperature so i'm going to be hitting this um off the peak pro at 490 for i believe it is a minute and 10 seconds so i'm gonna go ahead load this up and we're gonna go ahead and take a nice dab so let's go so here's what i'm going to be loading up if i didn't say before i don't think i did this is the recon flavor or strain if you want to call it but let's go ahead load it up and take a hit so it's all loaded up now and we're just going to wait for it to reach temp and once it vibrates we're going to be ready to go i have a turbo in here so hopefully you know i do get a better taste so all of the chirps will be splashing around so just vibrated and here we go uh do so i'm getting a lot of freaking smoke out of this at this low temp it should be over any second now so the batter tastes really good on this low temp and the reason i have it for a minute a minute and 20 seconds and so all of the batter um is used and i don't have any left so i don't need to keep reheating it so that's a good temperature to put it at so i'm only going to hit that one time because i really don't think i really need to go over it that much so it does taste really good i'm gonna have their instagram down below so here's like the little logo that they have and then here's what i just hit so really good flavor puffco peak probably can't go wrong with it really good device just expensive but if you do have the money to spend on it i wouldn't pass out on it's better than some of the other devices that are cheaper but if you want the best device this is it it's just kind of expensive but that's gonna be it for the

is talking about CBD and THC which are two important chemicals found in marijuana with marijuana legalization becoming mainstream what is the actual difference between CBD and THC inside you right now there's a biological pathway at work called the endocannabinoid system that helps regulate your mood appetite memory and pain sensation THC and CBD though hijack this system this is the chemical structure of THC also known as tetrahydrocannabinol if you are feeling fancy and this is the chemical structure of CBD also known as cannabidiol what you may notice is that their chemical structures seem almost identical they have the same molecular formula which is C 21 H 3002 and both of their masses clocking at 314 grams per mole but there is one extremely important structural difference where THC contains a cyclic ring CBD contains a hydroxyl group and this difference in biochemistry actually controls whether or not you feel high in order to fully understand why you need to first know about the cb1 receptor in your unstoned to sober body your cb1 receptor is affected by a neurotransmitter called an and amide which controls generation of pleasure motivation and feeding behavior in your unstoned body and manda mine is released after exercising and it's what causes a runner's high THC structure is so similar to Ananda mine that it fits in perfectly to the cb1 receptor therefore causing you to feel high CBD on the other hand because of the hydroxyl group is different in shape and does not fit into the cb1 receptor therefore it doesn't make you feel high but CBD does bind to other receptors in your cannabinoid system affecting you in other ways a lot of excitement came around a 2011 study where a few dozen people with social anxiety disorder were asked to speak in front of a large audience some were given CBD some were given a placebo those who were given CBD reported significantly less anxiety there are also many animal studies showing CBDs anti-anxiety and anti-inflammatory properties which can explain why some people say it helps with their anxiety and with chronic pain research is also discovering that THC can actually a head Grove eight psychotic symptoms while CBD on the other hand may help with psychosis so what happens when you consume them at the same time one study found that due to CBDs biochemical shape it can actually bind to the cb1 receptor and turn it off in a binding pattern known to biologists as allosteric inhibition this means that CBD actually makes the THC unable to bind as well and therefore decreases how high you feel if you vaporize marijuana with 25% THC and 0.1% CBD you will feel high as the THC is going to bind to the cb1 receptor with little interference from CBD if you consume marijuana with 25% THC and 12% CBD this more CBD will inhibit the THC from binding to the cb1 receptor decreasing th DS effect and leading you to being less high where marijuana is legally sold likely they will indicate what percentage of THC and CBD is in the product you are choosing which will help you to understand the effects that will have on your body in the end THC is a chemical found in marijuana with a chemical structure that makes you feel high CBD is a chemical found in marijuana with a different chemical structure that doesn't make you feel high but it can affect your body in other less obvious ways there is still conflicting research and a lot more to understand about both chemicals with more states and countries legalizing marijuana hopefully increased research can uncover more details about how these two chemicals affect us because weed is now legal in Canada we created a new series called stoned science where we make comedians get high and try to explain complex science concepts our first episode is about the respiratory system so click here to watch it and let us know what you think as we continue to evolve this new idea", "Dg4if0UpGo8": "now a KXAN news in-depth report it's one of the most powerful weapons local schools have to catch children doing drugs drug dogs can sniff lockers and cars even backpacks and purses without a reason it's all free game as long as students are not wearing them a mother though is now questioning the effectiveness of those dogs after her daughter was singled out kxan erin cargile has been digging into the story for months trying to figure out just how useful the canines are easy easy Krakow is ready good boy hey go hip-hop chica the mission sniff out drugs the place the student parking lot at Anderson high school he's more accurate than any scientific equipment out there he and his handler Austin ISD police officer Tony Andrew check the cars huh okay then move inside look trying to find the five cents this golden retriever is trained to detect meth heroin cocaine marijuana and gunpowder seats the search doesn't turn up anything but the district says it's drug sniffing dogs are successful more than half the time not surprising to Bowie high school sophomore and an amber C know so what did you say drugs are a problem in at your high school yeah probably half the school does it the 16 year old wanted to surprise her boyfriend with homemade brownies the chocolate never made a pass first period during a random classroom search drug dogs picked up on a scent officers thought was pot and they were like are these your brownies and I was like yeah they are my brownies and they said did you do anything special to these brownies and I was like no ana says she was taken to the office and questioned by school police who called and his mother she was just totally frightened and they had asked her questions like do you do drugs does anybody at your home do drugs I tried to tell the policeman I said well what dog would go for the brownies and so he said no these dogs are trained and there's no way that they would ever be attracted to the chocolate police sent the brownies to the lab for testing but as far as Anna's mother was concerned the damage had been done you can get on Facebook and ruin a kid's reputation and nothing flat by you know talking about them and I think that it's irresponsible and hurtful to take a child a policeman to take a child out of a classroom and you don't even know if that child is guilty or innocent I had some people that were like wow and it's a STONER I didn't know that about her I was like oh I'm not I'm a good person Phyllis after two and a half months the results were in turns out the brownies were drug free yeah I mean it's like tell me something I don't know I'd much rather see a social worker in in school than a dog walking the halls we wanted to know just how useful are they according to a ISD last school year the canines made 211 trips to campuses and detected drugs 138 times so far this year the dogs have made 66 campus visits and found drugs 38 times I think it's a very effective tool because all the stuff my dog has found wouldn't have been found if we he wasn't in school officer Andrew says the brownie situation is extremely unusual sometimes dogs have bad days and that that day a dog had a bad day we identify that as an issue and that will be fixed now Rocco is one of two AISD drug dogs at one time they had five but have had to retire a couple recently due to medical issues and they're not cheap a drug dog can cost the district between seven and ten thousand dollars that includes sending the officer off for training with the dog now other local school districts that don't have their own Police Department call on help from other agencies with drug dogs Erin Cargile KXAN news", "2Z1Nu7VQ5ak": "all right so this is our terpene distillation unit start here with the heat mantle goes to the boiling flask you're gonna have your material class cars is already loaded with lime peels and a little bit of rosemary it's gonna go right in there a little steel what steel mesh filter inside from that take this top youtube over here to the graham condenser the graham condenser your water and terpene mix will go through the coil while the pull the fluid goes on the outside the coil from your condenser you go down here to your boiler water separator the oil will stay on top while the water goes to the bottom and it will siphon out through the side into a separate cup and then you'll try to keep it little water as possible in the actual tube and then you can siphon the water or I drain the water first before you drain your terpenes this is one of our newer chillers this is a 5 liter BWR - Oh 5a it's a negative 20 Celsius version we have the inlet and outlet ports here your inlet port will go to the bottom of your condenser and the outlet port goes to the top of your condenser this will ensure there's no air bubbles or anything inside the condenser while she was running through turn on the unit we need to start up screen let's start eating because it's too far from your set temperatures here's it's a hair of the silence that when the alarm features in the unit so our temperatures already set to zero degrees Celsius so we're going to first we're going to start the circulation and seeing the condenser it's going to fill up rather quickly now we're just running water through because we don't need to go too deep in temperature values and then we died a bully just for easy demonstration purposes now let's start cooling with your chiller you're just going to hold the cooling button until the run cymbal pops up on the left under the set there we go now India is ready they'll kick on you the compressor start you can go ahead and cap off your bill area we start extracting guys you can see our water started boiling a few minutes ago it turned a little bit of color because the steam goes into a lime peels and it's not hot enough it obvious through yet so it dips a little neck down that's not a big deal they'll go up and through the system eventually see our chiller is down the temperature set just over one one degree Fahrenheit I'm sorry Celsius nothing's left to get but we have pre-loaded our oil-water separator they do that just so we make sure that yeah water is being siphoned out rather than terpenes onto Vardhan being siphoned out before it's enough water so you can see our chiller we have ice buildup in water that shows that the chiller really did keep up with the temperature and set it to zero degrees Celsius which is the freezing point of water this killer really holds up well to steam as opposed some other killers that we tested right now we're gonna get rid of most of the water in this thing just open it up and let it drain out now while reading this out we want to make sure they're not like any of the terpenes through the stopcock it's okay to keep some water in the flat we will show you a video on how to further separate it later all right", "IWxH23Hi5Po": "right apologize for about the other one uh had some [ __ ] going on had to check out battle royale you've got gas

that goes out so i'm just gonna have to find out how to put on the", "vvOrD3iny_8": "[Music] so [Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you can tell from the title it is another delta 8 video uh this is another delta 8 hemp video i actually completely forgot i still had tincture i still had another one of these products to make a video on and uh what better way to have some apple juice but these are tinctures and with tinctures they actually are droppers or like you basically put it underneath the tongue and let it absorb into your system but i've seen people put it in drinks as well and i'm very fortunate enough to have the pineapple express one if you can tell from the intro uh it also says the amount per serving is 30 30 drop wait serving size 30 drops wait serving per container 30. okay so those 900 drops is what they're saying and then one serving which is 30 drops is 33 milligrams of delta athc so yeah let's see this i've only tried a few tinctures and they're mostly very i would say it's a very alcoholic taste because i believe there's like i don't know was it glycerin i don't even know what it was in there but i'm sure there was alcohol in the last tincture i tried definitely was not good at all so we're just gonna open this oh it shows okay so this is at about 75 milligrams i'm smelling it smells really nice so 75 one milliliter is 30 drops so we're at 75 so that should be about should be about 22.5 milligrams all right 22.5 milligrams here we go kind of tasted like bubblegum it's a very minimal taste at best but since it's the only thing i put in my mouth like i can taste it but like if i were to put it in this i feel like i wouldn't taste it but we're gonna do that um but no not bad i was honestly expecting a much worse taste so let's do another let's do another 75 in here so obviously the effects aren't gonna [ __ ] just immediately take over you know so i will be filming again in about an hour or so uh but yes i wanted to get a shot of me pouring this in here how many shots let's see seventy-five another 75 [ __ ] it we'll do another 75 all right so how many was that so that's about 70 milligrams of delta eight thc in there i think i did over 100 plus milligrams on this stuff so i'm excited to see oh [ __ ] you can see it's just is that chill in there what the [ __ ] so just like that's crazy there's like a layer on top yeah i drink mostly it well that tastes like pineapple and apple now pineapple and apple juice that's crazy good so i'm gonna get back to you in about 30 or 45 minutes to an hour i do have a fast metabolism so it might be a little bit quicker than that but overall you know another good way to take delta athc you know there's gummies there's actually dabbing it there's cartridges and now there's tinctures as well and for those of you who you know i think i feel like like some people don't like to um medicate you like normally you know smoking flower or vaping or dabbing or anything and they want more of a i wouldn't say a better way but a more i don't know how to say it but it's just you know you just put it underneath the tongue and you go about your day that's about it you know what i'm saying and uh you you set it in your mouth and you forget it basically but other than that yes i will be filming or i will get back to you in about an hour or so so [Music] all right guys so i am back uh it's been about 45 minutes i mean i do feel somewhat of a buzz but i honestly feel like what i take like 100 milligrams i think my tolerance is a little bit higher than that but i definitely do feel it i definitely feel it around the eyes and everything um as far as like the drink goes i drank most of it because it tastes like just apple juice now and uh as you've seen from the earlier clip it was just sitting on top i mean yeah it's still it just tastes like apple juice but you can still put some of this in here [ __ ] it so we're gonna end it off i'm gonna take some more but i definitely do feel it and for how little i took you know i didn't take that much i took like what 80 milligrams or something or so [Music] okay i'm gonna take some more real quick before i end it off but i definitely do feel a head change oh but yes uh definitely i would i would definitely recommend it for the people that um don't want to smoke or vape or dab or eat edibles because you know that's a lot of uh sugar you know all those gummies like that one video i did recently there's a lot of a lot of [ __ ] sugar especially in the morning but this is a more subtle way of dosing and uh and yeah it's just a great way to to get some delta into your system and it's legal link will be in the comments below if you're interested but other than that hopefully you did enjoy this video cheers to some regular apple juice i mean there's a slight pineapple but not as strong as it was when i just put it in there but yeah hopefully you did enjoy the video peace

cannabinoid on the scene THC delta 8 it has long been thought to be impossible to concentrate until now what is THC Delta 8 it's similar to THC Delta 9 but it has slightly different effects and benefits it's a much milder high and helps with mood memory pain and sleep studies have shown it to be 100 percent more effective for nausea and appetite than THC Delta 9 this is good news for chemotherapy and Crohn's patients THC Delta EIJ also has similar analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties as CBD it may be the solution to mild headaches and pains and migraines regular users of Delta aid report having a more euphoric and relaxing experience as opposed to Delta 9 heavy doses of THC Delta 8 did not cause anxiety another key difference Delta 8 provides a more clear-headed high

question so what's the deal with Delta 8 THC so only say THC we're referring to an umbrella term THC is an umbrella term there are many different what we call analogues of THC the compound that we are most familiar with the quote-unquote activated compound of THC is Delta 9 THC when we smoke weed that's what we're inhaling Delta 9 THC Delta 8 THC is another analog of Delta 9 THC it has just a slight variance in molecular structure which is why it gets the Delta 8 signifier instead of the Delta 9 Delta 8 THC as far as its effects it's less psychotropic then Delta 9 THC but it seems to have many of the same medicinal properties and so it could be a good compound to explore for people who don't want necessarily the biggest high associated with THC but they want the medicinal value of THC we need a much greater research to fully elucidate the different physiological mechanisms of Delta H Delta 8 THC but there's a lot of potential there for people who again want the medicinal value from THC but are not so down with the high from it and that's all for this segment of ask Emma thanks so much for joining me if you have a cannabis question that you'd like me to answer on air hit me up my

we'll kick him out on the go what we got to do you know yeah all right we are live again I got Roger with me and Lester is trying to come on with this but he's having some technical issues if he gets on great if not it's just gonna be me and Roger today so how's everybody in the room doing tonight I know I'm feeling pretty damn good Roger you just as normal up and down but quiet okay just or svl doesn't know it does nothing it's the same thing yes tapping everybody that I said hello and that Chad already Bob's here Robert and babe Taurus John Wilson Dusty's here I haven't seen dusty in a while and we got the $25 gift card giveaway starting up this is week 13 aka week one okay again we'll run it for the next quarter of the year and then we'll do the 250 dollar giveaway from mark to sponsors real flavors so let me give them a little shout-out here and give us a little real flavors drop that'll be that $250 at the end of the corridor is only available to the past twelve winners of the quarter and then those twelve people will get a chance at the 250 dollar quarterly price but every week we're gonna be giving away this $25.00 from real flavors which is barely coming up here because it's yeah it shows good on Roger he's a little bit darker but yep that's our sponsor it wasn't for Walt he helps us a lot here with a couple of the costs plus what he does for the group I really appreciate everything that real flavors does force and it keeps the lights on here a little bit some I David's here told David so the big winner he was the one that won the 250 smackeroonies last week he's here to start all over again all right Roger you can tell the people what we're gonna be talking about tonight I think they'll started with a core the differences between mixing by volume mixing by weight and mixing by drops and if you're gonna do drops we're gonna explain you the proper way to do it which I highly don't even like dewdrops period but we'll explain that to you and we are also gonna explain the bad things that you can possibly get in flavors I know everybody knows about some of the Lawrence flavors some of them are not vey pible well there's a heck of a lot more than that out there plus there's ones that we do use that are questionable and we'll be discussing them tonight so Bob Roger which one do you want to start on volume wait or drops those mother or I'll do everyone all right here comes Lester Lester let's see if you get a better connection this time yeah well you got a video say hello yeah better better and we are live here too Lester we are live already so good hello everybody so we just explained oh we're gonna be talking about well well you can just follow along with this right now we're gonna talk about mixing by volume because that's what most beginners start off with so who wants to start off Roger or less we can talk about beginners mixing by volume but it's all about so it's nice to sit and complain afterwards you know I'm just gonna sit back I'm just gonna have C tonight you guys do all that with all the talking all right voloom is it's the main thing people used used to mix when a starch it ain't better that it ain't worth sure either than any of the other ways it's the same thing they volume or or weight it's the same thing whatever what's needed you need some syringes it depends on on how much you like or big batches you're gonna make but if you have a 1 mil to an off mil 5 mil perhaps a 10 mil then you should have enough myself I use I use when I'm making it by woolum I use a lot glass rings because then it's easier to clean and I don't get any problem with the components s these things in in ya see-through so everything is very fast I tried glass syringes I kept breaking them all the time let's say something here let's see if he's still breaking up a little bit I'm still here I don't know if I've turned everything else off on the network so yeah can you turn your mic gain down just the hair just a tiny bit because they were saying in the room that you were cracked when coming up with distorted a little bit oh no there talk about the PA equipment sitting behind me oh okay all right yeah so you you are you're making extra sound interact in the black [Laughter] Roger what do you imagine I'm pretty sure you were mixed by weight now but when you first started off or now Roger Lister did you use syringes when you first started out yes I did I have we switched over to to using a scale and weight so but yeah I still use occasionally because I got some bottles that don't have the little drip tip on them you know yeah yeah I'd do the same either head or pipettes but like Roger was saying about the glass syringes I had something I kept on breaking on that so it's it's expensive when you're a klutz you know run down to Tractor Supply and I pick them up I think they're like 35 cents apiece or something like that so yeah that's for the plastic yeah yeah I get AG the 1 mil so I get 3 from my my drugstore things they hand them out to me yeah well I tried dad but they they kind of looked at me funny over here so just cool I go spin at 35 cents and be done with it you know yeah no I don't blame you yeah I bought him attractors to play myself fact I have a whole ton of three miles from here someplace but I see some somebody says normally it's not so possible to get it as corrects with woolum look here it's a syringe is made for 0.1 mils I think they're talking about the meniscus Anacin it's not it's no problem to make it correct enough if you want to buy do it in in pharmacies of why can't we do it in hallways too so but when you got into the bigger bigger you know and you pull out a syringe like like this who know your dad that meniscus that comes in here and everything if anybody doesn't know what the meniscus is when you put liquid in any well it counts it's like a convex cone that comes up here and they've said there's a meniscus and a lot of people measure by the top of that meniscus which is actually the wrong way to measure you gotta mention down on the bottom because what's up top is very my noon but it's still toast people off or X so I think the biggest syringe I gots a 30 mil yeah well and when we're talking about volume I mean volume is not just limited to syringes graduate and I have them I have them all always found at ten mil oh you got a ten mil graduated cylinder and I have a five hundred mil graduated cylinder too but right on up but that's mixing by volume and it is easier when you're going into big quantities and is the nice thing about big quantities mixing by volume is you have a lot more room for error when you yeah you think you're when you take two percent of ten mil compared to two percent of 500 mil that difference is minimal you know if you mess up you know what I mean yep so I agree with that a hundred percent yeah yeah and then that's the way a lot of the bigger companies still mix - you don't they just go by volume and and throw it in and that tiny little percent doesn't throw it off that much yeah well you got a bigger they're probably mixing this stuff up like about 50 per gallon drums worth you know I mean they have measured you know when they get really big and you can afford it they have huge measuring tools but for you know middle - mediocre guys that's basically what they're doing is they're mixing graduated cylinders or beakers or whatever you know so uh yeah but like graduate has on like the smallest sigh had ever had was one milliliter and what was that the master yes that syringe was 0.103 yes for each it's micro yeah it that's it yeah suck my layer is up and that must be like kinda suck VG in a syringe in a bigger but I used it sometimes just to check it but normally you don't need you don't need it that's this it's enough if you have this one meal order to make it you see if it's small amounts yeah I'm not following a chat here to see if I missed anything here somebody was something for a poster to use for a background oh yeah that that's gonna be tough that's gonna be very tough to do well unless you run into somebody dough into a lot of Shoals or something sometimes go on no you could probably go get one made yeah yeah that's possible of course yeah about 15 bucks to make one but you know I don't know how big are you big you want it there's any way you know okay that's the other posters I've yeah I Drive boxes he loved to have a 0.1 syringe - yeah that's uh that's nifty to have especially for some of these stronger flavors it's crazy you can you can buy it from some medical companies who have it I guess even seeing it in eBay I believe I'm not sure but I believe some lead pipe - how you don't - I know anybody else I miss your dating Frank's here crazy Chrissy's here a bunch of people in here today oh yeah yeah I'd like to get my hands I wanted a myself er that would come in handy for a lot of things so really would but it's kind of you can't be cheap yeah I like it when I need to make small tests miss Nixon and I and I want to make it funny it's nice to use it yeah it's perfect for me because I make a lot of five mil testers you know so yeah hmm done it's good very good audience I saw you when you testers that when you're making test mixes me 15 15 I used to kind of like you I used to have my own old line here at a local shop and then shop shut down so I had a bunch of the 15 mil bottles leftover so yeah that's what I use yeah PA ship mics line down their damn test just that's another story though that's but yeah that's a as far as volume goes I highly recommend it for a beginner to start off with for the simple reason that it's cheap and for the beginners you know and I'm watching these chats and everybody no no no buy a scale go buy wait go through this yeah I'm at scale gay myself but those people's just starting out they don't know if they're gonna stick with it and why waste the money you know what I mean there's make sure we don't get us a cheap little scale for 10 15 bucks now and it'll work just fine for the most part long as you don't get you know no big giant 500 mil bottle or something on it yeah but what mike theory is you know those people can only mix for two weeks and get discussed sit with it and it's 15 dollars down the tubes compared to 35 cents that's why I say it I like it yeah I'm a mix biochemist but also a lot of the cheapest rate just shut off automatically approximately two fasts then they get another problem for people so I see whatever people who ask me I say use ruler must start when you when you begin to understand how to mix and everything yes for sure weight is pay is easier span hope it function a lot less clean up - oh yeah definitely my but yeah but but I must say if I do if I do something like this a couple of times that's right that means in alcohol will be the glass syringe then it's ready it's nothing I did the same thing I remember many years ago when a baby when some friends began this discussion about computer it was oh you need to buy the newest one the fastest one everything why I did say I don't sit and play yeah I'm not doing playing on my computer I did do some designs and search things at that time then I found out I need time to drink some coffee too he and the same thing no I need time to wait a bit yeah that doesn't matter if I need to do some extra but but probably a lot of mixers also especially new beginners try to complicate it too much it ain't so complicated as some somebody believes it's say you don't need to shake for a half an hour and everything it's not neither so thank you do it easy and do do the way you fund it if it your you best that's the main thing above all the mixing so and don't try to be make the most superb mix in the world but everybody is gonna run the world around for because that you won't do whatever you need to try to make some mixes you gonna like and if you do it by volume you do it by weight doesn't matter as long as it's good for you true whatever you you know you're comfortable with you know exact I mean I mixed by a volume for a long time before I got into the weight thing oh me too high I must have been a couple years two or three years before I get in mixing by the way you know the the biggest problem perhaps use my weight is that are you gonna use this one gram is one mil or you gonna use the specific weight because develops a big argument a hand with their ass recipe site and my problem with that is I agree specific weights is much more accurate alright but yeah but if everybody does the same thing like a lie card my DIY recipes is setup that everybody does one one milligram per milliliter right if everybody's the same everything's the same correct ILR you people mix in vice specific weight you got people mixing by one milligram per milliliter all those recipes are jumbled together and nobody knows what's gonna that it so if you do everything the exact same like we have our recipe site set up to do yes everything will be great at least an approach and the problem is if you are beginning to use these specific weights then they also need to find out how we gonna calculate it to be a percentage when you put out to receive money don't do that either then we got even more problem the best way if you use one Grammys is terminals none you know it's it's the same thing whatever consistency is the key no matter what no matter what you doing in anything consistency is the key that's what gets all these juice businesses go and they they can make the juice it's consistent all the time no big changes and everything is good yeah listen you should know that that's fine was my rule of thumb everything had to be the same you know oh yeah I have no arguments with you on that at all just look how piece to be gonna be if some flavor in history is rebirth now in its day time focus anything for know who bob says no let pipes as I got tired of clean I did too I'm not scale guy and we're gonna talk about that next I think we got volume fairly well covered let's talk about mixing by weight well we just started talking about specific gravities but mixing by weight everybody knows this fancy littles to dad right here come on who give me the name of a fire one there you go that's the most popular scale let me show you what I got hang on all right he's probably got some one of those tippy scales there you go stay easy one keep hold you know you want cheap here you go yeah yeah I got one floating around here so it's right here in front of me I think it was like like I said about 10 bucks I got you beat this thing was probably about four right here it works you know it works I use that in a while sitting right here on my desk I yeah but that's the most accurate way to measure is by weight it's also the easiest to clean up I did a video comparing mixing by a volume to mixing by weight and I did it extremely fair it is only slightly faster than mixing by weight or by met by volume but yeah like everybody says you don't have to clean up you know yep the only cleanup you have is if you don't have the smaller bottles you're using you know the pipettes and if you're cheap you're rinsing them out but if not you're throwing them away so the rest I just you know the smaller 10 mil bottles they drip right out of the bottle so there's nothing to clean up there and the only the only problem I have with going by weight is not all your bottles have the same tips on them no I'll trip the same well we're gonna we're gonna get into that next we're gonna talk about drops but you're right but for the most part you can try and do we you know that only really hurts it's like when you're trying to put in like you know point zero one word the flavorings and something you're only making 15 or mil you know and then it's you having a hard time when I get that bad I go to a syringe I go to you know what the real small needle on it and it up drip from the syringe I've even gone as far as using a toothpick you know I just drip with the toothpick I don't need I don't need some time to when we were talking about this drip tips oh I didn't find this old one more okay even by my flavor art they had had a blue top and our on top the older one with big blue topped I don't know the size than the orange one benda got two different sizes it's like we're putting out a picture in files in the university there you see a lot of different things and this is another size you have there's so many different sizes it's crazy it's different ones all the flavoring companies need to get the other and put together a standard I think that's something that would help all of us as mixers I don't hear every gonna see that Deanna's yeah yeah but I don't think that's going to happen though for sure but it would make things a whole lot easier for people yes it would but if you're looking in the pharmacy then the laboratory that is normal with the 25 drops Peru mils over what I remembered but yeah somebody's have it some don't have it it's from 20 to 60 drops per minute so in that you can also take him and consider you know the volume of the fluid itself you know the viscosity of the fluid that makes a big difference in the drops crew and you're gonna you know and there is this somebody you know somebody told me one time oh you're flavoring Solway just about the same they're only a little bit off oh no no there I've seen them at point nine grams to 1.6 grams are you know from in TFA you have from point A eight 147 right to one point one 56 in their head there's heavier than that too because I seen a miss a point oh six okay you know you gotta figure okay they're they're using stuff like alcohol as a part of the she got PG as a base you got try acid and in each one of those is going to have a different weight to it exactly I'm doing for ya so it is so it's not possible to make it yeah good enough with drops I see and I'm not gonna mention any names but I know one person is specifically who's a big mixer - oh by the way only does drops but they only know from the same company the same type of bottles they won't very 8 from those flavors at all and but it's still not accurate you know like I said because it'll wait specific gravities of the fluids themselves and in the viscosity fluids it's still that accurate but at least it's more accurate than oh definitely you know I I I also use some of my my flavorings I got I changed my tip yeah to use one type so then I know it a bit easier yeah that's what I'm trying to do is switch everything of same type bottle with the same type tips just make yourself yeah yeah it does make it easier people time to know approximately how much one drop is anyway yeah yeah I just lost track what I was gonna say here so I am got sidetracked yes yeah I'm easy I'm easy to do that now I was gonna say something about that about the dry oh yeah well me even some of the recipes I put out I'll put out like a doughnut recipe or a pie recipe and then I'll say add one drop per five mil of AP to your mix the only reason why I even do that is because it's minimal that one drop AP and even if it is over or lower it's not gonna make that much of a difference to the mix so I don't measure that out you know what I mean us and it's easier for people let them remember in the input size at a drop all right you get a little bit more you might have a little bit more of a bratty note than the next time it's but it's minimal you know I understand it in some mixes but in other mixes you can't do it it's I have mixes when I use toothpicks that just the front of it right and that makes a difference so it depends a lot about what everything is sound I using a toothpick for a pee now are you not at all yeah yeah I don't use IP oh you don't use it at all see now the truth comes out zo is serious Lester he just doesn't like to admit using anything that I use that's what it is Oh honest I've got I don't know how many flavorings over there on my shelves but I probably won't use half of them oh I mean I was buying when I first got into it I was just buying you know every week I go by 10 or 15 20 different flavors you know and it just okay well I'll get to them eventually and they just stack up and sit there and then there's some that I have tried and just I don't like and I'll never use true yeah all that type of flavorings goes down the Dom pair I don't keep the favor I don't want to have I don't see a reason for it I keep in case somebody comes over to the house and says hey can you mix me up something that tastes like you know and I may have that there type of flavor and on the Shelf that I won't use for myself but if they want it you know why not I'll mix them up something I can give them the flavors but I don't want to make something with them if I don't like them so it's be well around here though there isn't very many people that mix but I do have people that do come over the bait that still get juice from me from Tom they're picking that around here in the room and and Dusty's picking at me I'm getting all yes come on [ __ ] I'm gonna knock you all down with a Salman when toothpick I agree you no problem this I agree with them on toothpick your salmon is definitely no it's not enough yours you're just a bunch of guys in a box everyone wait when it comes to fish beeps that you don't you don't understand oh I see people suddenly begin to like with with their with the flour flavorings inside why flavors taste [ __ ] everyone believed or something I don't know but if nobody have gone further than they've been stuck with the first or I for yeah - yeah I don't want to be standing with this ri4 I don't like our rifle so just sit there with your ri4 and let me wipe myself I remind everybody here again in a couple minutes I'm gonna put up the fancy key word that everybody is gonna have to type in the chat for our $25 gift card from real flavours we're gonna do that in a couple minutes after we get them picking out around you're here so I also get some some other small things for for measuring that's any pipettes I thought I don't know how much you're gonna take but they found out it's it's small at least it's something we come from a hospital stuff I got some of those with a starter kit that I bought a while back okay it's not not to be used it's just to have it yeah I don't use them knodel is trolling a lot in this chat no we got wrenches here to total help trolling if you're never tasted you sweets almani and done you haven't tasted something good that's quite all right well crazy as it sounds I'll tell you what if y'all ever find it I'm hunting for a shrimp flavor shrimp shrimp mm-hmm yeah Mitzpeh believe I know about this some no wait I need to check it flavor art had some yeah only they took it out took it off the market for whatever reason but I want a shrimp Lee I'm not sure we gonna be but perhaps it's gonna be okay I'll look Troy yeah I'm thinking you know and I'm saying I think that myself you know there's shrimp scallops well I serve lobsters just so here's a you got yours and whether I'm down south Southern Mississippi southern Louisiana we're talking Cajun food yeah no beer shrimp crabs that kind of stuff and I've gotten I don't know how many people were questioned that I make a wild trip hey I can I can see that because it doesn't have that fishy taste so you know you're talking you know shellfish basically yeah so it's why it's about meat right maybe that's your problem Roger get out get rid of this stuff with the scales on it and go to the shellfish it's not my problem is your problem I don't that problem with myself it's only the neighbor from runoff and oil we just gonna make a battle like that stuff that was given to you that I got a son too every end of me are gonna send some Solomon all right let's get let's let's take a breather here everybody I am gonna give it sounds like I find it here I'm gonna put the fancy keyword up for it and you have to this keyword in the chat and it's for the $25 gift card giveaway and we'll have the bot pick a winner for this week in this week's is memorial the more you'll type that in oh you're turning into a robot you turned into a robot on us but just put shrimp skins and PGA let it sit in the Sun we'll be talking about that too we will be talking about that shortly after we get yeah you don't worry about the case on a dead lower upper case it don't matter here in the chat - and we'll pick a winner and I like it look at that gone in a couple minutes here if I make sure this is all set up here ah where's my keyword a keyword set yes it is we are good so far we got a bunch of people in here so far and I can't keep up with chat is going so fast yeah well they're all typing in the name Aaron's which is a good deal Keith Keith this here I haven't seen Keaton eaten in ages Keith so one of my bosses up in up in a Boston area oh yeah I've been out but I haven't been working almost a month so far so yeah he's here to check you yeah if if you already seek or not yeah well I get the scars to prove it now they're just painted with ink yeah hiya I miss work and I don't miss work but even when I'm back to work if I'm still on the same bed I'm going the opposite direction keep this - I've been going down south so see that's that about Cajun do you also think about chilly yellow peon war something like that yeah chilly ACK I thought about it but now I like it for an accent chilly I got the unaware chilly and I was hoping it was gonna be hot and it's a relish it's a chili relish it was kind of a dress I know it's so good you know you can get bell pepper and you can get cayenne pepper you can get regular black pepper flavorings you can get all the seasoning basically flavors but the actual shrimp crab or crawfish you can't find those I know what is a place that has crab but I know it sucks to be honest with you yeah I never tried it but from everybody to try it it was it was terrible yeah yeah I gonna check up for you at least a I know I seen it somewhere not long time ago I'd like I'd like to get a good pepper myself I think I think a nice little red pepper behind like a chocolate would be real nice you know just get that little spiciness to it oh boy see how easy we get sidetracked your hand what a bunch of flavored nuts alright last chance type memorial in the chat here if you haven't done it and we're gonna roll this right away for everybody and see who won the this week's $25 gift card and if you are not in our group our Facebook group you can email me at DIY HS University at yahoo.com if you're the winner if you were the winner in in our group you can

Paul is gonna be mad at me she's trying so hard every week every stinkin week she tries and she know when but I can't complain I did before you started doing videos I did win the that flavor Artbox kid oh did you thought you were the winner in that I like it it's a nice short piece for me you know yeah you got it that's nice I guess they got another contest coming out that they're given someone I'm awake with from flavor right I just seems in one of the groups that they were talking about it I'm not gonna do it again cool yeah I don't know worry I don't know why just seen it I wasn't sure what I guess I was just one of them I guess you're putting on a bunch of prizes and stuff so who knows who knows right now we got to get to a Memorial Day I know there's people in our group that are tempting to my there we got their finger on the trigger and they're afraid to pull it take a name of the blacklist I don't know Paulie you just got terrible luck you really don't every way she's here dedicated every stinking week she's been trying and trying and trying see I'm pleading for you Paul I'm trying to make everybody feel sorry for you so maybe I'll give it to you at sound she gonna win yeah I don't know dog didn't say which years or all right so we get I think we got the drops covered that like I said that's my least favorite method of mixing it's the least accurate as far as I'm concerned it can be fairly I could if you use the same thing of everything but like I said it makes a difference so me speaking on though there's some none they got the same problem you get their friend drops so yeah so let's get into the flavorings let's talk about everything that's bad for you oh I guess we should start out with the big one that's really bad for his diacetyl yeah but but the problem with it or we can call it problem man for some years ago this was a big problem but yeah as I remember capela I've changed two or three times since it was a big problem in the historicity every producer have changed their flavorings they have reduced it market it so it ain't a big problem with was earlier also in hideous producing it has been a lot of tests and everything it was yeah the vapors wanted it then a lot of this died still problem is gone away even if I know as in Europe in this tobacco directly TPD system there it's there it says it's gonna be zero the acetate but what I meant by Sarah we don't know if it's 0.1 0.5 in Auto I decide zero at least so Panama and a big scare with diacetyl was popcorn long and everybody knows the story behind that everybody that worked in a popcorn factory all developed big bad long problems one of them died already but I also see a check up in it was some some thing that they make some tests in Netherlands I believe on rats and then it just to say every rest got trouble with it with small amounts but but mainly as the scientists say today it's not possible to say how much you can intake in before it gonna be a problem that's what I was gonna get at the whole point is none of a survey panned the amount that those people in effect or you were paying like you know or breathing in I should say but we know what's bad for you so why do I do it you know but but we can also go back some years and say when the Russian Baker had approximately over 33,000 PPM's died still in the flavoring and also flavor West had two and a half thousand ppm in in there butterscotch then it was a perhaps could be a problem if you then also use this to you get together and then put in the the oldest cappella we won cursed are then we had free with a lot of the other till and then you can get problems if you waited long enough so but every every component is a problem in it it all depends on how much you take in I don't worry nobody gonna die if you if you're using normal flavorings about vaping it for an hour or two never very if it's something and and you vape it in perhaps just that type in what should I say five years ten years two years then perhaps you're gonna get some trouble but we never know and nobody can say yes but that's the whole problem is you know the research and all this is so fresh and so no nobody knows exactly what's going on but we do know that the chemical said we are partly and it's a heck of a lot less and the cigarettes yeah if you're checking the food flavoring for food then they they used at least in in the Europe they they have started approximately 1985 also to control each of these components and set up safety their roots and everything right they are not ready yet and it comes new everyday so it's not possible i don't i think we're never gonna see exactly motor is ok or not they're gonna take the things we know with should be a problem and make some regulation of it yeah and i'm just reading here but the dye ketones by law the testing ever take it and food products is actually compulsory non-compulsory however it is not legally required to be tested in inhalation products correct correct this is why many have struggled to find information I need liquid ser die ketone free that's for daikatana basically which can turn into diacetyl it can't by heat right but it also dies ideal problem it's probably this we don't know but at least I can say if somebody is waiting with a lot of die since some days over some weeks or whatever it is it's not a big problem if you are a normal healthy pupil if you if you have some health trouble then perhaps you're gonna get easier some triggering or something that's not normally the the main thing to keep away from is what we feel what we feel I know about that's fat oil and sugar right we gonna real bad stuff first before we got into army because sugar is bad for you but I mean it's not as bad as bats no but the problem with sugar is how it don't matter vaporize true what we wanna VapoRub see it is by burning for ignore you can yeah it small particles in your lungs and then we get the same problems but I am I'd like to talk about the oils the fats and it's not to be confused with essential oils because most essential oils are safe to vape but the problem is there are a few out there that aren't and so we're gonna talk about that and I want to talk about nets because you get oil from from the Nets and which battalion knows all about he's the best out there for for his nets as far as the oils go that I know of but like I said that well let's talk about the fat so that in lipid pneumonia that's a big scare about bats is labelled mo pneumonia when I know some years ago a lady in USA in fact get troubles because she made all the time I made in us with fats inside and of course made it itself and everything and it get problem it's it's dangerous but also there you need to use some time before you gonna get some problem outlet right but the problem is if it when you get it it's yeah it's very difficult to heal it if it can be done the problem is to people don't know the difference in a lot of people don't take the time you know that's you know like some of these Lorenz products or have young oil because you can ingest them no problem I mean they're made for that you know correct correct even lizard is made from animal fat vegetable glycerin is made from vegetable but what a straight good let me go ahead it's ain't no fad longer it's a sugar alcohol correct so it's a it's a big difference of what this oil and how is the oil is treated you can say if and the oil with or or something with the whale who is destined distilled thankful for the oil is no problem I wanna show so it's a lot a lot of thing but this lipid oil is the problem that's the only will miss the problem in in every flavor is gonna be normally when it's so natural components there it gonna be some oil from its reason some flavors have alcohol and so again site right here a little bit to it I'm reading in the chat I want to show about our allergies and things like peanut vapes and we feeling that the guys to do that we're not doctors I mean I could tell you that there's a difference between somebody's large ik the peanuts and somebody's made from synthetic peanut you know they're they're mimicked in the flavor and there's nothing relative to the penis but that's not guaranteeing that you're not gonna get something that has peanut in it either we're not doctors so we can't at least as far as I'm concerned I don't think we can handle a show like that because we're not medically capable to give the correct advice so what do you what do you think router problem with everything and like that that's not allergies and all this fame yes you don't need to be the exactly the not it could be one of the components in others let's I'm thinkin being whatever other thing right so then you don't get the same same reaction by some people who get have this nut allergy it's not from the nut itself it's from one of the components but look what like what you're doing you're trying to mimic an egg in you use an avocado it's not even there close to an egg but somebody might be allergic to eggs and you're making an egg babe and it's great but then somehow somebody comes all undertaken I've got only know what they could do with fry an egg and put it in PG here's something yeah and then you get your hands on that and then all of a sudden you're in the hospital we can't we can't talk about that but all one of human we know some components is a problem agar gum is is triggering asthma we know this b2 la citt\u00e0 this is is making some head they can and even faint of it and everything but and all the things that could make some skin irritation or inhaling irritation and everything but the trouble is it's normal if you talk about from from a healthy portion then it depends on how much it is true I give you this advice people I'm not a doctor and I'm just gonna tell you what if I had that problem what i would do personally and not telling you to do it but I'm gonna tell you what I would do personally let's say I was allergic to bananas like bob says he's allergic to bananas I won't get that that banana flavoring I will put some on my arm let it sit there for the longest time and see if I got a reaction from it I was that's what I would do now I'm not a doctor I'm not giving me I'm not telling you to do that I'm just telling you what I would do so that covers my ass see why that's my alibi that code see why the doctor would normally say stop weeping don't use it yeah that's that's an easy solution then you got no problems with it but if you really want to make them and you need a reward to try it out something that you need to try try it out yourself it's not not only medical list who says this is okay this is not you need to try it out and find out it's the I I won't either say it you should do it but it's the only way to do it if you want if you vote to to taste something like that at least even if gonna get perhaps some problems for you but it's the only way to do it yeah and even this stuff we're talking about now all we can do is tell you about what we know you know we research and know about it you know and so all this stuff is it's still the research is an internet stuff and it's probably gonna be another 20 years before the research is in honest stuff in all the studies and you know and that you know it's they're getting the groups of people there for their class studies and we're not gonna know we're just not gonna know we're all experimenting here right now but I do know what's a hell of a lot better than what I was doing so it is it's a lot it's a big difference in just the last two three years that's three or four big I tried to check up a bit when I was going on in this di and I find a lot of info about some of it but some difference I happen and I don't know everything but I found out the components it could be bad but the problem is you never know how bad it is because the amounts decide right you can you can in fact you can even vape arsenic believe it or not it's not any big problem oh I've always lived by there's nothing in this world that will kill you if you take it in the right quantity nothing or it's not granite earth that will hurt you if it's in the right quantity you know correct some of you doesn't sir well look at those people over in over in Hawaii with the volcano what about Wafaa yeah well if you take us thinking pinhead pull a lot I know it's coming towards Bernie a little bit ain't gonna kill you you know so correct correct hmm that's correct yeah so it's not there's nothing here that and then too much of anything and on the opposite side too much of anything here kill ya you know but also the same thing this is what what we are using in de I think my mother-in-law that's not the same thing as what you is gonna be controlled by the authorities and everything yeah we need we need to think a bit more about it yourself for me I I feel if I found some flavoring we have stuff I don't like to use then I don't use it whatever if if it's some thumb or whatever I don't see the reason to put it in so then I don't want to use it but that's me Jansen we're gonna get to that about the blood orange F a blood orange is okay to vape when it contains blood orange oil and we know orange oil is left that but it's a way it's processed to correct way you know ways distilled makes a big difference you know we're gonna be we're gonna talk about Nets Nets are heavy in oil but Hector and in fact in this store tobacco just the tobacco leaf could be up to 40% sugar yeah so don't you have at least the two things are most often sugar and the the oil but without gonna happen process racing Roger you did two tests you know the paper test son and tie stuff they're in yes holiness that's out there the cleanest cleanest nuts around so as I said I give gave a picture to Paul or earlier today when I when I take up this is the black Kevin Cavendish yeah from from sticks mix this has made approximately at the change of year this is nearly six months now look at the flavor yeah is it dark no it ain't dark at all I could I could in fact easy I would suppose I could I could read reading a read through it if I if I begin to check it yeah you like that are filtered nice grip tobacco oh you know you're talking about arsenic it's either peach stalls or walnut stones but now I'm not remember but as I said it's not done a problem to wipe it if it's enough amounts you know I think it's peach I think a P a peach pit it has a good amount of arsenic in it the perhaps yeah perhaps I think if I'm remembering correctly but it's perhaps it's something of that in the flavor too yeah never know but at least it's so small it isn't measured so funny is something natural foods like sesame seeds you know I was worried about Blanc in the dig you know at one time somebody gave me a whole bunch of poppy seed rolls which I love you know and that's just loaded with with poppy seeds and I was I hate so much of it I didn't they called me in for a random drug test and I'm like home again am I gonna pass this thing oh my god and I asked and the girl says well I don't know what you might not like really just for me this stuff and before like I'm not gonna make it didn't make it extra terrible for you yeah well I don't find find these buttons off but ya better head back to the of the blood or orange it's all the way like I said it's the distillation of it it's the way it's filtered it's the way it's yeah because a lot of citrus there's a lot of citrus fruits that have those oils compared to other things say you can close to every lemon for example close to every cinnamon it's in fact well right but the problems it isn't as as long as it ain't lipid then it's not only problem yeah well so let's look into the essential oils there's a ton of essential oils out there that are perfectly safe to vape because the way they're processed in the way they're filtered and like you said you shouldn't have any LA's known form they Lawrence is known form they have a ton of them out there and they also have that chart showing the flavors you shouldn't because you gotta watch with these play especially when you get with these bigger flavor companies like Lawrence and stuff they're not making for vaping they're making for cooking and you know it's a big difference between cooking or vaping so you have to be careful of what flavors you buy but if it says essential oil on it you don't be afraid the worst won't be the la is the reasons which one the wisdom may make some flavoring for it for LA oh well it's not in your turn yeah there is some big problems there is phosphoric baking pastry yeah yes for this flavoring company so but it's also solved by some some vaping shops really that's that's the [ __ ] as I see it anyway it was some baby shorts don't care they will do your movie yeah in it flavors are cheap to Welton's button sells all kinds of stuff right you know baking tools but we got some some happening in Norway for some years ago was one guy who bought bought some one Milton because it was cheap and everything yeah but the customer over him get trouble with the scratching - blood in the night and very eating and a lot of problems anyway it was hospital and doctor and everything is in in these things that's what's in fact awesome and flavor and and the biggest problem was if you if you go a got on the web and checked up a search on the flavouring you're gonna find warnings from Witten saying don't use it for raping yeah so a lot of people you know since vaping seems so big they are point out some warnings on what are the flavors look at real flavors do you know right on the side of their bottles smell you know they tell you everything that's in them correct to let you know that they're safe a lot of companies are starting to do that but you have to like I said they everybody starts getting scared when they see essential oil on the bottom and then they get this oil scare well my god I'm gonna get lipid pneumonia well no you're not but you still have to watch you still flavors out there or not but don't get scared if you see essential oils but do your research on it before you buy when we discussed this flavor arch blood orange but what is that the problem we have I see a lot of people and used some flavor of a stuff and everything as I get a new flavor waster you see perhaps each month somebody asks why some II do separates oh yes thankfully it's because of the this oily content to do it see I shouldn't have said anything about cyanide rosh hashanah cavity everybody begin to discuss it I've made flavor west at my own got some stuff just because there's on the input like the yellowcake not the car you know yeah this yellow cake you get the sugar box again frame same with the salted caramel yeah correct same thing but I like it good find something else to use to to get rid of it I don't like to put in myself things I know I don't but it is a big four ounce bottles and tryna get rid of - so if I were a flavor Oh surely they called being flesh sorry I have it yes that I did stopped selling and made a new new type of it and then removed one of this company what's the matter what was it should be a problem it's off incorporate three Willis Reed it's called these component areas are problem oh really yes you're the first one who told me about that I never knew that I buy I like to have it you got some mail from the company no I know what it was stopped in selling I never stopped and they changed it to the Rainier cherry correct right which I have also but the rain here is not this is good the Bing is good it's a big difference oh no oh the Bing is so good because I bought a couple of when I first tried it I so oh my god this is one of the better cherries I ever had you know cuz you know that mixed with the in aware cherries there's two different a nut cherry cherries is a fantastic cherry so I bought another one of them and then they came out to Rainier and oh it's just now it's no comparison there's just two different juries arranged darker and its biggest brighter but is such a such changes have happened in there in the flavor world in the last year she all over it's something is gonna change t pay T FAA also changed a lot of flavors know for a short moment ago I'm just surprised because the war was supposed to be for vaping and then all of a sudden I get flavor that's not good it's surprise but but I'm not sure how it is feed flavor off or if they make everything themselves or I mean I made for you know they're too bad for them I I think I'm not 100% positive but I'm pretty sure I'm not sure so what I think most of them make the receive of how the flavor is gonna be and then get some other company to do it yeah done it depends what are this company used and the son that I found out afterwards it wasn't possible to make it the best and that I need to change it alright well let's get into I don't know if I want to get into the into the food coloring or if I want to talk about a seed of prop you know and acetone would you just basically take your tongs which we kind of discuss but we can touch it shortly this is a trick aside as a twin you can vape you can vape it direct without no health problem and it is some questions on it you know it's it's it's together with us a teal purple real it's gonna be a problem yeah at least is doctor for Solano study to me if if you want to raise the first screen just wipe it is no big problem but if you get it together with the other till probably done they can be indicated rock because as a teal purple ill have a very similar DNA of all the component is as dear Satine and this Osteen is the main part who changes the thing to be the other till alike but as if it's just that himself done it's no problem so yeah I made in here too and it doesn't same thing about the combination but it does say acetyl propane you know in acetone may increase the rate of a chemical reaction of any small trace of diacetyl that may be present so in other words even though did you know somebody tries to get as much the diacetyl out it is a smallest trace then it can cause problems it was one of the main theories was when it start when this DRC Chile was coming up as a big problem then a lot some companies just changed the name without changing to another components that was also some problems who happen and it was discussed in in science at least them but it's changed but this is this two part is very very similar and that's the biggest problem it's easy calm but but I don't see exactly that it should be so big problem this thing's is about the acetyl is known in in bear industry in in in beer making and everything in here right you can read about the Dino steel problematic in India in how many people could pop a bag of popcorn in home and sit and watch a movie I mean it's diacetyl in that you know in but that's it's the amount yeah that you're you're taking it and there is a difference I agree there is the difference between ingestion and inhalation so there's a big difference but allegedly allergic to IP yes there's somebody can be it but some somebody can in fact be it for sucralose to somebody could be there for I think three percent is allergic to PG and one percent the world by this at the Wiggy so look at Lauren Lauren is also finally figured out that she's allergic to PG she's having problems and she wasn't having any problems sold she got sick and her immune system went down that's when everything started kicking in at so so now she does now is goes to max VG and her mixes in problem-solve so yeah there you see there's the only way to do it try to find out test out and and find out yourself if it's functional not it's all the way to do it so I guess we can talk about food colorings now they do before we can even get started on this I want everybody to know that like for instance I got two bottles right here look how dark and how clear this one is just because the bottle is a different color and you think this is natural coloring this is natural coloring there's a big difference between adding food coloring to the flavorings and natural you're up I'm here just just need to open our sides and check off of it get some more color to it here to show everybody here's one that's some Isana reddish side yeah but but normally when you see when it when it comes out eaters who is really really strong in color and the color from light yellow yellow orange some redness some pinkish over to brown an orbitrim darker brown that's a normal it's possible to make it really really really orange with without putting coloring but yeah err perhaps you see it's a bit it's no color in there is just a standard flavoring with aged aged yet but when it comes a really strong flavor that color then for sure is gonna be some some color in there and then it also depends what is which color is it what's the component in the color in flavorings it used a lot this I need to find out and find it back corn syrup is used a lot oh yeah every sweetener yeah no it's also used for a four-color in fact because what is it it's caramelized sugar and then it also come this caramel color the same thing Bo both is it's just heated sugar it's only thing at this I mean and it makes a darker have your color of it is natural flavors cold as what was saying in our group today and it was today even at the time a year time of year the batch can change the flavorings like somebody you know say well I just got this flavoring and it's clear and now I got this next bottle and in its brownish or it has a tan flavor your color to it but I can say only only by nicotine it's normally it comes from a gel it speak it four times a year if you pick something in the winter time if you pick something in the best summer time it's gonna be changed in color whatever right it doesn't matter it's changed in a color and it's a look at the entire thing you saw it's organic stuff it gonna change look at the the review I did and liquid nicotine there Nick salts was bound it was good very good but it was brown and it was well I just bought it and it was clear well yeah it was a whole different batch that they got but the the nicotine itself was good you know what I mean yeah correct that's quite normal right in in a lot of things the color on it don't say if it's good or not the color don't decide it's in iniquity and somebody use chemical cleaning it's just just too pure to make it rain to keep clear but it's not better it's even in fact you're sure because it's the land you have to worry about that is if you had it already and it was clear and turned brown then that's a different story yeah that's it that means you get to sunlight too much heat too much air to watch this too much that and that's when you ruin your neck but it's wrong you purchases from the company ads are unless it's a crappy company outside a NIC is still decent like I said that that liquid nicotine stuff was on a brownish site it would look like let's try and get a car it looked like this it looked like this color and it was perfectly fine you know it's and they also told me it's the way they process is like grad you're saying you know if they don't clean it and clean it and clean it it's gonna be a little bit darker so it varies everything varies about this disc on Lorsch you somebody remembered cut wood first mother milk yeah yeah I remember people say nose and pinky side right no it was whitish why it was bit white and the problem is bundle he used the Flay coloring and this color had a daughter Ramona Nemo he had some component to is not good to inhale at all it was stopped very fast so that's one of the reasons about this dangerous about coloring because when you go at the web and check up about colors you're gonna find warnings about not every flavor but that lost at least most of them when it's used in food how it's gonna be when you are using it inhale then yes or not in its probe problem is if it's pronounced is very propyl paraben is a preservative basically that most food companies use and in their food colorings to to help preserve the flavor preserve the color and it's in a lot of these for eating flavors doesn't belong and I stuff that that we we and consume but from what I read in here it it mimics estrogen and it acts as a hormone and it can screw up your endocrine system can do all kinds of damage see if you're raping it so but that's like I said you know you talking like Wilton's I'm sure they're using some of this in some of their flavors you know about about these colorings I have a lot of codes and what what all the different coatings are and I and I I don't see any color is good to use yeah it is yeah it's perhaps not so dangerous but why do you need it it's not it's it's possible to take it stay away from it without changing anything in taste it doesn't do anything for you you're not gonna if you put brings food coloring in your in your vape you're not gonna sit there and blue blue smoke unless you're right up next to a light and then it's only gonna be a faint blue but if you're just out in the streets because that that light reacts with those molecules said you know you're never gonna get thick and no weight cord and if you want to look pretty in your tank just change the glass put a colored glass in your tank you know I can I want to answer Bob he asked if absent have a distinct natural green color yes it can it depends on on on the amounts of natural herbs is in it I know a DV a decadent vape ish UK have owner is quite green and it's correct we have we have attested it by by documents and everything it has so much of this part of natural pores it gives this green color so it ain't colored by a decadent my gosh in fact yeah like I said don't be afraid of the colored naturally no but very nice is not not roulette or all in need use an assignment blue sign with the blue very hard very you know there's only one thing makeup even possibly get blue out of its like a blueberry or something but and that's not gonna be blue blue correct gonna bring more purple not look at here I'll give you a perfect example [Music] under thing with the but don't just have not just one banana cream la Lawrence makes banana cream this is the clear they also make a yellow which is not good for you because that has food coloring in it they have a watermelon that's clear and then they have one that's colored you get it just be careful I have a colored Laurens here someplace I know I do the yellow because I bought it before I didn't realize it was regular food coloring in it one easy way I found out even it checked which colors we seen Lawrence products you know where it's on Amazon if you check out the products are you gonna find it very easy that its Sun distance red have red number forty a blue number one okay then it's just begin to check up what these things are then you're gonna find very fast out if it could be a possible with different problem or not so I have a list of everything in the Laura and I have a list of yeah we got it we got a chart we don't have the full list but we have a chart in our files in the group that has their saved in that safe to vape layering service but but it's not just Lawrence that everybody to don't forget there there's a lot of companies that have them stuff out there look at correct honey flavor right flavor art I had I love this stuff - I have their Pandora Pandora is like a one of those sweet Portuguese rolls it's delicious and I love it but it's not really good for you it's got acetone and if I remember correctly I don't think that acetone I said to him it's possible acetone right and then acetone acetone - Owen - way because as I told me it's the finger is in paint right exactly right I can say I can tell I also have have leaders from somewhere a CEO somewhere I don't remember exactly know that I can tell for sure by testing using acetone inside we should get ready to sing I'm singer for forum I'm very good with this this tape deck to push on stop and play tape deck oh my god I [Music] still have to twist the rabbit ears on your TV - I also have a 8 track system even your if it's superb it's even better better solved on this DVD jumps off e and every bump or something yeah true that track was superb yeah so these are the tapes Adam you know that's back in the day my gosh people have been eight-track it's twice the size of a cell phone now yeah but then you have something to smack somebody in the add weight chart yeah we uh I think we got just about everything covered here yeah like I said that is the full companies just be careful what you're you're looking at if in doubt ask same with the essential oils most of them are good okay I can say for a group I have I have some info about flavorings the trouble with some of them have a lot of info about this color and what the different color have no components so it's just ask I can try to help at least I don't have it on everything but at least an for four or five hundred different things to use in the market so yeah that's something you'll find something somewhere especially when you know we got some good people here one thing we haven't talked so much about it was nuts everyone one of the biggest problem with nuts it's if you go on the web and check you find out people make something of their own coffee or yeah we go back or whatever it is and I'd use a coffee filter and then it's it's superb and then you see some black gunk yeah it is it's black [ __ ] the gunk yeah it's full of sugar fat you never know whatever I just seen a guy sleep in a tea bag in a little jar PG and just today I seen it on Facebook someplace sir and he said I'm steeping it it's the tea stolen a tea bag and that's my first level of filtering and I'm thinking oh it's not even a filter no it never gonna be okay sure no any that's one more the main reasons I I find and now I can recommend Stix mix yeah yeah okay you have told me a bit about how we do things okay but but at least I can see of my own tests it's pure it's clean its superb look look at this and find on that to be six-month and say it's so clear normally you don't find it that's just boom one way it's like this it's because it's done properly right yeah and there's a lot of companies out there that don't there's a lot of people trying to make you know their own stuff to you know that trying to make their own coffees you're trying to make their own teas they're taking cinnamon sticks and trying to make their own cinnamon and and it's not number one it's not worth my time number two it's not save but but the trouble is they feel it's I it's better taste yeah perhaps it could be but I don't see the reason is some nice taste of anyway when you suddenly need to go to the doctor right then you got some problem so think if you could be a little at least it's a little it's nothing and go buy a flavor it costs you a couple of dollars sister and use 10 hours to each monofin to make some minor part of a flavor you don't you don't gonna run off in any way it's just like just like take a toy you do this in in a bigger scale and it does it properly then it's possible to do something with it but then you need to make it as good as possible if not the gonna be stopped very soon if if say because the main reason if you are making something and at least when you're trying to sell it who is going to be responsible if your customer are going to get the problem yeah risk understand for that who is going to stand in court by by this thing it's you and that that's one thing people at least when I are trying to selling must post think about make this as cute as possible so then you know it won't be any problem if you don't know anything yeah then it ain't sure then then this could be a perhaps a big health problem you never know and then you take the risk use perhaps need to pay a lot for the rest of your life or something so right beat safe at leasts now words professionals do this stuff you know it's down like we go trying to mess with your car or something yeah you know it's right weed so let the professionals handle this up which is nice so we get so many professionals in our group we have a lot of flavor a center group you company owners like Walt Hill steering in the right direction and a lot of things yeah and to say it's so much flavors who's coming oh my gosh he lost last year it's pops out every every week perhaps a new flavoring you can't keep track you know that was one of the arguments one night - you know on ice we started doing the arrest subpoenas site you know mmm people are saying well you don't have all the recipes up there and you know and we have to request a recipe site to make it a little bit easier well why don't you get all that stuff done I says because it'll take me a team of people for over a year to get all those flavors especially you know on specific weights and all this other stuff that they wanted it take us forever to do that stuff it's not it's not possible because it comes to your faucet and you yeah and everything keeps coming no everything every time you turn around there's another flavor company I mean look at the place I said I don't even have you right I don't have any vape trained I don't have any sassani I don't have do you have them you don't have flavors no I have some taste stuff make out look around big show you the camera all this over here is the ceiling just for the shelves not for use I get tons of stuff here I can reach over this way and I can even wait go forward and I can plot all the failure West I can go all over the place I guess stuff all over the place huh in there being the package [ __ ] ain't they open never open they're all open every day one of them I got so much stuff I got it's big it is yes I don't know I don't know but but I remember when I started see there are 16 ounces I'm almost out to look at no that's sweet very very very I think when I started in di at the first number I heard was approximately 700 flavours or something and a short time later I the next most approximately $50 that's so 70 years is not this that many flavor companies out there you know and I got Nooh robbery every day nearly I got even like care she don't even make him anymore but these were Smokies flavorings you know tiny companies coming around you know makin stuff you can't keep up there just like you said I think this is 1,500 more than 1500 companies probably ten yeah for sure and you never know where who is just rebuilding or remixing or whatever it is of all the ones so I know who makes really good flavors that I like to should get some other flavors but that but they're good for me to use if I was selling again I probably use them but for nobody has these flavorings is IDE ID make some nice flavorings oh really good flavors there down and and it's North or South Carolina okay but it's strong super strong too but it doesn't matter if it's strong me it's a taste of it all sides are good they're good very very good but nobody you know for me to be mixed and putting out recipes I can't put out those recipes I'm I don't get people mad at me like you can put out all this Asami and all the people don't want to buy good flavors it's I don't stick with strawberry and cream I don't either I haven't put our strawberry recipe in a long time main reason is I'm living in Europe I need to make easier to get flavors and then you you buy the flavors closer of course when I need to buy something direct from from USA it's gonna take me at least three three weeks to color courses mostly bein what you're trying to say is you want the mountain to come to Mohammed that's also far away in the middle now you gotta use what's available to you that's one thing as long as I find I found out earlier as I said I feel generally the European flavor is a bit more true than the USA types was at least in some of the flavorings that I found it easier to use test as I like and and I'm used to but okay I agree it's some US flavors I need to have - it is yeah I'm just trying to go over the chair making sure if I miss anything they're having their own good time for Evan are smart but not seriously uh yeah you gotta use what's available available to you but I have seen Asus ami their eyes mean some of those flavors I want to get my hands on they get some flavors that nobody else has that I know you know that's the main thing I used them at first time because they had some flaming I never heard about to find anything else and his flavor I bumped it yeah then I tried it I want things I scoured they're around their flavorings and they got some good stuff on there some real good stuff a stronger flavor flavor goes okay so and it's no problem just boy from Australia I've used juice factory in the in Australia in some years - there's some different things but I'm not sure who made their flavorings but they had some of these but it's more standard flavorings again yeah I want some of that vt flavors myself there I would like to get my hands on some some of those flavors everybody's raving off but then again I might get sucked into the hype again like I always do I'm not I don't buy I have got some vta but I'm but mostly its distant changes the lost one I guess was bitter flavoring yeah yeah it's superb to use in some so mixes and everything but I keep hearing about this you know one on one creamy undertones now if that's the newest type out there yeah I tell when one on one like I'm probably five years ago and I wasn't impressed with their flavors back then but I could like everybody else they made some changes and there's a lot of people are bragging about them you know but way back when I wasn't wasn't too crazy but a lot of their stuff but okay I also see problems say so Houston is superb to our handsome but some of this is it I do I love doctor Hanks and cream they're they're straight cream it's advertised it's like a cream frosting but that's not what I get I get a heavy heavy cream it's one of my favorite creams when I want a heavier cream I love it stuff that's only on like one or two Hanks and flavors but that cream is out of this world it's really good I tasted some of them earlier this I think it was his peach and and one other thing quite nice exactly that one because it was sad it was okay but all the phones know I loved I loved coffee for me I love the cream I really do I love a lot of their banks and cream it's one of my favorite cream cos I found too much of this Asian he uses that they can use lighter and and get it to light up right so then I don't want to use anything of this more than necessary should I say try to use European most possible for 20 minutes left here people you got any questions for us while we're in here - I think we got mostly everything covered like I said we talked about the Nets tell us how you love the cream tie shut up for you you know you can do it that rich you know you can stick that wrench tight I like it what can I tell you I like I like sticks mix - I mean that's okay for me to talk about that stuff though but but you also also know in Germany I think it's six or seven different flavor companies yeah who is into vaping I have contact with some of them but but not everybody have yeah shipping for to foreign countries then but yeah it's it's so fun there at least I try it some of them but same thing you can also have three or four big ones you say this what is called truly more something I have a couple of flavors but is it is it the reboot or is it I have no oh yeah I don't have a clue where they where they come from be honest with you that's totally unknown mean in Europe whatever yeah and then they don't have any don't reach or or European vendor for it then it's lots of interesting you don't hear much about purely my name when I first started pushing them out there you were hearing a lot about them but you don't hear you know the flavors I ever okay I can't complain about them but I'm not like my Hang Seng cream over I'm good the ones I have I don't have it's not a revenge expenses is not a rebrand you're sure have you documented it I can picture it happened what's the same thing if you begin to check most of these flavor companies buys flavor from others they make the they make the component to receive three or four major major companies out there I mean there's one over in the EU we got two of them here that I know of once mother Murphy's the other ones there's someone in a big international company that they for the life of me I can never remember their name but they are absolutely huge they make like a places like mother Murphy's so it makes flavorings for like Kellogg's and Nabisco and all the big companies food companies and they they're the ones that provide the flavoring for them but this other company makes them like aunt we're not thinking the name of that company either it's huge that's quite normal that's nice yeah it's all over Robert but they get like you said they get their flavorings you know these companies get their flavorings made by them in their name you know I'm pretty sure like I said I'm not positive about labora but I'm my guess is I think mother Murphy's is providing for them I'm not positive it could be it could be a whole lot of things you know I know you know even some of the smaller flavor companies that do do you have one or two chemists work for them and then they even the smaller ones are providing for other people too so for it's like a big chain it's just goes down and down and down so you don't believe it's not possible dirty to find it out that way yeah it's just just to use this brand as if you like you tell and be happy with it feeling so plus the matarese there's a there's a lot of work goes into making flavorings there's a lot of research I think the R&D is probably the biggest out of everything you know you can't just turn around and say I'm gonna make a blueberry you know and then though these things change during the time of year tastes of everything changes you know you can buy it I'm not quite sure of the numbers no but a blueberry if it is made approximately of I counted it one time I think it was approximately sixty or seventy different compounds yeah a blueberry flavor is made approximately about ten to twenty and you also got to take into consideration like you got a a blueberry that's like here in Pennsylvania compared to a blueberry that's in California they're two different tastes and that company doesn't want to make in California the Pennsylvania blueberry because the people in California uses it on blueberry you know alright you know what I mean they want that taste they don't want this blueberry taste here alright which makes a difference something we say about this bilberry bilberry is the scandinavian blueberry right I never never heard it I never heard it any time already it's anywhere before I started vaping and working with DI and then I found it out it's a this is the Scandinavian or Northern Europe blue bar and it's a much darker darker blueberry than what you would get here in my neck yes Brad quite red meat in it yeah but like I use bilberry you know with my blueberries here because it just gives us such a nice dark rounded flavor it's beautiful you know 100 mix wheat bilberries close to a stone door if you're gonna make a good blueberry yeah at least in my opinion that's the same thing as we say with this rosehip - also the same stuff not not something to sit in vapor Oh see butt-kickin elder flavour to give you the more butcher to say it's or taste or whatever it is the hype seems Afghan down in our so does a really quirky yeah breathe it works it it is not gonna it's effervescent it's a it's never besan it's not gonna give you you're not gonna vape in and get bubbles in your mouth but it'll give you a tingling sensation on your tongue it does work I don't think the hype is over it's just that the few people that got it or happy with it and keeping their mouths shut but I guess I know I don't know but it works one thing about it I believe people don't so for about try to use it approximate around to a percentage and that's a magic number that's imagine boom you don't feel so much reviews it in free and off you don't feel so much near to approximately to just the correct amount of yeah it is I don't know why I don't know why that magic number it is but that's what it is and I was shocked first time and it works but citrus Oh voiceover good oh my goodness hey ty yeah you people re you're something yeah we know am I gonna do it then what am I gonna do with them [Laughter] picture and I'm running around the Argonne not so bad words from his mouth because at least be clean this roads sitting with this little bubble maker in his mouth trying to blow the vape through it herckel Marian Solomon yeah why not about for ya perhaps perhaps it could be nice yeah it's an emergency emergency emergency I just died again throw a spare now oh I'm two for two what's going on here what's going on oh this this soda base for for a real favor everybody heard about TFA champ on it should give some fees for me it it gives so little it's not me in need for it in fact perhaps you could help in in some other flavors as kuva lummox or whatever but it also give me a bit of this great taste of it it was the same same thing with Univera sparkling wine it's more fizz in it but it also gives some great taste of it yeah the I don't get mushed a Saturn are it's sort of a second a tiny taste is something again even Oh tiny tiny I think it's so great being that it's not much it's a if you use it close to in every mix you won't use it then you're gonna mask this taste so it's not it's not a heart it's perhaps there perhaps the best to the best CC taste you can find today at least yeah he didn't she hell of a job with it yeah all the new flavors he's coming out with that holiday pie oh my goodness I like that stuff I think champagne is the same thing it's berry and a grape I mean it the best chances we had Adam there but they're not comparison to this soda bass in my house I you might want to add I don't have you tried I haven't tried it yet have you tried to add like sparkling wine to the soda base yeah under get more grape flavor just more grape flavor that's a no of course you're gonna get more filler but but they feels like it dies fast I found out in tests yeah so I don't I don't try to use ball firm in dynamics I think it's also there as in in lot of other things if you if used too much of one component than economies probably if you don't know they don't know the components so it's not easy to say oh it's gonna mean if it's gonna mute a lot but I feel at least in California no official DFA bad sorry I tried my feet I feel the same thing I'm reading what Bob Susie Trey he's naturally mental because he's of the expected mint flavor you don't get mint flavor from menthol if you buy menthol I have regular menthol crystals that I dilute myself there is no mint flavor to it it's just strict mint all right if you want a menthol that has I'm gonna talk about company Roger don't like it's a flavor west extreme ice that's a menthol with it's got peppermint spearmint and wintergreen mixed into it and just really nice amounts it's a really nice at least for me really nice menthol mint I think it's also mint in in the flavor if I were ought to whole are most also have some minty taste it's got a tiny bit of a mini taste but I just get it off note with it I you know I got a 30ml bottle here and I tried and try it and try it with it and I just get an off nope what did I use it a few times just adjust to taste it I'm in love with the ws 23 dome that is the cleanest coolest but I'm being smarter than you I found out I bought just a 10 mil bottle you have four tiers I got a 13 yeah I followed all the FFA hype you know all that came around and I got suffered it was the best thing is the best thing no it's not it's it's cooling some people enjoy but I just get an off taste to it zippy corneum vaping she would taste like if index correct yes yeah yeah no you're right I just don't like it they just did a poor job with it really did he is it once can't really place it yeah I just I don't know but this ws 23 oh my goodness I don't know why I never had it before what wasn't available here for the longest time but yeah I love that stuff you know you could just make cold you want cool you get cool you want cold you get cold you want a brain freeze you can get brain freeze well yeah but if you want mint you add your own mint to it you know what I mean it's it's just perfect let it under get the coldness in the whole mouth yeah we mean COLLADA you get it more on the front of the tongue yeah and we think cloudy you get that at least for me if I'm vaping too much if I put too much of a percentage of glad if I'm gonna get a colder yeah I get chest pain I need actually oh goodness you know it sits in my chest I know somebody got it but once I heard somebody get problem with me as to antifreeze so it's it depends of it I don't have a proud little problems but I don't see any problem and I know that lots yeah I used to be a stunt theory yes the battle dovetails everybody keeps some I had to build up a tolerance just stuff like you know you you got to eat this you got a drink you know you got to drink this build up a tolerance what I don't like it why do I have to build a tolerance of do it I like stuff that I like I don't want to force myself to have to like something you know it's just want to know can the King gets the sober in the liquids I never tasted candy King and I'm never gonna buy or taste it yeah maybe mainly because its trademark or a fragment but Malik acids perhaps perhaps you could use some citric acid and put in some top tartaric acid w he called or you can also use a bit bit colada or vs 23 and Dan you gotta taste it oh you can you can do it you can do it no problem I have a motto tartaric acid I don't even know how safe that is to vape so sure I'm not found anything who says it's okay but I don't find anything you say it's not right yeah that's where I'm at so but I that's that's what gives you the malic acid is the sour citric acid is tart but when you but when you mix it with malic acid it gives that malic acid that initial boost to get the the sourness L in the tartaric acid is just put sour on steroids is what it does sense but I'm sure that's where they where they get it from but that's exactly with what tartness sour is sweet and tart is malik and citric acid but the problem in all this these things us solver or Malik or see if we can everything yeah it's very easy to get muted flavors you know short wine yeah especially we use it why I to believe you can I can have it somewhere in in six months after oh it's no problem I got a banana recipe somebody gave me that uses an extreme amount of citric acid I mean I'm tired I like one drop per milliliter you know add into it was his recipe and that's a lot so you're looking at I don't know what the percentage of B anti-prom it's got to be up around three or four percent somewhere in that neighborhood but in it's fantastic the juice is fantastic but it only lasts about three weeks three weeks you're done you know then it mutes write down the banana goes nothing you know you go from banana the banana skin yeah the main trouble with that made every additive is the kernel it's gonna mute or or disappear quite fast anyway at least if you use a bit too much and it's not a lot of Italy you need before it gonna get make some trouble so as I said before if you can't make a good good mix without it then it's never gonna be better with it you can change chicken after some of some of the parts of the flavor but not the main yeah mix you can tell so I got a mix thing that I I'm looking at hands as well Speer I got a recipe that's similar to that but I remember it I had a little bit of Hingham in it and I gotta get rid of it because it's it's muted ami muted a I mean after about two months recipes good it's tasty but I got I gotta make an adjustment to it it's like to make it last lemon fades and it's all but I think I'm forcing it to fade a little bit more than it should so lemons hard lemons lemons hard strawberries hard fire percent sucrose why didn't use 15 yeah it's the same thing it does matter you haven't waited till it steeps down away so just yeah just pop it a sugar cube in your mouth yep and that's all you're done yeah feel the whole mouth with sugar like groups that's a you know pack way back when we were fighting and fighting fighting for to get that fizziness in your mouth it's all everybody just throw a couple pop rocks in your mouth and say you're done there you go you got all that busyness you want so but we're here two hours anybody got any last-minute questions whereas someone get the heck out of here I don't want to keep us here all night for once he's tired of me because I know Paula's got a winch she's not gonna get hurt us somehow I don't know how I can do it I gotta send her a lucky rabbit's foot or something so she'd go in this giveaway I feel sorry for that practice there you go they just dissolve in your mouth as you go correct but but but this the drip tip can't last long either you need to need to change it every 10 inhalers over half my wrenches disappear entice taking our furnace or enough with this app free Consuela was normal yeah appreciated tight as usual yeah there you go crazy day yeah there's a good deal of crazy Cressey won one of our earlier drawings and the shipping over to him was gonna be too expensive so he actually gave up his winnings the last time so then they got double chomps now here you go two for one now you gotta do is get your neighbor to come in and sign in to that's that so and you'll have three times he adds or if not just try to bribe Jack it's this is very try to bribe me jr. flavourings work I already had her flavourings uses low moan order fixes lawn or the resist and there you go kick your hobby up the couch get him the login and then there's an extra boat for you so you'd have three of them that she's been here like I said from day one dedicated and she ain't went him what can I do the bad has a mind of his own you know yeah right give me a contact give me a ring and and I'll send you the code give me a little time because I gotta talk to Roger here and then hopefully my dinner's ready that's a late dinner again but yeah hurry no more questions last chance and then we're gonna get the heck out of here I couldn't like every device I'm different [Laughter] now we run off before they begin to ask questions it's easy it's a brutal you get your son to build where my PA my from I'm in Northeast PA I'm up here in the Pocono Mountains is where I'm from up here in a beautiful Poconos it is nice appear especially this time of year right now it's beautiful except for today it rained

of us see you in more places vapor Tora sauce because I don't want to be anywhere is miserable he doesn't know I I'm very critical about places I I get pissed for for easy and if if I feel it's some group I don't like man I don't care about it I don't stay there I have so I do some work in in some low vision groups and help out during community and everything but the main group I are using in foreign places is this groups because I like the style of the group the way the members are the way the group function and we pick Sami nobody have tried it then they hate whatever and you don't know what it is so they can just sit there in their box Maybach I never heard about it I don't know what it is yeah Regan it we can't California now he's about build buildings although don't try to hijack

nickel stainless one so you pop this off of flat-head screwdriver this on the screws or the Phillips and then this knob will pop off Iran screwed everything for video and then this should just this Park will just pull off it shouldn't it might be cocked but that's it just pull as you come off and you unscrew these two very and firs here unscrew those and then you'll have to get the clock off around this is not too hard this should just pop off as you can see it kind of the insulation on the backs all worn and everything then you have this do not remove this brass bonnet unless you have the water turned off but you don't need to turn the water off for this installation but might make your life easier to accidentally turn the valve laundry and get water squirted on you this rubber thing also comes off and gets replacing the kit I've already put the new one on there so yeah right first you put this rubber ring on it just goes over the bonnet I already put it on next is you put on and put this little thing in the side there first things be some kind of spacer that's additional with this kit and then you just put over like that next cut okay now next you just slide this right over make sure it's aligned right up to the screw holes in the back you might need a flashlight to help you with that and then you just put back in the tent long bolts alright so how you do is you get the hand next to just get the handle slip it on there get the little screw that comes with it set screw we're going to put that in there tighten up here we go I believe we are good to go it looks beautiful okayhow though this isn't any instruction just for my application I think this is helpful this one had most of its seal already in there pretty good for foam seal so I'm just going to worry about caulking just the outer rim here and you make sure you use clear Cox that dries clear you might have the white line if you don't care for that on my old one I also did clock in the middle here
