{"eH_jmUD6H3M": "load up me to back out here with another review another edible review so this time I got some gummies this stuff is from Aurora Aurora drift these ones are their raspberry gummies I personally fan of indica I only get indica either a gummies concentrates flower hash anything like that I normally go for indigo this stuff is sativa I don't know sounds like we're all stuck together they're five per container two milligrams each which is hilarious but again not everybody has a tolerance that in every day user does so they're trying to keep for people freaking out and overdoing it overdosing and other people call it which technically you're giving not that you can die from it as people know I don't know I don't know why I'm buying all this stuff one this at the animals don't this low of milligrams I can eat the whole pack not feel anything again they are sativa so hopefully I feel a bit of a buzz they are nano emulsified so they're supposed to hit your bloodstream faster um this isn't sealed pack so these guys are just getting held on the shelves these guys had them for two days now I'm the fifth person to try these apparently so bust the seal I don't know right off the bat they don't it is a smelling raspberry I don't know it's a very very synthetic smelling this one is not coated in sugar it seems like they're the same type of consistency as the grapefruit gummies that I just reviewed again smell I probably get it give it a hundred I'll look at two out of a five they don't smell very good obviously they've been sprayed with something that's what it smells like to me yeah I don't know they're just they just don't smell good I'm gonna bring the clip the camera up so you guys can get some close-ups of what they look like and then we're gonna eat one we're gonna eat all five okay honestly I'm not really looking forward to eating I ate cookies so far I've eaten the grapefruit gummies and they're both lower than my expectations so that's saying quite a bit with these I'm not expecting much I can they're probably gonna taste terrible the consistency I'm probably not gonna like the bus is the main issue that I have with these gummies is they're they're also low THC that for me personally I need something higher these are high enough let's go ahead and try our first raspberry gummy from Aurora drift okay first gummy has the same consistency basically as the grape fruit gummies actually prefer this consist like they're basically the same but these ones are a little bit more gummy than the other ones I like that these ones aren't sugar coated the flavor they're their raspberry gummies like what do you expect I can taste the raspberry can't really taste the oil but again at two milligrams of pop and kill when you expect these were eight dollars by the way my kind of girl mommy it's too bad and they come in packs of five eight bucks ten milligrams for me personally I don't think it's worth it for someone out there who has a low tolerance that may be worth it for them again to me I don't think I'm gonna be buying them to enjoy because again 10 milligrams that isn't gonna do much to me I am buying this out of my own money to do my reviews hopefully you guys like my reviews I'm trying to be as honest as I can I don't know I still get a little bit of flavor after you know a minute or two of not eating them so I don't mind the gummies I would buy them again not for pleasure I would probably buy them with someone else's money or if someone else gave them to me how to eat them again I don't think I would actually buy them again personally not for eight dollars not for ten milligrams I have some BC pinkish and I'm gonna bust into pretty quick here I may do a review for that stuff this is from flower don't know if it will either way I hope you guys enjoyed this video look for my other cannabis to reuse because every animal that comes out and then I'm gonna buy them in regular review them hopefully I guess subscribe like this video I don't know like the content Cheers let me off", "mcImux044M8": "here's this James Beard chef opens our own restaurant pastry chef she's sort of well you know people know who she is she's written a cookbook and Wow she's like doing cannabis when we set out to create a brand for edibles we wanted it to be sort of sheffy under the Cresco brand we're looking at Mindy's artisanal a little bit more high-end that's where our chocolates and baked goods come in they're made with a distillate oil when we sat down and we talked about like I want to do my Brittles I've been making these brittles for years I want to see what it's like to make my brittles have THC in it what starts with good quality chocolate really she likes to blend so our flavors are a little bit of mix mixes of this chocolate that chocolates our specificity and then we add on the crunchies and the gooeys as we like to call them so she loves rich dead decadent caramel or peanut butter and then we'll make a toffee or brittle that will chop up and kind of mix into the bar I kind of feel like we have a really wide variety of edibles and I kind of feel like there is something for everybody and they're really really accurately goes on our more confectionery base and our sugar products I guess is Mindy's kitchen so that's where our gummies fall under we have Fruit Chews under that line as well as hard sweets so you know you're sucking candy is sugar base just kind of quick little bites I'm ahead of the game you know and I know there's gonna be a lot of other people are gonna get into industry hopefully my brand will be established and I mean it's gonna be like it's the craziest thing it's gonna be like you know like the Wild West I'm very excited about the future of this industry I'm glad that I'm in it and I'm glad that I'm a part of it that I've like sort of almost laid a foundation for other people like me [Music]", "JYEKo4fdgHs": "our special series on cannabis in Illinois recreational marijuana becomes legal here on January 1st dispensaries will sell products that come in all forms including edibles they can pack a powerful punch if customers don't pay attention to the dose NBC 5's Phil Rogers got a look in Colorado where legal marijuana began five years ago say the word marijuana and this is probably the image that pops into your head but when legalized cannabis arrives in Illinois January 1st you'll also see things like this and this and this resins waxes and especially edibles packaged in ways which don't look like drugs at all actually what we saw was a spike in emergency department visits Denver emergency doctor Andrew Monty says while many of those were tourists taking advantage of first-time-ever legal weed the most common patients are regular even daily users the most common reason we see patients coming to the emergency department has actually a syndrome called cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome so that's a cyclic vomiting syndrome that occurs when patients actually use heavily so they use every day this study which dr. Monte co-authored shows that in Colorado while smokeable marijuana is still by far the most frequent method of use edibles have led to an unusually high number of emergency room visits we know that edibles are associated with a 30-fold increased risk of actually ending up in an emergency department there's also the issue of dosing cookies and especially candies like these chocolate bars can contain multiple doses of THC but some users don't always get that message I challenge you to eat a tenth of a cookie because of all these issues five years in some critics in Colorado are especially concerned about children there's a normalization going on with kids perception of harm is going down the state of Colorado says over 19% of high school students report they used marijuana roughly even with the national average but the organization's smart Colorado worries about the many forms available to kids they don't perceive some of these products is being harmful when some of them are much more harmful than the marijuana in the past her group calls those the unintended consequences of legal marijuana at a recent cannabis convention here in Chicago vendors like Scott burns were displaying difficult to open child resistant packaging which will be required here in Illinois the way you pull on it and now I can get it open to help prevent those unintended dangers and that's coming worms children could think that's for that absolutely one other thing cannabis today is not the pot grown in dorm room closets in the 70s modern science has produced a much more powerful plant when you and I were kids right Phil there the percentage of THC was in the single percentages you know one to two percent but now actually the percentage of THC is actually about average of about 20 percent here in Colorado here in Illinois as in Colorado a typical dose of THC in edibles will be 10 milligrams and Illinois dispensaries will be required to carry warning signs cautioning that infused items can take up to two hours to take effect and users should review dosages before consuming any edible products Phil Rogers NBC 5 we're learning a lot our thanks to Phil", "5Nxne8QfIhM": "If you\u2019re like me you probably tune out\npharmaceutical commercials when they air on TV. But there\u2019s one drug warning that stands\nout: \u201cDon\u2019t take this medication with grapefruit juice.\u201d But what\u2019s wrong with grapefruit juice? And what\u2019s in grapefruit juice that isn\u2019t\nin other citrus juices, like orange juice, the normal one? Grapefruit is full of a type of organic compound\ncalled furanocoumarin, which interferes with the activity of an enzyme in your small intestine\ncalled CYP3A4. Problem is, that interference means your body\nwill absorb more of certain medicines, for things like high cholesterol, high blood pressure,\nand anxiety, than it\u2019s supposed to. This enzyme\u2019s normal job is to chemically\nchange certain potentially dangerous compounds before they can get to your bloodstream or\nliver. That way, they\u2019re easier for your body to\neliminate. But it also recognizes lots of different medications,\nand deactivates them the way it would any chemical -- meaning that a large amount of\nthe drug you take never actually makes it into your body to do its job. Except that the compounds in grapefruit deactivate\nthe enzyme. Just one glass of grapefruit juice is enough\nto knock out nearly half of it. So, if the enzyme deactivates drugs, and the\ncompounds in grapefruit deactivate the enzyme, that sounds like a good thing. More effective medications! No! It is not a good thing, because one of the\nfirst things researchers do in a clinical trial is work out a safe dose, one that takes\ninto account your body\u2019s attempts to remove toxins, including that enzyme. When your grapefruit juice gets rid of the\nenzyme, you\u2019re suddenly getting way more of the drug than that safe dose. That could cause serious problems for your\nliver, which normally filters out these medications after they\u2019ve done their job. You can also have too much of the medication\nin you! If you drink a bunch of grapefruit juice while\nyou\u2019re taking blood pressure medication, for example, your blood pressure could fall\ntoo far. So if you take any meds but you\u2019re a big\nfan of grapefruit juice, you might want to talk to your doctor before you crack open\na new bottle. Or just switch to orange juice, which tastes\nmuch better anyway. Thanks for asking, and thanks especially to\nall of our patrons on Patreon who keep these answers coming.

guys it's really hot and because it's so hot we're gonna do ourselves a hot review I don't actually know what that means I just thought I would say it what we are gonna do is we're gonna do a follow up review on plus gummies the ever-present ubiquitous plus gummies see them everywhere here in Southern California this is the uplift sour watermelon flavor I reviewed them about a year ago I think they're blue raspberry flavor liked it quite a bit on found them to be very pleasant tasting and to be quite potent but in that year they have grown and grown and grow and I see billboards for them everywhere and it is sometimes true in this industry where a company will get really big really quickly and in their quality starts to drop so I decided to go and take a second look at Plus here a year later see if I like it just as much as I did at the beginning especially with their brand is expanding I think they're doing mints now so let's just without any further adieu here go ahead and take a look at these plus uplift sour watermelon gummies so I actually went ahead and took off the plastic wrap because I knew I was gonna have trouble with it but I have not opened it yet I can actually smell them they smell very very pungent not weedy just very fruity that watermelons scent is quite strong okay so I've got it unscrewed there there are the gummies hope you can see them there don't want to pour them out that is 25 milligrams sour watermelon gummies plus gummies five milligrams each and I will be eating all 20 of these probably over the next 30 40 minutes or so unlike all our weeks reviews I'll come back to you guys two hours after they consume the last one unless you know exactly what I thought of the whole product how I got all that good stuff so plus is pretty affordable they routinely sell for about 20 bucks which is what I picked these up for any legal dispensary in Long Beach which is on the low end of the hundred milligram edibles so that's a good thing you always like your edibles to be affordable and I remember them tasting great as well so here we go very gelatinous very very soft gummy mmm wow that is a cute that's really good sorry guys my dog is gonna go crazy if I don't do this um that's as good as I remember the blue raspberry except not really because no flavor is better than blue raspberry there is a little bit of a weedy aftertaste now just a little bit but that first hit is a great great little gummy snacks if it weren't for the weedy aftertaste I would have no problem eating these sour watermelon gummies just pop them right in speaking of which let's do a couple more of them here now they got sandy fingers oh yeah now that punch mmm sandy gummies okay well so far looking really good impressions are super positive on these but we've done nothing important all I've done is a taste test and told you how much they cost what's important is two hours after I eat this last one am I gonna be pretty [ __ ] high I hope so I think you probably hope so so I will be sure to let you guys know I'm really excited to find out if they're as good as they were before so stay tuned right here and I'll see you guys back here in just a moment ciao dogs three and a half hours actually since I had my first plus gummy and spaced them out over about an hour or so and I am pleased to tell you that these three three and a half hours later I am still pretty buzzed these are as good as I remember they even taste a little better than I remember and I remember them tasting good the only thing is they have a slight weed aftertaste but in comparison to most gummy edibles it's it's they're delicious 20 bucks low end of a hundred milligram edible costs here in Southern California so a great deal and they're potent I mean these are on me you know these are as strong as any other gummy at the 100 milligram level and they just happen to taste a little bit better and a little bit cheaper so I I guess they I am pretty happy with my plus there wish I had some more to be honest um so yeah a big thumbs up still for Plus look forward to reviewing some more of their stuff now that I know they're branching out in those mints and all that other kind of stuff if they're half as good as their gummies I'll be uh I hope I'll be just as pleased uh well guys that's gonna do it for this review then that was the plus up lift sour watermelon gummies they tasted good to me big big thumbs up and before I go here guys I'm gonna give you a little cherry on top something that Yuka you kiddin you know enjoy with or without weed just to uh you know a little recommendation for you so this week I'm gonna recommend the thing that has been overtaking my life in the past two weeks and the Fire Emblem three houses is that the name of it on switch it's pretty pathetic I don't know it because I've been I have played maybe 60 hours in about two weeks which for me is pretty obscene but I am absolutely loving it if you don't know anything about it it's basically the strategy game blended with a sort of Harry Potter ish kind of skin and it's great if you like any kind of strategy RPG game you have a switch Fire Emblem three houses get yourself hooked it's crack and that guys is gonna then do it for the cherry on top which is then going to do it for this review and what's gonna do for everything so to recap + uplift super good Fire Emblem three houses maybe even better alright guys thanks so much for watching and we will see you all on the next review goodbye", "MjPgbEmRK78": "what's going on guys it's knives here and i'm finally back for a strain review this time for grapefruit grapefruit is a potent sativa strain made through across the cinderella 99 the effects of grapefruit are energizing and produce feelings of happiness this strain features a tropical flavor profile and citrus aroma personally i think this is a fairly nice looking bud it's mostly dark green with little bits of bright green in there and some orange hairs covered in little crystals it looks really nice i think so i'm gonna give it a 7.5 out of 10. i've seen better but it's fairly nice the smell of this just closed is exactly what it says on the tin it smells like grapefruit it's really citrusy it smells really nice in my opinion i personally like grapefruits i've got a few grapefruit centered things so this to me this is getting a tent because it really does smell like grapefruits if i stick my head in the jar it smells like i just sliced open a grapefruit i really like it so it's getting a 10 from me i've got a little bit in my grinder ground up just to get the smell of it open and again it just gets even more powerful when you grind it up it's just straight grapefruits it's really nice so here's our joint nice and rolled up i just got some raw black so this is my first joint with these i found it fiddlier to rot is that word fiddlier more fiddly to roll than with the normal rolls because they're so thin but we'll see what it tastes like so if i just dry toke it [Music] i think it tastes exactly like what it says on the tin it just tastes like grapefruit or just plain straight citrus i really like it dry hits getting a 10 out of 10 from me again so i'm gonna stop chatting i'm just gonna spark up [Music] so on the first toke it's all right not getting any flavor yeah i think that's just paper tastes citrusy but it's only after all the smoke is out of your mouth that you get like like a tang that kind of coats your mouth and it's in the back of your throat like like as if you were to eat a grapefruit that's the only way i can think to describe it like it's tangy and it kind of gets you in the back of the throat but it tastes just like a grapefruit not once you're inhaling it or as you're exhaling it but after the smoke's gone if that makes [Music] sense [Music] it was a little bit apprehensive to try this because it is just a full sativa there's no wind occurring at all it's not a hybrid and usually when i smoke sativas i get mild panic attacks and it's not a very nice experience for me but i smoked a bowl of this yesterday and i felt [ __ ] great i cleaned the entire house i walked my dog and i just felt really really good and it made me feel productive and happy yet relaxed but not anxious at all there was no anxiety [Music] i think as far as i know the only other like false teams i've ever tried have been hazers and it might just be hazel's i'll [ __ ] me up um i don't like them because this this isn't a haze and this is treating me fine i really i'm enjoying the strain it tastes really [ __ ] good i'm high but i feel uplifted not like lazy i just feel really [ __ ] good and i'm really enjoying this flavor of this late is just getting better and better so i was going to get 10 out do you know what i can't give it a 10. or can i give it a 10. 10's insinuating that there's nothing better than this and i know for a fact there is a lot of things better than this ashram this is a bit patchy i'll try and show you it just looks pure black on that but it's patchy like that side there's paper on it so it's just a paper that's black but on this side cover myself up so you can try and see it's patchy like it's not pure pure white but i wouldn't say that it's like proper black that being said i haven't had like um an orange type strain that's ever burned clean i've had mimosa before and that was black ash joints out we very nearly lasted a full joint without it going out it's gotta be a new record for me so let's jump into the rating for this grapefruit strain looks i think i said 7.5 it looks kind of average there's nothing really like amazing about it so i'm going to give it 7.5 smells getting 9.5 i'm not going to give it a 10. i'm gonna give that 9.5 because it smells pretty much exactly like grapefruits and the taste you can't not tell me that this doesn't taste like a grapefruit so i'm gonna give it a 9.5 as well the burns like a seven i think because it's camera black but not quite fully black and the high i like the high i feel really [ __ ] good right now so overall i'm gonna grip [ __ ] overall i'm gonna rate grapefruit a 8.5 out of 10. i really like this makes me feel really good tastes like grapefruits um nothing else really to say if you like this video give it a like if you've tried the strain leave me a comment telling me what you thought subscribe for more videos peace [Music]", "68grx1czDhY": "[Music] [Music] yes everyone dr sean miravichy here and welcome to a very special edition of dr shawn's cannabis product reviews i'm here on bass lake in beautiful muskoka here in northern ontario and what better setting to do a product review than this you know here on the dock on the lake and so let's uh let's get to it what i've done is i brought a few cannabis products that i haven't tried up with me to the cottage and so today i'm going to be trying the afirma peach gummy so a little bit of a back story about afroma they are a brand under the license producer uh i forgot the name title health solutions they're located in new brunswick this gummy is 10 milligrams of thc it retails for seven dollars 68 cents on the ontario cannabis store i actually picked mine up at my local dispensary miss jones where it was nine dollars so a little bit of a mark up there but i guess you are if you're just buying one or two items uh you save on the shipping costs uh rather than buying it on the ontario cannabis store you can go into a dispensary save on the shipping costs uh there will be a little bit of a markup but you know it all kind of balances out i you know my my thinking is if you're buying a whole bunch of items it makes more sense to purchase off the ontario cannabis store but if you're only buying one or two items uh probably more uh worth it to go into a local dispensary and buy them there okay back to the product so the extract in this edible is made from a hybrid strain and what's uh unique about this product and i guess afroma in general is they're using a full spectrum extract meaning that while you have thc in there you're going to have all the minor cannabinoids from the original plant you're going to have the terpenes and the flavonoids in there as well so i'm actually a big fan of full spectrum extracts because you have this entourage effect or the synergy happening between all the different cannabinoids and the terpenes and the flavonoids which in turn help the help prolong the effect of the thc and the cannabinoids as well as mitigating some of the side effects of the cannabinoids so it's it's always going to be the best result when you go with a full spectrum or even a broad spectrum extract tidal health solutions and afroma they also have a couple other flavors so this is the peach flavor but they have a grape a sour cherry a watermelon and i think i've got them all they also do topicals and they have some dried flour as well okay so let's get into it i haven't so this is going to be a different sort of format because i haven't even opened it i haven't tried it yet so what i'm going to do is i'm going to open the package i'm going to try it i'll tell you about the flavor right off the bat and then i'll wait until the effects set in and i'll take it from there so i'll give you some information about how long it took for the effects to set in and how long they're lasting can't really control for airplane noise so i apologize if you hear that in the background okay typical of most uh gummies and edibles that come in a package like this you'll have to peel off the top there'll be sort of a perforated area indicating where to peel from so we'll do that in there here's the duties paid sticker so now you know it's illegal uh all right now these are the tricky zip lock systems um so there's a child safety lock so a little bit harder to open than your typical zip lock so i'm going to do my best to get that open i sort of like to dig in and tack it as best as i can from the top there we go all right got that open so yeah with these things there's uh if you go for the top area of the ziploc that's the easiest place to get it open from all right so it's kind of uh of sad looking inside let me see if i can show you guys ah there's one lonely gummy in there i'll take it out there it is there's your peach gummy right there uh looks like there's some sugar crystals on the outside um it's very soft and it's quite flat okay let's try it out so good consistency it's not too chewy i've had edibles that basically break your jaw they're so chewy this is good the flavor is really full body so you do get that peach flavor but you definitely get a strong hit of a sort of cannabis like a bit of the bitterness the terpenes the oils really sort of hits you after the first couple chews so don't expect this to be a super sweet one-dimensional peach flavor you definitely get hit with the canvas flavor in there which you know i've commented on in other videos can be a good thing can be a bad thing those people who are new to cannabis and might throw them off a little bit they're not used to that flavor but those that are quite familiar with canvas might like it because you know it definitely brings that cannabis flavor forward and you get to experience all the different subtle notes of the terpenes in there okay so that is that and we'll see how long this takes to have effect right now it is 11 25 a.m and i'll be back and let you know how long this took to have its effect just lost the package all right i'll see you soon [Music] oh hey guys i'm back so it's been about five hours since i took the edible the onset came on pretty quickly like within about 30 minutes i started really feeling the effects and i would say it peaked for me at around an hour and a half after taking the gummy and the effects lasted until very recently so i would say a good like four to five hour stretch the effects were also pretty hard-hitting like this one was pretty powerful one of the most hard-hitting uh edibles that i've tried and maybe that's due in part to the entourage effect of that full spectrum extract i don't know but um so i'm going to have to rate this let's see so it all in all really good product i would say that you know for nine dollars like at a dispensary it was around seven dollars from the ocs i would say it's a touch pricey but either than that really good effect uh really hard hitting good length of time the taste was you know it's going to be such an individual thing like i didn't mind it but it's gonna throw off some people for sure so i'm gonna take one off um for taste and one off for price so i'm gonna give this one a solid eight out of ten so that's it for now dr sean signing off i'll be back with another product review for you shortly please as always if you like these reviews if you find them helpful if you want to see more reviews better reviews please subscribe to my channel really motivates me to get working for you guys so i'll see you soon", "fStT49nZDF8": "hi Colette Florido here at the MJ biz con and we are here with Matt and we were at the dispensary last night we checked out the planet 13 and one of the products that they had there was these beautiful dark chocolate almond barks and so here we are today and this is the guy who actually made those so tell us about how did you get there what inspired you to make something in this pretty manner nice so we worked with Mindy Siegel a James Beard award-winning chef out of Chicago Illinois so that yeah that's kind of where the brainchild gets started you know we take her rich brittle so that she's been doing you for years in her restaurant and we just infused it with a clear distillate and you know using a flavorless oil and just kind of paired with great ingredients it's a no-brainer for a great great product and when they're taking an edible like this how much THC are they typically getting in one of their portions it should be a 10 milligram breakable bar dosage 50 milligrams in the entire bar scored so that's easily breakable and doable so you can't go too crazy and when somebody is new and they're learning for the first time about edibles where do you usually recommend them to start and and how to go about it as far as the amount of THC be patient first of all low and slow kind of like barbecue you can always eat more edibles you can never eat less edibles so you want to start off I would recommend between a 5 and a 10 milligram dose and then just kind of go for there and let it kind of set in for a couple hours see how you feel and then you know kind of adapt personally so not necessarily just the hour but a little bit longer than to be on the safe side you know everybody's going to be different you know you might feel the efficacy and you know half an hour it might take a couple hours so you know just like I said low and slow how are you getting the plant into the chocolates that you're making if you know it's just technique being a cannabis oil it's gonna you know adhere to fats so chocolate being a great medium for it to kind of bond and holding onto each other and then it's just you know professional machinery after that you know we let our chocolate mix and homogenized for a minimum of 12 hours with the cannabis dose to ensure that it's throughout the entire product and then it's just go down to a consistent dosed bar by bar gram weights so that we know exactly how the THC is getting into the bar and you talk about clear extract what does that mean so it's a distilled oil essentially removing all the terpenes and the flavor profiles from the actual cannabis oil so you're left with a pretty neutral strong high potency oil [Music] and what uh you got some different flavors and some fun things going on here you want to tell us a little bit more about what else's that's here so we've got a range of products on the chocolate side we'll do like you mentioned the dark chocolate almond almond toffee bar we've got a milk chocolate with peanut brittle a sweet caramelized chocolate with a graham cracker and a marshmallow kind of like a s'more as well as a white chocolate with raspberry very fruity flavors and we also do kind of more confectionery style products like a gummy what do we do pink lemonade cherry blue raspberry all different flavors well this is definitely the fun part of being out here and letting people treat while they're actually getting a bit of medicine into their system excellent what are people using the the chocolates for are they what sorts of people are coming to you and using them coming from Illinois being a medical state that's kind of the cool part about my job I think the most popular the thing that I think is you know life-changing is hearing people come up to me and say I ate a gummy today instead of a vicodin you know getting them off the opioids and the pain Pilar's as well as you know treating their kids with epilepsy and you know a mess or things like that so a wide range of ill people kind of are showing the the FX and the benefits which is just eye-opening it really is that's a definitely a different way to look at enjoying these trees well thank you so much if they want to learn more about Cresco labs and Mindy's baked goods of course you can only buy them in

eight in two\u00a0\ndifferent flavors we've got a few other flavors on\u00a0\u00a0 the way but for right now we've got two flavors\u00a0\non the site we've got a berry white which is an\u00a0\u00a0 indica indica is really good at night for sleep\u00a0\nbut it's got all the same benefits as the sativa\u00a0\u00a0 which is really good in the daytime because it\u00a0\ndoesn't make you as drowsy the sativa comes in\u00a0\u00a0 an orange crush flavor and the indica comes\u00a0\nin a very white flavor they're both delicious\u00a0\u00a0 the whole container has 30 gummy bears in it\u00a0\nthere's 750 milligrams in each container so each\u00a0\u00a0 gummy has about 25 milligrams of delta eight\u00a0\nin it so these are the two we carry right now\u00a0\u00a0 we also have these little sample packs so if you\u00a0\ndo order anything from mypaynecenter.com and you\u00a0\u00a0 want to try delta8 but maybe you're not willing to\u00a0\nmake the commitment right now to a whole bottle of\u00a0\u00a0 delta 8 just let us know in the notes section\u00a0\nhey i want to try a delta eight sample can i\u00a0\u00a0 get a sample and we will send you a sample so\u00a0\ntoday i'm going to take a sample of the indica\u00a0\u00a0 the barry white um because about 9 30 almost 9 45\u00a0\nhere at night and i'm probably gonna try to go to\u00a0\u00a0 bed by eleven eleven thirty so this should kick\u00a0\nin way before then and we're gonna have a great\u00a0\u00a0 night's sleep so i'm gonna take this now and\u00a0\nthen i'll walk you through what is delta eight\u00a0\u00a0 okay so here we go so it's just like\u00a0\nthis okay so i'm gonna eat it it's chewy it's pretty sweet too a little sour but\u00a0\nit's like a mixture it's like a sour bear i should also note the delta eight can\u00a0\nshow up on a drug test because there is\u00a0\u00a0 thc in it not the thc that's in the\u00a0\ndelta eight like there's delta a\u00a0\u00a0 thc and then there's delta nine thc and\u00a0\ni'm going to tell you the difference so i will say the gummy bear was sweet and sour it\u00a0\nwas a good taste you could taste the berry in it\u00a0\u00a0 there is like a slight aftertaste to it like a\u00a0\num like a bitter aftertaste to it so it's not\u00a0\u00a0 as smooth as a cbd gummy where you can't taste\u00a0\nany cbd in it you definitely can taste in the\u00a0\u00a0 aftertaste that there is something in this but\u00a0\nit's not gross or overpowering or overwhelming\u00a0\u00a0 but just be aware that there is an aftertaste\u00a0\nokay so we're gonna let that seep through my body\u00a0\u00a0 it is actually 9 54 right now so we can keep\u00a0\ntime on how long it takes for this gummy bear\u00a0\u00a0 to really take impact on me so what is delta eight\u00a0\nokay so i'm gonna i'm gonna make it really simple\u00a0\u00a0 there's delta eight which is\u00a0\nwhat we're talking about today\u00a0\u00a0 and then there's weed and in weed there's thc\u00a0\nand that thc makes you high paranoid stone\u00a0\u00a0 increases your anxiety whatever it does to you\u00a0\nmay make your mouth dry it may make you hungry all\u00a0\u00a0 that stuff that that's weed thc also called delta\u00a0\n9 thc okay this is delta 8 thc the difference\u00a0\u00a0 is a carbon bond and that's what makes the what\u00a0\nmakes them different now they both have the same\u00a0\u00a0 properties to them in the sense of what they can\u00a0\ndo for you they have the same benefits per se\u00a0\u00a0 so just like when you smoke weed to relax to lower\u00a0\nyour anxiety lower your stress chill out calm down\u00a0\u00a0 maybe use it for pain relief anxiety relief\u00a0\nsleep maybe usually for nausea maybe use it\u00a0\u00a0 as an appetite stimulant delta eight will do all\u00a0\nof that for you as well but delta eight will not\u00a0\u00a0 make you high stoned increase your anxiety make\u00a0\nyou paranoid make your mouth dry but this is\u00a0\u00a0 legal and you can buy it without either a medical\u00a0\nmarijuana id or for buying it from a dealer behind\u00a0\u00a0 the garbage can or i don't know i don't know how\u00a0\npeople buy drugs these days i'm really not sure\u00a0\u00a0 um but this is legal because it comes from a hemp\u00a0\nplant so it is legal under the farm bill of 2018.\u00a0\u00a0 i should also note though that this does have\u00a0\ndelta 9 or weed thc in it less than 0.3 percent\u00a0\u00a0 because if it's more than 0.3 it's not legal\u00a0\nanymore in the united states but if it's less\u00a0\u00a0 than point three percent it is legal however\u00a0\nthat means it will show up on your drug test\u00a0\u00a0 so be careful if you are going to have these\u00a0\nokay so i'm just gonna let it sink in um and\u00a0\u00a0 i'll just keep reporting out to you guys as i go\u00a0\nthrough my process here okay y'all i had to go\u00a0\u00a0 lay down because then it started to hit me and\u00a0\ni was like oh my god so how do i feel it is now 10 36 so it's been what is that 40 minutes yeah\u00a0\nit's been 40 minutes since i took the gummy\u00a0\u00a0 um i've been watching tik tok videos\u00a0\nso probably not the best thing to do\u00a0\u00a0 if you're trying to go to sleep but uh\u00a0\ni feel relaxed i feel calm i am feeling\u00a0\u00a0 drowsy like i can feel my eyelids getting heavy\u00a0\num they started watering for a hot minute too i feel kind of like heavy if that makes\u00a0\nsense like i'm lying down and i just feel\u00a0\u00a0 heavy not fat heavy though i don't\u00a0\nknow what's going on over here but like\u00a0\u00a0 just you know like when you're sleeping and\u00a0\nyou're just dead weight yeah i feel like i'm\u00a0\u00a0 already like a dead weight like i think my body\u00a0\nis already sleeping and it's like shut up now\u00a0\u00a0 and turn this off and go to bed so i'm gonna do\u00a0\nthat i'm gonna go to sleep and then i'll report\u00a0\u00a0 back to you guys tomorrow morning how i slept and\u00a0\nhow i feel until then good night good morning so\u00a0\u00a0 i slept great uh i went to bed around i think it\u00a0\nwas like 10 30 when i stopped talking to you guys\u00a0\u00a0 i was feeling sleepy at that point i wouldn't\u00a0\nsay i felt high or stoned or euphoric but i\u00a0\u00a0 definitely felt something and i've been trying to\u00a0\nthink of the word to use to explain it but like\u00a0\u00a0 nothing was spinning nothing was dizzy but i\u00a0\ncould feel a shift in my body but it wasn't like\u00a0\u00a0 a bad shift but i knew something was happening\u00a0\nbut it wasn't like concerning or anything but\u00a0\u00a0 i just want to let you guys know that so that\u00a0\nyou don't feel that i didn't tell you that if\u00a0\u00a0 you do start to feel that it was totally normal\u00a0\num fell into a really deep sleep like i could\u00a0\u00a0 tell i was in a deep sleep according to this my\u00a0\nscore was a 95 out of 100 which was great sleep\u00a0\u00a0 um i i did i did notice that i was in such a deep\u00a0\nsleep that i usually have to wake up in the middle\u00a0\u00a0 of the night to pee um for those of you under\u00a0\n30 and don't know what that feels like enjoy it\u00a0\u00a0 because the minute you turn 30 um like at least\u00a0\nfor me when i turn 30 and now i wake up to pee\u00a0\u00a0 in the middle of the night and i had i struggled\u00a0\na little bit trying to get up because i was in\u00a0\u00a0 such a deep sleep i couldn't wake myself up to\u00a0\ngo and do that like it was like it was a fight\u00a0\u00a0 you know what i mean like my bladder was like let\u00a0\nme out and my resume my body was like no we're\u00a0\u00a0 not going anywhere so there was that and then in\u00a0\nthe morning um even at 8 am i probably could have\u00a0\u00a0 slept more um that would have given me nine hours\u00a0\nof sleep and i could have slept more but the other\u00a0\u00a0 good thing about this is like when i woke up and i\u00a0\ngot myself to wake up because of my alarm clock i\u00a0\u00a0 didn't feel groggy so like i used to take advil pm\u00a0\nand if i woke up before it was time to wake up i\u00a0\u00a0 would feel groggy i just shook this off like so i\u00a0\nam uh excited about these i think these are great\u00a0\u00a0 i'm gonna definitely use them on the weekends um\u00a0\ndefinitely do not use these before you're driving\u00a0\u00a0 a vehicle or if you have to wake up early like say\u00a0\nyou only get five six seven hours of sleep stay\u00a0\u00a0 away from these but these are like my new favorite\u00a0\nthing i cannot wait for the weekend to try one\u00a0\u00a0 of these i will be back with a daytime video on\u00a0\nthe orange crush since it's a sativa it's really\u00a0\u00a0 good for the daytime so i will be back with this\u00a0\nreview but for then i will talk to you guys later", "R0FAuYfxmNw": "if you watch the show often you know i typically roll but i'm feeling lazy tonight so i'm gonna pack a cone friends tell me [Music] how you guys doing tonight it's gp here from cbd hemp library um if you watched the show before then you recognize me if you haven't welcome to the show welcome to your first episode it's kind of crazy to think for me to think that this could be somebody's first episode really just because we've made 300 not even because we're so big or anything because we're not that big but it's just wild for some of the first video to be the 300th video but let me get into said video what are we talking about today i guess today i'll talk about the downsides of delta eight thc sorry i'm about to start packing this and then i'll get to talking all right so the downside to delta eight thc well for me i would say the downsides depend on the product so for the first product i will talk about i will talk about edibles which we do have on sale right now one bottle left but with the edibles the biggest downside to me in all honesty which is something you'll deal with with all thc so this is i'm probably gonna get some comments below like that's if you deal with anything but the cottonmouth associated with delta h thc edibles seems to be more intense than other edibles and other forms of thc that i've had whether it's smoking delta eight whether it's a delta eight tinctures whether it's normal delta nine the cottonmouth associated with delta h thc just always seems to be extreme like sergio says it as well when the edibles the a big way you can tell they're starting to hit in my opinion is that cottonmouth really starts to starts to settle in so if this is something that you deal with please comment below um i don't want people to think i'm crazy and i'm sure you don't think i'm crazy because it is a normal a normal marijuana issue if you will but at the same time in my experience or in my opinion how much cotton mouth you get for how much you eat for delta eight edibles it's intense really don't need much more than that see i only have it like a little over halfway so typically i just burn off the top if i don't want to pack the whole thing sometimes i don't want to pack the whole thing i'll be sitting here talking to you guys forever if i smoke that whole thing and i know y'all don't want that [Music] i am packing some rocket fuel inside this cone today and we do have it on sale as well because square is [ __ ] with us but the next the next downside i would say about delta 8 t8c is with the carts and we haven't gotten a lot of complaints with our carts but many of the carts many of the disposables they leak in the normal delta 9 they leak as well but for some reason or maybe with some distillates um the delta 8 just seems to be so runny like if we get some delta eight dabs and we leave them out at like room temperature a lot of times they get runny they get liquidy everything gets sticky which is another downside when it's running and gets sticky and they get nasty if you have a disposable and it gets on the top then you put in your pocket now you have lint hanging off the top of your disposable and it's just not an ideal situation so the viscosity of um delta eight thc um the the distillate is another downside i would say a lot of times it gets really messy if you're dealing with the dabs if you're dealing with the dabs i would really suggest freeze them um and that's something you could say for dogs 9 as well but often delta 9 you can still leave them at room temperature and they're okay many times the delta eight dabs are not okay at room temperature any of you guys that smoke delta dabs watch out for that and for the carts make sure you vape them at the right temperature and not all of them are the same but in general i've seen the 2.5 to kind of uh i would say even up to 3.5 depending on what type of terps are in there um for them oh [ __ ] i forgot to head back but that's what i would really suggest is to just find the right temperature when it comes to the vapes or else if it's at too low of a temperature then it pulls it not already vaporized and so now you have even extra oil pulling up with a already liquidy substance so guys when it comes to distillate one be careful in terms of putting your hands on and stuff like that because because it comes because it becomes really sticky but also just make sure that you also freeze the dabs when you get them and make sure that the temperature is right when you set the pin which i would say i'd say 2.5 more than like like 2.7 to 3.5 somewhere in there um to make sure that it's not too harsh but also make sure that you're vaporizing the distillate before it kind of goes up the up the cylinder so that's a tip for you guys but that's also kind of a downside with delta eight is the viscosity or the lack of viscosity i didn't do too well in science but i know viscosity is the resistance of things to flow so that would mean since it doesn't have a lot of resistance to it flow it would have a low viscosity right please comment below if i'm correct i may be smoking but i will just some school another downside about delta hthc next i'll talk about the flour so when it comes to the flour um the distillate is infused with cbd flour that's what delta 8 flour is so now more things are at play so the cbd flour has to first off be quality cbd flour the distillate has to be quality distillate and it has to be infused correctly to where there's oil throughout the bud because a lot of times they'll just spray it'll be a light coat on the outside but all that dense cbd flower on the inside has no delta eight therefore you're getting uneven smoke it's sprayed unevenly it's just not a good situation so um that's another downside to delta thc and it's not saying that's all budged you have to be careful you have to make sure the company is using good cbd flour is using good distillate and is infused throughout and these are questions you could ask like if you ask us i can tell you that our rocket fuel is infused throughout and it is the top shelf on cbd buds but that's something that you should ask these companies before you buy it just in my opinion because that's what we've seen and we're in the industry obviously trying as many things as anybody i'm told i can tell you that some of the cbd flour it's harsh because the cbd flour isn't good and also um some of the distillate that we also smoke is pretty low quality on top of the fact that sometimes the buds aren't infused well with the distillate which doesn't make for as pleasant of a smoking experience considering that we do have dota 8 products available i am definitely not making this video um to scare anyone off from using delta 8 thc but at the same time i think that informed customers are always good customers so i just wanted to kind of let you guys know and and kind of just share some light on the delta thc market what to watch out for what some things are good to buy and what some things aren't good to buy and obviously we have tons of videos explaining these things but just some things to watch out for like having good quality flour like be careful of the disposables you get because sometimes they get runny so be careful about keeping your pocket keeping them and things like that i have had oil run out of the pen onto something i was wearing or something like that so definitely be careful with that and when it comes to first i talked about the edibles and when it comes to the edibles um keep a drink close by because that cotton mouth gets real it gets real sorry if i've been talking kind of fast i try to make sure i get all the information in my normal style is to more just lay back chill out just make a video but i want to make sure that i don't stretch the video out too long so people can get all the information possible i know people's attention spans are very very short so guys these are just some things i wanted to share with you i'm not trying to convince you to buy delta 8 or not to buy delta 8 is definitely a very viable option it's a product that i personally enjoy but cbd hemp library we were created to kind of warn you guys about what products you should buy and what products you shouldn't buy um and that's kind of just what i'm trying to give you a general guideline for so when you're looking for quality products last time i talked about terpenes today i'm talking about just what is quality and what is not quality and if you don't have a quality product some of the reasons i name today may be the reason why obviously cotton mouth is something that can't be helped you're just gonna have to keep some water close but these are some things i wanted to point out to you guys um so guys i definitely appreciate you hanging out with me i talked about delta thc talked about the flower talks about the vapes talked about the edibles if you guys have any questions about delta hthc please feel free to reach out to us dm us email us we can get you answers we can tell you about the products we tell you about our products here about other companies products we've tried so many so guys i really appreciate it like i said it's been gp another episode cbd hemp library legally lifted you name it we're putting content on it appreciate it guys [Music] peace [Music] you", "w61k7fOTqeI": "[Music]", "QJdU5VXo85M": "great fruit delicious breakfast snack or cold-blooded citrus murderer you probably know there are some drugs that you shouldn't take with alcohol but did you know there are also loads of drugs that you shouldn't take with grapefruit so what does it do let's think about what happens when you normally take a pill when you swallow a tablet it goes down through your stomach and into your small intestine that's where most drugs get absorbed and so the concentration of the medication in your blood will start to increase as it slowly gets absorbed through those intestine walls that means that hopefully it'll actually this threshold the so called therapeutic dose and that's the level at which the drug can do its good work be that relieving the pain from your headache lowering your blood pressure or even killing cancer cells the concentration keeps on rising until it's all been absorbed hopefully getting nowhere near this threshold the lethal dose that's when you've taken enough of the drug to kill you the perfect drug has a nice low therapeutic dose and a very high lethal one meaning it doesn't take much to make you better but it does take a lot to do you harm the next thing that happens is your body notices these weird drug molecules floating around in your system and it starts to break them down that's the reason that you can't just take a paracetamol and never feel pain again it's only a few hours before the liver has broken down most of those paracetamol molecules it slips below the therapeutic dose and need to pop another pill to top-up the pain killing effect the problem is that grapefruit is stuffed full of molecules which interfere with the way your body processes drugs they disrupt enzymes the chemicals which break down drug molecules which means the drugs aren't broken down in the way that we expect so the three ways that grapefruit can kill you one allowing too much drug to be absorbed there are enzymes in your intestinal wall that break down a drug as soon as it starts to be absorbed and that means that not all the medication from a tablet is going to make it into your bloodstream normally when a doctor decides on the dose of this drug they'll take this effect into account so I'll give you slightly more in the tablet so this effect doesn't matter grapefruit disables these enzymes which means when you take a drugged you can absorb more of it without it getting broken down and that can lead to you absorbing a toxic dose to stopping your body breaking down the drug when are you taking medication regularly the dose and the period between doses are determined to make sure that you always stay safely between the therapeutic level and the lethal one grapefruit stops the breakdown of the drug in your liver and that means that over time you can slowly build up to a lethal dose of medicine 3 stopping the drug being made in the first place ok this is the strangest one because we know that your body has these enzymes to process foreign molecules sometimes we don't give a drug in its active form we give us something called a pro drug which is a molecule no body can break down into the drug you actually want when you take codeine the way that works is that the codeine molecules are broken down by enzymes in your liver to give you morphine which is a powerful painkiller unfortunately grapefruit blocks the action of those enzymes which means that if you take codeine with grapefruit you're not going to get much pain killing effect this effect could mean that you never make it to the therapeutic level in the first place which means if you're taking your drug that's keeping you alive like anti-cancer drug then this is the third way that grapefruit could kill you what's really crazy is we didn't even know about this effect until 1989 and it's not just grapefruit other citrus crazy fruit include the Seville orange often used in marmalade Pomerleau and lime we now know that these fruit can affect absolutely loads of different drugs for example triazole am my dazzling my trouser Pam diazepam viagra that one warfarin and zolpidem and that's not even the complete list the enzyme blocking effects of grapefruit can last for several days and there's nothing you can really do you just have to wait for them to wear off they also affect different people in very unpredictable ways which means we can't just compensate by changing the dose of medication grapefruit may seem like a benign breakfast but I think this thing should come with a warning label [Music]", "to5i65TnyzI": "do you want to learn how to pick the right type of pectin to make jams jellies and even chewy candies well today on WTF we're gonna cover all of our types of pectin and how to make a great grapefruit marmalade strawberry jelly and even chewy candies [Music] hello and welcome to WTF where we transform food here in the modernist pantry Test Kitchen I'm chef Scot Guerin and I'm Jani Wang one of the owners of modernist pantry here on WTF every week we cover unique ingredients techniques we share fun recipes and demos so that you can get started in advancing on your culinary journey so remember subscribe ring the bell do whatever it is today that you need to do to get notified of our content it comes out every single Tuesday ok so today we're actually going to be doing a follow up to one of our very first WTF ever which is all about pectin because we get a lot of calls and emails here about what type of pectin do I use when do I use it how much of it do I use and because we carry so many different types it can be confusing so today Scott's gonna cover exactly what the differences are and of course you know a few recipes and common applications on when to use each one alright Scott we have 4 different types of pectin here can you really just kind of high-level how do people understand what the differences are or so we're gonna start at the top there's a champ actin and LM pectin okay first one we're going to cover is hm pectin hm pectin is that most common pectin that people are looking for something that you're going to use with sugar something you're gonna use with fruit if you wanted no sugar then you would go with LM pected but we can talk about that later and how that works so hm pectin there's two types there's rapid set and slow set and it's very simple once you understand what it's used for rapid set is if you're making home jam and you're canning at home you're gonna put it in there heat it up and then put it into your refrigerator and let it set or even onto your shelf and let it set you want rapid set if you're just doing it at home rapid sets perfect for whatever you're making now if you're doing large batches say you want to do a farmers market or you want to even you know industrial commercially sell your jam or or jelly you're gonna use slow set and it's just gonna take longer to set up you're not gonna have to worry about it setting it in the heating vessel or anything like that I'm just going to take a little bit longer now if you're looking for apple pectin yellow pectin all these names that the people call them fruit pectin all those things this is going to be hm pectin okay so when everyone's looking for though because they're labeled like that by different brands this is hm pectin which is high methoxy pectin so let's do a quick demo and when we're done with that we can kind of jump into Ln pectin because I want to show see people just how easy it is to work with hm pectin so this is a rapidset pectin we're going to make a strawberry jam but it's kind of brought up to the next degree right we wanted to make the most flavorful strawberry jam that complements the strawberries the best so first I'm gonna start with just our liquid which is a little bit of white wine and a little bit of red wine now you can substitute both these for rose' you can do whatever you want with it if you say don't like red wine or white wine use grape juice whatever but I like the the red wine or white wine it's not going to add any extra sugar but it's going to add that acetic acid is one of the things that makes hm pectin work two things make it work high percentage of sugar and acid so without those two things it really won't fully set up it won't get that jam or jelly texture like that when you spread it it you know stays really beautiful on top of like whatever it is English muffin like we have here so I'm just gonna heat this up quickly just to get a little bit of the alcohol off of our our wine but then we just have strawberries and we cut them in quarters if you like more of a pureed type of jelly or Jam just mash these up and you can put them right in there but we want them to be in quarters so while this is starting to steam I'm just going to add in my strawberries and the natural juice will come out of the strawberries themselves now while that heats up a little bit I'm gonna show you what you do with your pectin so I'm going to add my pectin directly into my sugar and I have a little bit of citric acid here that's also going to help that pectin set okay so they don't use any wine or any type of other you know acidic liquid do they just add more citric acid to get that acidity or do you have to add us yes so liquid it works below 3.5 on the pH scale okay to some people that might just sound like gibberish so what that is is you want to have a good little bite to the acidity if you taste it and you get that little kind of pinch in your cheek you're about the right acidity for what you're doing and yes if if you are making this at home and you're not familiar with you know citric acid or anything like that for about one pint of jam or jelly you're going to use a teaspoon so it's really kind of simple ratio that you can do there because this is one pint that we're making and I just use one teaspoon of citric acid and it is also to taste if you want to be a little bit more acidic balanced with the amount of sugar that you have to add all right so I have my strawberries in here the wine is starting to simmer I have some honey some nice local honey we have get that out so whatever your flavors are for your jam or jelly you can add them if you don't like strawberries or anything you could add any other berry to this and it work just fine and the exact same amounts and also vanilla so every little thing we can do to kind of accentuate that strawberry we're going to do it right so I have my pectin citric acid and sugar mixed all up in here I'm just going to move some of the fruit out of the middle because I want to get into that liquid and I'm just going to stir it in so now some people have asked me recently and this is actually great that we're filming this today because it was a question just came in and people were saying well don't I have to heat it then I need to put it into the jars or containers and then heat it again right so if you are using a sterilized jar and you are heating your strawberry liquid up to a boil this is also going to be sterilized as long as there's no contaminants between here and there you don't have to worry about it if you put it in there and you put the sterilized lid on top and you let it sit on your counter it will set it will seal that jar because it's hot enough and it's continuing to sterilize the inside if it is above 185 degrees which is boiling it's 212 Fahrenheit so as we're mixing this up you can see we just want to barely cook those strawberries so that they release their liquid I'm going to lower it down just a little bit just below a boil and let that go but you can already see the pectin doing its job by thickening is it at first it will thicken yeah and then when it cools it will set a little bit on here in the chute it should be all set look right I I could take this right now depending on how cooked I want my strawberries I can take this put this into jars as long as they are hot enough and they are sterilized I can have them to be you know canned and ready to go on my shelf or even into my refrigerator or eaten within an hour or so some is very simple to do to make a strawberry jam if you don't want to eat all that sugar we have to go to Ella and pectin okay LM pectin is a pectin that is Lomas oscillation which means it needs something else to gel it doesn't need sugar actually if too much sugar it won't work May and if there's too much acid it won't work so it works in the opposite way it uses calcium so it needs to have some sort of calcium in it to gel now the way you get it sweet because I did make a a grapefruit jam here our grapefruit marmalade and grapefruits are generally a little bit better they do have some sugar content to them but you definitely have to balance it with something else I use I'll at all xylitol there's a sweetener that we have here and it's very close to the same sweetness as like granulated sugar but you don't have to worry about it you know messing up your pectin okay so if you're going to be adding the LM pectin to this you would make it the exact same way you would just mix the LM pectin with the xylitol and then we have to add a calcium and the calcium you can add as calcium lactate calcium lactate gluconate I would not add something like calcium yeah exactly because yeah very salty kind of flavor to it and you don't want to do that you don't want to change what you're putting into the jar but the same method you heat it up cook it to the point where you want it put it into your sterilized jar can it and it's ready to go you don't have to worry about you know boiling it again and then trying to get those boiled jars out with something which is always dangerous so as long as it's hot going in and this is sterilized you're gonna be good but it's super simple until you go oh wait there's 2 LM pectins yeah so LM pectin like I said requires calcium and if you go to a store or you've used a calcium gelling pectin before it's usually called like a universal pectin which is like a branding name for it but the real name is Helen pectin there's two types the regular LM and then Amma dated okay and Amma dated is a word that's very kind of difficult or intimidating because none not many people know what it is I don't know Amma dating she changed so that it only needs a very small amount of calcium okay yeah between 10 and 13 milligrams per gram of LM pectin so okay very small like things like blackberries will just gel on their own and when they're added to it because they have enough natural calcium in them you can also do other types of fruits and you just add your own calcium to it but it just takes a very small amount of calcium and then boom it works so it'll set up it'll gel up you know as you make it I can actually see this starting to gel up already see it right there so this is perfect yep alright so in our cooled one should be very ready very soon then we wanted to put it on something so we made some English muffins and that recipe is gonna be on the blog as well we don't have to cover it too much is just a great little rustic kind of English muffin recipe yeah lots of nooks and crannies and yeah it goes great with the jams and jellies but like I said before you can take either one of these and then you can change the flavor you can make any type of marmalade you can even remove all the grapefruit that's in this and replace it with any fruit and this base recipe could work with anything so just know that as long as you are you know following the amounts of water and pectin it's going to work yeah and as always you can get all today's recipes on our blog which all the links will be in the description below as well as I think a really and dandy chart that actually lays out a lot of stuff that Scot just talked about if you're like I'm diligently taking notes but it's a lot of information don't worry go to the blog the chart will be there for you to reference so you can get this information at any time it's from my handy-dandy notebook yeah and I think you know well I want to eat this but like before I eat this one of the things that people have also been like emailing and calling in a lot about is you know like I want to make a pectin gummy so they've they want that gummy bear texture but they want to make it with a pectin so what can you talk a little bit about you know like what exactly is going on there yeah so that's that's a really common question is people are looking for a way to make a type of gummy that doesn't require gelatin all the time right and pectin is one that people go to because it's used a lot for this type of thing but when you go to try to make it it doesn't necessarily work it's very soft okay so when you have something very soft like that and not not super chewy it's called pet to flee or pet date if week depending on where you're from and what that is is just like a really soft pretty much jelly then you have it's not that chewy that you're looking for but to change it and make it chewy you actually have to mess with the sugar so you have to heat the sugar to about 235 240 degrees while you have the entire mixture and then there's also another thing and you can see we did an Instagram video of it cuz it's really cool once you get it up to that point you take a small solution of the citric acid so it's not in there already when you add the citric acid at the end it starts to gel Oh interesting so you kind of hold off so you're able to cook that sugar and that's where people you know don't necessarily because I'm here with pectin I can just add the citric acid it works yeah but when I do a jelly or like a gummy or a chewy candy I have to wait till the end because I have to be able to cook that sugar if I add the citric acid too early it's going to set and burn and I don't want that so so you have to cook the sugar and then you add in the citric acid right before you pour it into a mold and once it sets coated in sugar cut them roll them and eat them and Jane if you want to try one I'm gonna try one okay I'm going for the great what's this white one delicious it's lemon ah oh my least favorite flavor too late but anyway so I think just kind of think we also want to highlight here which is that when you do these you're not gonna get a traditional gummy bear if you do want something that's closer to that we would probably recommend checking out our Druids grow vegan gelatin and there's an entire separate WTF and and like recipes all about that but you are looking for to make a really nice pectin candy then this is probably the right product for you yeah these are chewy they're soft but they have a nice bite to them you're never gonna get that bouncing as that you would get from gelatin it's not the same product if one is a protein one is a carbohydrate so right they're not gonna work that way and we also wrote an entire article on it which is probably gonna be in the link in the description below so you can go there and read all that so we have tons of different things for you to be able to understand these different types of pectin so you can figure out what you need and when you need it yeah and right right before we wrap up I just want to take a quick 30 second and we should mention NH pectin only because it's pretty special and we have another WTF all about that so we're not gonna go crazy diving into it but just mention it because people are gonna see it on that conversion chart on the blog yes so NH pectin very simply is an L M pectin and amedeo Ln pectin that already has the calcium in it required to gel so you can just use that as a kind of a one-stop shop for your L M pectin needs so you can take that put it in there and one great thing about it thermo reversible so let's say I mess something up I can take it out put it back into a pan melt it back down which you can't do with hm pectin melt it back down and then I'm able to read jorrick can it said it whatever I need to do okay well this was a lot of information so hopefully you've enjoyed learning a little bit more about pectin and hopefully walking away with like oh yeah I think I know which type of pectin will be right for me in the future and if not at least you'll have their

review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of your dispensary uh accidentally jumped the gun forgot to record this once so i already opened this package that was just a moment ago haven't eaten anything welcome to weeds guys with a review show here on welcome to wheats everyone the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of your dispensary classic ass episode today which means yes a good old-fashioned edible and one of the most old-fashioned kinds of weed edibles the gummy that's right we're taking a look at wanna one of the makers of the cannabis infused sour gummies these ones your standard 100 milligram edible 10 different uh pieces at 10 each however these ones are also a cbd blend uh at a ratio that they actually have listed incorrectly there of 10 to one even though it should be one to ten the way they have it listed in that it is 10 milligrams of thc per piece one milligram of cbd per piece 100 milligrams of thc total 10 milligrams of cbd total in this package in these strawberry gummies i picked this up and i accidentally already opened it was recording didn't realize my bad haven't tried any i picked these up for 18 bucks at a dispensary here in long beach california which is a slight premium i would say over there traditional gummy edibles which probably average about 15 so a definite premium there not a whole lot but something to notice and again it doesn't have that nominal amount of cbd in it which i'm curious if it's going to have an effect on me that's not a lot of cbd i'm guessing it probably won't but we'll be on the lookout for it um and on here as well as all the good stuff you want to see they've got lab testing results although this is nearly a year old at this point which is a little disconcerting but whatever uh nutrition information all that good stuff so let's go ahead and take a look at the most important stuff the gummies themselves these 18 gummies and here you go looks just like that 10 of these squares in there oh smells very strawberry not very weedy at all mostly just strawberry well let's go ahead and give it a bite give it a test see what it's like gummy weedy strawberry a lot of wheat flavor actually more wheat flavor than i was expecting not grotesque but for the gummy candies higher than average but otherwise a totally fine gummy candy nice soft chewy okay well i would say in terms of taste a slightly weedier taste than your like plus or your steezy gummies but not revolting in any shape or form but it's there uh but of course guys it's not the taste that we're in this for trying to figure out if they're gonna work or not are they gonna make you hide and for that well that's what we're gonna have to wait around and see um so uh any time i do gummies i like to try to do them under the optimal conditions i don't think i said this i did have a little bit of fat beforehand just to make sure it's going to hit me just right not necessarily for you or for everybody i do it just in case so i had a little bit of fat before just for the optimal thc absorption um but it's still going to take a while to hit the old bloodstream so i'm going to finish these gummies off of the next i don't know hour so do all 10 as we do here on wheats we review the whole product i'm going to review them over the next or as i said eat them over the next hour and then two hours after i have that last one or thereabouts i'll come back to you guys and give you our wrap-up thoughts the most important part of the edible review is it gonna get us high and for that guys you're just gonna have to stick around and i'll be back in just a bit to let you know our wrap-up thoughts about these wanna sour strawberry gummies well here's one for the blooper reels guys i'm back two hours two and a half hours later with these wanna cannabis infused sour gummies uh and as you can see with my eyes they are pure as the driven snow uh and i came here with a really bad review i was gonna come and really trash them as i was like these are pretty um non-existent non-existent in terms of the high that i feel from these wanna cannabis infused sour gummies uh and i was gonna say something along the effects of well maybe it's the 10 to 1 ratio and maybe that little 10 percent of that welcome back to wheats guys it has been two and a half hours since my first uh bite at the wanna cannabis infused sour gummies and if i look very very sober you're correct um i this guys is gonna be one for the blooper reel uh i came here to excoriate the uh folks at wanna i'm saying that these gummies basically did nothing to me all ten of them felt practically nothing and i was originally going to think well maybe it has something to do with that um strange 1 to 10 ratio of cbd to thc and maybe just that 10 cbd was enough to totally blunt the thc and but not provide any of those cbd benefits that was just i've said i was gonna feel like i felt just kind of peaceful but that's about it not really high at all uh and that's because that is actually the case uh i had it wrong not them well actually the bud bud tender had it wrong uh i ordered the one to ten and they gave me the ten to one uh so this really is 10 cbd milligrams to 1 thc so this is 100 milligrams of ca cbd 10 milligrams of thc the exact opposite of what i thought it was um at least i know that i know when i'm high or not and i was definitely not high in any traditional sense with these but that's on me not on them this one's for the blooper reel we'll have to review wanna again in the future this was just a fun little [ __ ] up um and an 18 mistake so uh wanna i am sorry i uh did not mean to disparage i don't know anything about you just yet i do know that my bud tender [ __ ] up the order uh oh well uh [ __ ] happens but we will check you out again in the future apologize for that it's been fun it's been funny anyways that's gonna do it that's gonna do it for this non-existent review here on wheats no cherry on top just a big shame on me thank you so much for watching guys stay high and more importantly stay healthy and we'll see you guys right back here for our next review live stream or even [ __ ] up see you then bye", "Kq6oNcd3d-U": "Whether or not you have anxiety, you\u2019ve\nprobably heard of Xanax. Somewhere north of 50 million Americans have\na prescription for the drug, making it the 3rd most prescribed medication in the country. That\u2019s a lot of pills. What\u2019s in them? How do they work? This is your anxious brain, and this is your\nanxious brain on Xanax. First let\u2019s talk about what anxiety looks\nlike in the brain. Doctors are still working out the root causes\nof anxiety--the brain is a complicated thing. What they\u2019ve noticed though is that when\npeople are feeling anxious or panicked, there\u2019s an uptick in activity in these parts of the\nbrain responsible for processing emotions and making decisions. We don\u2019t fully understand why that\u2019s happening. It may be that natural checks on overactivity\nare on the fritz. But it helps explain why Xanax works. Xanax--also called alprazolam--is part of\na class of drugs called triazolobenzodiazepines. Molecule names are like one of those German\nwords that\u2019s really a whole sentence smashed together. When scientists hear that crazy-sounding keysmash,\nthey can actually tell how each syllable relates to the molecule\u2019s structure. Since xanax\u2019s structure is key to how it\nworks, let\u2019s take a quick dive in. Triazolo refers to these three nitrogen atoms\nat the top. Benzo is for benzene, the ring of carbon atoms\non the left. And diazepine is the ring between them with\ntwo nitrogens. Xanax\u2019s shape lets it interact with proteins\non the outside of neurons in your brain. These GABA-A receptors are gates that let\nchloride ions into your neurons. Chloride ions are really important because\nthey disrupt the balance of electrical charges between the inside and outside of the neuron. Charge is crucial since neurons use electrical\nimpulses to send their signals. Here\u2019s what I mean. Your neurons are like wires that send signals\nall through your body. Where one neuron meets another, the messages\nare carried by molecules. But inside the neuron, the signals are electric. When the charge balance is disrupted, the\nsignal\u2019s get interrupted. It\u2019s a bit like a relay race. The runner is an electrical signal moving\ndown the axon. At the end of her leg, she passes a molecular\nbaton across the synapse. But if you\u2019ve taken a Xanax, the charge\nbalance along the axon is out of whack wherever there\u2019s a GABA-A receptor. Almost like someone dug a bunch of holes along\nthe relay racer\u2019s track. That\u2019s going to make it a lot harder for\nher to get the baton to the next neuron. She might not be strong enough to hand the\nbaton off at the end, she might not even make it through her leg, or she might never leave\nthe starting blocks to begin with. The Xanax molecule is like a key that fits\nin the GABA-A lock. The shape, structure and orientation of the\nrings helps Xanax fit snugly in GABA-A\u2019s binding pocket. That triggers the flood of chloride ions into\nyour neurons. If there\u2019s no signal to the next neuron,\nyour brain quiets down. There are biological molecules in your brain\nthat do the same thing to GABA-A; Xanax is just copying their work. For whatever reason, those natural processes\naren\u2019t working in the right way in the anxious brain. So by activating their GABA-A receptors and\nquieting their neurons, Xanax is like hugging your dog during a thunderstorm and telling\nher everything is going to be okay. But for your brain. Kind of nice, right? On the flip side though, one of the side effects\nof Xanax is sleepiness or sluggishness. The drug is basically stopping your brain\nfrom talking so much, and it starts to feel like nap time. Now, scientists don\u2019t know exactly which\nneurons or parts of the brain cause anxiety. Recent research points to some likely culprits. What we do know is that Xanax is effective\nfor helping people with acute anxiety live a normal life. Unfortunately, Xanax can lead to addiction,\nespecially for people who are abusing it and not taking it under doctor\u2019s orders. Overdoses are a problem too. Xanax and other benzodiazepines are among\nthe drugs that send people to the ER the most, at least in the USA. Some doctors worry that Xanax and other drugs\nin its class are being prescribed too often or too casually. That said, for the millions around the world\nwho use it to treat panic attacks and other anxiety issues, Xanax can be a lifesaver. Have any other chemistry questions about how\nthe body works? Or want to know how other drugs do what they\ndo? Leave them in the comments and we might tackle\nthem in a future episode. Thanks for watching.", "cwiIKSCAuxo": "[Music] hello everyone it's me the cannabis reviewer i am back for another exciting week of grow welcome to my winter my 2020 2021 winter growing season i'm growing creamed caramel and orange sherbet cannabis plants they're in their fifth week of the flowering stage and they're in the fourth day of the fifth week of their flowering stage and today's a great video it happens to be also happens to be monday march 22nd 2021 and in this video we're gonna show you a weekly update of my beautiful ladies and how great they're doing and i'm gonna tell you what it's been awesome it's been an awesome week uh let's get to the ladies i'll get down and show them to you real quick and then i'll talk a little bit about what we've been doing and then uh we'll get up and close and personal with them and also take pictures with mine beautiful and also just take pictures i should say not and overlay them on the videos so you get a better a little clearer view of what's going on because this camera does have issues sometimes with the light balance but without further ado let's go ahead and get it started if you oh [ __ ] if you haven't been to my channel before go back and watch my previous video that i uh last week i do it every week i do an update on my grow so you can go back and look at the fourth week and the third and the first and the second all the way back to seedling all the way back to me picking it look at this i am beyond happy right now i am beyond happy guys i am so let's look at our ladies what do what do we got going on well all of that that's cream caramel all being scrogged over here that front one cream caramel back to those are the orange sherbets look how much bigger they are than the cream caramel they're really growing great and i will show them to you here up close here in just a minute but let's just talk about it i've been using bottom feeding watering method and feeding method i've been giving each plant three pints of water or feed i've been following the fox farm uh soil soil schedule soil nutrient schedule whatever it's called and um it's been working real well for me to be quite honest a lot of people look at those schedules and they do it differently i've been going full strength on them but flushing after every three feedings i've gone through and did a flush with sledgehammer so far i've been pretty pleased really pleased with what's going on and as you can see i mean proof's in the pudding right wait till we get closer and i show you some of this [ __ ] i mean uh it's something else it's just i think i do a better job of uh ls10 and everything than scroggin but you know it's still looking pretty damn good the ladies were fed yesterday and you can go back you can see a video of me feeding them if you want to check it out that would be good it's just a sea of bud i love it and let me tell you something i just updated my grow box on this side here and you can barely see them but they're right there and notice the red coming off of them i have two led pucks from rapid led sort of their photo red uh is the color i forget exact the the exact nanometers i want to say i think it's uh 650 nanometers something like that but it's meant to enhance uh production of uh of the buds getting the yield and getting them increased in intensity and so i bought one first put it in uh didn't know if i was going to buy another one it was kind of just testing it out and then overnight these buds here start developing orange hairs underneath only the plant only the plant underneath that red light so i'm like wow really so i went and bought another one and i put it in and you can go back and check out my long ass video of me doing that but i designed it and had trouble with it because i didn't i didn't really design it 100 like from scratch i kind of what what i'd say one i winged it basically now and you know and every time you do something yourself let's do it yourself you'll have a design where you go okay i want to go this way and then when you start to put it together and implement it you realize oh [ __ ] oh i forgot about this or i didn't expect that or just whatever and you causes you to have a change so there is a change and changes that uh know if we can zoom in and see it here there it i have put in right back there that now is my new light i have that going over to my light switch here which is right there and what that does now is that feeds my lights on this whole right side and allows me to run those two led pucks on the same time schedule as light schedule as the big lights uh par has been increased almost 100 on the on the edges here where that we were having trouble so i'm extremely impressed with that too you know what can i say it looks great i guess the only thing i can really say is let's get up and close and personal and check it out this is the cannabis reviewer i'll be right back all right cannabis reviewer back let's get up and close and personal check this [ __ ] out i'm so pr impressed definitely my best grow this year it's only gonna get better guys i know how to grow i've grown gardens since i was a little [ __ ] and you know tomatoes and corn and beans and and so i know the process and then my used to grow grandma used to teach me and we used to grow flowers um but i couldn't tell you all the flowers she used to grow but yeah you know it's just you guys a grower you gotta figure out what works for you and once you figure that out you can run with it so like we'll go down here and look at these so you can see there's there's frosting going on already but these aren't orange notice they're not maybe starting there's some a little bit if i can get the [ __ ] thing to tune focus in maybe just a little bit of orange popping through i mean there is a little i guess but not wait till you see the other side wait til you see the other side it's definitely impressive but we're not there yet we're looking at this side and they don't look [ __ ] bad look at the frost seriously fifth week guys fifth week so i'm gonna come down like this let's really get into it now you can tell it's a photo this is a professional camera and you tell because the focal length you can really it can really help you or hurt you depending on how you want how it's used it does automatically do a great job of blurring [ __ ] out in the background once you get it focused but look at that look at these ladies wow trying to keep them all in focus oh yeah we're going to spend a little time on this and i don't give a damn let's go down below and look did another set round of trimming i know you guys say you go to trim and i know i know because it's wasting energy on [ __ ] that ain't gonna actually work i get that but uh you know i'm going with a little i don't want to be too aggressive like i did last time i'm kind of but i get you i got i did get rid of a lot of little popcorn nugs that were down there they weren't really growing that well and some of these like these really haven't had a chance to really pop through get real big but i'll let him go anyway what the hell yeah these ladies are i mean come on man that is looking good and she's stinky all right let's come back here one last look-see so you've seen it there she is in her glory there's my light notice and uh we'll i'm going to talk about that light too we'll get over here real quick because i'm telling you what i am so impressed can't believe how great these lights are oh my lord or lordy now yeah they're getting away but that's okay i'm good with that it's got a little i do have some browning on the leaf tips notice that though at least on it on a couple of these plants won't deny that so i am keeping an eye on that and if that gets any more aggressive then we're going to do some more a little bit more flushing and we'll stop we'll stop the nutrients all together and hit the flush a few times now this plant here you see some of the yellows our orange hair is down there but which you get to we get to the ones here in back going all over the place here look at this sun [ __ ] this is great that's what i'm talking about look at the [ __ ] frost look at the hairs you can already see the oranges orange hairs popping look at them on those and i rotated these plants as i told you you know i do that and when i fed them yesterday i rotated them so they are definitely you know the one here in the back here this one was up front and it had had the light hit it the most because it was the first light to get on it look how dense those [ __ ] buds are though look at that guys oh [ __ ] it is so hard to keep things in focus but let's look here so you can see the reds in the middle and the one right there that's barely lit that's the ir one infrared and those are basically the red blooming lights which is is basically what we got here same thing one two three four five one two three four one two three four five one two three four and the fifth one so i added those bad boys those two and go back and watch that video that you know you can zoom through and pass forward past all the talking that i do if you want obviously you know but uh it'll pay to go look and see how much bright how how bright the damn thing is you know but look at the buds they look great did some trimming on these as well not quite everything there are still leaves falling and dying but i try to get most of it that i could so i think it and now keep trimming slowly as need be but i am not going to go crazy i want to keep some of those sugar leaves to use i won't get rid of all of them but wow right don't you think guys doing a good job finally figured it out a little help from paul talking about his uh bottom feeding method me listening to him figuring it out that really helped and then you know just me working on the nutrients now it is true i got myself a little bit of a tip burn going on right that is true i do but um and i'll keep my on that for sure overall i think uh i think everything's pretty good we'll be putting i already had started the pictures i'm sure but if not they'll be going in this area here because i want to take a lot of pictures so i'm going to do some babbling uh while we're going you know i got one more feeding of uh nutrients though before i flush again and so and that's in three more days or whatever and we'll just keep an eye on those those beautiful looking buds because it's looking awesome fifth week we got four to five at least four to five more weeks to go and we don't really know i don't really know until i see all those crystals turn we're not there yet we're but uh we're making good progress for sure definitely going to keep it up i'm trying to figure out how to add some co2 i don't know i i found this tank and uh having trouble getting the damn top off of it it's so i don't know if i just want to spend the money and buy something new a couple hundred dollars or you know try to go cheap because i was gonna make my own co2 and not fill it up with regular gas but i'm still working on that thinking about it you know i was thinking about maybe throwing hanging a couple of those mushroom bags in here that make create co2 um let me know down below what y'all think if the if you've done that if it's worthwhile uh what else i think that's it we're just gonna keep doing what we do keep following me please like subscribe click the bell tell your friends keep coming back that would be great that would be great we're gonna start another grow soon i don't know what i'm gonna grow yet i am gonna grow some more on sherbet i do know that that [ __ ] i might and i think i got seeds left from both of those so i'll probably grow a couple strains of that and then maybe something else on top of it why not it's fun growing and i love it definitely do i love you all coming to my channel i love you all watching my videos thank you so much please keep coming back i do i

connection my name is jenny and i am located here in tempe arizona where recreational sales are legal for those that are 21 and older if you're just now joining me let me explain to you a little bit about what it is that i do on my channel what i do is i go around and i visit uh different dispensaries and i make specific purchases and then i come online and i test them out for you guys i research them a little bit i'll tell you a little bit about um where they came from and what they're good for and if they have any side effects um or negative effects i'll definitely let you know um about those as well so what i want to talk to you today about is i took the opportunity to go out to uh nirvana in tempe here and i was lucky enough to get a hold of this awesome strain called grapefruit juice this is a pre-roll let me see ah there it is this is a one gram pre-roll now i'm gonna tell you a little bit about this this is extremely strong like it's got some it's it's potent you can really smell it um a couple of the really good things that they said that this drain was good for one was for pain management and depression uh it also is good for stress so if you're looking for something that will kind of take care of all of those in a bundle i would definitely suggest this strain now this is a very clear-headed strain it's going to make you very focused on whatever you're doing so if you have projects this i will always suggest this as a good strain um and two of the side effects or two of the negative effects um that was mentioned oh sorry especially in leafly was um dry eyes and dry mouth now for those of us who have been smoking for quite some time you know that when you get a hold of certain strains they're going to cause you to have cottonmouth maybe more than others some will cause you to have itchy water uh itchy eyes and sometimes um some people have said that they've smoked this particular strain and gotten headaches and a hint of paranoia now of course i'm a seasoned smoker so paranoia is not something that i normally uh deal with but it is something that some people do so just be aware when you're picking up this strain so let's go ahead we're gonna we're gonna fire this up and we're gonna see what it tastes like i hope it tastes like grapefruit it's very floral and it's very sweet i can definitely taste the grapefruit in this which um some flower the names can be deceiving as i've also learned some of the vapes can be deceiving too now as you guys know i've been uh i've been doing this for just a minute but one of the things that i

"i5S24Iq2wf4": "[Music] all right so today we're doing the grapefruits train another sativa it's a beautiful day here in Washington and Cascadia Gardens swung by and dropped off some grapefruit so I snagged it for you guys we're gonna go ahead and do a reveal but I have it here so we can see it real quick just zoom in it's a very nice solid dense super crystal e bud covered in white orange and a little bit of purple throughout you can see the trichomes all throughout the stem and in the roots this was very nice Cascadia is one of my favorite forms to get cannabis they just do stuff a little differently they don't use any pesticides so you get too full full flavor of the cannabis but it's just very dense very rock hard sticky you know see it sticks to my fingers super-dense very spongy not rock-hard like normal but this is gonna be a from the gardens of Cascadia Cascadia farms and the great trip that i have the harvest date was April 25th so not too long ago but there's a total THC of 25.8 for THC active at 28% just regular THC a 1.2 percent no CVD s or CBD actives so just an overall pretty potent sativa above 23% prasit IVA is usually pretty good I remember normally they go from like 19 20 percent a lot of them so getting a pretty solid sativa with a little bit of indica backtrack do tend to get a little bit higher in the percentages but we'll go ahead and get some of this grinded up here we'll do some bong rips overall the smell of this flower is very very pungent it's one of my favorite smells as far as fruity that's like artisans Dutch very it's very very very full it smells like I'm sticking my my face actually into a bag of grapefruits and that's what's nice also to about the no pesticides is you can get there's no chemical smell or anything it doesn't overpower it you can get the full soil full flower smell and it's a very very fruity very pungent smell everything that I look for if I want to open a bag up that's what I want to smell it's very very fruity very earthy very sweet smelling get some no chemicals in it whatsoever just straight berries and grapefruit just like the name it all grind it up here do some some bong rips I tend to think that if you smoke through a bong a little bit of water ads you can get kind of the maximum flavor either that I like to a joint bongs are just going to preferred method in my afternoon it kind of helps cool me off chill me down a little bit so my body doesn't get super super hot so being smoking through the bong kind of adding that indica effect to it helps out a lot for me us Washington boys we're not easy to eat just a nice light green super fluffy very pungent very very skunky sweet awesome all right let's do some bong hits all right I'm excited to dis some ribs here I've had grapefruit actually a couple of times before going back about seven years ago when I first got my medical card here in the state of Washington me and my buddy at the time we went to the farmers market we had both received our medical cards at the same time we both went to the same doctor and I think he got hit as like a day before mine and at that same time when I got mine on the Friday there was a farmers market going on in Lacey and we went down there and I remember there one of the vendors being from like somewhere up north he had some grapefruit and it was like the most pinkish whitish just most chronic bud that I had seen and I grabbed it so that's why every time I like see grapefruit I just try and snack it up because it brings me back to the first times I ever bought any cannabis legally whatsoever so it's an overall really really good strain like I said earlier Cascadia is one of my favorite farms and they specialize in sativa as I tend to do a little bit more so Tina's just because there's more time in the day so it's really really nice so I saw that they got this this strain this strain specific helps me personally like with my anxiety I don't have any like panic attacks or any anxiety attacks to the grocery store or anything like that I don't have any social anxiety or nothing which is really nice it's finally nice to get a sativa a full sativa that doesn't really have any let's try this out me some ribs [Music] hmm not really too harsh on that exhale there's a bit of a kick to it it's definitely sweet it's earthy and sweet I know I did one of their strains or I've had one of their strains the Dirty Girl that's very sweet as well but this one has a little bit more of a kick to it a little bit more harsh I kind of tend to find out with more sativas normal partitions to it but it's nice because it does not hurt it doesn't burn too bad and I can sit there and take some pretty decent-sized ribs and not have to sit there and have a huge coughing attack so that's nice and I can still get the flavor out of it too which is really important in my opinion I think me being a cannabis I'm all all about the terpenes all about the taste I love to smell everything so just a very nice sweet sweet tasty cannabis the second hit didn't really have too much of a burn to it at all I think that's kind of how it is with most of them the first couple years probably a little bit harsh but it's nice I love the grapefruit it's got a very very pungent sweet taste to it very smooth after the first kick there it is start to kind of get towards the end of the ball it's got the harshness too it's not lovely sativa effect but it's really good I feel it I feel it already it's pretty rapid I'm really hot here it's about like 85 degrees and what's nice about I initially feel like this wave kind of go over me where it takes the heat away I feel nice and cool now I feel like definitely in my head behind my eyes straight up mentally change I already feel like motivated there's plenty of time the dam probably gonna go do some more probably you may be feeling some more just keep active you know it's just great it's a good scamper straight for keeping active I can already feel it I'm mentally aware though I'm motivated I'm feeling good I have no anxiety whatsoever I'm starting to feel really nice and cool it's really nice and another thing too about this that I notice too is not like a cush where you feel it like initially right after the exhale it's like about the third floor and it kind of like mellows become bellows that gently comes on gently it's very nice very soothing not not really like a powerhouse it is very very gentle very mind changing I'm still kind of got a little bit of harshness to it but that's always good I love a little bit of a kick I think you guys for listening to me and watching me do these strange for those of you who watch it's just been a passion of mine to do this so every time I have free time I'm going to go ahead and sit here and record some videos for you guys do some strain reviews can I tell you what I personally think about these strains from taste effect you can kind of see how it affects me when I smoke so I don't know whether you just like to stay here and just like to watch people smoke along with them I used to do that so I appreciate everyone who sits here and watched my videos and everyone who likes and subscribes to me I thank you so much for everything that you do I've been thinking enough it's just it's just really amazing I know I will be doing some more but I do recommend that you guys you guys get a chance to try the great pretty strain if you're looking for just a nice city that helps with motivation I honestly feel hungry Knoxville and I'm starting to think I didn't know that I personally didn't know that I had any effects or if it has any effects for out that's right but I am starting to feel a little hungry so I'm gonna do a little bit more research and see if this actually probably does help with appetite as well which is a nice one of those traits that because of the sativa but it does have some purple here I know that could be more of like a temperature thing and I know that some genetics do have more of a natural purple but every purple that I tend does usually come across seems to be a little bit more indica which is nice because I can kind of see where those indica affects it makes it coming from so would initially make it not a straight sativa I do feel relaxed in the body I initially would say this is probably like the 70/30 sativa hybrid it's really good for me I would still start my day with this wake up have my coffee get some addition and I have motivation to get me going getting started thing today so I don't know if you guys just wanted to overall sweet but very nice fruity tasting very uplifting grapefruit check it out it's a bomb I will definitely be grabbing it in the future just because it helps me personally like it mine thank you guys so much for watching my videos I will be doing some more posting some soon I hope that you guys stay lifted and you have just a blessed and wonderful day thank you so much for watching the best everyone", "VLob0UhweF8": "Welcome back to my channel TheCandyGuy where I talk about treats for the sweet tooth Today I'm going to talk about grapefruit slices Here at the Penny Candy Store we carry in bulk, the grapefruit slices We get them from Haribo the grapefruit slice is a gummi that's in the shape of a grapefruit slice, or a wedge I'd say it's more of a wedge than a slice wouldn't you? I don't know and it's also lightly dusted with sugar I want to share some interesting facts about the grapefruit the actual fruit It was created by crossing a pomelo and an orange It was created in the Caribbean Islands and it's interesting because it's the only citrus fruit that was created outside of Eastern Asia like all the other citrus fruits and for some reason before it was called the grapefruit it was referred to as the forbidden fruit not sure why now, I'm not a fan of grapefruit the actual fruit and the gummy I feel like the smell is really good like i enjoy the smell of a grapefruit but the taste it's extremely bitter and for some reason my taste buds are saying you're being lied to like what you're smelling is not what you're tasting weird I know ok so I'm going to dive into the grapefruit and just tell you I've had grapefruit slices many times in the past and only just one bite because then i remember i like how it smells I don't like how it takes yeah, it smells really good citrusy but here we go ok this is unexpected i like it like I really like it It's a nice citrus kind of bitter taste to it but also sweet and sugary because of all the sugar on the outside but i do recall years ago when I tried it the first time it was gross I didn't like it at all. I took one bite and I passed it to someone else like here you go, you want it, finish it this makes no sense I'm having another one Thank you for watching this week's video of TheCandyGuy Links for the Penny Candy Store and myself will be in the description of this video I post video every Friday so i shall see you all next Friday Have a sweet day.

at not last week i think the week before um anyway lab tested i don't know about that lab tested for quality inconsistency confused with solvent free cannabis distillate [Music] so these are like a black market edible pretty much they have a bunch of different flavors i guess or types of gummies these are peach rings i think um there's some a nice nice government warning for you don't mind my dog complaining um but i like to like i didn't even notice this before but the rainbow finish on it i don't know what exactly that is but it looks fire 500 milligrams no children's california wow if we take a look on the back there's an actual nutrition fact section um no serving size or anything just really all that's in here it's just really just sugar and a tiny bit of saturated fat um not a significant source of vitamin d calcium iron or potassium i was not planning on it ingredients cannabis oil sugar glucose fructose syrup wheat flour malic acid dextrose palm oil citric acid artificial flavor antioxidants sorbic acid dufferin artificial colors um and usually these are um hopefully if you ever get these they will be sealed but even if they are sealed you can kind of tell they've been like tampered with like heat sealed you know what i mean so it's always a risk when you get something like this um it could be very very good but also uh could be very bunk but these ones i got pretty lucky because these ones are actually pretty gas for what they are i saved one of them so we can take a look at it let me take this bad boy out and there we are your basic candy ring and says these are infused but uh you can really really taste it on like the outside so i'm assuming these are sprayed and not infused but if you're looking for a really cheap edible that you're willing to take a chance on i i would recommend these uh it comes with a good amount of them and i i ate a few and i was feeling very nice so they do work depending where you get them but wonkagumi's uh a classic company made into something very frowned upon but oh well i hope you guys enjoyed the video i got a ton of videos like this on my channel if you want to check it out and uh yeah later", "NLl6HYGA-Mw": "welcome to 420 RX cannabis cooking and confectionaries here's Jamie hiya we're gonna do some THC infused sparkly fruit gummies I'm gonna put in 3/4 cup of cold water and I'm gonna sprinkle in 3 tablespoons of unflavored gelatin powder you want to sprinkle that evenly across the surface of the water and allow that to sit for 5 minutes for the gelatin to soak the water up in the balloon once that's bloomed I'm going to put in one and an 8 cups of boiling water and I'm gonna gently stir that until the gelatin is dissolved [Music] I'm gonna put in my lecithin and three cups of granulated sugar we're gonna get that stirred up I'm gonna go ahead and turn my heat on and put in my food coloring as well as some flavoring I went with a berry ish flavor and some purple food coloring because I'm going to be using granddaddy purple we want to bring that to a boil and once that comes to a boil we're going to turn it down and simmer it for 25 minutes stirring regularly I'm gonna add my concentrate and stir that in [Music] I'm gonna pour that into the 8x8 parent pan that I had sitting to the side once the pan is cool I'm gonna put that in frigerator for four hours I'm going to use some granulated sugar and sprinkle that on to my cutting board and then I'm going to flip my gelatin on to that board if you have a resident mathematician you might want to grab them they cut perfect cubes once he has all the cubes cut I'm going to separate them out onto wax paper and allow them to sit for a bit look at the inside of that how beautiful is that [Music] once I feel the cubes are drying up and not super tacky I'll go ahead and roll them in my sugar and I'm gonna leave the cubes sitting out for 36 to 48 hours for that sugar to crystallize enjoy be sure to subscribe to this

right now we're down to where we need to be for that put the lid on that now watch how this works you first as i always do you first put a little bit in just to get the soil uh like get it soaked into the soil so it don't run to the sides of the pot so you let it soak in without soaking in and down definitely happy with my grow you watch it it'll soak right down in we'll let it sit for a little bit i'm doing the scrog side i'm not doing the other side but let me tell you the other side is looking really really good here i'll do it this way maybe give it right on down right on down i got i'd have been doing trimming as i go i haven't been overly trimming these too much though like i have in the past i did do it some trimming before i watered them i cleaned up a little bit more on the stems because those leaves are dying off and we don't really need them and i also removed some of the small popcorn very small popcorn buds as well but uh you know there we are we're we're soaking in everything's looking good i mean the bottoms are already sucked up i mean hell we're doing great let's go to number two show you what she can do how she drinks go ahead and get that set up start with the first bottle there we go watch your drink number two and she just sucks it right on up i can tell you that three gallons are definitely the right size for the pots for me for my grow there we go

yields i end up getting with my ladies for sure i can't wait it's gonna be great but yeah you know you add a little bit of water let it sit and then it's just gonna sit there and soak on in and down hopefully not to the edges but down through the center and feed those nutrients to those beautiful beautiful roots won't be long i'll be adding co2 and that's going to be an interesting thing right there by itself i'm working towards it slowly but surely we'll have it all put together definitely going to try it we're going to use baking soda citric acid and water that's the plan and i've got a i

gummies are housed in a white plastic bottle with a pine green cap there are ten gummies per bottle each containing roughly eight milligrams of THC and CBD per coming one us our gummies are flavored like strawberry lemonade it is worth noting for diabetics that these gummies are not sugar-free containing sugar pectin and corn syrup the bottle itself is fairly easy to open and is 100% recyclable design for this Ohio medical marijuana edible is appealing with a colorful photo of fruit on the cover and a striking wanna logo inside patients are treated to ten swear gummies crafted into the shape of the THC warning logo the gummies are a deep shade of pink almost like grapefruit and are covered in tasty sugar crystals in terms of flavor the name says it all these gummies are juicy bursting with strawberry sweetness and a tart lemon flavor that's just right I wasn't wincing or pinching my lips while chewing on this gummy like I might with other sour candies if you're looking for that experience though I'd suggest mixing this gummy with some sour patch kids medicinally wanna sour gummies provide a one-to-one ratio of THC and CBD per gummy this translates to a medicinal experience that's both mildly euphoric and relaxing used a few hours before bed this gummy is excellent for distressing after a tough day it's also great for inflammation relief rest and sleep euphoria creeps up with this one building to a crescendo about an hour or two after eating the edible I could initially feel a slight headband effect that grew in intensity before peaking and slowly dissipating this was followed by immediate pain and stress relief overall I rather loved one a sour gummies they are great for the evening providing gentle euphoria inflammation relief and smooth relaxation before bed if

for the third day of the 20 days of 4/20 I'll get that right eventually today day number three I told you we're gonna do a trio of edibles so sure enough we're coming at you with some Dixie citrus blast gummies now I've had gummies from this company a couple times before I think the last time I had them they were like the sour ones so maybe more of that little citric acid type of like twang and your your gums you know but these are the citrus ones and they have one or two other flavors but not the sour this time over at relief and Burton but majors relief that is but you know I figured I loved all the citrus strains so I'll probably love this one too and sure enough well I'll give you a little spoiler this isn't my first Bagley's so I do sure love them and the one thing I don't like about all the froley proof packaging is that right there but you know it is what it is don't eat the silica package just you know fYI these come in at I think 20 milligrams for peace it's 200 milligrams per bag and they're pretty tasty tasty now these say it's made with high-quality sativa oil sativa indica distillate is that what we're talking about cuz you know it's hard to really make that claim when you don't have any terpenes left in it but they work and they work really well and I'll be honest I taste pretty darn good too so shout out to Dixie I think that's made by Joyce labs absolute southern here mmm now if you like that lemon the orange kind of that flavor gummies give these a try pretty tasty until next time guys good luck going grow big", "-ZMp_BVH5hw": "[Music] so as

inside we're gonna head out there and go check out the creek so the title of this video was taking a thousand milligrams of delta athc so [Music] i was first to it they don't even know i don't even know [Music] that looks like [ __ ] [Music] backyard [Applause] so what about if you could grab that stick what about making like a bridge with the stick that would be a good idea i don't know how are we supposed to get that out there hand it to me jesus christ jacob how you feeling that'll definitely reach this is better than elon [Music] one dude i held on to that all right if everyone grabs a cane they can make it across i just don't want to get my feet yeah dude where are you at [Music] first man to walk on water actually third man easy all right i really want to put this in perspective for you guys so we are out here in the [ __ ] swamp these boys have made a bridge all the way across this [ __ ] swamp and have used stick canes to travel themselves to this island they are pioneers of a new [ __ ] country bro no cap yeah dude this is not hard at all right now it's like that's the plan all right that's a little tricky oh [ __ ] you guys it's fine boys jacob is now traveling through the wild west in this wilderness to go meet up with rick so i can go out to the cool island ah i stepped in [ __ ] ew come on jacob you're good just grab the other tree right here let go of your cane and grab the tree don't let go of your pain all right now [Music] good job jacob how you like the island [Music] you happy good to get outside get outside kids you know stay active especially when you're high it makes it go your way and yeah dude especially when you're high bursts at man it's good to get all high honestly i think it increases yeah a little bit [Music] move faster through your bloodstream quick update we just got back from the swamp and we're all [ __ ] gotcha right now dude i don't even know that's a word like i mean for real like explaining how you explained it to me how light it is and it's like delta a edibles man it's bad like especially with the amount that we're on right now it hits almost like a tab without the psychedelic effects so i mean i'm up wanting to do something you know what i mean like i i just [ __ ] did all that you see so i mean yeah i mean we're we're pretty geek right now i'm [ __ ] high wouldn't you say dude i am like i want a whole another level as soon as we stepped in the house and we were like dylan outside and i actually started paying attention to how i felt in the moment i realized the [ __ ] geek right now i stood in the house and it like immediately kicked into me like i am gone i feel fuzzy like one of tim's skill how [ __ ] up are you right now i'd say i'm starting to come down now probably eat some more but uh like in the woods i was probably like a solid like seven and a half eight like for me the best number yeah for me that's pretty good [Music] all right ladies and gents so it has been about four hours since we indulged into the edibles i'll say about an hour since i hit my 1 000 milligram peak and definitely coming down at the moment i all i got to say is these things got me high as [ __ ] and again we do not recommend you taking this many at home take recommended dosages like no more than like 100 milligrams at a time but overall flavor [ __ ] amazing it was like hands down some of the best like tasting edibles i've ever had and just the fact that they had some big flavors was great [ __ ] and i also i hit 1000 milligrams on that [ __ ] that was my total account for how much i took [Music] i was pretty high up on that that's like one of the highest i've ever gotten off edibles honestly and like they didn't taste bad at all like they taste like regular candy that's what's kind of dangerous about them but um yeah they're fire as [ __ ] dude i appreciate empire send this out to us um i got to about i think 900 or maybe 850 something like that but um i'll probably need some more later on i'm just trying to say something okay i got 2 000 [Music] i think i didn't take near as much as they did but i mean i really couldn't handle the flavor after so many of them they're really not they really shouldn't be taken in large amounts at all um but i've never really had a high off edibles like i have these ones so i'd definitely give it a good review i took uh 750 milligrams and i got really high i had a great time i was very energetic and euphoric um i i'm coming down right now yeah i mean i'm still pretty high it's been about three or four hours um but yeah all together i mean they were they're pretty fire it definitely left a bad taste in your mouth if you took a lot like we did but you know it is what it is i got high as [ __ ] i don't mind it so yeah

So guys tell us in the comments\nsection down below which gummy you think was your favorite. >> Make sure you slap that like button\ndown below and we'll see you all next time. Good bye.", "0HNsKjqC8iY": "today Kevin and I are gonna be trying some gummies I have the Crayola gummies or watermelon slices I have the Sunkist fruit guys these are the sour citrus so we found these at Ali's mom were three nutty nonetheless or two Briana $3.99 and Ollie's and this is a huge bag heavy 32 ounces that's 28 and these are watermelon slices and and Kevin and I did a review of the Haribo and the sour patch watermelon I wish we had known these were available we would have thrown these in the mix but those horrible it's our veg are long gone gummies do not last in our house we like to eat them a lot so these are made by Bobbito they have no high fructose corn syrup they're peanut free two pounds of fun it's yes there are 30 servings five pieces on 120 calories oh wow that is some strong don't want stuff like you're sticking your bag in the bag of blood and it looks like a wedge of water one look these are called Joey I'm coming that's over look at me no because of gummy I consider more like the horrible mm-hmm these are more jelly like mm-hmm they're very nice though I like them I think they have more of the green flavor of the watermelon white part yeah the white part yeah I think they have more of that the white part but then the actual watermelon I think if you want more of the watermelon candy flavor you should go you should get one of the other brands but these are nice those are good they're good no I want them yeah there's nothing wrong with them but I actually prefer the other but more just because they have that more of a candy watermelon flavor and this doesn't and there's no sour dose or anything like that like to either so you didn't say that on there is no make sure you made yeah the Haribo I had didn't have the really strong flavor like the sour patch there but I really liked them okay so these are very small little like pieces no these four different ones there is a long orange tangerine and lemon there are 26 servings in the container and they are 100 calories these are made in a turkey heart of different use these were made in turkey ribs okay that's interesting okay slow learner orange yellow and orange and LA and a green so there's a light orange in a dark orange see that's an orange and then this is an orange no that's why I gave you you didn't give me one of these that would have any my water when you need yeah the oranges I can't want to tell there's a little difference once you get next to each other yeah the yellow on the more slippery so yeah okay so you do what do you want first for the matter let's see the one the covered with sugar now these are going okay these are made by the same company that's all right they're both made in Turkey they're both made by the beach house so that said it on the front by Bobbito these it says it on the back so they probably came out of the same place probably I think that's very carefully long it was alright it wasn't the best lawn whenever I say it tastes more like you're eating the skin of the fruit not the actual fruit yeah it wasn't like a long jello which that's the llama and I can look forward but it's like the ski animal I'm saying it kind of tastes like the skin not bad yeah so that's not one we would eat is it well these aren't so the other sour Samara should be orange just daughter okay you know I think about it's supposed to be good I think these are more of jelly like there's some dents or jelly do they come apart pretty easily no that one I want I like the orange it's not the best we've had once again but hate to keep saying that but it's not and there's just other orange that we've had that we like better that I actually do like the orange where I didn't like the line no the other ones moved about did the tangerine yeah that's a Lulu Missy add - I liked a dream more than I do the orange I thought it was sweeter really what didn't you like about it mm-hmm it's not weird plug Oh see I don't think so at all I really that's pretty much that's my favorite so far yeah and last is lemon I don't like the one mmm don't bring up no I was like so Wow the lemons like pledge its yeah it's like a cleaner lemon so honestly I would pass on these oh yeah I would I would pass on both of these well we've tried some pray of love before and we paid a lot for too because they sell them at Toys R Us and we wouldn't enjoy that which doesn't exist anymore unfortunately I miss it but um we went in there and we paid a lot for them and then it seems like the next week was on a dollar treasure so just like boy I got robbed because I paid like four times the amount but so we have reviewed the Crayola in the past and there's just nothing special they unfortunately they they just scrap select their name but they allow their name to be used just like Godiva has with a lot of things and they shouldn't they allow they're going to be used and then they put out these this mediocre product and really it should be more of an embarrassment to the company they should take their name off of it so so the one on does have a strong flavor it's just not the greatest flavor it's it's not a flavor of the watermelon you want yeah it's not sweet bright pardons yeah when you get a watermelon you don't say oh I can't wait to get to the white part yeah yeah so it's not the part of the watermelon you really want even though they're not horrible or anything it's just I would pass on Oh yes so I hope this was helpful to you and that you enjoyed the video and thanks for watching [Music]", "k6bZWStRazM": "all right everybody hello and welcome back to another video with tokentown 420. all right say hi to all the new subscribers old subscribers and you know you soon to be subscribers that's right if you haven't hit that red button down there it still says subscribe subscribe all right got that out of the way i think i tried to do it as fast as i could all right we got a review video and a haul video for you

know what day it is anymore help me um today is friday so the weekend is starting today so hopefully everybody has a good weekend all right that's the last sticker all right let's get something lit up here that's what's wrong we ain't got nothing lit let's light this bad boy all right we're smoking on a little bit of that purple five keys f something or another from truly if you guys know what i'm talking about the name nobody can remember excuse me for a second all right i wouldn't do want to do a couple shout outs today in this video you guys haven't checked out proper major quality they're in jacksonville florida go check them out we also got another florida youtuber she's not really doing reviews i don't think which that's fine because she's got a great personality i can't wait to see what she's going to do but it's cut hat brie i'll leave a link down there now she's also from jacksonville now i know proper major quality likes to put people on their podcast and have guests if you guys want to get together so bri go watch their stuff proper you go watch her stuff and see what you guys think um like i said i've been following her she's only got two youtube videos up i've been following her on instagram for a while um she is like i said pretty funny girl so i think she's going to get maybe michi 69 a run for her money sorry guys um but yeah go check her out she's got a graham dab video she took it like a champ she turned real red but she finished it so like i said check them out guys if you're one of the first ones to watch the video because some of you guys are crazy little ninjas when it comes to the video popping up i can't get the thumbnail in for you guys have watched it and left a comment you have to give me a minute i'll have to go copy and paste copy and paste the two links okay all right so let's do the hall part of this video first because i'm a little bit confused by it maybe you guys will be too um so i did get the sublingual tablets today um what are these 150 milligrams five milligrams of piece 30 infused pieces now it still says sublingual but this is their version of a gummy now this is an arctic berry i think that's the flavor they said it's a hybrid blend yeah arctic berry so they are gummy and they do smell good now here's my thing on these um if you go to their website and look it says they're coming out the 8th which is tomorrow today is the 7th um but if you guys follow the nurse colleen um she does a 7 10 morning show uh they also drive the gr the big green buzzer and i think it's pete um they had these last week so i kept looking online and daytona gets theirs on the 8th port charlotte if you go on there online it says they'll get them on the 20th i've seen a couple others that said the 11th i couldn't find nobody that released them yet so i called my cure leaf this morning because they don't have a corporate number that i could find and i didn't look too hard so if there is one don't give me a hard time on that one um and i was going to ask i was go you know how come how did north colleen get them when they're not even out yet so i asked to speak with the manager um and she tells me they got these last week they got a shipment in for their top 10 customers so if you was a cure leaf top 10 customer you got these last week i'm not a top 10 customer because i don't go there that often because they ain't got a lot of crap but um i find that in medical i find that a bit disturbing i don't know that some people should have got this early it's almost like you know you guys know i got five kids if i had one candy bar i'm not gonna go pick my favorite kid and give her a candy bar [ __ ] i just said it was a girl all right i'm gonna wait till i get enough candy bars for everybody i think cure leaves should have done the same thing if my dispensary wasn't going to get those till 20th i think they should have hold production until the 20th so everybody could have got at the same time but not to mention that i don't think you should have a top 10 customers that get products before anybody else that's just my opinion but she said because she had extras i guess one of her top 10 customers didn't want to damn things that she was able to sell these today and i just happened to be one of the lucky ones and grabbed it i also got a flower what did i get the purple sunset and i have no idea if it's an indica oh oh camera almost dropped you uh let's see keerley prepack florida purple sunset thc uh oh indica it's just so hard uh 16 so this is an indica they need to make that stuff a little bit better we still got the old can't get into unless you've got you have to kill them sometimes uh so hopefully everybody had a good day i've been working on the car all day so i didn't really leave the house so that's why i'm a little bit extra medicated um feeling pretty good right now not bad not the best looking stuff that's for dang sure it feels pretty moist they're not super moist not super but it does kind of look a little leafy this time the leaves are kind of dry but it feels okay smells good some of them are a little darker than the other ones so not bad so we will have a review on the gummies um coming real soon i'm gonna try one after the video i just wanna talk with my mouth full through the video i'm probably gonna do two of them uh to try that to start with i know it's gonna be a low milligram for me um but edibles do affect people differently i've never really had an edible so i'll start low and work my way up i do plan on eating one and then sucking on the other one see if that helps put it in your system a little better because the some stuff like this tinctures and stuff like that you're supposed to hold underneath your tongue um and the longer they stay in your mouth and dissolving the saliva the quicker it dissolves in your system so we will try that see if it's any different and then we got one of their elite live this is enhanced live resin so i'm imagining this it's supposed to be a live resin cart um but since it says enhanced i imagine they might have added some terpenes back to this not real sure um so we're 79.4 percent how we're going to get you out of the box so it is a hybrid it's got a little sticker label on here that we i guess we can put on the thing i'm kind of digging that if we can figure out how to get it out it's got one push button so i imagine i'm gonna have to slice this open real quick guys let me get this little sticker out of the way um but this is their select so it's a different company um and as you guys know we're seed to sale in florida so there is no different company what they sell they produce so it's a different it's still cure leaves product in here the only thing different doesn't look very full it's got a big ass [ __ ] bubble in there see how that settles down and let it sit up for a while but um so the cart is going to be different the actual thing the liquids in um but that thing's only going to look like it's half full i'm hoping it's a [ __ ] full gram carton that just charged me for a half i'm not sure if it doesn't say yeah i guess it is a half gram so but you can see it's not going to be quite full so like i said i imagine this is going to have a different flavor profile let's leave that sitting up then there are other live resin carts that's supposed to have a cotton instead of a wick in there i guess um what else was i going to say on that oh so the reason i did get this because i'm running low on flower this month for sure i'm going to run out way soon um and i renewed my card last month so i still had the 75 off 150 at cure leaf hadn't been able to find enough flour or i would plan on getting you know two shatters two crumbles and a flower that i made at 150 i couldn't ever seem to find those in stock together so when they had these these are 45 dollars by the way their flour has been on sale for a while for 35 so that was 80. so i added a 60 cart onto there and then i added a 10 battery the batteries are the only thing that you can get a discount on that aren't product like i was going to get a t-shirt and he's like you can't use the discount it won't register the discount for a t-shirt so instead of doing a pre-roll i did a another ten dollar bait battery you can never have enough of those they go out you need an extra one always keep a spare one of those around so but most people should be able to get these tablets tomorrow at most of the true leaves some are cure leaves sorry sorry freudian slip so um those should be available to most everybody tomorrow um a few of us are probably gonna have to wait a little bit so the review we're gonna do is on their citrus farmer coming at 16 thc this was a hybrid they said it was a sativa leaning hybrid um got one little buddy over left this is the one if you guys remember had the nice orange big hairs in there nice beautiful buds it was supposed to have or some people said it had you know lemon taste i don't know if they thought that because of to me this was more gas and earthy it was good flavor i wouldn't really count this as a sativa i count this as a hybrid um it had a little sativa to it but it had been more like um 55 45 you know i mean not a lot it was real close to being balanced for me so close that i was able to do a sativa wax with this in the morning and it didn't overdo me so if you haven't tried that yet like i said it is more of a hybrid for me what it is for you you just have to wait and see and that was coming at 16 was also 35 bucks like i said their flower's been on sale for 35 bucks for a while i don't know why they just don't they're not going to sell any back at the 48 dollar price range when they jump the prices back up so i think the sale is going to last it's been lasting for several months now i'm pretty sure we're going on three maybe four months of their flower being at 35 so it's pretty good guests to say it's going to stay there unless they come out with a you know better version and they raise that up and keep some of the other ones at 35 i don't you never know that's just me guessing and talking out of my a-hole uh but right now their flower is 35 bucks looks like across the board some of them was 30. i did see an afghani for 30 in there not today or anything or i might have got it because you've seen there's one little bud in here there's one little bud of the other stuff left and i got a thing of this and that's about it so i would have bought more but that was the only strain they had except for the citronella sunset which is a sativa and you know i'm not a big sativa person they did come out with some black tuna today i know michi 69 got the black tuna so if you guys haven't checked her out check her out i did not get the black tuna the black tuna sold out at my location so i will not be getting no black tuna for a while not until black tuna comes back apparently um so if you want to check that one out like i said check out mi269's channel that's going to be it for me guys um i'm gonna let this one go make sure you go check out the proper major qualities cut hat brie like i said i'll leave the links down in the description for you guys hopefully everybody has a fantastic weekend and hopefully you guys are taking on something good this weekend till next time keep", "UqzhgZjdpAo": "what's up everybody my name is Sara Vee and welcome back to the haze today I'm gonna be doing another review I'm gonna be viewing the BAM Camino by the very famous brand Kiva confection now you probably recognize the name Kiba because of their chocolate products that you see at most stores they're very well known for them they're very very delicious but today I'm gonna be talking about their gummies now this is the Bliss they do other flavors but I'm gonna be talking specifically about the Bliss which is their hybrid gummy let's talk a little bit about this awesome container it comes in a tin container which I really love it keeps the flavor really nice and fresh it is all summer themed and in the front they'll tell you how much milligrams which is a hundred for the entire one in every little gummy is five milligrams in the back it will also give you you know all the nutrition facts that you're counting your calories if you're trying to get high on a diet that will be there for you to open it it's just a quick little push down and turn voila and you'll find your gummies on the inside too it does give you a little bit more information on why they're called Caminos which I really love when an edible company kind of gives you that it kind of sets the scene it gets you in the mood for getting high every little gummy looks like this look at that little gummy how cute it is and it is five milligrams now the taste is delicious they're very tasty they're nice and sweet they're not crazy crazy good but they kind of remind you of movie theater candy like chewy sweet and something you just want to shove in your mouth all day for the high because these come with 20 of five milligrams your will needle II eat a lot of candy to really get super blown if you're willing to go down that road more power to you're willing to down twenty of these but I would say this edible is best use and best for people who are trying to micro dose specifically for the fact that every one of those little gummies is five milligrams if you're kind of a lightweight or you're doing something that you don't need to be high doesn't it take a little bit of the edge off even one or two of these or eating just one or even half of one if you're looking for a 2.5 is really great and it makes micro dosing so much easier with these guys yeah I can't say enough about how how nice these are for micro dosing and how great these are for also traveling if you're someone who gets nervous going on an airplane or something like that these are great because you won't get to blown where you'll get like super paranoid but you'll get high enough to take a little bit of that edge off which is really great if you're looking for something and that's gonna get you super high if you're looking at like go to a party and you don't drink it but you want to be stoned as hell these I'd I wouldn't it wouldn't be my first choice maybe if you have a slower tolerance or you're just getting into edibles this is for you especially if this is gonna be your first edible a try splitting one of these small gummies is so easy and they have like had like a fake little line between them that can kind of give you a little idea where to split it right in the middle these are awesome if you are working from home like a lot of us are these are great for that too because you won't get high you won't feel stupid you can get your job done but it also helps with a little bit of shaving off a little bit of that anxiety which is great yeah if you guys see these which see them a lot I've seen the prices range I've seen them from twenty dollars all the way up to thirty dollars so I guess it just depends on what dispenser you pick them up from these were pretty average for me nothing crazy that's before tap that's after tax and everything so if you guys see them out of dispensary if you got some extra dollars in your pocket I would say pick up the Camino by the Kiva you won't be disappointed you'll get high you might not get superstone but you'll get there so alright guys well that's my review for the day my name is Sarah P again thank you so much for watching in the haze and I'll catch you next time [Music]", "NtGmqEIz9to": "[Music] another review and today I'm doing candy yeah I'm doing baked Bros gummy bears again these are baked pros gummy bears this entire contrack ajiz 150 milligrams of THC 10 milligrams each piece and there is 15 pieces in here so 15 doses and this actually has directions on the bag most of them normally don't but it says start with one dose which is 10 milligrams I love worth up to 90 minutes for effects and consumers needed suggested use temporarily reduces pain stimulates appetite sleep aid and relief of nausea okay so again baked pros gummy bears 10 milligrams each you know guys you know I'm a lightweight so I'm just gonna start with wine right I'm going to cut into this right now I need to cut it again because evidently I didn't cut below the seal this cut low enough that I'm not cutting all right to hit me and just because I'm going for I get it so honey bear squishy yeah Oh something got put the sugar around it because he's very cannabis II and you know I tend to stray away from edibles that have a strong lead taste because I just don't like the V taste that's a personal thing you might I'm glad I read this it says testing accuracy plus or minus three milligrams of THC per piece oh and that's the thing would be good you kind of always don't know exactly how much teach so you're getting and that's why it's best you're like you know trouble I'm and then wait a little bit before you try nothing but they're gummy bears and they're good it's like to me once you get past that initial taste of it like the cannabis taste hmm I guess the sweetness other kind of mellows that out a little bit to me and they're good they taste like gummies you know like gummy bears but growing up and coming beers right and these are things that these especially when you start talking on gummy treats and things like that candy that kids normally eat or that they gravitate towards if you're medicating that way please you know make sure that you're keeping those out of the reach I mean seriously because for them all they see is gummy bear they don't really understand any of this other stuff okay so now that I'm done this is going back into my weed safe and again yes I can have a week I do have a weed safe and I try to keep my things away I have four kids to a grown and then the two youngest or in their team so just because sometimes it's candy and it might look you know killing even though they're old enough to understand what it is I still keep it you know am i safe just you know to keep it away from him but faith grows very good and as far as um I mean there's 15 in here so I mean this is a good amount to dose with okay and when I bought this actually bought this Micra so it's been a while but the price says $31 again baked bros and so many other companies out there they always they're always offering you know not always but sometimes they're specials that you can catch at your dispensary and there are places like weed Maps who else but I go to online they will actually send me notices about different specials that dispensaries are having and a lot of the companies offer you know boku you know buy one get one so what might be you know $31 you may end up getting tuning and that's actually what I did I think for sure I didn't pay the full price for this I end up getting something free or it was on discount or something so like I always tell you be mindful about the specials and deals that your dispensaries have because you can I'm getting your medicine or action alright alright guys that is it so also available in 75 milligrams and 300 milligram bags so you have options okay alright I will talk to you guys later alright y'all take care [Music]", "42BJGT68owU": "[Music] hi my name is Bart and today we're gonna try th C rich + gummies they come in two flavors blackberry and lemon indica and sour watermelon sativa I really like the packaging all the information you need is front and center you can see they're gluten free with no artificial sweeteners the can keeps the gummies from getting squished and has a strong twist off seal the indica gummies are in a 91 THC to CBD ratio that means that their THC dominant so you may feel high with some psycho activity there's two flavors inside the indica blackberry and lemon now let's check out the sativa gummies these are 100 percent THC so these guys are even a little more potent there's one flavor inside sour watermelon the gummies are small but you can still easily bite them in half if you want a smaller micro dose well they taste so sweet and the best part is there's smells so good just remember they are small and poet so it's important to start low and go slow you can always get more at hello MD calm until next time [Music]", "bsV3AVDB_Bc": "all right good morning everyone and welcome back all right welcome back to another video with tokentim420 i'd like to say hi to everybody this morning hopefully everybody's toking on something good hopefully everybody had a good weekend um like say good morning let me take a drink got my protein shake this morning breakfast the champions it's a little after i think nine maybe it's still eight o'clock i'm not sure been playing in the garage for a minute or two tried to get the lava lamp to come on didn't get it heated up good enough all right we got some lemon oh g mini flowers we're smoking on today and a little star dog wax in there got the lemon og because we got a rough day so we're getting ahead of the pain today um and a little bit of that star dog to get us up and moving i usually don't do wax in the morning and if you can i don't even know if we can find it in there i just put a tiny bit in there so don't think i'm getting all whacked out early in the morning and i'm talking a tiny like like a half a dab in a whole joint so i don't want any of you think oh tim says he don't do that occasionally i'll do some concentrates in the morning all right we're going to do the sublingual tablets 150 milligrams of thc they're five milligrams a piece so there's 30 of them in there from cure leaf this is arctic berry 5 milligrams times 30 150 it's a hybrid i didn't get to use these too much a little rougher weekend they do stick together quite a bit you can see that they didn't quite let these dry out good enough i think so you can see where they're kind of got like a coating on them i think that's where they probably dry out but if you rip into them you can see maybe it's a little sugar on them i don't know um but like i said not really going to do the effects on them because i didn't have them long enough i didn't want you guys to wait too long and the effects are going to be different for some of us uh from what i understand edibles don't work for some people at all no matter how much they eat other people they work quicker and more intense and flower shad or all that stuff combined so that's pretty much going to be personal experience but what we can go on is flavor and stuff like that price price point is probably real high i did two of them the one day didn't feel nothing which was 10 milligrams i did five or six the next day so it was 25 30 milligrams and i felt a little something something i think they did help with my appetite a little bit i was hungry the one day um usually i don't get hungry hungry so i think they did do something for my appetite i won't swear to that because it could have been what i was smoking too i just smoked a lot when i was doing them too but now for the flavor take another hit of that um the flavor was good it was a nice little berry like a little mixed berry flavor um but it had something when you're eating them you can taste something like on the back end of it the first two i had the first night i was drinking a peanut butter cup smoothie from tropical smoothie which is chocolate and peanut butter and when i had the first two i had that artificial flavor aftertaste like you get from drinking a diet coke or anything diet and that stuck around for like an hour i couldn't get rid of it and i probably had some bread got rid of it the next night when i tried them now like i said i don't know if it was what i was drinking um that's why i'm just letting you know everything the first day i was drinking chocolate pretty much chocolate milkshake with peanut butter um and i could taste the diet part real good when i ate five of them in a row what i got more than anything was you know if you uh use like the fake maple syrup like the strawberry flavored um any kind of flavored maple syrups you get that real syrupy kind of sticky thing in the back of your throat um that's best way i can explain it i had that like it was too much syrup or something in them um so it kind of caught you like in the back of the throat it was like i said the best way i can explain is like i said strawberry maple syrup kind of does that to me but other than that the flavor wasn't bad like i said the first time i got a little bit of that what i feel is artificial sweetener aftertaste and then the second time it was like i said a little syrupy like if you had something with a lot of syrup on it kind of caught you in the back of the throat there but this is i don't know what words to explain it um this is way way way way way better tasting than the the mint ones like i said i couldn't keep the mints in my mouth for a couple minutes the true leaf had i never did try the mints from uh cure leaf because you don't get no refund there if you don't like the things you can't take them back um they are rather big for five milligrams i think um you know they're just almost as wide as a white lighter they've got some thickness to them so for five milligrams they are rather big gummy uh let's take another hit off this joint see what else i was thinking of but now if you're one of those like i said i've never tried edibles before so i don't even have anything to compare it to as far as once i do find get some effects from it that's why i was doing more of the taste of it i've eaten stuff before just never had edibles before you know what i mean so i do know what something's supposed to taste like um but like i said as far as the effects go you know even if i did get off on five of them i wouldn't have any other edible experience to compare it to but i think for me i'm probably going to be around 50 milligrams on the edibles like i said i thought because i hit that little dab of wax in there um i did feel a little something something on the 25 milligrams but not enough i think the 50 would definitely do me now to get maybe hammered off of it i might need 100 of them but that's a different story so i will do 50 of them later on and then i don't think there'll be a hundred left and i probably won't buy them again because we're 150 or 150 milligrams for 45 dollars so that's expensive expensive expensive i thought the pills or the patches was the most expensive things before i think these are more expensive than those now um so you're basically paying a little bit over you're paying what a buck 50 a [ __ ] gummy it'd be 30. yeah 45 bucks so buck 50 1.50 for 5 milligrams so the stuff on there is probably from where i was touching them i did dump them all out put them on the rolling tray so there was no little black dots on them i'm sure that's just uh little pieces of flower i picked up from the rolling tray so don't nobody freak out on them but like i said they did have a good flavor i do think now like i said the price is a little bit out there i did use my 75 off 150 for renewing my card which made it a better uh price for me you know i pretty much got it for the same price i would have if i didn't i mean i added this stuff on and got still spent 75 hours that i was originally going to spend buying the flower in this i got a free vape cart basically um so if you've got a discount to where you can get these cheaper than 45 um i would say give them a try if you like edibles i think they would be a good thing um even for people like me with a higher tolerance this is something i could suck on during the day um nobody's gonna notice what you're doing with this so it's a way a little micro dose throughout the day when you can't get away from work or you know me i don't like to get tortor up at work i do today i'm painting boats so i'm smoking a little bit more i know i've got a lot of stretching to do um you know reaching out there getting crap on the boat that i can't reach so it's gonna the back's not gonna be feeling good the legs all that stuff by the end of the day that's why i'm starting early but if i was doing something you know climbing turning trees today climbing up on ladders with chainsaws there definitely wouldn't be no wax in my joint it would just be straight flower flower um because i don't like to get tore up out there and get tore up with a chainsaw or something else if you make a mistake so i don't get hammered during the day at work i do medicate but i don't over medicate so i also want to throw that out there so this would be something good where you could kind of micro dose and kind of level yourself out during the day you know say i can't go smoke i don't want to do a whole dab because i'm running a saw or something i don't want to get hammered hammered these would be enough i think i could do a couple of these and take the edge off um so i wouldn't be hurting all day and jonesing for you know smoke basically if i can't get to one and some jobs where you're doing you know if i'm working in people's houses a lot of times it's harder to get out and smoke because i'm a cigarette smoker too so i got to take cigarette breaks all the time and then try to take a joint break on top of that that's a lot of breaking so like i said i think these would be good for people just starting out with lower tolerances or if you've been smoking for years and still have a lower tolerance or if you want to be real discreet during the day um you could take some of these like i said i wouldn't use this as my main thing all day because i'd go broke quick using that but if i can smoke a joint before i go and then you know 10 11 o'clock during the day hit a couple of these it wouldn't be so expensive that way put it that way it helped keep your prices down a little bit so but like i said if you do have a discount you want to give them a try give them a try but we will have edibles i think before the end of this year too um so like i said a lot of you should be getting these i think today is the 10th or the 11th so a lot of cure leaves was coming out between the 8th and the 20th was the last date i've seen the 20th was mine i didn't see anybody i think past the 20th so that's it for those guys if you haven't give them a try just remember it's 45 for 150 milligrams it is rather pricey it's a dollar fifty a gummy um so if you're one of those that have a high tolerance and you've tried edibles before and you know it's going to take you 100 milligrams or even 50 milligrams to get off you only got three doses in here at 50 milligrams so at 45 for three doses that's kind of pricey in my opinion but if you're somebody that can do 10 milligrams there's 15 doses in here that's not a bad deal so like i said it kind of depends on your tolerance on that the lower your tolerance the better deal is going to be for you know because you can make this last you a little further um if you've never tried edibles before and you're like me and you got the 45 extra bucks this is a good place to start i think 150 milligrams will do anybody no matter how high your tolerance is i think you're going to get off on 150 milligrams of edibles so if you had to eat the whole bottle you'd still get you know at least one trial if you got like me and tired of waiting i've been waiting for edibles for a long time and these did the trick i got to try something um like i said you do taste a little bit of something while you're eating them i don't know if that's the cannabis in them if that's the extra serpiness in them i have nothing to compare it to like i said so i'm just giving you everything i found from it i do taste something why i'm eating them on the back end um like i said i don't know if it's more that diet that syrup or the thc that whatever they put in there um so hopefully somebody else reviews them that has a little bit more experience with edibles sorry about that guys but you know first impression

show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and it's old-school today guys cuz we are taking a look at an edible just like good times good times I mean old times but the old times aren't necessarily good times anymore because here in California we are fully in the new recreational world which includes this ridiculous hundred milligram cap on edibles not just that but makes absolutely crazy packaging requirements for all edibles here in California so what edible are we talking about that is ridiculous today what we are gonna take our first look at Plus gummies that's right another gummy review I normally tell you to avoid the gummies but I have heard a lot of good things about Plus and I am a little curious I'm always hoping to find another gummy I like cushy punch or flourish or Tiki killers that's actually worth something so I'm definitely looking forward to reviewing these plus gummies first thing you're gonna notice is how crazy this packaging is so here it is here is our plus gummies I believe they are sour blueberry blue in case you don't know is objectively the best flavor of everything if there is a multitude of colors and blue is available always go with blue because blue is much like a like a law of thermodynamics or whatever the case may be blue is always the best fruit flavor even though I don't know of any naturally-occurring blue fruits other than blueberries and blue tasting foods are hardly ever blueberries usually blue raspberry or something it's always the best trust me on this though so we have a sealed bag with you know all these insane requirements on it batch number this that and the other I mean it's great because it has all of those wonderful serving sizes and ingredients and all the testing results all this stuff you know I like seeing but it's a bag and then a fancy 10 on the inside I think all edibles now have to be bagged in addition to whatever kind of thing holds the edibles they have to have these sealed maggots it's insane it just boosts up the cost because this uh 100 milligram 20 piece edibles so I believe it's 20 gummies each worth 5 milligrams of THC cost me 20 bucks at my dispensary which is outrageous of course but that is the world we now live in and we shall review it as if it's the world we want to live in who knows I don't know what I'm saying I know I'm sad I'm disappointed that the edible world has changed so much and so for such and in such a shitty direction over the past year but let's stop the bitching and get straight to the review of the plus gummies cannabis infused sour blue berry so we're gonna open up the first layer of the packaging here it looks like it's got a little tear thing nice Oh and then then we got our second layer the zip sealed bag on side of the tear bag and then we gotta figure out how to open this the childproofing I think you ground push down and that breaks the seal yes there we go so second layer of security through now we're finally to our chin on the inside and to the gummies in here ah so here are our blue raspberry or blueberry gummies whatever they call it blue flavored the best 20 gummies in there give it a smell oh definitely a cannabis e odor which is not a bad thing I I'd like to know that there's some cannabis in these but also a hefty flavor and aroma of blue but certainly in a cannabis aroma there as you can see just a bunch of little squares dropped one there and let's pluck it into our mouths but before we do in case this is your first week to review the way they work when we do edibles we reviewed the whole experience I'm gonna eat all 20 of these gummies and then I'm gonna come back to you guys in about two hours to actually let you know how I'm feeling because it's you want to know how have it tasted like [ __ ] but you what you really want is it gonna get you [ __ ] up it's gonna get you high are you gonna get what you paid for it and that guy's is what you need to stick around for but first the taste test so here we go first cube in the mouth um very spongy gummies very very spongy almost hard to bite into because they're so Airy um a surprising cannabis taste them it's not awful but there is a 4 what is 5 milligrams of THC in these cubes definitely a cannabis taste to it but the blue the blue sciency flavor counter sex but if you don't like cannabis taste maybe you don't stick with these because you're gonna taste it again not terrible not overwhelming but it is surprisingly noticeable for what is just 5 milligrams of THC so guys I'm gonna eat me about what 16 more of these and I said I'm gonna eat me which is very back woodsy and folksy way of saying I'm gonna eat the rest of these so guys I'll see you in about two hours I'm gonna scarf these down and I'll let you know then if they're worth your money or not so thanks for staying tuned this far sticking around this far sorry guys this is really my second video back here on weeds and this will probably be another video between season 3 and between season 2 and season 3 so forgive my rustiness see you guys in two hours thanks for sticking around 2 hours since I have had the plus cannabis infused gummies looking at the camera for the first time now since coming back the fuse but I also see now I'm saying the word let's just start over one more time BAM I'm back guys it has been 2 hours since I had the plus cannabis infused gummies and I think there was an even yeah it says create on there as well there are a lot of nouns and adjectives and verbs on that packaging I'm really not even sure what it's called I'm just gonna call it plus gummies plus gummies uh guys I am genuinely pretty impressed uh for a gummy and for a hundred milligram edible this brought the heat um I'm not outrageously high but I am at like maybe a 6 somewhere in that range which is way higher than I expected it to be after a hundred milligrams and especially after a gummy I am pretty pleased with this now that is in the relative scale compared to you know this new world of edibles because this is a very expensive product you don't get a lot for your money here compared to the old world but in this new world this is a pretty good little solution um I found myself not maybe quite as high as if they were like akarova or a Kanaka mini cookie situation but for a gummy and for how much less you have to eat then which is very important to me you have to eat a [ __ ] ton of those cookies from like all you know Pete's and Korova and Kanaka all those ones you just mentioned you have to eat like 20 of those you know many cookies to get the hundred milligrams the gummies here were a hell of a lot more manageable that 10 was no problem to eat by myself I didn't didn't feel like a gluttonous badass after consuming that whole thing at all so really really pleased with that aspect um have a cannabis taste for sure but not awful um I didn't feel like retching after eating that not even close there was a cannabis taste but it was not the primary taste and again didn't have that just incredibly bitter kind of almost you know a cynic that Pacific we've tasted no no just the taste is there but then again for as potent as these came you know turned out to be you would expect that so guys this is a a nice win I think I'm I'm pretty impressed with Plus cannabis infused gummies and then also that were to create for some reason on there as well so I'm really happy with this I think I'll be reviewing some more stuff from plus in the future and if you see these in a dispensary near you and you guys want to eat all of something to get the hundred milligrams Jesus it's it's almost easier to recommend this then which is hard to say which is hard to believe actually then like the Kanak o or the kirova because it's just such it's so much easier to do and they're they're sort of equivalently priced you don't get quite as high but it's it's it's easier to it's easier to manage for sure so really surprised me on this one guys and what the [ __ ] let's just shoot the moon here guys I'm gonna throw a cherry on top - my little cherries on top here just little things I like to add that aren't necessarily we related something you can just do to enjoy throughout your week and I'm just gonna throw this one out because I am having an ever-loving blast playing spider-man on the ps4 from insomniac holy [ __ ] guys it's so great to see insomniac get this win I assume this game it's going to be an amazingly huge hit it seems to be it's only a couple days since it's been out but reception seems to be great and it seems to be doing really well sales wise I'm so happy for insomniac I love these guys since the ps1 days back in like Spyro loved them on the ps2 days Ratchet and Clank so my favorite you know 3d action platformers ever even love the resistance franchises back on the ps3 days and then they have been one of the greatest VR developers as well and I'm a big big fan of VR so you know what [ __ ] it I'm going to this endorsement is not for spider-man which is an awesome game I am having an utter blast with it it doesn't rewrite the rules anyway it's it's not a you know changing the genre it's just a hell of a good video game you know it's not rewriting anything but it's it's wonderful I'm having a blast with it but instead this cherry on top is just for insomniac in general they make great great games they've been making great great games for like 20 years I love them as a studio I'm so happy to see them having this huge success with spider-man so insomniac you'll never see this video but great job guys really proud of you and that's gonna do it for this cherry on top and that's gonna do it for this review what a great time we had great gummies that were so good here's an extra piece of packaging we had [ __ ] spider-man and insomniac on our cherry on top woohoo this guy's has been a [ __ ] good review let's just acknowledge the fact that everything went aces this time which doesn't often happen so great job plus great job insomniac and great job weed thank you so much for watching this review it's gone way too long and I will see you guys on the next one peace", "J19-zx7HPB8": "i really

pack of edibles right here 200 milligrams of delta eight okay you guys obviously got it literally the first day and i'm gonna stop making such easy light goals for you guys um because you guys are [ __ ] awesome obviously that's why you're killing it uh we're gonna eat all this i mean there's nothing else to say effect send me these um shout out to them i'm just doing this because why not [ __ ]

um yeah i definitely don't recommend you eat a whole bag of edibles i definitely doubt they didn't tell me to do it obviously i doubt they'd even want me to do that but [ __ ] it the mango is good damn this kind of reminds me of those uh those scooby snacks remember the gummy scooby snacks that were super fire i mean i think you can still get them but um it reminds me a lot of that to be honest this is mystery they got little triangles on them no no no i wasn't good all right oh that's true strawberry not bad so man so if you guys have ever watched my edible challenges i'll generally just eat all these wait an hour come back to you it's gonna be the same thing all right now i was gonna roll up a joint for right now but um i think for the first hour i want to see just how i feel off these before i smoke just regular just so i can give you a clear answer and then go smoke i guess that's like the responsible thing to do i don't know i don't [ __ ] we might have to come back early

some water all right man we are going to come back in an hour see how we feel um i'm a little nervous to be honest because i've never eaten this many edibles on delta a um but i do feel like my tolerance is high enough it's only 200 milligrams like the whole pack is only 200 milligrams so that's why i don't really think it's that big a video to be honest so yeah all right we will be back in

[ __ ]", "4lLn0PhkakM": "[Music] [Music] hey guys mr. and mrs. Smith here and today we're going to be reviewing the heavy hitters cannabis infused gummies we have strawberry pineapple to try today we're actually very excited to try these uh if you don't know already heavy-hitters is possibly our favorite brand I would definitely say I would say it's also primarily smoke heavy hitters for our everyday cartridge and then when we want to like it up a little bit we'll grab some other stuff but heavy hitters is definitely always on a cartridge for us so we're also going to be trying the heavy hares GSC I say trying we've had it many times but we haven't been able to find it for a while not what you are it kind of it kind of went out of stock just weird it used to be available a lot in like 2018 but it kind of just fell out of favor except for certain places would still carry a guy in town by our main delivery service was no longer carrying it but they had it the other day so I had to pick it up cause it's been too long it seems like they almost haven't had it in stock since the name change so JSC used to be Girl Scout cookies I don't know if they changed it in others stances I'm pretty sure it was part of the laws that happened I'm pretty sure it's part of the laws that happened in 2018 for California that's they weren't allowed to call it they can't call it candy I believe they can't use the term candy and they can't use the term anything that could be marketed yes towards children can't market towards children right Paul any so that's why it says gummies or it'll always seem medical or cannabis like that they never never make yeah that would be appealing to a child exactly it can't be bears or anything like that so I mean it's a good law honestly I totally understand why there's some other laws that happened in 2018 which I will give you a refresher on right now now there was some weird stuff that happened when California passed a recreational marijuana back in 2018 I believe it was one of the things that happen is towards the middle of the year they actually switched it to where edibles could no longer contain more than a hundred milligrams per package now if you work in the medical marijuana industry or if you were a user or anything like that prior you know that there used to be packages up to a thousand milligrams in just one treat and what that used to be really good at is you could like just take a nibble off of a treat throughout the day and just kind of keep yourself dosed and medicated off one treat for a whole week basically but they changed it because there were way too many people who would come into a dispensary have no idea what they were doing by one of those really high potency edibles eat the whole thing and then they have a really bad time and end up going to the emergency room they got sick of dealing with that so they made a law saying you can't have more than a hundred milligrams per package there are certain things you can get around that such as cannabutter tinctures and pills those three items you can definitely get in higher doses than 100 milligrams but for edibles and then kind of cookie or anything like that max you're gonna get in a package is about a hundred so today we're reviewing B's from heavy hitters and the way they went about with these twenty milligrams per piece is you can actually rip the pieces in half so it's actually two servings per piece so it actually comes in two to ten milligram servings which I'm pretty sure is the law is that each piece inside a package can only be ten milligrams or something like that I know five to ten milligrams is a state recommended serving I'm not a hundred percent clear on the laws but it's just an unfortunate thing that happened with edibles in 2018 but I am absolutely dying to try these guns so let's go ahead and open up to the [ __ ] strawberry cuz I'm Joey it's been it's been a long time looking for out that let me grab the a7 r3 with the 70s [Music] [Music] yeah we just won't have us we won't help you all this video it's just not working at the moment six and a half hours Nathan I might open the pineapple real quick to maybe these do not open well I feel like we should show just how much of a struggle these were to open just like a montage of the [ __ ] difficulty this is bad this one opened much easier but that first package it just ripped in such a way that it was really hard to open but this is just like the other one has a really strong smell I figured it's it's really strong artificial pineapple mmm it's it's kind of a a bit herbal but not like too herbal it's not like overly pungent or anything like that like you're not gonna have you're not gonna get in trouble they're just keeping these in your drawer or anything like that like no one's gonna smell it yeah I don't know if this has any actual like pineapple juice or anything in it it doesn't have it listed on the ingredients mm-hmm so we're not sure if this is artificial flavoring or real bad no artificial actual coloring and flavor so is that natural flavors that display really use the natural coloring and flavor like or is it a flavor that's kind of that's kind of weird I don't know if I feel someone from heavy Harry's modified food yeah I don't mind it I mean that's just what I mean the people are heavy hitters you might want to put that it is natural flavoring as well like actually specified natural color and natural flavoring because natural color and flavoring just sounds a bit odd it's it leaves it up to the imagination as to is the flavoring also natural or just natural color you're always a nice flavoring this yeah always alright so let's try the pineapple yeah I'm gonna do a full 20 but I'm gonna show the camera how it splits so this is the gummies from heavy-hitters it's a square and if you look very carefully there's this little seam in the middle that if you pull whoops it starts to come apart yes it does if you start to pull it comes apart very nicely into two perfectly even ten milligram pieces so let's start well I'm actually just gonna eat the whole thing at once wait so where's our list of like criteria so I know what the hell I'm supposed to be doing bring it up go on top down your mouth and just roll around a little okay yeah my hands are all sticky now you know I gotta say I'm a little disappointed I'm a little underwhelmed actually I had I had much higher hopes it could just be the pineapple yeah because I mean the strawberry definitely smells better than the pineapple the pineapple is a little strong it's kind of it's very herbal forward which isn't a bad thing a lot of people enjoy that it's not a bad flavor necessarily but it is definitely herbal forward if you're looking for something that you could just totally mound shun and forget that there's weed in it not that we recommend it's not gonna be that yeah definitely don't recommend that but I mean like if you're if you're a fan of someone who like Eric or someone who likes really really flavorful very liked gummies that don't aren't bitter or plant alike at all this is not for you this is made to be strong and to be potent and it definitely tastes like it so keep that in mind and next up we have the strawberry so let's go ahead and pop these open and yeah will rate them in a second let's try the strawberry and I want to go ahead and split this one yeah because there'll be 30 milligrams each mmm much better much better mm-hmm all right strawberry is actually really good um I would say it's definitely pretty it is still has that herbal flavor but um let me bring up the criteria so we can actually start to break these down aftertaste yeah yeah really bad yeah I would say it's a bit odd I I'm almost feeling a little bit um disappointed I know me too it which it sucks because I'm such a fan of their oils but that's where comes in would we be as disappointed if we hadn't hyping it up so much yeah we did we we've also we've held on to these for about two weeks we've been waiting and waiting and waiting to try these specifically for the on camera experience and you know I think that also kind of built it up the fact that we've been we've been like dying sitting on me dying to try them the whole time and I mean they're they're good [ __ ] effects for sure by new user mm-hmm will probably like would probably really like it however its strong grams each heavy hitters recommends 10 milligrams as a dose the state of California recommends that california recommends that I personally have very low tolerance when it comes to most things so if you're like me I would definitely recommend starting with 5 milligrams when it comes to edibles but I mean you've been doing it you've been using medical using marijuana medically for two years yes so her tolerance is pretty high so we can handle the 30 we just say no problem but the big thing is though from let's let's go ahead and actually break this down but the main thing that I'm getting from these is but from trying both of them it is quite herbal forward the the flavor is there the strawberry is much sweeter and more flavorful I would say than the pineapple pineapple is a little more herbal forward as well but let's actually start talking about our rating categories here and give these are actually solid score each [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] we're also gonna open this GSC previously known as Girl Scout cookies for those of you have been in the game a little longer and actually know the OG strings we're gonna be trying that card out today so anyways hope to catch you all later and see you in the next video like and subscribe [Music]", "fdvWwr1lF80": "thanks for rolling up until the morning certified quiet smoking one of my mornings maybe would it be looking at

grow us but they don't use gelatin so if you're vegan or if you don't need gelatin for any other reason this recipe is perfect for you so let's get started so you want to pour some juice and sugar into a small pot and bring it to a boil over medium heat then add some powdered agar which we are going to be using in place of gelatin and simmer for one minute then pour the mixture into a gummy bear mold and pop this into the fridge until set for about 20 minutes so you can just use juice as in or you can add some coconut milk to the juice and it gives you like this obviously like delicious coconut flavor but it also lightens the color of the juice so it's not like a pastel color that's an awesome option or route to go down I googled and try to see if we going with vegan and the answer I got was it isn't so that's why I didn't use any food coloring in this recipe so yeah so if you want to add coconut milk what you want to do it for the juice and sugar into a small pot and bring it to a boil over medium heat then add the powdered agar and simmer for one minute and then add some coconut cream and mix until it's fully combined if you don't want to use coconut cream you can always use almond milk then pour the mixture into a gummy bear mold and pop this into the fridge in full set for about 20 minutes then just unmold the gummy bears and you are done net so thank you guys so much

you whatever they put in this thing they've done a good job I [Music] bought a couple of quarters at a dispensary the other day and they offered you know a freebie and so I decided to go with the edible that they were offering and it happened to be a kirova Saturday morning cookie sample and took it home tried it out and I got to tell you I really really like this brand I really like this I mean I'm not familiar with edibles you might have a particular brand you like I came across these and whatever they're putting inside this thing I got to tell you it works really well for me I think these things are awesome you might have other brands that you particularly care for but I highly highly recommend you try the kirova I am not affiliated with them in any ways and just you know came across them at random and I really really like this cookie plus it's only 150 milligrams so I would maybe recommend to kind of start with these if you're just getting into edibles as far as dosing goes it's a good idea to start small now like I said this is 150 milligrams and you know other cookies and other things in other bars and other products they have you know 250 500 I've seen it even a thousand milligrams which is for me is it's too much you know I can't quite do that type of a thing but this packaging here says that it's got 15 servings per package so if you do the math it's like 10 milligrams per serving so if you're able to divide the cookie up as evenly as possible you can kind of figure out your dosage from there and I would probably you know I would say start with 20 milligrams these things can you know come across you anywhere from 10 minutes to you know 45 minutes to an hour depending on your metabolism and kind of like what's going on with your body and stuff like that so I always like to pass along the information which is kind of the thing with edibles because you know dosing is such a it's such a gray area definitely be careful with this don't eat a whole one for the first time if you're just starting out because you probably would have not such a great experience and you might not you know you might not come back to pick up some more this is about the size of a dose that I would do probably if you're just starting out I might do something around that size but since I've tried this a few times I'm adding this much more but I would try about that much in size even if you're a beginner start with twenty milligrams you know and see see where you go give yourself a little bit of time wait for about half an hour or so and see how you're feeling you know if you go on to maybe an hour hour and a half and you're still you know you're feeling good but maybe you want to feel a little bit better maybe try another ten twenty milligrams and then just call it good and see where you end up there some people will just you know eat something go I don't feel anything and eat some more I don't feel anything and all of a sudden they're just they're just blitzed it's the first time for them that would be that would be a shame because they wouldn't receive the benefits of the Saturday morning cookie so you know if you're just starting out that's what I would recommend for you to do dosing wise hopefully you found the information in this video useful if you did please comment like and subscribe I'm Enzo truffle with bud symbol calm and the kirova Saturday morning cookie thanks for watching [Music]", "J5Nu589uIAw": "what's up everybody my name is Sarah feet and welcome to the channel the haze we're gonna be reviewing the very famous very well-known and very beloved got me edible cushy punch now this is a California brand this is the sativa formula and it is absolutely fantastic so there's a few different types of products such as you punch makes the gummies I believe are their main and their original I know now they have like vaporizers they have CTD products things like that but the cushy punch are very well known for their gummies now these guys come in a hundred milligrams they also have a 200 milligram call to TKO and these guys come in these awesome little packet they're easy to break apart and each of these little squares is ten milligrams so you can dose however much that you would need personally now they are pretty strong I don't know exactly how they're made so they are made with organic sugar and feature no artificial coloring is all made with natural coloring so if that's something that concerns you if you have allergy problems and you can do artificial coloring these guys are a great option so let's talk about flavor these guys are really nice they're sweet but you do get a strong kind of cannabis oil to smell to them so if you pull them out in public if someone partakes or it is kind of in the know-how of how cannabis smells a little recognize this then they will smell it now if you're trying to see what kind of high this is this is the sativa one and for me these guys will keep me well they don't make me drowsy you can be very creative on them yeah I built this Depot these guys are good I could go together in a pinch because you will find out my most places now if you're talking prices they kind of range up and down I've seen these guys as low as $10 and S&M as high as $20 I don't really know if there's just a lot of places that are able to up the prices because it is wanted so bad if you can find a good deal on them they're very much worth it if it's the people are signing for 20 bucks and if you have to get it but it's a bit bit overpriced for these guys all in all if you are someone who travels a lot these guys aren't perfect companions they're small to fit in your pocket if you go to the movies a lot these are great as well so that is my little small review for the fam the cushy punch well there you go guys thank you so much for taking the time and watching this review again my name is Sarah B welcome to the haze and I will see you next time oh also please follow us on Instagram the haze anyway guys thank you so much for watching I hope to see you next time and shout", "L2EvOegVsN8": "hey guys welcome back today I'll be showing you how to make peach ring gummies I am including a recipe in this video but you can use any recipe you like you could even buy orange and yellow pre-made store-bought gummies and just melt those down and that will work just as well and this video is going to include some troubleshooting because I had quite a bit of issues making these I had to remould them multiple times I'm gonna show you guys how they started which was like this but eventually I got to them to come out like this here's what you're going to need 1/3 of a cup of water three and a half tablespoons of gelatin 1/4 teaspoon potassium sorbate mixture which I will link how to make below 1 teaspoon citric acid 1/2 teaspoons of peach flavoring oil 1 tablespoon of Tincher 1/4 cup of sugar 1/4 cup corn syrup 1/2 a tablespoon lecithin white food coloring and yellow and orange food coloring the first step is to bloom your gelatin so just pour your gelatin over your dish of water as well as your citric acid your potassium sorbate mixture your flavoring oil and the lecithin no need to stir this just leave it to bloom for about 5 minutes now pour your sugar and your quan syrup into a saucepan and heat that up once that begin to melt you can add in half of your gelatin mixture and then stir that in you're going to add in a candy thermometer and you want to keep stirring and heating up this mixture until it reaches between 200 to 210 degrees once it's heated up to that temperature you can add in your remaining gelatin mixture and stir that in then turn off the heat now I'm just going to pour in my tincture and stir that in and then because I'm going to be doing three different colors I'm going to separate this into different dishes I'm going to be coloring one yellow one orange and this one here is white and yellow I filled up a pyrex dish with very hot water to keep my mixtures warm while I'm not using them and then I'm going to pour my first one into a plastic bag that I have sprayed with cooking spray so it doesn't stick and then I'm going to fill up the first half of my molds alright so you can clearly see I'm having a lot of issues pouring the mixture into the molds it's too sticky it's making a mess and not coming out smoothly so I try to warm it up again and that is not working so I am just going to have to figure out how to fix these and what I decided to do was to take them all out and remelt them with some more water and a little bit of gelatin so I added a couple tablespoons of water a few for the microwave for about 30 seconds and then now I'm going to add in half a teaspoon of gelatin and just mix that in I decided instead of a plastic bag I'm going to put it into a squeeze bottle so I'll have better control of how much is coming out and you can see how amazingly it's coming out it's absolutely perfect I was very happy I also added a little bit of water to each of my yellow and orange but not extra gelatin as there wasn't a large enough amount for it to matter I wanted to try and see if I could put the yellow and orange directly on top obviously I couldn't so that means I needed to leave it in a freezer to cool down for a bit and then after all of that work I realized something very unfortunate and that is that I did everything in the wrong order so the curved part of this mold is on the bottom meaning that I needed to have the orange and the yellow on the bottom and the yellowy white color so once again I am pulling them out and going to warm them up and remould them and then I just threw it in the microwave and poured it back into my little squeeze bottle and everything looks like it's gonna be perfect third time's the charm right let's hope so well after this was done I put them in the freezer for about half an hour and they were good to come oh they look beautiful well after all this hard work I am happy to say they came out very nice they have a beautiful texture they look wonderful hopefully if any of you guys try this out some of my mistakes will help you guys not make them and then I want something to have sugar on them so I'm just gonna throw the ones that have a little bit of imperfections into a container of sugar shake them up and then lay them out to dry and just a reminder that before you cover your gummies in sugar you need to make sure you have let them sit out for at least 24 hours so any excess moisture evaporates otherwise they will become watery thank you guys very much for watching this video if you enjoyed it please leave a comment give us a thumbs up and subscribe also let me know do you guys prefer shorter videos that I don't include any troubleshooting or errors or you prefer videos like this where I kind of talk about things that can go wrong and how you can fix them let me know in the

california not just southern california but all of the west coast uh so i thought you know what better day to finally review these smokies edibles than this smokiest of days also the name of the minor league baseball team uh where i grew up in east tennessee smoky mountains uh so as i said these are the smokey's edibles very handsome packaging picked these up in long beach california for 18 bucks which puts them at a slight premium for the gummy edibles that they carry that are 100 milligrams these are a 10 serving 10 milligram edible and it's got all the good stuff on the back your lab testing results your nutrition information all that wonderful stuff and as i said these are 100 milligrams of thc 10 per piece and they contain less than 2 milligrams of cbd per piece really handsome packaging here from smokies i think it's quite nice looking uh i i really appreciate it it's not super opulent or ostentatious or anything it's just a nice print i'm easily impressed that way so let's go ahead and open up these gluten free dairy free vegan no high fructose corn syrup fruit snacks and give them a try [Music] we've got our standard child proof packaging here not gonna fool me today ah and here we are here are our smokies uh these are the jamberry fruit chews i'm not really 100 sure what a jam berry is but let's give it a try uh and i will mention that i did have a little bit of fat uh just a few minutes before this just to take these under optimal conditions probably not necessary i do it jic so here is our first 10 milligram smokies edibles jamberry gummy [Music] i would jam with that berry all day wow that is really tasty vaguely yeah uh berryish berry medley flavor some strawberries some blackberry but uh great gummy i mean taste wise there is just a smidge of that wheat aftertaste um but not much not much at all uh in terms of gummy's taste these are on the better end these are like the uh the plus gummies if not even slightly better tasting [Music] it's hard to say it's good yum again there is just that little bit of weed after taste it's not a whole lot um certainly not gonna ruin it for me uh outside of that taste is really good but the most important thing about these slightly more expensive than usual smokies edibles is are they gonna get you high and for that we're gonna have to wait about two hours to find out for sure like all wheat's reviews i'm going to finish these eight now seven whoops smokey's here over the next probably hour so and then like all wheat's reviews two hours after that last smokies i'll come right back to you guys and let you know exactly how these things are hitting because that's the most important part of any edible review until then stay high stay healthy stay out of this smoke and we'll see you guys soon later [Music] welcome back to wheats everybody it has been two and a half hours since my first smokies edibles not quite so smokies in here uh but still pretty smokies in here i don't know what that means what i'm trying to say is these are damn good gummies i am uh very high right now um i think i would put this in the uh higher tier gummy snacks in terms of both taste and potency um these feel every bit of 100 milligrams if not slightly more so than some of the uh better gummies like your steezies and plus i mean look at my eyes i'm pretty high uh it could also just be that i just finished and what the [ __ ] let's just cherry on top it while we're here uh it could be that i just finished an episode episode four of lovecraft country on hbo max or hbo go or hbo whatever uh hbo noun or verb next to it holy [ __ ] what a good show i'm pretty sure i actually carried on topped the novel upon which it's based years ago years ago uh but now the tv shows out it's really good it's not a whole lot like the novel but that's not a bad thing but also is not a bad thing are these smokiest edibles they are a bit of a premium at 18 uh as opposed to these sort of more 15-ish dollars but they are damn damn good um both in terms of taste and potency and also uh tasting and uh tasting great and being quite strong love craft country on hbo but things i like quite a bit uh both things i look forward to enjoying again at some point in the future smokey's edibles thumbs up love craft country your random cherry on top no effort added but that doesn't take away from the quality at all just like smokies full circle thank you so much for watching weeds guys it has been a blast hanging out with you until our next review live stream whatever it is that you watch with us stay high more importantly stay healthy we'll see you then love craft country", "mabfxc09iq8": "hey guys welcome back to my channel today I'll be sharing the super easy recipe and this seems to be the latest craze right now all the kids are eating it everybody's buying it and do you know what I'm gonna share with you my simple version of it because it's so easy to make you're gonna need a bag of gummy bears and this is the party size it's twenty eight point eight ounces and you can use whatever gummies you have at home I also have these sour watermelons like GE but you can use sour patch kids you can use lifesaver gummies whatever kind of gummies you have use it anyway powder is basically plum powder it's a popular thing here in Hawaii and they have different brands as well but this Brown seems to be the popular one here you're also going to need lemon strips the Jade Brown is my favorite one if you can't find that they have different brands I found these as well they're called Rocky's and they also have local kind snacks some one that you don't want in don't get this don't get the lemon peel because this actually has seeds in it and you don't want that in your candy we're gonna also need one lemon juice from one lemon and just a little bit of sugar as well so let's get started the first thing you want to do is go ahead and blend your lemon strips in a blender the consistency that you want and you want it really fine and shred it because this will help to quote the gummy bears at the end when you're ready for alright so next you want to go ahead and juice one lemon and I have this little gadget here alright so I have my lemon juice and I actually measured this this is equivalent to two tablespoons of lemon juice so you want to go ahead and pour that in a bowl you also want to add one tablespoon of sugar two teaspoons of leaky moy powder and you want to go ahead and mix this until the sugar is dissolved completely so the sugar has completely dissolved at this point you want to go ahead and give it a little taste to see if you want it sweeter and if so go ahead and add in another tablespoon of sugar but I kind of like it this way because the gummy bears is already sweet and the lemon strips have sugar in it as well so I'm gonna just stick with one tablespoon next step is to add the entire bag of gummy bears go ahead and give it a good mix and make sure that the gummy bears are evenly coated with the lemon syrup [Music] here is a close-up of the final product you can see that every single gummy bear is covered with those lemon strips and that's just how I love them and I also went ahead and put the gummy bears and these little plastic containers cuz I'm gonna just give it out to family and friends anyways I hope you guys enjoyed this easy recipe give it a thumbs up leave a comment down below and feel free to share my video if you want to anyways thanks for watching guys and I'll see you guys next time Aloha", "azwHy_zm08I": "[Music] it works on a receptor which is called the gaba receptor gaba usually keeps a sense of calmness it has sedative properties it has muscle relaxant properties you feel the good feeling in that way one may feel the effects for approximately i would say three to four hours then one way and then one may need to repeat it at that time to get the effect again and it lasts in your system approximately eight hours or so so it washes out pretty quickly benzodiazepines including xanax can cause cognitive problems over a period of months to years people can have memory problems you become psychologically and physically addicted to the medication if you don't take it you can develop severe withdrawal you'll become restless you will become irritable you'll become edgy you won't be able to sleep you may start to have gastric problems you may feel sweaty you start to lose all of the positive effects of the medication and because it has a short half-life you need to increase it and you need to take it more frequently", "tFiPPb3WFG0": "hi well welcome to Diamond delight edibles my name is Liz if this is the first time you're joining and if you're a regular subscriber welcome back thank you so much your support has been truly awesome so I had a couple requests there for vegan gummy bears and as I said it previously in the past I tried it with epic fail and so but I am never one to give up so I kept thinking about the method I knew would have just something to do with the method so I I thought I figured it out and the fact that you're seeing this video actually means that I did figure it out so I've created a vegan gummy candy for you so it's not gonna be exactly like a gummy bear but it's gonna be about as close and probably with you being vegan this is probably something that you're far more used to anyway and and with that yeah so I'm really excited to be able to bring that for it to you and the one thing I decided is if I'm ever gonna want to pick up somebody rich I'm gonna pick up a vegan because seriously man if they can afford the Google's groceries or that kind of food holy mountain they must have money because that stuff is expensive so anyway I'm gonna get into the ingredients here and the steps on how to do it and stay tuned alrighty so for our vegan can of oil gummies you're going to need well now I'm just making a small batch because I'm testing it so I'm not a hundred percent sure if this is gonna turn out and I really don't feel like wasting a whole bunch however if it does turn out you're if you're seeing the video then you know it's turned out so I'm going to be using 1 cup of juice I'm just using a peach cocktail you can use whatever juice that you'd like just not pineapple juice because it has an enzyme in it and that will that I know causes gelatin not to set I'm going to think it probably has the same effect on agar you're going to use one and a half tablespoons to one cup of the liquid if you want to make it more so if you're going to go 2 cups of liquid then you would do two and a half tablespoons of agar 3 cups of liquid three and a half a garb so on we're going to use one tablespoon of blue a gob syrup a quarter cup of our can of oil now I've just used regular coconut oil I haven't infused it because again I'm not going to eat this so I didn't really want to waste it and there's really no difference whether I've got THC in it or not and we're going to use Gore gum as our emulsifier so we're no further ado and we're gonna need our handy little blender and a saucepan and a spatula obviously your molds and that should be about it so I'm just gonna get this stuff cleared up and we'll get going alright so we're going to turn our heat on - so we're going to add our liquid to our saucepan and we're going to add in one tablespoon of the aghasura that's a coconut it was a lot different than butter so what we're gonna do is we're going to emulsify our our oil and our liquid first when I've tried it the other way adding everything into the agha R it just didn't work so I'm hoping that emulsifying our liquid and our oil together first is gonna solve that problem so I'm going to use 1/2 a teaspoon of our agar our sorry of our Gore gum Gorgo Mogar it's very tongue-twisting if you have a strainer like a little small strainer strainer works great for doing the gums so because you can evenly distribute it all over the top otherwise if you have to do it with your hands just try and do it as evenly as possible just kind of take little pinches and sprinkle it around like so and we're going to get our handy little hand wonder and start blending this up [Music] all right so that looks all thoroughly mixed so that looks good all our oil is nicely blended in so once you're that it's all nicely blended and it is all one uniform nice uniform homogeneous texture you're gonna add in one and a half tablespoons a Gaur now you can get Oh Garf lakes or agar powder the flakes are less expensive the powder I'm pretty sure you would use at the same but you'd have to look at the instructions for it I just don't have a hue a lot of experience with us with it and a half a tablespoon is one and a half teaspoons three teaspoons is one tablespoon and you're going to turn your heat up to medium-high we're going to bring this to a boil and once it's boiling we're going to turn it down and let it simmer for five minutes so now that my mixture is coming to a boil I'm going to turn it down to medium medium-low and just let that simmer for five minutes or until it is completely dissolved and you just want to keep make sure to keep stirring that alright so I'm kind of seeing some oil the oil sitting on the top here so I'm going to use the blender here to see if we can get that mixed in there because that's not looking quite right [Music] so I'm still seeing it set up at the top here the oil on the top so I'm gonna add in some more I'm gonna add a little more girl gum so I'm going to add in just a quarter of a teaspoon this time [Music] well that looks a lot better all right so what we're going to do now is distribute this in to our moles so whether you're using your squirt bottles this might be a little bit thick for the for an eyedropper but you can give it a try all right so once your your syrup looks like this it's nice and smooth no lumps you can put it into your squirt bottle oops oh [ __ ] all right don't do that on the mold learn from my mistakes all right so I'm just gonna clean up that bottle we'll get this into molds all righty so now that I've cleaned up my mess now the bottle is going to be very hot so you want to wrap it either in a some doubled up paper towel or use an oven mitt or something and you're just going to distribute it into your molds now don't fill your molds all the way up to the top like I just did there that's an oops you want to keep them just below and that's so it doesn't create an edge a sharp edge on your candies now with agar you're just gonna leave these sit on the counter for a few hours for them to set they do not go in the refrigerator whatever you do a guard is not set in the fridge it is completely different than gelatin also has a very different texture well if you're vegan and you you use agar you know what the texture is like but for those of you too new to it are trying it something different it is a different completely different texture than gelatin I can't really describe it it is a gelatin but it's not jello it's filling these up and I'll come back in a couple of hours we'll take them out and see what happens right so let's see how these little puppies came out well they come out of the mold really holy mackerel they actually worked this time I can't believe it last time they were partially set and partially mushy and they were really disgusting but this this method actually worked so I did some reading on how you actually store these because you can't do them like a regular gummy bear or a regular gummy candy and with four agar actually it says but it's served best cold so actually once they're all set you know just put them on a plate put them in the fridge for a couple of for about an hour George's for them to cool down get cold and then give them a try so I'm gonna do that and we'll see how they are now these puppies just pop right out of the mold look at that lot easier than the jello look bear overboard alrighty so I put these guys into the fridge for an hour and so they're nice and cold and you can see how much they lighten up and as well they're not as greasy so when you first take these guys out they are gonna feel a little bit greasy once you put them in the fridge that tends that goes away but as I said you can probably see you store them in the fridge I'll just wrap them up in wrap it up with saran wrap and they'll probably be good for about two weeks I'm gonna guess if you find that different please let me know in the comments that would be great alright so that is the little tutorial there on a vegan can of oil gummy bears and I'll just be back to say goodbye so that was my little demonstration there on vegan and can of oil gummy candies I hope you enjoyed the demonstration if you have any questions at all please don't hesitate to put them in the comments I will get back to you as soon as I can and I'd love to hear from you and let me know how yours turned out alright well thank you so much for watching I really appreciate it and if you enjoyed this video I do hope you subscribe thanks again have an awesome day [Music]", "jsrYj8rSzRc": "I say these tastes better than the real fruits candy is better than fruit doesn't have all that pesky fiber and nutrients in it [Music] we are taste testing ultimate gummy bears this one's really interesting they have natural flavors and they have supposedly premium flavors premium premium flavor wheeze taste tested a lot of gummy so you got a tough tongue to impress also then what makes them so ultimate is they're colored naturally with fruits and vegetables I like the sound of vegetables getting into my gosh I want this to be as unhealthy as possible but I'll give it a shot okay so we're talking Alphonso mango amedy raspberry I am probably mispronouncing all of this Asian pear black currant blood orange crimson cranberry Fuji apple and my favorite queen pineapple your favorite word just wonderful my favorite 90s R&B artist okay the smells coming out of this bag are unreal so good it's like a farmers market or a smoothie king or something it just sounds like most juice yeah it smells fresh let's try it oh wow mmm I got mango I got that Alphonso mango who can you taste the Alphonso first sure I think my brains playing tricks I mean but it almost was like juicy when I'm yeah I was getting that too because the flavor is so strong it tastes like a gum commercial looks you know like a gum commercial they're like flooded in like fruit juice they're like forever it lasts like seven seconds anyway these are delicious holy cow what flavor are you having it doesn't even matter that does I want to know I a mango and I didn't I think this might be the black currant I just had a queen pineapple it was good really own bamboo so I think what makes these different the other ones have more of a traditional like candy artificial flavoring these have like a much more fresher fruitier taste to them they're unlike any regular gummy bears you just buy off the shelf like the gummy that we usually sell is already really high-quality and this like is that a whole nother level it's so soft so fruity so refreshing oh yeah please this might be my new favorite coming flavors that we have mm-hmm there is really unique you don't know I got crimson cranberry cranberry gummy what a lot I just got pear you don't find pear that often in like candy yes this has pear and it was delicious ma'am each one I keep eating I keep thinking that's my new favorite without raspberry was good my favorite is a pineapple because you don't see a lot of pineapple gummy yes you kind of do but this is like a really good pineapple gummy I thought oh my gosh I have a hard time deciding I don't think I've had them all again but the mango the mango and the pair of both really good I'm really impressed with these it's a different kind of gummy experience I got to be honest girl please pineapple vat19.com", "CuS8zdDf4Ro": "hey everybody hey guys Justin and Jennifer here with Ravi yoga and wellness so glad to have you joining us today we want to share a brand new product that we just got into the studio I guess it's been maybe a couple of months now months it's Smokey's gummies edibles they are actually out of Oregon and this company Smokies started with a THC product a product that includes THC and they only recently just started having CBD products on their lineup as a result you don't see terribly much information on their website but that is why we wanted to do this review it's really funny the the salesman you're really good of an away the salesman gave me a call it was a random maybe Friday afternoon and wanted to know if we wanted to carry these in the studio and where yoga and wellness studio so I thought no I actually no I thought no we don't need any more gummies and he said no no let me just send you these I'm telling you as soon as you've tried them you'll buy them and he was right they're good he sent me five different varieties and four gummies and one hard candy we still carry all of those in the studio and they were so good the first one I had is a different one that that we will review later the first one I had was so good I couldn't just eat one ga - no I ate all of them I one of all this so I basically had no beauty function the hard candies only had 15 milligrams so there was I think it I think I did the math it was like 85 milligrams so I must have had only four samples anyways I was not high because there is zero THC I did see it let's show them that there's that on the back corner there's zero THC so I was a high but but let me tell you ladies I did not care no should I think you're the rest today I was like what is wrong and then I put in a huge order because I love them and so does everybody else so in this bag you get ten gummies that are 25 milligrams of CBD each the nutrition labels right here on the back there is about 2 grams of sugar per gummy so it's not too bad for those people out there that are concerned about sugar and bean gummies they are 25 milligrams and each gummy right here well I'm just reiterating it there that's a logic of me CBD love all the gummies are gluten free they're not all vegan friendly they do have some vegan friendly options and we carry we have so couple of those flavors in the studio though we also have some sugar-free options as well yep that's true but today's review is on the watermelon flavors not just watermelon it's sour watermelon so I'll just take it from the team so you're gonna notice like when you open they come resealable which is really nice oh my gosh and I'm having trouble getting it open this might be a sign I did not I did not and they're little bitty squares and they're super delicious I actually really like the sour kinds of candies and so this is like a holler back to like the lemon heads or what are those super sour candies that the kids love these days anyway so they're a better sweet tarts but they're gummies but these are gummies in there there's no that's our daughter she just went potty okay so we will have to finish this review very quickly so this um you'll see a little bit of the sugar on the outside it tastes amazing you can eat half of it and then you get like half of the CBD but we preferred all of it so we like to eat all of it yep and if you got our website they said they're revamping their website so it's really because of the THC and because the laws in Oregon have changed to where they can't market gummies anymore because of kids obviously so the website will be updated in the next couple of months is what they said that they're a little bit behind but I wanted to show you the website a little bit they also said I actually talked to our rep on the phone today here is here is the about page well let me see if I can show you my inner I'm only as fast on my internet so as you can see it's a really nice website it's really pretty the problem is the about page is pretty it's it's pretty bare-bones right now they do not offer the third-party test results they do not offer any of the like ingredients list and you also can't buy the products online from their website yet however you can buy them from our thrive hemp store website thrive hemp store calm we should be able to keep the inventory updated there I hope and if you ever have any doubts you can give us a call at four to three to nine zero to three to six again this is in the US we can ship inside the US once you start shipping overseas it gets a little hairy I believe I know that several other CBD companies do have trouble trying to ship overseas so if you're interested in trying a really good it's absolutely delicious gummy it has 25 milligrams of CBD isolate it is not the full spectrum it is a nice lip we absolutely love the Smoky's brand CBD we sell a whole bunch of these things have actually kind of over passed our other brand that we had in the studio and so we absolutely love them and think you should try it out the sour watermelon is awesome so is basically every flavor so as a result of that we're gonna like review every flavor so that we get to taste them that's right so if you like this review or have some products you would like us to review send them to us yeah yeah and leave us a note below let us know what you think of the Smokey's CBD gummies with 25 milligrams each and if you want to buy some check us out at thrive hipster calm see you soon buh-bye thanks so much", "KlAEA1y6Omo": "yo what is going on youtube welcome back to another video with your boy savvy g guys today man we got something very very special all right i'm gonna be trying something new and i'm gonna be filming the entire thing with you guys all right so pretty much though how this went down was i want to really take a break from d9 um thc and just because i feel like every single time that i smoke i don't really get the like super super baked just because of my tolerance right i've been smoking for four to five years already and i just feel like dude that's a long time man literally oh like i think for the past like two years maybe it's been daily usage so i haven't really had a break from it at all but today guys we're going to be trying out delta 8 thc all right so this one in particular is from a brand called moonwalker and honestly they're probably the leading industry delta eight company out right now that i've seen i've searched all over the google already uh i've had friends tell me that they use this product and they like it's probably the most talked about brand right so if it's being talked about it obviously has to be good so i went ahead and copped some myself i have two of the gummies right here i have the your let me go ahead i'm gonna butcher the hell out of these names europa and atlas this one right here i'm assuming maybe like an indica doesn't particularly say that it's indica but whatever and this one right here is atlas which is watermelons gitls and i didn't even read that they have strains but this one is blue dream berry alright so honestly two pretty pretty fire flavors so i'm gonna be taking like some of these i honestly don't even know so there's 25 pieces in each and each piece is 25 milligrams all right so i'm probably gonna take maybe i want to say i kind of want to take like 100 to start off since this is something that i really don't consume often i heard that this hits you way different than delta 9 thc since your body doesn't have a tolerance to it so i'm hoping that i can feel the effects but i'm pretty sure that i'm not going to be able to feel them right away so i'm going to come back to the camera in about like 45 minutes to an hour when i feel a difference 100 honest review if i really feel something different if my anxiety's gone away my stress like you know my headache whatever the case is but we'll tell you guys if we feel different but i don't want to leave you guys empty-handed for this first clip so we got something else for you guys we got two of their cartridges right here so this one on my left is calypso and the one on the right is titan right strawberry gelato sour lemon haze and then um yeah 800 milligrams so i'm gonna go ahead and bust into the strawberry gelato for the first one and see if i could even take feel anything i'm not gonna i don't want to go two two i don't want to get too too faded or whatever the case is with this but because i want to feel the gummies right so i'm gonna take a hit just to give a taste test all right so i'm gonna go ahead and bust one of these suckers open and like i said we're gonna be using the toki 510 thread battery one of my favorite batteries you guys know that and boom look at this right here this thing is clear bro super super freaking clear let's go ahead and do the bubble test i don't even know if a bubble test is a thing in the delta eight community but it's not moving so it's definitely very very thick with three c's my boys so go ahead slap this on here i'm gonna go ahead and see the light turn on once it's on boom so this is just a taste test i'm not going to go ahead and be taking blinkers off of this or anything because i want to taste the gummies first all right so cheers whoo yo that actually tastes really really freaking good dude hey where we might have to make of taking blinkers off a delta 8 thc though honestly let me know like run up the likes on this video if we could get maybe over 500 likes we'll do a specific video taking blinkers off of these cartridges but i forgot i was literally going to end the clip and i have to try these out for you guys all right so the first ones that we're going in are the blue ones that these are also i just read 100 vegan gummies and this one is a blue dream right a little inside look for you guys crystal little sugar cubes so i'm gonna go ahead and pop two of these cheers yo yo these are fire you don't taste any wheat in them or anything at all it just tastes up like it's straight up blue raspberry gummy so it's pretty fire pop two of those go ahead and pop these open these are the watermelon skittles honestly these could be even more fire so pop two of these suckers no i don't know if i'm gonna get baked or not but we'll see what happens man so here's a little card that they give you when you buy something off of the site i have a i have a discount code if you guys ever do because this thing is um illegal i think it's federally legal i'm not i don't remember but yeah it's not like regular thc you get a nice little card like this when you receive it so i'm gonna go ahead and end this clip out for you guys and i'll catch you guys in about 45 minutes to an hour when i feel something or i don't feel something but either way i'm gonna give you guys a little update and we'll be back guys so an hour and a half later right so this is what happened right so i went and ran some errands real quick i went to go take a shower because i was feeling a little bit dirty and then in the shower dude like while i was writing the errands i was like i was felt so rushed right everything would just felt so rushed but as soon as i hopped into the shower i felt like that's when the gummies took effect because i i like my mind was running so much and then boom i just got a a sudden calmness all right i just felt like super super relaxed and it wasn't like i didn't feel high but i just felt like relaxed like all of that stress all of that the things that i was thinking about i was just like gone right so it's very very very high on the calming side for me it's like i don't really feel any laziness any like couch lock anything like that that i would usually get from thc i mean delta nine thc like usually when i smoke delta 9 thc i don't know my thoughts feel really really clouded i feel like groggy i feel like very like yeah i feel faded but it's like not really like a very very calm fadedness unless it's a really really good indica but with this delta eight thc it's really really really calming and soothing and relaxing but you don't really get those really really super high psychoactive effects that you usually get from delta nine but to end off this other side of the um clip i'm going to go ahead and take a couple more hits because i'm pretty sure i'm not going to be able to feel the effects of this cartridge because i feel the effects of the gummies already but i do want to talk a little bit of this um delta 8. they did give me the info card right here so i was like why not talk with you guys for a little bit right but pretty much what they say in moonwalker the brand is this is what delta eight thc is so delta eight thc is also referred as d a and delta a blah blah is a rare cannabinoid found in the hemp plant right so delta athc is slightly psychoactive but less intoxicating than delta nine thc so then again that's why you're not feeling like that well that's all right i'm not feeling that super super crazy high it's like barely just that very very subtle calmness and how does it make me feel so delta eight is known for clarity euphoria and calming effects all right often resulting in a relaxed state of mind so that makes sense at lower doses delta eight can help you give the energy you may need to get through the day literally feel like i'm reading to a bunch of kids right now reading off of this but yeah man so this is honestly a pretty really good product if you really want to stray away from smoking too much of delta 9 thc because obviously you could build up a tolerance but if you still want to be smoking if you still want to feel that calmness like i personally do then you know this is the way to go delta a thc i'm definitely going to be using this a lot more i don't want to really do too much like you know 500 milligrams thousand milligrams like i do with thc or regular thc i mean um with this definitely gonna be like micro dosing it maybe a hundred milligrams a day so with that being said let's go ahead and end up this video with a nice little hit of the strawberry gelato um like i said if you guys want to see of blinkers or just taking fat at rips from the delta athc and giving you guys a real effect a real review of how it makes me feel when i'm completely sober just the cartridges themselves let's go ahead and run up the likes maybe if we could hit over 600 likes we'll definitely try to do that so cheers yo [Music] it's actually really really freaking smooth and the strawberry gelato sticks out so dang much all right i would i'm honestly really really interested and curious as to how the cartridges hit as opposed to delta nine thc cartridge so i don't know man it'd be an interesting video so i'm gonna go ahead and end out this video here if you guys enjoyed today's video man do me one favor smash the likes hit those comments and most importantly smash the subscribe button and we'll catch you guys on the next one", "BpKYde5BXHI": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today I'm gonna be showing you how to turn regular Cola bottle gummies into you guessed it infused Cola bottle bellies here's what you're going to need two tablespoons of warm water four ounces of Cola flavored gummies one-and-a-half teaspoons of gelatin 1/4 teaspoon of potassium sorbate mixture which I will link how to make below one to two teaspoons of a herbal tincture if desired and a soda bottle mold the first step is to sprinkling a gelatin over the warm water there's no need to stir it just leave it to sit for about five minutes so it can bloom now you can take your Cola gummies and cut them so the lighter color is separated from the darker color place the lighter colored gummies into a dish and add about a quarter of your gelatin mixture then place it in the microwave for about 30 to 40 seconds until it melts once it's melted pour in some your tincture and then stir it in I'm going to be placing my mixture into a squeeze bottle and then putting it into a cup filled with warm water to keep it warm and liquid until I have everything ready to go now repeat this process with the other half of the gummies you'll be using your remaining amount of tincture and all of your gelatin my tincture is having some difficulties binding to the gummy mixture so I'm adding in about a teaspoon of lecithin to help it emulsify now I'm going to pour in both mixture at the same time putting the light color on the top and the dark color on the bottom once that's done I'll place them in the fridge or the freezer for about in half an hour so I can take them out of their mold [Music] I want some of them to be coated in sugar so I just filled a little bag with some sugar and shook them around and then I will leave these to sit out for about 24 hours so any excess moisture can evaporate that's it now your gummies are ready to be enjoyed [Music] thank you guys so much for watching if you enjoyed this video please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe [Music]", "jf-qGT8TZbU": "I don't know what's happening this is\nharder than any challenge I've had at vat19 the theme this week is I don't\nknow might not work at all but it could be awesome this is that\nnineteen we're known for using our curiously awesome gifts to make\nawesomely big videos each week our team has to figure out how to pull off a new\nidea and try to create the next hit this could be awesome\nat vat19 we love gummy in all its forms food gummy animal gummy weird coming\nreally weird coming but this week I want wearable gummy I want to make an entire\noutfit out of gummy candy let's see if we can pull it off I have a plan so\nJamie's challenged us I don't know if we're gonna be able to pull it off but\nI'm out pick up materials and we'll do our best I've got to make a bunch of\nmolds a bunch of items and then make them into gummy I'm looking for 100%\nsilicone this might be way too much might not be enough I have no idea\nwhen you make a shirt you have to stitch up some of the parts you cut it into\nsections and then stitch it all together and that's how you make a shirt or\nshorts I think I'm gonna have to do the same thing with gummy all right I got\nsome thread and some needles well you can't have a gummy outfit without a pair\nof shoes so I'm on the hunt to find some sandals that we could mold and fill with\ngummy something like this has way too much texture on it that it's perfect it's got very little\ntexture surface so it should release just great from the mold and for mold\nrelease we're using pan because it's food grade and it does the trick I'm\ngoing to do a quick little test to see if this mold technique works I've got a\nlittle seashell here I'm just gonna use straight-up silicone to mash it into the\ncracks to get all these details hopefully this can be a really messy\nproject making the tiniest little mold that I'm already covered in silicone I\nforgot to put release agent on the shell so I don't think this mold is actually\ngonna work but this one I did put release agent on I mixed in some blue\nfood coloring pretty good we've got some shell detail this is pretty pretty solid\nnot super flimsy I think we could pour gummy in this and have a gummy shell so\nthis technique of making molds works on a small scale I don't know how that's\ngonna go when I start trying to make a shirt I think for the gummy shirt I'm\ngoing to slice up a regular t-shirt lay it down\ntrace it format of clay pour silicone on top let that harden flip it over and\nthen pour gummy into it does that make sense we've got other things like these\nslides sandals we got a watch we're gonna make we're gonna make some ear\npods Jamie also challenged us to make hair out of gummy for him to wear I\ndon't know if any of this is gonna work this is an extreme challenge okay so we\nhave ten flavors of gummies that we're gonna use in our gummy outfit being\ngummy experts as we are oh can we figure out what the flavor is just by our sense\nof taste blindfolded taste test first gummy is in front of you okay three two\none watermelon it's watermelon that is a watermelon I'm down one I can do this\nokay three two one Oh what is that you know that one green\nraspberry dang it you're right Giada dang it does a strawberry orange\ncream so good yeah up top up top ah three two one\nalright fruit great Oh is there a plate here okay\nnow this feels blue to my hands that's a bright flavor all right\nyou feelin bright about that hmm grape no we both said great really oh so I was\nright it was blue first of all always go with your field job here's what we know\nwell you're over here I'm better at feeling flavors than I am tasting it\nmango a lot of what there's no pina colada I think I've guessed that like three\ntimes now raspberry grapefruit yeah dang it oh you\nknow what I don't care if I'm not good at this cuz I could I got to eat the\nsame amount of gummies you did so still delicious either was amazing so we're\nmaking this shirt mold and it's really big and you want to make sure that the\ngummy doesn't spill out of this mold what we're gonna do is get some burlap\nand some plaster and rub it all over the top and get kind of a rigid mold to keep\nit contained we sing the shoe from the mold cutting it out this is extremely\nsatisfying there we go two halves of one shoe\nhere's all the clay from the shirt I made\nand the mold released nicely should get a nice-looking gummy shirt so instead of doing the shorts like I\ndid the shirt I've got an idea I think we should just pour gummy onto a flat\nsurface and then cut it out like a cookie cutter so it's really important\nJamie wears underwear yes well I think it's self-explanatory so I've got some\norange cream gummy I squirted it inside this mold for some AirPods Plus that\nopen in the morning and see how she worked really good we're on the watch\ndown of this parchment paper so that I can just pour the silicone on top of the\nwatch you have that cornstarch it dries in like 15 minutes that's right and\nthat'll be an Apple watch mold right here we go all right Jamie wants gummy\nhair I'm gonna sculpt a hairdo on this mannequin head then I'll put silicone\nall over it hopefully it works I've never done this especially like this is\nthe hardest part for sure this hair is basically a giant prosthetic just get\nthe basic shapes on here first and then I'll start layering luscious locks smoothing out some of these cracks it's\nkind of drying out as I've been working with it got a nice little comb-over\nsurfer looking I don't know something so while those guys are busy working on\nmaking my gummy outfit I want to have everyone try this it is the first\nproduction sample of a new product it's not out yet it's called the bittersweet\nchallenge the world's most bitter lollipop it looks fine it smells fine\nit's just a bitter thing yeah yeah so the challenge is eat the whole thing and\nyou can't spit it out at all like somebody put some limes in a trash can\nhey Joey do you want to try this lollipop no good luck to you you can do\nthat I need really impressive someone made this all right\ncovered the clay in silicone and let that dry when we poured gummy into the\nmold for the sandals and then cut it open we found out that the gummy didn't\ngo into the band on top so I'm gonna have to slice it up pour more gummy in\nseal it back up and hope it works well it looks like it worked but I've gotta\ncut the mold off to find out and if it didn't work then to buy a new shoe and\ntry again oh no it didn't quite get down to the\nother part I think since this parts formed already we can just leave this\nflap open pour gummy in there close it back up and let it harden I think\nthis is harder than any challenge I've had at vat19 I wouldn't have imagined\nthat the other molds that I made dried in like 20 minutes tops this is still\ngooey and it's been 2 days I don't know what's happening this hair mold will be\nthe death of me I don't know what the heck's going on but it won't dry I don't\nknow what went wrong but the silicone never dried for the hair mold fully so\nit really like adhered to the clay on the inside but we're gonna try it anyway the very minimal chance this might work\nkind of everything that could go wrong did go wrong I think it's time for Plan\nB I'm pretty sure this will work so I'll just cut some shapes out of this\nand glue it to a swim cap and I'm just gonna keep layering it until till it\nkind of looks like hair hopefully everything sticky and slippery so now\nthat the gummy shirt is dry I'm going to fold it into the shape that it needs to\nbe and then stitch up the side stitch up the sleeves and hopefully we've got this\nnice-looking shirt I was not sure this was going to come together I'm pretty\nstoked so they've told me that all of the gummy\nclothes are ready I can't wait whoa oh my gosh it looks so good it\nsmells pretty good to this head Apple watch\nedible ear pods hmm best testing hair I've ever had\nlet's do this let's get dressed starting to loosen it I think Joey made\nthe gummy shorts a little too small not as stretchy as I thought it was\ngonna be I'm not a tailor I think we're gonna have to loosen it quite a bit\nI'm sorry I'm not a good model I told him I was a size 2 I might be an 8 if we\nget a really big belt good work they are comfy though it feels so cool\nyeah don't touch my pants oh sure it's gonna fit all right sure it's gonna fit\nI believe you oh oh it's cold it's so cold oh man this shirt is a skosh big\nKaylee but I am wearing candy right now this is real joy on my face right now\nI got the watch going here guys I'm like a gummy guy right now there's gonna be\nan operation I don't know how this is gonna go what have you never done this\nbefore I'm still gonna look like a cartoon character how's it look it looks I need my clothes in my mind I was just\nfocused on getting it to work so now that I'm seeing it it's really weird I\nthink this is the last video for the channel guys this is that we've done it on him you guys did so good this is\namazing I love it I can't believe it worked\nha take this off sorry Joey", "uBlyb3dh02U": "good afternoon we're going to make some THC infused gummies first step is to make sure you have everything that you need out so our items are a three ounce package of unflavored jello or flavored gelatin not sugar-free I'm using two packets of unflavored as per the recipe that I posted and 2/3 cup cold water I've also got my lecithin to the side to put a little bit in because that is a nice fat protein that the THC bonds to there's a little machine that keeps it to a perfect time without having to go back and forth to the stove also has a link posted since we're doing super Lemon Haze on blue so let's again box tile I like to make sure it's very loosely powdery because it'll stick together I said it is a plant fat protein mini whisk mix all of these powders together enter water so we want to make sure that all of the gelatin is wet and separated and there are no clumps of gelatin that are still powdered the gelatin is mixed and 15 minutes has elapsed the gelatin has soaked up the water so enter the trusty little heater you turn that on I'm going to go ahead and break up the gelatin a little bit here and I'm going to wait probably about 10 minutes to come back and stir it again back quick search it's starting to look clearer for the record I'm doing blue for super-lon haze because true clear has a blue label just like I did read for indica and I did yellow for hybrid alright we're gonna let it sit another five minutes so it's been a little bit I'm gonna go with that is as clear as it needs to work because there's lecithin and it doesn't get that crystal clear like if you're doing candy but it is quite smooth quite runny I'm going to inject the super Lemon Haze truth here into it that has been so deep and warming in a cup of warm worth yeah it's tough [Music] and what i'm doing here is optional ma'am I usually pull that off but I'm going to pull some of the jello up in give it a shake and squirt that back in we all want to make the most of all of our product so I'm going to stir that in and once again I'm going to let it sit for five minutes to infuse before we put it into the molds all right we're gonna give it one more stir then because this is gelatin and not egg I'm not gonna whisk it super fast assuming it's going to stay in there [Music] smells like THC so the gummy bear molds that I put the link to hold about a milliliter you don't need to measure but they came with little droppers I'm going to hand this off to my partner because he has a much better non-payment you if you drip anything cuz it's silicone it's gonna that's basically gonna be one dose all of the little dots that end up on top of the silicone yeah kind of scrap all those at the end put them together it's almost like having an extra Bayer we use the opposite color or a different color than the jello you he's gonna go ahead and fill the rest of those up and we'll be back in a moment on to another bold [Music] we're gonna go ahead and stipple some cornstarch onto the back I put these in the freezer they've set and I've let them come back to temperature to make sure there's not a lot of moisture so this is my makeup brush there's a link to this this is the stipple the flat top that's what we're gonna stipple with so I've got cornstarch I just used the cornstarch lid they've got a little folded up foil and a paper towel in case I feel like it's getting too thick so I just went to stipple along the back of these and if you feel there's a bit much you can always go back and kind of wipe something away the nice thing about the brushes you can twist it and if you feel there's too much corn starch somewhere then you can use the edges of it so I like to know that my backs are good prior to pop them out I'm gonna pop this one out like so now gonna turn it over and show you the quick way I just stick my nail into it and pop them out and then lay them out afterwards welcome back to the final step we're going to say it's been 24 hours these will stay out overnight these have been out for 24 hours they're slightly smaller because they've now reduced down a little bit in size once they have dehydrated a bit as such I stipple them on the top with the cornstarch and I'm able to have them not to be sticky any further questions please feel free to send me a private message or post on the video however you'd like thanks", "WPakqUMCCIA": "So today I'm making gummy candy. I'm starting with a half cup of cold water,\nand to that I'm going to add three packets of plain gelatin. I'm just going to open these up, you can find\nthese in the store, they're available in the little box. I'm using Knocks but any kind will do, and\nI just want to add this gradually so it won't clump up. So just with a nice spatula or spoon make\nsure that your constantly stirring. Stir, stir, stir. You can see it's turning into a gelatin kind\nof a mess here. Which is perfect, just what we're looking\nfor. So I'm just going to stir that around and\nlast but not least I'm going to add one whole packet of Jello, because I'm really just going\nfor it. And I'm using the blue one, but any flavor\nyou like will do. Just pour it in there and again stir it around\nso nothing will clump up. So that is it, I'm going to take my candy\nand I'm going to move it to I have a pot of water simmering on this stove. And then I'm just going to heat it up inside\nthis pot of water. So I'm using a glass measurement cup and I'm\njust letting the heat from the water, kind of heat up my mixture. So this way none of my gelatin is going to\nend up burning, it's all very safe, very kind of a gentle process. You could also just pop it right into the\nmicrowave if you prefer and that's fine too. I'm just going to let that kind of simmer,\nand get nice and thick. So my mixture has melted so I'm ready to go,\nand here I have a nice cute little I have like a jewel mold. You can get any kind of plastic mold that\nyou like or any other kind of candy mold that. The little bears are really fun and adorable. But just while my gelatin is still nice and\nsmooth and liquid, I'm just going to go ahead and pour it right into my mold. You can even go ahead and fill it the way\nup to the top or as big as you like them. That is it. I'm going to let those sit up on the counter\nfor about 10 to 15 minutes or until they're nice and firm to the touch, to keeping them\nto the heat of your house you might need a little longer or a little less. But as soon as they're firm I'm going to take\nthem out of the mold and we're ready to go. So my blue gummy candy are still setting up\nbut I have some that are already done, so these are just the same just with a lemon\nflavor and a cherry flavor. The same recipe and you could see them getting\nnice and firm and chewy. Now if you want to get that kind of classic\nsour candy coating, you take a little bit of sugar mixed with a touch of citric acid. And what that's going to do is give our candies\na nice sour coating. And that's it or you can leave them plain\nor you can just drench them in sugar. Anything that you like, but anyway, enjoy. That's how you make gummy candies at home.", "qWufg1yPPC0": "good afternoon welcome to my little Network here for us cannabis lemon squares gummies this is coming from Ron's kitchen as you rolls across the screen you can see the greens are pretty straightforward and simple and the instructions come right behind it and you can see they are really pretty straightforward and simple this is an easy easy recipe for containers of gelatin they're a quarter ounce each six ounce box of jell-o sitting next to is a little bit of some Tincher they're made that about six seven eight weeks ago with high grain alcohol and about 14 grams of some good smoke spray these little things down so they don't stick this oh rig there's regular was spray there you get Costco just want to make sure they don't stick gonna start with the jello here six ounces this time are you making lemon ones today last time I made I think was black cherry I think but today just a simple box here we're gonna be using the four containers of gelatin each one of them's a quarter ounce we need a total of one ounce so that's gonna be four of them and the tin sure you can see they're as dark and pretty as that is it could be using a third of a cup normally calls for a quarter of a cup but I like I'm just a little bit on that more potent side so we'll gonna be using them with a third of a cup in the future so kind of throw some gelatin in here and so this is just gonna get whisked together real quick after I get it all together we're gonna get on to a double boiler here in just a brief moment over the stove I used two boiler so they sugar and everything doesn't melt and stick to the bottom of a pan that makes it really nice and pretty and stuff like that no see this thing change from just a little yellow jello to a nice thick almost a thickening type of one I'm gonna use 1/2 a cup of just regular cold tap water does make any difference at this point I can pour anything else in there at this point oh there it is jell-o gelatin ready to go for the double boiler I think I see we've got on the double boiler here for us so that whisk it around you can see it's hot this is jello it has sugar in it stuff that you're looking at it's very hot to touch it will burn and as I whisk it down a little bit further here you'll start seeing the house starts to thicken up this just means that the gelatin the jello are thickening together like right there for us so this actually was about a five-minute process it just happened you know momentarily here for us so at this point I was getting ready to take it off the stove and just let it kind of like warm up a little bit more because I want to make sure it's hot enough here for us well then put that into a glass container a Pyrex glass and then whisk in the some of the Tincher that I made like I said it's 190 proof it's ever clear that I use in my state you can get it legally and the rest of it of course the cannabis I live in Oregon so what can you say so we're gonna throw it into this little container that I'll use a spatula for a moment just to stir it up a little bit and jump into a whisk to make sure the rest of it gets connected together and that little blue tray is where we're heading for that's a hundred and twenty six little scummy squares I don't like to make gummy bears anymore the squares are so much easier to handle and they are easier to store I think I don't know so gonna do is gonna add a little bit of Tincher here like I said made this about six seven weeks ago that's a hundred and ninety proof Everclear with with just some regular 14 grams of dakar good grade cannabis I think it was 21 22 percent THC so that stuff is pretty potent but that's always an option also for us now at this point once it's stirred up you really want to taste it to see how it tastes to you if it tastes a little bit sharp or the tin sure you can taste it suggest throwing in a little bit of some honey maybe two teaspoons maybe three teaspoons not tablespoons but teaspoons here four so we're a stir it first just to get it started got it into a whisk you can see the color here for it then we're gonna be going into the bottle here just built brief moment at this point you test to see what how you want if you want it sweeter this point you'd be putting it into some jello I mean into some honey if you want that I pour it into my container makes delivery of it easier I probably could just pour it straight from the glass pitcher but probably a big mess of it instead so this way it goes a little bit easier for me and no I'm not eating any Cheerios as you can see I'm gonna countertop that is from my cats because they like to eat that kind of food here for us but once again you can see this is a really simple simple recipe if you didn't have a tin sure all you'd be making at this point is just yellow squares but attend sure is the stuff that is super important to this whole product or whole the whole thing here for us and each one of these little squares comes out about somebody can mathematically figure this out each one of these squares is approximately three milligrams of THC way my mouth works out by figuring out the THC and the connection with a tin sure and how much of it that goes into a square at this point I'm just filling the squares like there's 126 open to fill so however you want to go after filling them out got this blue little thing from Amazon online really nice little thing here for us I'm almost full with filling the squares up at this point it's starting to set and I'm gonna put this out in my garage here in just a brief moment my garage is 38 degrees today and so it does not need to go in the refrigerator it'll set up with and a half an hour just because the cold nature and the refrigerator and I don't have to worry about it getting under way and I don't have to worry about it getting thicker here in inside where it's a lot warmer of course so it'll set up within probably 30 minute time frame okay my stuff is sticky this is our final product isn't that purity yep so I put it on the tray that's a non silica that's annoying that's a silicon nonstick mat below no use for cookies and then I have a sheet pan below that so when I pick it up it could just pick it up and move it all at once for about half an hour went out got my little squares and you can see how they set up they're just the right size to eat depending on what you want to do one maybe two squares is plenty my next one is going to be gonna be a dinner black cherry wine is my next goal you can see that the tin sure changed the color soon if again though your force I put a little bit of cornstarch with them just to help dry them off a little bit you know and they don't stick yes you can see I just had some of my fingers is all I had it's almost it's not a lot and once again it's almost ready here for us it's gonna be sitting out on the cabinet here for us they changed off just a little bit with that a little bit of the cornstarch on them just like I said they don't stick you don't have to use that by no means but this is the final product better dry it out for about an hour so I'm sitting on my counter and we are done enjoy", "o9TfvoA2XAI": "    Ok it's not that easy But I'll show you how it's done! To start\nyou're going to need gelatin, sugar And of course Rose a wine! I found the gummy bear mold  online for less than ten dollars And they include a dropper to\nmake it easier to fill Measure out 1 cup of Rose on low to medium\nheat.  Cook the rose' in a small saucepan and do not let it boil Next add a half cup of sugar and whisk\nit until it dissolves slowly add in the gelatin one packet at a time into the\nmixture. Four to five package should do the trick   After whisking the mixture - pour it into\nthe molds. I used the dropper for better accuracy but a spoon works too This recipe will make at least eighty to\na hundred gummy bears depending on the size of mold you use. Let it set for at\nleast two hours and when you've done pop out the gummys. They looks so cute at first you\nalmost don't want to eat them but remember keep them away from children as\nthey may retain some of the alcohol but for the adults, rose a gummy bears make\ngreat gifts for bachelorette parties or even wedding favors! So that recipe was a\nlittle too complicated for you don't go drinking that road they just yet put it down because we have an easier\nrecipe. Take some store-bought gummies and place them in a bowl. I used\ngrapefruit flavors but any kind will do. Pour the rose' over the gummies\ncover and set in the fridge for 10 hours the gummies will expand. To serve\nplace them into a jar with a lid now They're ready to eat! Again make sure to\nkeep these away from children.

help you find wonderful folks make sense of your dispensary today is a classic ass episode which means edible review but this is not a company that is new to us but it is new to us in the world of edibles uh that is because it's from moxie the folks over at moxie uh we've actually reviewed a few products from them um i know we've done a couple of carts and live resin where they have a different branding mx by moxie there but now they are in the edibles game with the classic cannabis infused gummy uh it seems like if you are a weed company and you want to branch out from whatever your starting project product is you go gummies and that's what looks like it's happening with moxie uh this packaging is pretty uh nice it's uh kind of like a aluminum can little puck here uh pretty substantial actually uh this little tin is not cheap i'm sure uh but you got all the stuff you want to see on it uh we've got our lab testing results here on the side uh and then we've got uh our dosage instructions which these are uh 10 milligram gummies they're 10 10 milligram gummies in here for 100 milligrams in total uh and these gummies cost me 17 bucks at my dispensary which puts them at the ever so slightly above average price point for a 100 milligram gummy in my neck of the woods uh it does say on here that uh moxie has won 90 plus industry awards neat uh i always find those things to be more annoying than edifying or clarifying uh if you're not gonna tell us what awards you've won uh why should i believe you anyways uh we need some more uh you know packaging regulations here but uh that's neither here nor there let's get to the moxie good stuff i did not actually mention what flavor this is it is the member berry flavor or strain i guess i didn't realize there was a member berry strain before this it does show member berries on there uh i don't know what k i assume member barry got its name from the south park episode which minor rant here boy south park uh on the air for 24 seasons now i remember back when people were making jokes about the simpsons getting along in the tooth back around it's like 15th 16th 17th season uh and now we here we are with south park uh at its 24th season i think there was even a time where south park mocked the simpsons for being uh so long in the tooth that is not to knock south park it's just crazy how long actually and resilient that show has been around anyways member berries uh i don't actually have never seen the episode i don't really watch south park anymore still appreciate what those fine folks do but um i do remember hearing on the internet for about 24 hours people saying remember when a member something like that remember barry who knows uh i assume it tastes just like berries uh let's go ahead and get into this edible here this is 17 thing of gummies uh with my experiences with moxie have been good uh nothing to write a home about like um totally fine makers of cartridges uh and i've had some of their wax before too in non-cartridge form and found it to be totally unobjectionable uh nothing stand out but nothing uh to be suspicious of either all right well here is our here are our gummies rather got a little moxie logo on them uh 10 gummies in there i i guess the idea that every gummy has to be five milligrams everything has to be five milligrams is becoming irrelevant that was a law but i see everything lots of things now uh packaged as 10 milligrams so uh getting lax cool shut up siri she keeps thinking i'm talking to her uh anyways here is our moxie member berry let's give this a shot hmm wow very pleasant very pleasant starting taste um kind of a chewier gummy i don't really need to tell you what a gummy gummy's gonna taste like it's pretty fruity to start uh but there is actually a very strong cannabis aftertaste i mean it's not grotesque most gummies don't get uh offensively bad you've got enough sugar in there to mask the taste but there is a pretty strong weed aftertaste here so if you are very sensitive to it watch out fine for the first two or three seconds and then there it is actually about five alarm weed taste there you got a couple of seconds uh before it really hits you wow that is powerful that is one of the uh more weedy tasting gummies that i've had uh in some time i wonder how they infused uh if they did something different it looks like uh same process as far as i can tell just a very strong weed taste uh that does make me a little optimistic that these are gonna be pretty potent uh there's not necessarily a total correlation between oh well somebody just subscribed apparently that's what that noise was um there's not always a correlation between taste and potency but there sometimes is so fingers crossed that these member berries are going to be as potent as we hope uh for me guys i am gonna eat all 10 of these it's probably going to take me oh i'm going to do over the next half hour 45 minutes or so and then 90 minutes two hours after i have that last one i'll come right back here and let you guys know the most important part about the edible review is it gonna get you high and i've got really really high hopes no pun intended for these with that aftertaste until then guys thanks for sticking around we'll see you right back here in just a bit oh there it is bye welcome back to wheats guys it has been about uh just over two hours since i had my first member berry uh cannabis infused gummy from moxie and that is a really sticky inside of a container there a lot of residue anytime i'm talking about residue it means i'm pretty high uh so these are pretty good gummies these are um i would say um on the good end of average the high end of average they're uh good not outstanding not the absolute best i've ever had uh not the best test tasting gummies by a long shot but they are certainly going to get the job done uh for anybody who is familiar with 100 milligram edibles um 100 milligram gummies uh if they work for you these are going to do the job they are just a total uh thumbs up in terms of quality uh really the only thing to talk about here uh is gonna be the taste and price uh the taste didn't offend me that much uh i quite used to a pretty bitter cannabis aftertaste and uh there was that potency you want with the with that uh taste but it is a stronger cannabis aftertaste if you're looking for gummies with no weed taste these aren't for you uh and that these were the only other thing to mention is that these weren't the cheapest gummies these aren't the cheapest gummies available at my dispensary um so i would not necessarily buy these myself because i know that i can get just as good of a gummy for a cheaper price at my dispensary say a um punch edibles or a buddha's best they have a couple of different gummies at a i at my place for sometimes uh like five bucks cheaper than these so that is a thing to consider uh it really is just going to depend on the price at your dispensary because there is nothing again in this package that's going to say uh it's worth a premium over any other gummy um but you know totally perfunctory and good i'd say these moxie may not have moxie but they have gumption gumption what a weird word speaking of gumption no speaking of moxie let's do a little cherry on top we're gonna do something with some real moxie uh and cherry on tops by the way anytime we have a review that we like we like to give a little something extra that's not weed related uh and let's do something with as i said somebody with some moxie now normally i have a policy i don't like to uh give any cherry on tops for anything that i've actually finished uh because you know i like to it's a wheat thing we we do the entire experience but i've been enjoying this book so much i'm confident that even though i've only got about a uh i don't know a couple dozen pages or so left to go i'm confident that i'm still uh if enjoyed enough to give it my recommendation and that book is a nonfiction book by the author maria konokova uh former writer for the new yorker called the biggest bluff uh she is a fantastic writer and a psychology phd from harvard uh who uh decided to take a break from writing and instead uh spend a year training to become a poker champ after having never played poker uh she just decides that she wants to see what it's all about but really it's a book about how to make good decisions how to avoid making bad decisions why poker is a good analog for decision making it's a pretty fascinating stuff she's an excellent writer it's a really cool concept again the book is the biggest bluff by maria konakova uh that is an excellent book from an author who has a lot of moxie and somebody who has a little bit of moxie is moxie and their member um edible i almost forgot that's what we were talking about but that is what we were here for pretty good from them really good from maria and that guys is gonna do it for everything here on wheats until we see you for our next review or whatever it is stay high more importantly stay healthy we'll see you then goodbye", "6sJY277KsQI": "how's it going everybody wanted to talk about my first trial of delta eight so got excited we order it i've already ordered soft gels i'm about to call and get some gummies ordered as well remember that i had a sample a company that i sell my flour through has the gummy so they had sent me a sample with my last order and i kind of put them off to the side didn't really want to try them if i couldn't sell them uh surely didn't want to get excited about a product that i wasn't able to offer anyone so now that i can i tried one at 12 15 12 30 somewhere around there 45 minutes 30 minutes before lunch time for me uh i know what was gonna happen didn't know what to expect of course i've looked up what it does how you can kind of some people get a better appetite or kind of gives you that relaxed feeling that positive vibes that kind of thing i said you know why not let's try it let's give it a shot so 30 minutes in you you really could start feeling it uh there are 25 milligram gummies uh that kind of gives you an idea the soft gels i ordered just now are 15 milligrams okay so keep that in mind but uh i did i felt i felt happy i felt like a motivated i don't know how to explain it it was it was uh it was it was so i i want to say unexpected i mean it definitely wasn't euphoric i mean i mean come on now let's be honest let's not reach into the vocabulary bag and start trying to pull words out like that i mean uh let's let's bring it back down to earth here but it was you could definitely feel it but it was still clear-headed you still could focus you could concentrate you can do all of that but you really do get that ah feeling that i mean i don't know i just i just don't know how to explain it to you it's it's it was surprising i didn't of course people tell you oh you're gonna feel this or you can read you know read an article there's a thousand of them oh you're gonna feel this or oh you experienced this or but until you try it it's different it's not it's creepy it's not like like creeping on you what i mean i'm so creepy wow um it's slow it kind of builds up builds up and you're just like oh okay this is this is good i can get used to this it's pretty cool so i don't know i'm really surprised by it i think i think y'all will really enjoy these i'm excited um soft shells should be here within three weeks i know that's a long time but they've got to create the labels for me they've got to do all that fun stuff so i'm thinking three weeks is a good guess hoping they're here within two but i don't want to get uh too optimistic uh gummies i haven't ordered yet hopefully to have those within two weeks second i get everything in i will pop on and let you know but i just wanted to kind of share my experience with the first time trying it it's the first time i've ever tried delta h so i will definitely be trying it again y'all have a great day", "DC2B0TdQBjs": "for marmalade making to be ultimately satisfying you need to start by harvesting your own fruit and for most Australians that's not a problem as they grow so easily here servals are the best choice being naturally quite bitter so to count the sweetness of these Valencia oranges we're adding a grapefruit and a lemon to the recipe add some sugar and water and a couple of hours and you've got a fabulous preserve to brighten any breakfast now let's get going we need around 900 grams of the fruit so around 700 grams of oranges will do as half the grapefruit will make up the full 900 and the lemon just gets added on next comes the juicing of all the fruits this could be done by hand but power juicers are great especially if you have aching wrist joints don't worry if you miss a bit nothing gets wasted in this recipe fill a large pan with 2.25 litres of water and then add the juice to the pan as well we're now going to salvage as much of the pith as possible starting with whatever was left over in the juicer the rest has to be scraped from the fruit shells it's the most laborious part of marmalade making but it is essential as the pectin that makes it set to a jelly is in this part of the fruit when it's all been collected in a muslin bag tied up at the neck and suspended in the pan next we slice the peel such a distinctive part of marmalade if you like it thick or thin well now is the time to decide collected in a bowl and add to the pan setting it to simmer on a low heat for rent 2 hours depending on the type of rind and thickness of your slices you'll know by squeezing the rind if it's soft it's ready if not give it another 15 to 20 minutes now remove the bag and let it cool on this for a while then add one point eight kilos of granulated sugar to the pan and stir it in until all the crystals are dissolved squeezing the juices out of the bag requires some effort and a couple of plates make a great juice press making sure you get all that gelatinous goo as well stir it all into the pan and set on high heat to a rolling boil for 15 minutes stirring occasionally to avoid burning now put a plate in the fridge to cool and when the mixture has had its full 15 minutes of boiling you can scoop a spoonful onto the cold plate and place it back in the fridge for a minute or so to cool all the way through to test the viscosity of your marmalade just push it and see if it wrinkles up nicely if it doesn't then keep the pan boiling for another five or ten minutes until you have a nicely jellified end result so your marmalade is now ready but needs to cool down before decanting in the meantime you can put your clean jars into the oven at around 170 degrees C they'll take around 5 minutes to warm up cut some greaseproof paper into circles to fit inside your jar necks or you can buy them ready-made but homemade is always better ladle the still-warm marmalade into the jars and lay the paper caps over there there to keep the surface moist soft and finally the jar tops to seal it as the marmalade cools so a vacuum is formed to keep it tight now your breakfasts will be all the more delightful knowing that you've grown the fruits to make your own delicious marmalade you", "sYU9BooNY0c": "today Kevin and I are we trying some new new to us at least hi chips these may have been out for a while but who think a lake simply says they they ordered some of these from Amazon and who knew I had no idea that hot you made all these we have some plain weak sorry not playing we have some yogurts and then Kevin home screen size so the yogurts are plain yogurt blueberry yogurt and strawberry yogurt and the sweet sour has lemon and grapefruit so I start with the plain yogurt these are you get them in a 5 for Amazon so they're like in a bag like whatever like yeah they're a mixed bag but it's like one of those that you by Walmart that hangs up on the shelf Oh scissors I don't even think about that you don't think that's too hard to go further than others I like that it's very sweet I don't think it tastes like you over though and I know I'm trying to think of what out there it's not like no this week's pretty clever I think I'm playing a pretty thick then I can't pinpoint it down to what to do what bright it is so it's not cherry it's not strawberry it's not it's not vanilla um which Vanilla's I'm afraid but it normally when you see this color packaging it means it's kind of vanilla it's not citrus no no citrus then but yeah like a strawberry Kiwi come on there's something yeah it could be a strawberry something know it it's very very sweet and delicious though I really liked super-sweet if you're afraid of yogurt yeah yeah if you're afraid of that sour yogurt there's no sour there this is the blueberry that cut really easily with scissors oh nothing should be cutting them at home and that tastes like very high chew calm hello the texture of these thank you they're very addictive they're calm tacky like whether they have a chewiness like uh honey can't even describe it it's like a doughnut starburst kind of but they're even chew you're more like rubble refilling them and then that even but they don't get certain you're taping and they're not hard to chew I mean they're tough but once they warm up in your mouth they they get really solved that blueberry only reminded me of a cereal boys area we've had we've tried every us yeah we tried Sierra's with a blueberry flavor that's what that reminded me it was actually really good so then the last yogurt one is the the strawberry yogurt thank God you said about 20 to 22 calories that's so bad get a couple of oats for a little snack I like it quite a bit nothing would dress strawberry no sweets make it takes their dog strawberry no no no we have to have a mixture of that the blueberry blueberry before we run inflection it's okay it's a no and the strawberry reminds me of a Starbucks strawberry it's not as I don't think it's as if the strawberries is strong but I just love the the flavor in general all of them hurt ones for me right head I would totally buy a bag because you can get on Amazon and you can buy a bag of just the yogurt once I buy whole bag up there girl the strawberry one which is like it's okay and it wasn't bad by any means if I was eating him I would enjoy it but just so you know Ruth and Kelly they sent us two of each one of these she told me that they out there were only two blueberries in the entire bag so just know that that it's gonna bury what you get and who knows you might not get any at all of something you know that's been our luck before so this is the sweet and sour and this is the lemon no one seems even more rubbery yeah yeah that's good though I like they my brother it got a little sour stuff but it tastes just like lemon it's very different from the ones with just rubbing oh yeah because it is it does have a salvage it and it's more of a pure flavor like a mule women like flour no but I'm gonna say I live in this hour so yeah you like a real mmm then that's good it's it's um it's like candy Linda it's not overly sweet it's mainly sour I think and that will last when I'm scared about this is the grapefruit tastes like break free yeah that's a separate package I probably wouldn't bother sweets are ones it is a separate just because I want that sour flavor huh no they're not I mean they are what they are they made their delt really nice like grapefruit but you need you really like grip yo cool yeah it's very very strong some people eat that all the time and they love it it's just not something that I'm used to eating all the time it's not like it's bad or anything it's just incredibly sour I remember back in when I was a kid and like the 80s late seventies probably there was a big kick everybody he was eating grapefruit I mean they had the little tools to be kept a little thing I remember dad going through the phase and everybody was doing it mom and dad would back right yeah yeah now that's like people still do it but it's not it's not like that big craze that grapefruit diet but headed to eat your grapefruit he would cut in half uh-huh and then he sprinkle sweetener on top of it uh-huh and then they would cut around the little like pockets and scoop it out with us yeah I put the sugar pile of sugar the sugar bowl is there and then there was tama dab it on there I have put that much sugar I finally can you guys should be it's works for you to act so it's better for me to actually not eat it it's hell figure that way trust me so anyway yeah oh I can they're all they are good for what they are yes sweet sweets are for me personally as nothing but they did a good job that or what we would both buy the bag of the overcoat and eat every flavor because every flavor was delicious it was seriously good I would buy the next bag just Regirock seize any day because oh and they have a well Amazon no because I was looking for the calories for each of these on the package so I went to well and I want to have something for the end of this video for you all to look at so that you can see the nutritional information and the ingredients and so I was I was looking up that information so they do have individual bags they have all kinds of things I just didn't happen so thank you so much to Ruth and Kelly for sharing these with us you know you ordered on for yourself and you didn't have to share them but I really appreciate it that you did so I hope everyone else enjoyed it and thanks for watching [Music]", "IIqB1wlfboE": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today i'm going to be showing you guys how to infuse any type of candy that you buy from the store well at least any candy that has a sugar coating on it for example um we're going to be using sour patch kids and sour patch kids watermelons but any other type of candies that have that sugar type coating will work i've also done this with just like generic gummies that you get from the bulk section or anything yeah anything like that will work and this is what they will look like so essentially they will look exactly like they did in the bag and this is what a lot of the time people are selling so like they put them i don't know what they have like there's a different name for it but the logo and everything looks very similar to this and you're you're buying these and they look exactly the same as a store block gummy and the reason why is because it is a store-bought gummy and it's just been um sprayed or um in this case dropped on um tincture um this method is not going to get you exact dosing so please don't do this with intentions to be um like having a perfect dose because it's not really possible to do that but you can get it pretty close but for most people who are just using these for themselves like i am it doesn't really matter in the end so yeah let me show you guys how to make these and i just want to say a huge thank you i just hit 10 000 subscribers this weekend that was absolutely amazing it is my birthday in a couple of days and i feel like that was kind of like an early birthday present to me if you haven't subscribed already please do now i would appreciate it so much here's what you're gonna need some store-bought candy um the sour kind with the sugar on the outside some tincture and a syringe okay so we're just gonna start by getting our surface ready i'm just using a baking sheet with some wax paper you could use parchment paper a plate whatever it doesn't matter and then i'm taking my candy that i have here um i chose sour patch kids the kids and then the watermelons but you can use any candy that has a sugar coating on it it doesn't need to be a sour sugar or not sour it doesn't matter as long as it has that um sugary coating so i've done this before and just gone to like bulk barn and just chose whatever candies i like um you need to have that sour sugar on the outside because that is what is absorbing the tincture so yeah once i have the candies i want to infuse i just lay them out on my baking sheet and then here is my tincture so now i'm going to get my little syringe thingy and pull up some tincture so i'm not measuring how much i'm really using because it's just for me to use by myself but if you want to know how strong they're going to be you could like keep track of how many syringes you use per x amount of candies but anyway so you're going to take your little syringe and you're going to press it on to the candy and not too hard but hard enough that it's not going to go flying everywhere um here we get a little bit closer so you can kind of see what i'm doing so yeah so i have i fill up my syringe and then i set it on top and push down with a steady hand that's why i'm using two hands so i can be really steady with it and then i just push enough that um fills the cat the sugar coating with the tincture but not enough that it goes onto the tray if you add too much it will leak off of the candy and go onto the tray and then you're wasting stuff um so just use less at first to see how much it can kind of hold and just a reminder here this when you're doing this is not the candy itself like the gummy candy the chewy part is not absorbing the tincture it's only the outside that absorbing it so then now i'm just doing the exact same thing but with my sour patch kids now this is what they look like after i did the first round so that means i've only added tincture to one side of the candy and there's those watermelons you can see they've already started to dry um and you're just gonna leave these out with um air circulating so i just have a fan facing them um to help dry them off um but i have kept on having to move the tray because it kept on sitting in the sun so you don't want to be in the sun or it's going to melt as i put them into the sun here but you know that's for the visual effects so has that good lighting but yeah so in the fan leave these to dry until they're dry ish and then you're going to repeat the process of adding more tincture okay now that they've dried which i think that took like 20 minutes not even i'm just flipping them all over and then i'm going to repeat the process so with these watermelons i could flip them over repeat the process and then turn them on their like other side i feel like they kind of have a couple sides they could sit on whereas with the sour patches i can only kind of turn them over one way or another but you can keep repeating this process over and over again so i only put tincture on or i only put one layer or one serving i don't know what you want to call it i only did each side once i guess is what i should say just because i wanted to be able to eat a lot of these in one serving so if i kept on layering the tincture on it would limit how many i could eat at once um but yeah so you're just gonna let them dry after this and then you could flip them over once again and keep on adding and you can keep on doing this over and over again until it no longer absorbs any tincture and i think you could probably do about four or five rounds on each side so keep in mind when they are drying it's evaporating all the alcohol from your tincture which is why you're able to add so much to it but um i think you could also add some more sugar coating to this to allow for more tincture on the outside but i didn't want to mess around with it too much i just wanted to kind of show you guys the simple way to do this um and you know it's kind of guaranteed that this is gonna work um you could also do this with your already infused gummies so if you actually make some gummies with your tincture and then put a sour coating on them you could do this again and that would make them like extremely extremely sour non-sour extremely extremely strong because in this case these ones are only having tincture on the outside whereas if you had a gummy that was already having tincture on the inside you could also add on the outside and that would just be super strong and lovely now i'm just gonna zoom in here so that you guys can see a little bit better about how i am actually adding the tincture without it splashing so i'm taking this little syringe and i'm pushing it lightly on top while still having control of the syringe and once you do a couple of these you get really used to it and you kind of know exactly how much you can use [Music] so they were all done but i guess i decided i was gonna add a little bit more which i shouldn't have done because i got kind of sloppy about it and you guys are gonna see what happens when you get sloppy about it or when you put too much tincture on your gummy and it's not able to absorb it so let's just take a little look closer up so you can see that tincture on the bottom of my waxed paper those little greenish brownish splatters there so that is tincture that is wasted i mean obviously you can lick the parchment but if you don't be so quick and lazy when you apply it it shouldn't happen so if you see my sour patch kids here there is pretty much no tincture that leads off just a couple of little specks and that's what happens when you're patient instead of when i went overboard with the watermelons without letting them dry in between okay now let's just take a look at some of the finished ones versus the original one so here is a finished watermelon um and then yeah that looks good and let's grab a un tincturized un infused i guess uninfused watermelon and that's how it looks so you can see that sugar chunked up and then it gives it that it also have that little bit of the brown and greenish after the um alcohol evaporates so it kind of looks like grubby i guess i don't know i just feel like it kind of looks like dirty but um it's only if you look kind of close up and then let's compare it with some sour patch kids on the left there that's a uninfused sour patch kid and on the right that is a infused sour patch kit so it looks a little bit like wetter kind of it's not wet though um but yeah the sugar kind of clumps i don't know i don't even really know how to explain it but i guess you guys can kind of see on screen there yeah then there's our little watermelons um and our sour patch kids um i guess now that i'm closer with my camera here i can show you a little bit better kind of the tincture that is still on the pan um it's not too bad but i was doing this with one hand part of the way because of the camera and stuff so i was a little bit sloppier but if you guys are careful there shouldn't really be any waste now they are all dry and i'm just packaging them up um they dried like i said for like i don't know 20 minutes half an hour if you want to be super sure they're really dry i would just leave them out overnight and if you want to you can always add more tincture there is nothing stopping you from adding more a day later two days later a week later whatever it's all gonna work now you have a bunch of delicious infused candy that was super simple to make and i hope you guys enjoy this little trick as much as i do okay so now these are finished let's taste them and see how they are i'm going to start with the sour patch kids here so immediately when i open it has a very strong smell and these are going to taste stronger than gummies usually would because the tincture is all on the outside of the gummy so when it touches your tongue the first thing you taste is the tincture whereas if you're making your gummies homemade the tincture is mixed in with the gelatin with the sugar and everything else and it's less of a like direct flavor as soon as you eat it um but once you start chewing it kind of all blends in so it literally just tastes like a sour patch kid with tincture i didn't make mine super super strong so like i would eat this whole bag probably but you can make them so that they're really strong yeah oops very good very strong tasting but that'll be depending on how your tincture tastes so it's just going to taste like sour patch with a touch of tincture okay now the watermelons they're just so cute i love these bags so much i reuse them to be honest they're super super cheap but i'm cheaper um so whenever i use them and they're just like for gummies like this i'll just like reuse it after but i wouldn't reuse it if i was giving it to someone anyways [Applause] um these ones are better not just because i like the watermelons better and surprisingly they like you think they'd be all sticky and stuff but they're not i literally put these in the bag like right after i made them instead let them dry because i'm lazy um yeah they're not sticky at all they're very good strong you can definitely tell that they have tincture on them but yeah thank you guys so much for watching this video i hope you enjoyed it if you did please leave a comment subscribe and give us a thumbs up thank you guys so much for watching and have a wonderful day", "n8-VIBJAf6o": "[Music] aloha mai kakou my name is Ralph and welcome to my kitchen where I like to share on my favorite Island and Hawaiian

home and craving all their favorite foods this has come up more than ever it's a simple recipe that you can make at home it includes the Huey the Huey is a Chinese dried salted plum you can use the Huey in the seed form or in the powder form this recipe uses the powder form this also uses lemon peel which is another Chinese dried snack and gummy bears of course now you can use any gummy snacks that taste great gushers strawberry belt peach rings anything really you can use the sauce on fruits as well it's really yummy the kids love it toss it in the freezer if you'd like make it a cool

a new video and I post new videos every week also don't forget all the recipe instructions and ingredients are always listed in the description box below so how they might come along and let's make so many lemon peel gummy babies all right first we're going to get the lemon juice I like to use fresh lemon but if you want to use the artificial ones from the store you can roll the lemon with the palm of your hand and cut in half this will help get the lemon juice out easier then you're gonna squeeze the lemon to get the juice now I have a kabillion of different kitchen gadgets but for some reason I don't have like a regular juicer I have the full-blown juicer that you throw the whole thing in but I figure I just squeeze it here because most people don't have one anyway so if you squeeze the lemon and place your hand underneath you can catch the extra seeds that fall out if some slip away from you just make sure you get them out of a bowl when you're done [Music] next you'll take your lemon pill strips and place them into a food processor if you don't have a food processor you can use a blender we'll go ahead and grind it until you get fine pieces continue to grind it down until you get the strip's down about this size next we're gonna make the sauce take a bowl and add the lemon juice that we squeezed earlier some granulated sugar and some of the human father Meehan whey powder can be found at most grocery stores in Hawaii you can buy it online on Amazon at crack seed stores around it's pretty easy to find all these go ahead and mix that up until well combined and you're gonna go ahead and add your gummy bears toss the gummy bears in the sauce until well coated [Music] then you're gonna add the ground-up lemon-peel lastly stir it up and enjoy [Music] and that's how you make lemon lemon peel gummy bears really easy right if you try this recipe or any of my other recipes please let me know leave a comment in the comment box below what's your favorite thing to

across Arizona but tonight we're turning the tables on the dealers who are selling pills laced with deadly fentanyl chief investigative reporter Morgan Lowe traveled to Mexico for this hidden-camera investigation I'm good how are you doing you are about to witness a drug deal caught on hidden camera in a back room in Mexico this is it 30 30 how many do you have those pills called em 30s are counterfeit percocet they're made with the synthetic narcotic fentanyl smuggled from China to Mexico it's pressed into pills in a lab in Culiacan by the Sinaloa drug cartel just south of the border they're worth 6 or 7 dollars a pill just north of the border in Nogales or San Luis Arizona they're worth $10 and by the time they reach Phoenix or Scottsdale they cost 15 or 20 dollars per pill people like to pass it off as percocet Parker McKenzie was hooked on em 30s but last year just a single pill killed his teenage brother Brian a promising highschool baseball pitcher from Buckeye who had never taken a drug before in his life he was my only sibling you know I miss him everyday and police tell CBS 5 investigates that they now believe every pill sold on the street here in the valley is laced with fentanyl that brings us back to Mexico where I'm wearing a hidden camera posing as someone who wants to buy a batch of em 30s to take back to Phoenix we have another camera shooting me from a distance and it takes just seconds for this guy to approach me I'm looking for EM 30s takes me to a storefront where we meet his dealer 13 how much per pill yeah quanto Valley but those seven okay okay I'm not really going to buy the drugs so I tell him I need to think about it and I walk away from the deal but not five minutes later how many women I run into this guy who says he'll take me to his dealer we walk down an alley and end up where we started our story how are you I'm good how are you doing the man in yellow takes me to the back of his store where he pulls out a small baggie full of pills that's not baby aspirin no no no because no no this is an M and that is a is 3030 how many do you have [Music] all right let me talk to my buddy who's got the money twelve you said well don't I let you have work ten dollars ten dollars okay I tell him I need to get the money and leave the store astounded by how quickly I was able to find two people offering to sell the drugs there's such a narrow ratio of what can make it get high and make it kid died dr. Frank love akio from banner poison and Drug Information Center says the danger with fentanyl is that it is so powerful and there's no way to know how much fentanyl is in each pill find them on our patience you know when we see patients and you know maybe our near-death they get treated they wake up and they say they often say that they use em 30s there are few current official stats on the number of overdoses but fentanyl seizures on the street have jumped by more than 1000 percent in three years police say since Arizona made it tougher for people to get legitimate opioids like oxycontin and percocet counterfeits like em 30s have flooded the market it's just it's scary officer Benjamin Gomez from the San Luis Police Department says the fastest growing market for EM 30s is teenagers almost every overdose in his community this year has been a high school student it's scary how easy these kids can can hide these case those how how affordable they are to them back in Mexico and m30 dealers expecting me to return with money he gets a surprise instead remember me yeah how are you doing okay I'm a reporter with the CBS TV station in Phoenix I want to talk to you about the pills you wanted to sell me okay you know that those pills are killing kids in the United States and probably here in Mexico why are you selling them you have anything to say why do you sell them you had nothing to say [Music] that is just an incredible investigation Morgan is here with us now so people are buying these pills south-of-the-border how are they getting them back over the border into the US law enforcement officials tell me that the pills are so small in the amount of fentanyl in each one is so minut that it's relatively easy for people to just cross the border through the ports of entry with fifty or a hundred pills at a time stuff in a backpack in their underwear or in motor vehicles so they can just slip right through the border in a lot of [ __ ] times so ASU students they're on spring break right now a lot of other colleges and high schools their spring breaks are coming up is there concern that some of these spring breakers may try to bring some of these pills back with them yeah absolutely and that's part of the reason why we did this story is to show parents and law enforcement officials how easy it is for these students these young people to get these m 30s and bring them back yeah they'll be offered the drugs just the way you were and that is not the only way that these pills are making it into the valley you're right this is just one of the ways that the pills are getting here there's also a huge black market that is controlled by the Sinaloa drug cartel and they are shipping thousands of these pills at a time up here to Phoenix just an incredibly i opening investigation into how easy it is to get these pills Morgan thank you", "syrJm9m_bds": "[Music] but anyway I said I will make a intro because of my hair or because we all look together and you know guys wanna see who's making Easter eggs so today's video is gonna be stellar rolls Carlito's who are you the gummies are gonna be strawberry flavored and y'all I'm excited to taste it I'm gonna do a reaction video after the gummies are made because I made it just now but you know our two for they'd be done but here if we're not hip to Stella Rose you need to get it you need to get on the wave this [ __ ] right here tastes good by itself you don't even need like no I not that you can just drink in room temperature I'm weird I drink wine with ice don't judge me I'm just like I'm just now getting into the whole wine thing because I like hard liquor like I like to drink and why you know why just don't do for me like I never got wine drink before but I feel like I just been checking on wrong line so you have any wine suggestions let me know anyways if you want to see how I made Stella rolls gummies first you're gonna need some stellar rose Stella berry if you don't have this particular flavor you can use whatever wine brand that you have I look real hurt but it's okay I made this video like something like a newborn who's gonna judge me judge your mama next we're gonna need some gummy modes I bought these from Amazon I don't remember the brand but you can use any gummy molds that you have in the house girl oh boy next we're gonna need some strawberry margarita mix I got these from jail shots they sent me a package like two months ago you're gonna need some a syrup mix a strawberry mix you also want to need a pot I ain't cannot sleep cuz I ain't gonna sleep cuz I mean I know just reliving my favorite bad girls club scene I need to go away looking real dumb so you're gonna add a cup of water to your pot and you're gonna bring it to a bowl after the bowl of oil a bit talking about job I'm actually going to add your strawberry margarita mix and you wanna pour it in I'm just meeting you know opening the package yeah I'm so black only black people saved shopping bags and gives it as trash bags it's okay so you just see me pouring it in and I just like to make sure that I get everything mixed together so that's why I'm grabbing my spatula and I'm going to stir it together because who was the wait for jello to burn down not me so I'm just going to speed up the process and there's me no stir it together and make sure that all the sugar is dissolved on the side if you know like I'm really cooking in here but I'm not next I'm gonna add my margarita mix and I'm gonna pour a splash into it I don't really have the exact measurements for this I just know I poured until God told me to stop so yeah so now I'm just gonna mix it together and make sure that it's mixed well because I really want it tastes like a strawberry daiquiri with berry hints so now that I mix that together I'm gonna add four teaspoons of Stella berry now when you're adding alcohol you have to add a lot of gelatin because if you don't then it's going to be really sticking on this video I only added two packets of gelatin and in reality I should have added like three or four because it took longer for me to actually make the gummies usually if I add like three to four packets of gelatin then it only takes like an hour but when I made these it took like two to three hours so if you're making these make sure you add to the four packets of gelatin and we're adding a gelatin make sure that you mix it well because you don't want to have a bunch of clumps in your mix now I had clumps but it wasn't a lot it was expected because I had turned my heat down because I didn't want the wine to burn out but make sure that you mix it well so you don't have a lot of clumps like how I did I had like a couple combs but it wasn't a lot usually I don't have any sometimes I used to microwave to make my jello as well but today I started use the stovetop so these are the clumps I'm talking about you don't want these in your mix so if you see them make sure that you mix it together and make sure that everything is dissolved now after I let it sit for a while I didn't have that many columns like you may have a few but I didn't have that many I can't I anticipated so I'm just going to fish the clumps that I have out now what you can do is you can just let it sit for a second before you stir sit for like five minutes but you know I was in a rush and I didn't feel like doing that either so yeah Electric gelatin sit for like five minutes and then stir but make sure that you keep stirring so everything can dissolve so this is me people taking it out so I didn't have that many clumps in it so I am satisfied with that so right now I'm going to use my little mixing bowl or picture that regreted mixer sent me and I'm gonna pour it in Montgomery mix now I don't know what was wrong with me maybe it was too early or whatever but I just couldn't pour to save my life I don't understand what was wrong with me so right now I'm just pouring the mixture in Montgomery molds and you can see I'm just spilling everything all on my stove but it's okay just make sure you uh you guys are making this on a surface that is easy to clean up or make sure you have like paper towels or something under or it's gonna get pretty messy you see I'm spilling [ __ ] in the video it's okay cuz I'm gonna wipe it up so I had left over gummy mix so I used my heart mol so got from Michael's a long time ago for Valentine's Day and I just put the rest of the mix in my heart shape modes it's going to be cute so I just poured it in you know make it a mass per usual but it's okay I'm cleaned up afterwards so you're just gonna pour the rest of your mix into the hearts or whatever mold that you have if you have like jello dry containers you can pour it in there just make sure that you use everything that you made because you got to get your money working girl oh boy whoever watching me so you know I'm supporting y'all gonna feeling so bad the quarantine got me looking hurt so this is the final project I been in the fridge for like two to three hours and it's at the final result stellar rose gummies now the reaction time okay I saw her back with the finished look I might get a plate you guys like my shirt I want a best cocktail contest on Instagram and they sent me a shirt and I was cute but you know how to use gummies taste so let's go ahead and get into that well first of all they got the gummy texture he's a good shape hold up really good I'll taste like I could examine the taste sort of they taste like a type of gummy brand I can't think of it but it's real fruity it's because I use strawberry daiquiri mix I use berry wine and I used strawberry jell-o so it tastes really fruity so I'm gonna broke we're not such a hell-like that's why they're not in like the best shape I think I should have used like one more packet of gelatin just because I used all that wine but my heart's he came out pretty fine but when you're making these just make sure that you use like three to four packets of gelatin but overall the texture is great he stays really good so I highly highly highly highly highly recommend you guys make these

updated video over the the goalie apple cider vinegar gummies I posted a video about these already so this is my updated video of them after finishing one bottle so yeah I kind of just wanted to get on here show you guys my results what I noticed share with you guys my experience with the goalie apple cider vinegar Co means before we get into this video hit that subscribe button it would mean so much to me if you did so let's get on with the video first off I want to say that I did stick with eating only two of these a day you can eat up to six a day but I just wanted to stick with the minimum two a day that actually ended up being really great for me I like taking just two a day I didn't feel like I needed to take more so pretty much I always took these in the morning time it was so easy taking these because they taste so good it literally tastes like you're just eating candy every morning compared to taking the apple cider vinegar shot which was so hard to do every day it just was so harsh it's just not fun taking that every day so these are actually very enjoyable to take it's super easy so I did like that in the one month that I took these I would say the biggest thing that I noticed is your appetite it definitely got rid of craving whenever I would eat like my meals would be small and I wasn't wanting to eat these big meals you could definitely tell that your appetite is just controlled you're not out there like wanting to eat everything the thought of food is just not in your mind so it definitely helps with appetite control I would say that was my number one thing that I notice when it comes to like weight loss I wasn't really focused on trying to lose weight with these I lost about four pounds and the whole entire month I could see how these would help you because like I said it definitely helps with appetite control so if you're watching what you're eating exercising doing stuff like that while taking these it definitely would probably help you lose weight on top of that it really helps with bloating in the past month I really wasn't ever bloated you don't have that heavy feeling after you eat which was another thing that I really liked because no one likes being bloated I also noticed taking them in the morning time that I had is so much energy throughout the day nothing like wired and going crazy but like you just feel good throughout the whole entire day like you don't ever feel sluggish or tired and needed to take a nap so that was another thing that I notice is you definitely have just good energy throughout the day I noticed during this a month was my skin I talked about this already in my first video that after even like a week I could notice my skin was just clear it's even toned I had no blemishes nothing it was really nice to just have clear skin there were so many days I just didn't even wear makeup I didn't need makeup so that was really nice as well yeah those were kind of the really main things that I noticed during this month overall I really loved taking these I would highly recommend them I already ordered another three months worth of them they still haven't came in yet but I do want to say that I've been off of them for about a week now probably like two three days ago I started getting like all these cravings I was bloated for the first time and forever and right away I knew it was because I was not taking these for a few days so ready for this package to come in so I can get back to taking these consistently like I said I would highly recommend me so that's pretty much my experience with this with one bottle I do want to keep making updated videos for you guys about these if you are curious about these I you have a video on them explaining all the benefits and everything for these gummies if you have any questions or anything please feel free to comment them below I would love to answer them for you guys also if you are wanting to buy some of these I do

welcome back to my channel I hope you guys are having a good day you know what I mean like I'm so sorry for my wheel being in the way but um here's the thing I can't do anything about it because I don't have my tripod my tripod broke I try to get a tripod the other day and they didn't have any for some reason so I'm guessing I need to either order one online or just somewhere else I don't know what to really do about it but right now you're just gonna have to kind of deal with this I couldn't move it but then I'm gonna be like up here to video so I don't know what you guys would prefer see I'm saying like I just don't have any like flat oh that kind of worked okay okay we're gonna roll with it anyway so today I'm doing a quick little review on an edible eye balm I love edibles I mean I love him but at the same time they're deadly to me they're strong girl I took a edible for 4/20 it was the la familia hot chocolate one I took the whole thing and that thing smacked so today I didn't really want like a chocolate or like a brownie I wanted something like more candy like so I got the Smokies edible and these are in the sour blueberry fruit shoes basically so it's a hundred milligrams there's two milligrams of CBD per not per actually the whole bag is I guess that's what it is now per serving it's 10 milligrams of THC so per gummy and then 2 milligrams of CBD in one little gummy so I'm not gonna do the whole thing and by the way you guys this review is going to be really really [ __ ] forward really honest I'm gonna tell you guys about the taste I haven't opened these or anything yet so I want to record like my reaction of like the taste that I get instead of like trying them and then coming back and then you know my thoughts would be kind of you know what I mean so yeah anyways these are vegan this is a vegan uh thing not all of them are weakened from this brand so if you are vegan and you know you stay away from Dairy and stuff so I'll definitely ask them which one is the vegan one because I know not all of them are vegan but I know that their dairy they're gluten-free all of them are gluten-free but not all of them are vegan so I just got this because of the flavor you know what I mean so I'm not vegan so it doesn't matter to me but it's a good thing that it is vegan so I don't mind it and I don't really care so yes so the ingredients on here is just sugar corn syrup pectin I don't know what that is but it is citrus acid natural and artificial flavoring FD&C blue one which is probably like the color of the candy soy let union I don't know and then cannabis extract so the weed basically you know so yeah the sugars in this is four grams I'm thinking yeah per piece it's four grams so if I'm gonna have three of them for 12 grams of sugar when you do the math it's kind of a lot so these are sour they're Fruit Chews had crafted gluten free vegan and so I watched a review on these and people said that only 40 will do the trick I'm gonna try 30 just because I want to see how I feel and if I don't feel it as much I'm so sorry about the [ __ ] Sun oh my god but if you don't feel it as much then I guess well if I don't feel it as much because you're not going to taking them I am but if you don't feel it as much then I'll take then I'll take another one pretty pretty much but I know how adipose are they sneak up on me I keep eating them like I eat them and then I keep eating them and then boom you know so these were $21.99 okay before attacks at my dispensary so I think with tags and all the little bag they charge me for because I've got to break minds it was like $25 so basically it's really easy to open I just rip this up hopefully it's easy to open it cuz I haven't even opened it yet already strong it's kind of like this there's like a little this in here and I'm guessing you pull that apart and they open up they smell like blueberry literally like [ __ ] they smell like powder aid okay you guys the blue powder right that's what they smell like I totally spot on that's what I'm getting and they look really cute and like flat and big oh they're soft they're like super gooey look at all that little sugar let me just you know I'm saying basically they're just coated in sugar they're sour they're pretty big I would say they're like as big as a [ __ ] let me see some money up in here so this is a quarter and then they're a little bit bigger than a quarter even so okay you guys so I'm gonna try one and I'm gonna see you in like a week [Music] mm-hmm gather my thoughts okay so I'll say this they taste really good they have they're sweet they are sweet you know I'm saying like I'm not really like a candy person but I like gummies and like sour stuff so I can make an exception but they're really good I had one of these they don't taste like we do know what I'm talking about you know when you take some edibles and they have that weird like nasty aftertaste of the weed you know you can you feel on the back your throat and all that I don't get it with these ones so I'm gonna take another one this is gonna be my number two you know I'm gonna take the three in front of you guys so you guys know what's real and I'll check back in with like in an hour and two I got some laundry to do so I'm gonna be a little bit busy and then they're just gonna hit me like a truck and I'm gonna be gone you know what I mean I don't know I hope so I hope these are strong they were saying these were strong so they better be so this is gonna be twenty you know what I'm saying these are really good you guys like even if they didn't have ween in it I would probably eat them they're kind of like okay they're like a sour patch kit all most like they kind of remember that but they're not as sour they're like they're like up from sourness it's like a good five it's it's the perfect amount it's honestly good with this week and see what I mean so I'm gonna eat one more you know I'm saying well you know we get lead tea today [Music] he was a [ __ ] fly in here anyways these are really good I wish they had like a pack where they had like all the little flavors that would be really dope like you know they had blueberry rhinos berry that would be mom like a little mixed assorted pack but yeah so I've had if I'm gonna have three out of like seven left so that's 70 grams seven milligrams so basically I'm ready to eat another one this is gonna be thirty and I will check back with you guys and an hour or I think on the back it tells you yeah wait two hours so I'm gonna wait two hours and I think he's gonna give me pretty lip but I don't know because I'm not smoking at the time maybe I will smoke a bowl but I'm not gonna like smoke because I feel like when you smoke weed and you take edibles it's both of them combined and it's just too much so I'm really trying to see how strong these are going to be just with 30 milligrams and if you guys the real tea on this you know I'm going to eat the last one and then I'm gonna go and go do my little [ __ ] wash my drawers and then I'll be back and then I'll tell you guys how they are so yep sure yeah of course chuckles you guys but I told you guys I did a little bun you know what I mean it's like a tank guys so it's like eight o'clock now I took those three edibles at 6:00 it was kind of like noise in there but anyways there's six it's been like two hours I smoked a bowl I'm not really feeling it all that much so I'm gonna wait until like 20 more minutes see if it kicks in and then if not I'll take another alignment so then I'm gonna give it the complete fill out two hours so you know it's good at all so we'll see but if not I'm gonna take one more or maybe two more to see if it's gonna hit me later but yeah that was 30 milligrams and it's been like an hour and 40 minutes I don't really feel anything but I'm gonna wait 20 more minutes because you know how they are they hit out of nowhere so I'll be back with you guys I'm kind of talking fast I'm not trying to but it's just a quick update you don't even a brief summary so I'll be back and I'll see you in a bit hey y'all so it's an update it's been I think a day or so two days I don't know when I recorded that video but basically I'm here to give my initial and final final thoughts you guys about that edible the was it the sour blue raspberry by Smokies the gummies the Fruit Chews to be exact you guys they were [ __ ] smacking okay when I had the 40 milligram that night oh my god was I gone was like on I kept [ __ ] eating I didn't really felt them like hitting me like instantly instantly but I felt like they really creeped up little by little and I also feel like it took a little bit longer for 40 milligrams to hit me it took like I would say to and I have hours and then I was just like Munchie [ __ ] madness you know I was eating anything I was just eating chips food I ate even after my dinner like have some snacks if you're gonna eat some edibles because trust you're gonna need up and then what's getting pulled in here okay and then I took 50 milligrams that I think the day after okay I took 50 milligrams and that actually hit me a little bit sooner I would say that one they fit me I don't know why maybe like maybe because the timing that I took them at I feel like the first time I took the 40 milligram I took it at like 4 to 5 so it was like kind of late afternoon already so you know it girl was tired she was doing her SH and she was tired but the second time when I took it I took it earlier in the day I took it out like 2 o'clock because I wanted to be like awake and [ __ ] at least enjoy my high you know so I took the 15 milligrams and on this sweet so I took him I took him I'm chillin literally I would say two hours later two hours and ten minutes later it hit me I was at Walmart I was grabbing some things and that [ __ ] hit me like a brick like oh my god I was literally in one of the aisles and I was just [ __ ] dying you guys and I know you guys don't really care because don't everybody feels that way but I was legit like [ __ ] dying like over nothing and I was just like the [ __ ] but I realized that okay the edible so I know decided it's my cool I left Walmart and then even when I was home after that my boyfriend looked at me and he was like you're [ __ ] what did you do like I guess I was that [ __ ] high guys but I was like I just knew what it was you know to me that I didn't feel like I looked that [ __ ] high but I guess to somebody that you know from their point of view they would get it but um yeah to me I was really [ __ ] high but still productive so I would recommend taking them on like a very like good day that you're not gonna do [ __ ] you're gonna be eating a lot you're on your own time definitely don't do it if you're gonna go into work or something like that it's noticeable if you're high you know what I mean it is for me so my eyes got a little they got sleepy they got a little low they got red so you know but you guys the edibles smack I totally recommend them I'm going to try other flavors you guys I'm gonna do more reviews on this monkey's fan because I think it's probably one of the good ones okay really good really good so I've been totally gonna recommend to you'll I haven't tried other flavors but I definitely like the sour blue raspberry because I'm a sour person so you know I like sour candy so they were really my cup of tea so if you guys are into that I definitely recommend these edibles so that is my review you guys I don't want to keep going on and on and on but the same thing basically I rate him a 10 the taste is a 9 out of 10 the potency is a 10 out of 10 because I was gone with 40 so that's good because you can literally take 40 40 and then maybe the other two before work because it's like okay they're not gonna hit you as hard at vicious 20 milligrams you know what not as me as hard but like so like 42 like 60 it's like the perfect range for me yours might be a little different so I don't know so be careful but your dosage and all that dogs barking so I'm just gonna go and yeah you guys have a good day I'll see you on my next one bye bye", "UKeVf5n-yTY": "[Music] what's up you guys it's valuable on the perfume down and i'm back with a very very exciting video i am so excited to bring you guys this reveal today is national fragrance day as you know i have some other things going on like a giveaway on my channel but i'm really excited to bring to you guys this exclusive we're not exclusive but like a new scent from our favorite bath and body works i'm super excited you guys are gonna love it i can't wait for you to rush to the store to actually smell it for yourself the weather is warming up and this is the perfect time to release this entire fragrance line like i'm super excited so we're just gonna get right into it we're gonna go through everything i've got my yellow and my orange one because i feel like it's appropriate for this fragrance and let's get right into it so the name of this fragrance is sunshine mimosa now i do believe they had other fragrances in the past maybe like a lotion and a fragrance mist that have this name however this is an entire line this is like an entire line my dude and i know i just know that you guys are gonna love it especially this is for my bubbly citrus people okay so let's go through the notes that it actually says so it states that it has bright bubbly champagne and fresh citrus and i have to say that's exactly what it smells like sorry for the background noise i am outside the weather again is really warming up so i wanted to get outside and i think it's appropriate for this fragrance because this is definitely again a bubbly fun sunshine fragrance we're gonna get some leaves on these trees soon and this would be perfect okay so back into the actual line so they have everything so i'll just go through and show you guys what they have they have a fragrance mist of course i think the packaging is so beautiful it looks like sunshine it looks like a sunrise or a sunset and then it has like three sparkly um like almost i think it's like silver or gold specks on it along with an actual like a sun burst on it so that's so beautiful i don't know if you guys know but orange is like one of my favorite colors orange and yellow so when i received this i was like literally screaming because i love orange so we have our fine fragrance mist love that of course you can like douse yourself in that it's really great for the summer when you don't want something to be super strong but along with that we get a full fragrance an actual perfume which i'm really excited the size is a one point seven fluid ounce this is the uh de parfum and it is in the same scene it says again bright bubbly champagne fresh citrus really really love that again the packaging is just so freaking beautiful look at that it's gorgeous it's like an iridescent orange kind of a color for the top but overall just freaking stunning okay the next thing that we have is a body scrub i did utilize most of these products i did use the perfume and the fragrance mist today and then i also used the foaming sugar body scrub in the shower oh my gosh i really really liked it but we'll go through that a little bit more individually and then they also have a body cream i usually like a body cream over a body lotion especially for the winter but since it is warming up they also of course do have a body lotion which is definitely hydrating as well so again everything in the same scent but they have a body cream if you prefer the cream or the lotion if you prefer the lotion a lot of people like to go with the lotion in the spring summer because they don't want something that's super thick even though i feel like their creams are really good for like keeping hydrated but then also dissolving into the skin really quickly so either one works perfect today i also utilize the moisturizing body wash which i really like i'm all about hydration as you know the moisturizing body washes have cocoa butter they have shea butter um they also have coconut oil so if you really really want some creamy lather instant hydration then definitely go with the moisturizing body wash if you like the regular shower gel of course they have that as well which has vitamin e and aloe as well um and again i just love the packaging i think it's so beautiful and then of course since this is like spring summer themed we're going to be going hopefully fingers crossed on vacations or even staycations or even if you just want to pop this fragrance in your bag and you don't want to take the full bottle then you can go ahead and pick up the rollerball which they have as well so that's super super exciting um oh actually i'm sorry it's not a roller ball it is a perfume spray so that's that's even better because if you know me and you know my channel i'm not a huge fan of rollerballs i prefer a perfume spray so they've got something for everyone so the actual spray i think that if you like champagne toast you would really like this one i feel like it smells kind of similar in the same family with like that sparkly brightness to the fragrance however they've definitely turned up the citrus note so if you like a juicy citrus fragrance then you will love this line so i really really do like the fragrance mist and i didn't realize how strong it was until like i sprayed it i doused myself i was in the living room and then i went into the kitchen went back into the living room and i could still smell it like really really strong so these scents really have some performance some punch and then of course the perfume is going to have even more impact than the fragrance which you can use one or the other you can use them together of course just depending on how fragrant you want to be that day the foaming sugar scrub i love a sugar scrub to begin with but this did a really really good job of being abrasive and really getting like dead skin off of my skin so of course it has the sugar exfoliants in there but it also has the vitamin e so it's hydrating as well it's not going to like rob your skin of any hydration which i really really like and then of course it's foaming so it's also going to like be your soap as well if you forget your soap or something like that this will do a good job of like cleansing your body and making it super soft love that of course again i do love a body cream i feel like it really adheres to scent to you and sometimes i found that like i could just use the body cream and i don't even have to use a fragrance like it's that strong and i've i see the same thing in this body cream really really love it super hydrating nice it's thick so while it's still a little bit chilly even though it's warming up it's definitely going to keep you very hydrated after you get out the shower the actual i didn't use the shower gel but of course everyone loves their shower gels i think it's going to be great for getting you super clean in the summertime but then also the scent is just so delicious and so juicy and bright and citrus again i did use the moisturizing body wash and oh my gosh the lather is so creamy like they are not lying like i love it it's just so rich it just feels so luxurious it feels like you're treating yourself to a spotting like literally i love it so much i'm more than likely going to buy a backup of of this um just because i really really like it and you know what's crazy i think that if you've been following me you know that i'm probably not i always say i'm not a huge fan of citrus scents like i don't feel like they usually work for my body chemistry this works with my body chemistry so that's saying a lot it just smells so freaking good if even if you don't like citrus like i feel like if you want a summer scent this could be the one for you so and then another thing i want to point out i know this is like should be the standard this range is dermatologist tested and then it also is not tested on animals as well so that's something i want to point out because i know that really matters to a lot of people as it should so i really like that and then for the body lotion again i i opted for the body cream today um but i really like the body lotion as well we're actually i think i used the body lotion yesterday but as you know they're both like super hydrating it's just kind of like which consistency do you like better this one's a little bit more liquid so you know some people prefer that some people want more of a cream you've got both in this collection really really like that as you can see i didn't even take the plastic off of the now that i know it's the actual perfume spray but i'm definitely going to pop this right in my purse after this because this is going to be my summer scent if there's anything that's making me like that will make you want to purchase this is the fun bright poppy colors and again it has like like that glittery kind of a look and actually you can feel it it kind of feels like raised glitter on there but it's just so beautiful the packaging it really puts you in the mood for summer and i'm just like super excited i hope that you guys can get out to the store try out these scents if you have already then let me know what do you think about them do you typically like citrus bright citrus scents do you like champagne toast because i feel like if you usually get champagne toast in the fall in the winter then you should go ahead and get this one for spring summer but let me know your thoughts let me know if you have any questions and i will catch you guys in the next video peace [Music]", "G_jmMfjsKtw": "hi everyone so today is Sunday and it's a pretty boring day today I don't really have much to do today I have some housework but nothing like you know major that I have to do and it's cold I think he got down to like 0 last night it's cold here this morning I'm just gonna have my my tea and I'm going to be doing a review on the twisted extracts cherry jelly bomb cooking green bastards style sent this to me I never had this before so I'm excited it's uh it's 80 milligram THC and it's a sativa so that should just it should just be fine I shouldn't be you know tired I'm hoping I'm not probably not anyways let's open this up you can really smell the cherry oh my goodness okay so it [Music] so it looks like like this it comes in this type of thing and it looks like a Lego so I guess each um because it says eight eight by ten milligram doses so I guess each little round thing here is ten milligrams it smells it smells like cherry but it smells like um like the 1980s like the Cabbage Patch Kid when you first gotta go with that that could smell it had that but plastic I was just telling ed about this the other day about plastic smelling things it was like just a smell that came off the plastic anyways let's uh okay it smells like cherry it doesn't taste like cherry you could taste the THC in it I'm sorry but odors doesn't taste good like I thought the stuff from Dana bhisma was strong well this is really strong good thing I brought a drink that's tapas hole and it leaves like an after taste in your mouth wowsers okay so I will come back when I feel something I don't know how long it's gonna take probably not that long because I should have probably had something to eat like a toast or something cuz I only have tea in me so I'm just I should have maybe read the directions first but it just says um yeah you know it's eight doses we recommend first-time users which I'm not allow 60 to nine minutes for 60 to 90 minutes for effect before another dose is considered well I just took the whole thing so let's try the 60 to 90 yeah that's that's it there maybe I'll get a lot of housework done in no time after it kicks in who knows anyways I'm going to finish drinking my tea and I have bedding to do today and some other things so I will come back when I have let you guys know when this kicks in what I'm feeling all the good stuff okay so um because I didn't think through my date properly and I reached out the edible I am walking to the Metro if I need to pick up some stuff and I cannot drive now and it can't drive so this is going to be the experience I [Music] feel something I just don't know what it is yet so you know Azusa kicks in I will turn this on and let you know okay way back hey um the [ __ ] has ever started to kick in and this is probably not the best idea but I'm like not far I'm not far to go I just need to get there get the [ __ ] but I don't know my eyes really feel like they're high okay so like I think I'm gonna probably call ahead just so I don't feel so um edgy I guess okay I get closer when I get to the match our Altos heart because they should this is not good okay I'm just gonna at the match room and I'm pretty worried this this [ __ ] here just keeps kicking in stronger lighter for Edie I'm gonna do that now and then I'll show you inside Metro okay leave the grocery store and I feel like everybody is looking I'm getting a little bit paranoid here it's just like I don't even have anybody quick wheeze though the struggle is real I don't know what to do and it's just a wave okay I'm just going to get the theme so they need to get it and then I will come back after I hurry up in here and get outside experience I just really need to make it home and it seems like it's so far away [Music] lazy like my arm is gonna bust before I make it that but stuff there that cooking green bastard style sent me it's given it I like you know I like it a little bit paranoid like with the whole grocery store thing but like now that I'm I'm home I'm okay I'm not feeling tired I'm feeling it's kind of relaxed and when I rolled up the joint so I'm gonna smoke that like you feel relaxed and you feel like does not let you feel lazy you just feel like doing easy tasks there's just seen Charlie he's like looking at something over there now what but you're a you just feel like not really doing much I don't know what's going on with this the the twisted extracts that jelly bomb it's good it smells like you know it's a cherry but I will be honest the taste is horrible it kicked in roughly like and like an hourish thanks what is that guy's name cooking that cooking is a cooking green bastard style [Music] so thanks cooking green bastard style I'm not feeling too hungry or anything like that like I kind of like this stuff would be good to do I like on a really nice fall day when there's lots of leaves all over the place and you're just like in the bush like in the trail or something like that like when you know how many people are around right like this stuff would be good I think you would like I would like it I'd like to go walk on a trail and when there's more leaves mmm that's what I learned to talk about okay well the leaf thing I just on my way home there was some like really nice red maple leaves that's we're on the sidewalk and I was like I just thought it was really pretty but in the Metro everybody was looking at me like everybody and by the time I got to the cash like the cashier I didn't even make eye contact with her I just saw debit and Jetley when she was I guess meaningful I wanted a bag I just kept my head down so yeah there's some paranoia with it and I'm just gonna finish this and get on with my day so it's like that's it that's all bye", "QHxhZ1_U4ns": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show YouTube's preeminent marijuana edible review show I only say that because I think I'm the only marijuana edible review show I'm sure if there was another one it would be the preeminent one because it's hard to have a worse one but what are we talking about here today other than how bad we are we are talking about gummies that's why I've got my Nutella and spatula here so that's what this is for this is for fat this is for fat for the real review the infused creation sativa strawberry apple sour melts strawberry apple sour melts what a weird combination don't even understand what the Apple is supposed to be in that strawberry Apple sour belts 300 milligrams of THC this will very likely be my final review of infused creations they've all been bummers from the get-go and if this one isn't doesn't pick up or it doesn't change my opinion in any way that will probably be it for infused creations and we can go ahead and write them up so I've got my fat here just with the gummies I like to ensure that I eat them under optimal conditions so I take a little bit of fat beforehand and I like to do that in the form of Nutella because I'm a red-blooded human being and I like Nutella like everyone who should creamy chocolate hazelnut evening delicious now for something a lot less creamy Nutella II and delicious this all of infused creations gummies we've got a strong whiff of it just as soon as I open that package have that very recognizable gummy weed aftertaste that very bitter a very astringent yeah makes you want to rub your tongue on sandpaper type of taste and I can already smell it coming out of these so I'm not looking forward to it this is smell strong boy does it smell strong I do like sour bells traditionally but I'm pretty sure I'm not going to like these anyways let's go ahead and put it right down the hatch let's stop bitching and complaining and just go ahead and eat it well oh my god that is terrible that is so bad oh [ __ ] me oh there's no like sweetness right on the get-go it's ah it gets worse just that awful awful awful aftertaste oh [ __ ] this [ __ ] these things are terrible but I'll do it for you guys so I'm gonna finish these off and I will see you in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling because that's the most important part I don't we'll review actually in this case I'm pretty sure I haven't I'm gonna feel not high at all uh maybe the taste is the most important thing and the taste is [ __ ] sorry for such a bummer sorry to be sitting down and see you guys in two hours peace oh hi guys I'm back it has been two hours since I had the strawberry apple sour belts from infused creations and they are terrible boy are they terrible they taste terrible I'm not high at all totally stone-cold sober I feel like I wasted my money on these total total waste of money thankfully not does not cost a lot for the infused creations I believe these only cost me nine dollars which is really affordable for a 300 milligram edible the only problem is I don't think there are 300 milligrams of THC in there because I am NOT high at all not even as I said I yeah yeah nothing to say about it nothing nothing kind to say about it if you see it at a dispensary near you pass totally avoid it actually go and tell your bud tender they should not be stocking these because it's just an insult to their customers sorry to get so real with you guys and sorry to get so real with you infused creations I wish I liked your products more I just think that they are garbage thank you so much for watching weeds guys I'm sorry it's been a bummer over of you but hopefully next time we'll find something a little bit better

milligrams in each little gummy and 16 gummies per pack and this retails for 39.99 if you want a quick brief history about what this is uh it's a cbd gummy basically made with delta 8 thc which is basically like the brother of delta 9 or the thc that you would normally find in marijuana delta a contains similar psychoactive properties as its little big brother delta nine thc but the catches it is still federally legal here in the united states um the problem with delta eight is it's very hard to get it concentrated to give you like a real high it doesn't exist too much in abundance however companies are finding way like 3g to concentrate the delta h delta 8 to give you um a nice cool relaxing experience i took mine about four hours ago it's starting to wear off a little bit uh it came the high high quotation marks came about an hour and a half in and i will tell you if you've tried cbd gummies and you don't feel like you're getting anything out of them like they're not getting you that relaxing feeling that you want uh 3g delta 8 thc gummies did it for me past two and a half hours my body's been really chill kind of relaxed um a little bit tingly just nice i've been having a real nice feeling what i don't have is too much of the head high or feeling like oh hi or any kind of the psychoactive properties they don't feel like they're they're you get that kind of head high that you get with the some strains of marijuana you get just a more like peaceful relaxed chill feeling and i honestly think like that's what i've been looking for in cbd gummies and this is not a sponsored video by the way this is just me being truthful i like these you i tried multiple cbd gummies and they haven't given me that chill relaxing feeling at night when i'm just chilling that i wanted but this did like i i feel good right now um i've had a little bit of trouble filming these videos uh today because i mean i feel like you know i'm pretty chill like i'm not on top of my game

makeup hand let me do the makeup here for y'all oh oh i can't really see this chili flakes but sugar man shout out to y'all this would be better as a belt yeah it would be better as well the flavor of that chili and that sugar right maybe on a belt right this like this this texture is coming with this texture is kind of strange but the flavor is blessing though this is like somebody who they trying to make a cheap i feel like this is a they didn't really put too much effort in a gummy right i feel like they need to put this on a belt stretch your gummy out to a belt because there's no flavor there's no lots of flavor it's just that texture's not matching with the flavor the texture was kind of strange in mouth but the uh the flavor the chili lumon that [ __ ] was good it's like just like the uh little candies you feel me man it tastes just like it look that's what i was gonna say next or makes a little thing a little like does the candies yeah like the candies you know either way the belt or the candies but you need to change your gummies man i don't know man this is just a weird little texture right well you don't write that too well i give it one thumbs up because the flavor is there and you don't taste the marijuana so you know what i'm saying look i know we can say that what you know you just i just come natural nowadays if i taste the marijuana that you could probably get a thumb down now at this point yeah i'm gonna be real know that you said that like when you in the edible section you probably can find like hell of [ __ ] that tastes way better than that but if you just want a chili lemon taste like i mean chili mango taste if you're looking for specific taste then grab those if not if you want just want something that just tastes good get something else you feel me cuz it's not too many [ __ ] busting on that milly chilly chilly fangirl milly chilly fangos fast in a hurry you feel me look like i said man that [ __ ] one thumb up one texture flavor would

really is a little bit different from a delta nine thc delta nine thc everybody knows that's the thc that makes you guys has some psychoactive effects it's also the main psychoactive ingredient within the marijuana plant and what delta eight is is it's a form or an isomer of that delta nine thc the reason it's been talked about a lot is because a lot of people are using hemp and derivatives of him to create a delta eight thc and they're doing this with some organic synthesis jiu-jitsu really in the laboratory and they're taking cbd and converting it over to delta 8 on thc the reason they're doing that is because the delta atfc of course has some of the same psychoactive effects that delta 9 phc has albeit they can be quite attenuated from delta a lot of people would say it has like a mellow effect so they're using hemp derived materials um they're hooking it up and they're processing it to the point where it now is converting into a delta eight thc molecule that then they can formulate into vapors or gummies or whatever that is that they're looking to formulate for so that's really what delta eight thc is when you look at it just look at it just look at it it's actually an oil and it looks a lot like a cbd oil or it looks a lot like a thc oil you've seen some nice golden pictures of some of that oils as they're flowing out the oil itself is a little bit more biscuit so it's very very thick hard before you need to really heat it up in order to pour it if you want to make products associated with a delta eight a couple different things you need to be thinking about the first thing is you gotta make sure that there's no delta not in your product because the law says that you have to have less than 0.3 delta 9 thc if you have a delta h thc and you have too much delta 9 in it you're not going to be able to use that product for your vapor or you need to dilute it down so that it doesn't have too much delta line in it that really is delta eight how you can use it the oils they look beautiful for them and you can formulate them into different products like that so really guys that's what delta 8 is all about please subscribe to our channel on youtube like us

alarm is that going to be picked up in the video [ __ ] where did i leave off at hey man it's mike from bonus cbd.com today we got uh hometown's new gummy bears man this is that delta eight thc pretty [ __ ] excited about this supposedly delta athc is supposed to be some strong [ __ ] it's supposed to knock you on your ass man i'm really curious if it's gonna taste the same as the other blueberry uh gummy bears they kind of had a sour taste to it it was pretty good man so i'm really curious about that so let's go ahead and start talking a little bit about delta athc supposedly what what everybody's saying is delta 18c is supposed to be more of a medical property thc more so than delta 9. delta 9 thc is the one that's regulated that's the one that you can't have above 0.3 percent you have that have to have it below now all the other tastes like delta delta eight thc a thcc all that can just be as high as they [ __ ] possibly can or as low as they possibly can either one there's no regulations on those guys it's just a delta nine thc that has the regulation but let's go ahead and crack this open and try these out now when we got these in they told us two get you feeling real good three you getting couch locked so i'm thinking about just trying out three i'm gonna try out these two and then go from there has no smell so we can't do a smell test let's try these gummies out man all right so let's go ahead and talk a little bit more about the thc's and the cbd properties that are inside these gummies um first off though the flavor it tastes just like the other blueberry gummies if you've ever had that if you haven't it's just a sour patch kid with the blueberry sour patch kid pretty much that's the easiest way to explain the flavor of that one now so one thing about this is it has like hardly any cbd properties in it it's point if you look at the lab results it's going to say 0.01 percent they round it down to zero that's why you can see on the side of this package it says zero milligrams of cbd there's not enough cbd in it for them to say hey these are cbd gummies that's just kind of false advertising now it's only pretty much only delta 8 thc and that's supposed to be good for medical use now as far as recreational side goes we're still waiting on that to kick in so we're gonna go ahead and give it 30 minutes and then we're gonna come right back and i'm gonna tell you how i'm feeling off these delta a cbds tell you how good they are how bad they are so stay tuned i'll be right back man all right man we're back after waiting 30 minutes for these to uh kick in i do feel a little something off of it more so than what i was expecting i wasn't expecting a whole lot so let's go ahead and talk about how it made me feel imagine taking like one or two beers that's about the same amount of feels that you get off of this i can see why it's good for some people and i can see why it's not good for others a lot of people are like oh delta eight that sounds spicy it's new it's not bad i don't mind it at all one thing i like about this is there's like no thc in it so if anybody needs to take it and you don't need thc in your system yeah you'll be all right man now if you're wanting a little bit more of a kick there might be something else stronger i want to say actually i have more of a feeling off the cbd gummies versus the delta 8 gummies that one gave me a harder feeling quicker this one's giving me more of a deep feeling i don't know if that makes sense i don't know how to explain it other than that but that's what i get off of this so it's pretty good i like it like i was saying though earlier the flavor is going to be a lot like a sour patch kid so that's always nice it doesn't have that dirty hemp [ __ ] dirt taste nobody wants that [ __ ] all right so if you're curious man first off i didn't tell you all to stay tuned for the promo code so stay tuned for the promo code y'all are about to get that let's talk about the price point of this guy real quick so the other gummies they're 25 bucks this one's 30. i can actually get behind that price point i did say you do feel a little bit more off the other gummies quicker and i was saying that this one's a little deeper but man you do feel a little bit better off of this one than the gummies five dollars more makes sense i'm cool with that doesn't hurt my feelings now so let's get let's hit you with that promo code let's keep the promo code simple this time we're just gonna hit you with delta eight that's gonna be the promo code it's not going to be the [ __ ] numeric roman [ __ ] delta with the triangle and [ __ ] [ __ ] illuminati [ __ ] okay it's just going to be delta all right man so that's that's going to be it for this video i'd like these gummies they're pretty good so yeah man y'all have a good one we'll we'll see y'all next time peace so quick update video on those gummies uh because it didn't really start hitting me until after i went home those things are bad ass man uh yeah there's he was not joking when he said three will knock you in the couch because i only took two and i would say maybe about 30 minutes hour after i left after we shot the video is when it really kicked in uh yeah they're strong delta a no there's no need for the cbd in it man the delta a if you're wanting something recreational and uh not illegal this

another quick and easy cannabis recipe by me and today i'm showing you how to make banana pudding good old-fashioned banana pudding using can of sugar now i infuse my can of sugar with the three to one sugar to tincture ratio to make my sugar not as strong but when i've finished the banana pudding it still came out to about 30 milligrams per half a cup so if you want something stronger just up the ratio on your tincture to sugar and if you haven't learned how to make tincture yak or sugar i'll make sure i leave the links above and below and if you're ready to start making that banana pudding let's get started recipe you need vanilla wafers ripe bananas milk flour eggs vanilla extract and can of sugar this recipe i'm using the double boiler method to make the banana pudding it makes it very simple and i think it's the best way to prevent your pudding from coming out lumpy or burning so start by adding three quarters of a cup of can of sugar a third cup of flour and a dash of salt to a medium-sized mixing bowl and use a whisk to combine and then set it aside next i'm using two small bowls to separate three egg yolks i find it easier to spoon out each egg yolk rather than trying to crack and catch each yolk in the shell but please feel free to use the best method that works for you and once each egg is separated i use the whisk to combine all three egg yolks and then i set them aside once the pot of water is boiling use an oven mitt add the bowl with the flour and the sugar on top then add one cup of milk and whisk until combined once combined add the last cup of milk and whisk until combined and make sure there are no lumps in the mixture at all next add the three egg yolks and whisk until combined again once combined you want to let your mixture cook for about 10 minutes stirring frequently and please don't forget you need to stir this very frequently or the mixture may burn now while the banana pudding is cooking you should start slicing your bananas make sure your bananas are ripe and bright yellow peel and slice about five to six bananas but don't forget to multitask and stir that banana pudding this is very important because you don't want the banana pudding to be lumpy but after 10 minutes the consistency of your banana pudding should start to become thicker when you're finished slicing the bananas add them to a bowl and set them aside and if you haven't already please give this video a thumbs up subscribe below and turn on those notifications so you don't miss any of my new videos now after about 10 minutes the texture of your banana pudding should start to thicken i like to use a whisk when i make my banana pudding because it's the easiest way for me to tell when it's done you'll notice when the pudding starts to thicken up the whisk will leave a trail in the pudding when that trail gets more defined like this the pudding is done take the banana pudding off the stove and add three quarters of a teaspoon of vanilla and stir until combined and then set it aside as i'm putting this banana pudding in jars i'm putting about 15 vanilla wafers in a plastic sandwich bag and breaking them apart so they won't be too big for the jars if you're using a trifle dish or a bowl you can keep the wafers whole i'm breaking them up just enough to have chunky pieces and i'll use the leftover smaller pieces for the top now start by using a quarter cup measuring cup to scoop the pudding in the jars then add a layer of wafers to cover the pudding then add a layer of bananas over the wafers and repeat this process until you get to the top top that last layer off with the small wafers you have and you have yummy banana pudding to share at your next barbecue okay guys thank you so much for sticking around and watching make this banana pudding it came out so well and i hope you guys get a chance to make it for your next gathering for your friends and before i go i gotta taste it so let's see um this banana pudding is so good it's so sweet and the bananas are so ripe so make sure you please make this for your friends and if you're into growing make sure you check out fastbuzz.com they have a new stream

here's what you're going to need some gushers eggs to put them in tincture and a syringe needle all you need to do is use your syringe needle to get some tincture and put it into each of your gushers now if you measure out your tincture in advance you can know approximately how much is in each so if you do a tablespoon of tincture you can divide it by however many gushers you end up filling and that's how you can figure out how many milligrams is in each gusher i have not yet tried this with coconut oil but i believe it would work as long as you melted enough so the syringe would be able to pull it up thank you guys so much for watching if you enjoyed this video please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe", "qbqDc9NbUMU": "hi everyone welcome back to hey bartender my name is gustavo rojas your personal bartender finishing my guinness float this is actually one of the nicest cocktails that you can be going to be able to see on on the other videos this is gonna be the shamrock uh drunken shamrock challenge 2021. just do your favor to yourselves google and see how we're gonna be preparing this guy um it is absolutely delicious and now that we're talking about cocktails you guys hey welcome thank you very much for all the support and all your thumbs up uh for all the videos and uh please if you haven't please don't forget to subscribe right there in the little red thing just clicking it you're going to be receiving two cocktails a week hopefully if everything goes okay and everybody's healthy and everybody's doing good and uh today we're gonna do something a little bit nice and special so i've been trying to work out on these uh very interesting cocktails and a system to make a cocktail so today we're going to be making a really cool version of the strawberries and cream which is going to be a pink cocktail a clarified cocktail so i really hope you guys enjoy it please stay with me and let me show you how we do it all right so uh a clarified cocktail or the clarification of a cocktail it is a system that uh it might sound not very practical to make it one by one uh especially if you work in a bar because basically what you're gonna be doing is just like mixing some uh cocktails and some spirits uh some syrups with uh uh milk products or like dairy products or products that they can tend to cradle and once they do that you're going to be filtering and uh what you're going to be needing basically is you're going to need a really decent amount or a size container you're gonna need a strainer a coffee filter or a muslin cloth uh and there is a couple ways that you can do it there is like some clarification with protein there's some gel that they sell then you can do the clarification with the gel you can look like a requires to put them in the refrigerator for like over 24 hours uh one of the interesting things is that you can make these cocktails in the large batches and uh i was kind of like a skeptical with the actual finish product but one of the things that i like is the flavor the flavor is just very unique very outstanding so i'm like hey what the heck why not let's try to do it today and today well we're going to be using this amazing product which i love the most it is absolute strawberry and juice and some absolute vanilla but we're going to start by putting your milk so in this case for me i like to use coconut milk if you decide to go for something you know like vegans you can use coconut you can use almond and we're gonna go for one ounce of coconut milk so i made it in this clear glass that way you can see the whole process of it and see how actually it tends to start crawling at one point okay so we're gonna put half ounce of lemon juice remember always fresh on your sweets what you're going to be doing is uh the mirror syrup or turbinado syrup it's going to be this nice brown uh beautiful brown sweet toasty notes on that syrup you're gonna go for half of an ounce [Music] and now what we're gonna do is ounce and a half of strawberry absolute vodka and half an ounce of vanilla now we have our cocktail done you are not going to be shaking it with ice basically what you're going to be doing is just stirring it in order to integrate all the flavors and you're going to start seeing right away that there are some curls on the actual cocktail all those kind of like white pieces breaking down okay so you want to start having that and what you're going to be doing is just like put your filter on top of the strainer and add your cocktail in it i'm going to make a second one because i'm going to have some guests coming over in a couple of minutes and i'm going to be able well a couple hours so i'm going to be able to actually offer them one cocktail for each one so we're going to repeat the whole process of the actual cocktail and i will see you in about 30 minutes all right you guys so we're back and uh well apparently our cocktail is nice and ready to go so i did a double filter after you finish the first filtering you're going to do a second time on so that way it's going to take all those little impurities on your cocktail you're going to see a little bit of grease and that's okay you just want to put this thin away and you have your cocktail ready to go so we're gonna put some ice like i said i'm making two cocktails for two special guests so i'm putting all our mix inside of the shaker and let's check and check for this cocktail we're going to use two nikon aura cocktail glasses and your final strainer [Music] this thing looks almost perfect and we're gonna garnish with something nice but at the same time simple and elegant a couple pink petals [Music] there we go and there you have it you guys this is gonna be your strawberries and cream a pink clarified cocktail salute everyone and i hope you like it enjoy you", "3QMf4ZOpJKU": "my name is Willie Christie I'm a wellness consultant for the cannery west Henry West is a new dispensary in West Los Angeles today we're talking about edibles customers come in here with all sorts of different requests whether that be dietary requests or different methods of ingestion or uptake or effect whatever you're comfortable with chances are we've got it for our first edible I want to talk about gummies gummies are the most popular edible and we've got the kiva camino gummies today they're cannabis infused gummies but they also add terpenes which is unique that gives it more of a indica or sativa feel just really nice tasting Class E gummies these are wild berry it got a pineapple habanero flavor a blend I'm apricot and my personal favorite the sparkling pear Prosecco next we've got sublingual strips sublingual strips are a small tab that you put in your mouth and let dissolve on your tongue you may know cookies and brownies as your typical ingestion method but what's unique about these is that those other edibles take up to two hours to take effect whereas sublingual effects you can start feeling it in 15 to 40 minutes you don't run into that this isn't hitting it's been an hour and nothing's working I'm gonna slam some more and then two hours it all hits and you're done and finally we've got tea now cannabis and tea have been a match made in heaven since time immemorial I find that this slightly caffeinated green tea is a really nice chill but focused way of ingestion it's absorbed through the stomach so this is another faster method than digestion and what I find with tea is that as you sip it it comes on in sips as opposed to like a boom there are different types of tea this is a caffeinated green tea there's non-caffeinated herbal tea this has a little blend of CBD as well really nice for chilling out so those are some of my favorite edibles on the market right now feel free to come by the can we stop in and check them out yourself", "ulQA1CY4tw8": "have you ever tasted orange juice shortly after brushing your teeth toothpaste makes many foods taste absolutely horrible but the effect is particularly bad with orange juice but why it's all down to one compound sodium lauryl sulfate which is present in toothpaste is a surfactant surfactants lower the surface tension between different kinds of liquids or between liquids and solids like water and fat the surface tension of a liquid is the ability of that liquid to resist an external force due to the cohesive nature of the molecules in water strong electrostatic hydrogen bonding allows pom skaters to be able to float and makes a really full glass of water appear to bulge out over the top surfactants lower the surface tension and help control how liquids spread over solid surfaces they can help to improve the separation of particles that may usually clump together and they can help to create bubbles they can also allow two liquids that don't usually mix to combine if you've made a vinaigrette which is oil and something acidic such as vinegar or lemon juice you'll see that they don't mix however adding a small amount of Dijon mustard as an emulsifier lowers the interfacial tension and your salad dressing doesn't split around your home sodium lauryl sulfate is found in washing up liquid shampoos shaving creams and bubble baths it's also found in toothpaste where it helps to create a foam in your mouth it also really messes with your sense of taste your taste buds that can detect five different kinds of taste they have receptors for sweet bitter and umami and ion channels that detect levels of salt as well as acidity which your brain interprets as a sour taste surfactants do two things to your receptors firstly they make it tricky to taste anything sweet and they make it easier to taste bitter flavors so after you brush your teeth you'll have a small amount of toothpaste residue in your mouth and there's sodium lauryl sulfate molecules slot themselves into your sweet receptors when you eat or drink something sweet because the surfactant is cocking them you don't taste any of the sweetness but at the same time the sodium lauryl sulfate interacts with other compounds on your tongue called phospholipids which usually dampen down your bitterness receptors phospholipids are a type of fat and surfactants are designed to break down fats so with your sweet receptors blocked and your bitterness receptors heightened foods which taste sweet taste horrible because you can taste none of the sweet but all of the bitter people notice the effect with orange juice because it's actually quite sour beneath all that natural sugar if you want to avoid this ever happening to you you can go in search of a toothpaste which doesn't contain any sodium lauryl sulfate but just remember to leave it a while before eating anything sweet for more edible experiments and the chemistry behind certain foods check out my other videos and demo sheets", "FeSd699JdgM": "hey everyone i am shireen from mypaincenter.com hey one of the new products that we're now carrying is delta eight and a lot of people have been asking us what exactly is delta eight so let me break it down to you in simplified terms okay so now you've got a cannabis plant right inside that cannabis plant there's over 100 cannabinoids now you're familiar with some of the popular cannabinoids such as thc or cbd now one of the other cannabinoids is called delta 8 or delta 8 thc but delta 8 thc is different from the thc you're familiar with the thc you're familiar with in a weed plant or marijuana when you're smoking weed or pot that thc is called delta 9 thc but in this video i'm just going to keep referring it to weed thc to make it less complicated okay so now you've got weed thc now when you smoke weed thc or you eat in weed thc edible you may feel paranoid your anxiety may elevate itself you may feel dizzy and some people don't like those effects and that's why a lot of people use cbd but now you've got delta eight which acts the same way as weed thc except it doesn't have all those paranoid stoned feelings to it so when you're using a delta eight vape pen or gummy bears you're not gonna feel that dizziness you're not gonna feel that stone feeling you're not gonna feel that paranoia it gives you more of a feeling of a relaxation more clear-headed feeling so what i how i explain it to people is like you've got weed thc and then you've got thc light or you're gonna go out and take tequila shots and like get hammered that's your weed thc but you really just want to have a night out and just like sip on pinot grigio that is your delta eight so it depends on what you're trying to feel i prefer the delta eight because with the delta eight i get the clear focused feeling i get the sense of relaxation it helps me with my sleep it helps me with my anxiety it helps me with my pain levels but i don't feel like i've lost control of myself i don't feel like i'm out of control because i'm paranoid or i'm dizzy or i'm just having hallucinations if that makes sense to you guys so what is delta eight good for delta is good for everything that you're using we thc four so say you have high pain levels high anxiety trouble sleeping nausea you need an appetite stimulant say you have a thc allergy some people are allergic to thc you're not even allergic to utc but are sensitive to thc say you've tried all the cbd products and nothing is really working you need something stronger but you don't want to go to weed thc because you don't want to be out of control that is what delta 8 is really good for okay now i want to caveat this i've had some people argue with me that when they smoke delta 8 or take a delta 8 gummy they do feel high my personal thought on that is that what they're feeling is a focus high they're just so they're getting so clear-headed so yeah you do feel something going on up here but it is a focus high it is nothing similar at least not for me it is nothing similar to getting weed high now if you do get weed high by using a delta eight product couple things to check for one you might just have a sensitivity to cannabis so just try if you if you try a delta eight product and you feel high try another delta eight product just to confirm because that'll tell you if you have a cannabis sensitivity or not secondly check the labels on the delta eight products you're buying check the lab results because here's the thing delta 8 thc is considered legal because it is from a hemp plant which also means that it should have less than 0.3 percent weed thc in it so delta 8 thc is very different than weed thc delta a thc is considered legal under the pharmac bill of 2018 but it still needs to have less than 0.3 percent thc which is the delta 9 thc so just check and confirm that the product you're buying is considered legal because that could also be why you're having a high in case there is too much weed thc in the delta 8 thc okay so i hope i've answered your questions if you have any other questions comments concerns drop them in the comments and i will get to you as fast as i can check us out at mypaintcenter.com for your delta eight needs we've got vape pens um sativas and indicas and we're gonna have gummy bears so hope to see you at mypaincenter.com and let us know if you have any other questions until then peace out", "GLatczgC--s": "Yo, what's up?

Nah, maybe a couple\nof the questions that I got were a little difficult,\nbut who cares? I would do this every weekend\nif it was needed, but it'll always\ncome back 100% truthful. Ask me harder\nquestions next time.", "NSFMK3p2kA8": "Today I want to quickly discuss Xanax - one\nof the most highly prescribed and used drugs in the world, for many, many years. In fact, one that I used myself in the past\u2026\nand I\u2019ll share that story with you in a minute. Xanax, which is the trade name for the drug,\nAlprazolam [al-pra-zuh-lam], is generally prescribed for anxiety and panic disorder. It\u2019s also used for depression and pain as\nwell. And lots of people use it for sleep. It works by calming down your nervous system\nand slowing things down, helping you feel calmer and more relaxed. It\u2019s a benzodiazepine [ben-zow-die-asuh-peen]\nmedication. Similar to Valium (Diazepam), Ativan (Lorazepam)\nand about 15 similar types of drugs. These drugs all work similarly. Some of the main differences between them\nis how quickly they are in and out of your system, based on the half-life. Why Do People Use Xanax\nWhy do so many people use Xanax and similar \u201cbenzo\u201d drugs? And the statistics are showing that women\nuse them more than men and these days, people are using them at an earlier age. So, how do they work? What are the benefits and side-effects? And finally, what about natural alternatives\n- eating specific foods, exercise, herbs, vitamins, meditation and so forth? I\u2019ll quickly go over each of these, so let\u2019s\nget started How Xanax Works\nAs stated earlier, Xanax and similar benzo drugs work to help you relax. They\u2019re used by people who have anxiety,\npanic attacks, under extra stress or worry and also for sleep and pain. When someone takes Xanax or other benzos,\nthey stimulate the inhibiting neurotransmitter responsible for how calm or relaxed we feel,\nwhich is called GABA. GABA is meant to be our natural tranquilizer,\nbut if you have anxiety or panic disorders, Xanax works by binding to these receptors\nand stimulating its production. Essentially, Xanax works by slowing brain\nactivity, which results in a calm, relaxed effect for the user. When you experience excessive stress or anxiety\nit causes the brain to increase its neuron activity, and that activity is what leads\nto the resulting feelings of anxiety. How Xanax works is by diminishing this activity. Something to note here is that like any drug,\nit works with existing processes within your body. Even though it\u2019s a man-made drug, it still\nworks with your natural, internal system. The good news is you don\u2019t need drugs and\nyou can do this naturally, which I\u2019ll tell you about in a minute. Xanax Side-Effects\nSo let\u2019s talk about the negatives. These type of drugs are \u201cdowners\u201d and\nhave the usual side effects of feeling tired and drowsy. However, they have lots of other negative\nproblems that people don\u2019t usually know about, such as Sleep problems and insomnia. Which makes no sense, since you\u2019d think\nyou\u2019re tired all the time and you could fall asleep at night, but after a few weeks,\nthe opposite happens because of neurological changes\nFeeling unmotivated and depressed - Xanax and similar drugs are in fact, a \u201cdepressant\u201d\nThe irony is that some doctors prescribe Xanax to people who have depression, ultimately\nmaking things much worse. Loss of sex drive for women and men, plus\nimpotence and erectile problems for men Muscle loss and fat gain. Memory loss and a 50% increased risk for Dementia\n- yup, you\u2019re killing your brain with these drugs\nDying prematurely by 400% - This is the scariest of all, 4x higher risk of dying early and\ngetting certain cancers. And of course, Xanax and similar benzo drugs\nare HIGHLY addictive and thus, it\u2019s extremely difficult to get off of them. They are both physically AND emotionally addictive. If you ever want to stop using them, please\ndo NOT do it \u201ccold-turkey\u201d or abruptly. It must be done VERY slowly and gradually. People have even committed suicide getting\noff of such drugs too quickly because of the intense anxiety and panic attacks due to the\n\u201cnegative rebound\u201d effect. You\u2019ll also need to make changes in your\nlife-style as well - diet, exercise, stress management, supplements and so forth. And I\u2019ll tell you how in a minute\nMy Experience With Xanax However, I wanted to share with you my own\nexperience with Xanax. For those of you who know me or have seen\nmy videos, you\u2019ve heard me say that I\u2019ve never been a good sleeper, even as a child. I\u2019m a light sleeper. Any little thing wakes me up. Plus, my mind is always racing and thinking. I\u2019m either excited about something or trying\nto figure out a solution to a problem. So anyway, it was over 20 years ago and I\nhadn\u2019t had a good night sleep for at least a couple of days. My girlfriend at the time then told me to\ntake a Xanax, because that\u2019s what she takes when she can\u2019t sleep. She said it\u2019ll just relax me and calm my\nmind, so I can sleep. I had never taken it and I didn\u2019t want to. But I had a super busy week and I figured,\n\u201cokay, I\u2019ll do it just this ONE time\u201d She gave me a pill, but I only took half the\ndose - I think it was 0.25 mg. The smallest dose you can take. And I ended up having the best night\u2019s sleep,\njust like a baby. It was amazing. To make a long story short, I started using\nXanax once in a while. Then it was more and more often. Next thing you know, I was using it at least\n3-4x weekly to sleep. But, it wasn\u2019t working like it used to,\nso I had to increase the dose. And the nights I didn\u2019t take it, I barely\nslept and had horrible insomnia. Thus, I was now addicted to Xanax. I could tell my brain chemistry was changing. To make matters worse, I was also very unmotivated. No excitement. No enthusiasm. I wasn\u2019t depressed, but I wasn\u2019t happy\neither. I didn\u2019t want to do anything or go anywhere\nor talk to anybody\u2026. Unless I HAD to Everything started to suffer - my relationships,\nwork, school and the gym. I was getting weaker, smaller and fatter. As much as I didn\u2019t want to, I knew I HAD\nto get off Xanax. The next few months were horrible. Even though I slowly got off the drug, I still\nhad side-effects and withdrawals. I started to actually have anxiety throughout\nthe day. Any little thing stressed me out. I was also very moody. And of course, my sleep was horrible - worse\nthan ever. So I did research to see how I can fix things\nquicker and get back to normal\u2026 and in the process, I learned a lot. The first is I made some big life-style changes. I exercised during different times of day... I started eating different foods and taking\nvarious supplements -- all of which quickly improved my neurotransmitters, neurons and\nbrain chemicals and helped fix everything the Xanax broke. Over the next few months, things went back\nto normal. I felt happy and motivated again, my body\nimproved, my memory was good and this time, I figured out how to also improve my sleep,\nnaturally. What I Learned The bottom line is that most people can make\ndramatic improvements in their anxiety, feel more relaxed and happy, if you make some simple\nand easy modifications in your life. Most people do NOT need such addictive drugs. And NOBODY should be taking them long-term. Which is what I want to discuss in my next\nvideo -- how to naturally reduce and avoid anxiety and similar feelings - WITHOUT drugs. You can access to this next video by clicking\nthe link below in the description area. So if you are thinking about taking Xanax\nor similar \u201cbenzo\u201d drugs... or are currently using it and want to stop, check out the next\nvideo about natural and proven approaches for relieving anxiety, feeling more confident\nand getting a good night\u2019s sleep.", "IGug7E8Li9M": "ma'am I don't know why Sandman so well what's the deal with the edibles [Music] good stop to wear these masks

"DZa6mGbEK4E": "[Intro music]\nNarrator: Origin House is a California-based cannabis products and brands company operating\nacross the US and Canada. Origin House\u2019s brand development platform\nis operated out of five licensed facilities located across California, and provides distribution,\nmanufacturing, cultivation and marketing services for its brand partners. The company is developing infrastructure to\nsupport the proliferation of its brands internationally, including through its acquisition of Canadian\nretailer, 180 Smoke. Origin House\u2019s shares trade on the Canadian\nSecurities Exchange under the symbol OH. James West: I\u2019m joined now by Marc Lustig,\nwho is the CEO and founder of Origin House, which trades on the CSE under the symbol OH. Marc, welcome back. Marc Lustig: Thanks for having me. James West: Marc, you originally founded CannaRoyalty\nCorp. as a company that was deploying capital into various opportunities in Canada initially\nand then the United States, and you morphed this story so many times that even though\nI talk to you on a regular basis in the context of this show, I always have to refresh my\nmemory of what the company is today, because you keep making these moves. Now today, you\u2019ve announced this combination\nwith Cresco Labs, who\u2019s going to acquire you in an all-stock transaction? Marc Lustig: That\u2019s correct. James West: And it was at a 30 percent premium\nto market of the 30-day VWAP, you were saying? Marc Lustig: 25 percent. James West: 25 percent. So basically, a win for everybody involved? Marc Lustig: Everyone should be very happy;\nprobably most importantly, they should be happy from this day forward, because of the\ncombination of those two companies. James West: Sure. Okay, now, what is the compelling logic to\ncombine the two companies? Marc Lustig: It really, first and foremost,\nhas to do with strategy and management philosophy. So you know, to answer your first question,\nI built, with a great team around me, a company that became Origin House, which was the largest\ndistributor of branded products for the California market. And then we bought 180 Smoke as a way to give\nour shareholders and ourselves access to the Canadian market in a lot more different way\nthan the Canadian licensed producer has gotten that footprint. And so, we were very careful and very disciplined\nto stay focused on distribution and manufacturing of brands. Now every company wants to be in the brands\ngame, but lucky for us, we were there early \u2013 in California, which is a real market\nwhere we\u2019ve been there, and we\u2019ve spoken about this quite a bit \u2013 you have real competition,\nand you have customers who are sophisticated and they compete on things like quality and\nprice and durability and access to those products. And so it was a great breeding ground for\nthe company that we built. And the next part of our strategy was going\nto be, how do we expand into other states? Because we had built what we thought was a\nvery solid platform in California, and we had been looking at our expansion plans into\nother states, and that\u2019s when we met with Cresco. And to us, Cresco has built this phenomenal\nnetwork of licenses and vertically integrated operations in key states, including Ohio and\nPennsylvania and Illinois and Michigan and Florida and Arizona. So we had always wrestled with this idea of\nhow we expand, and we met the perfect partner who shares our philosophy regarding the importance\nof branded products and distribution. James West: So you\u2019ve known Cresco management\nfor quite some time, then. Marc Lustig: A couple of quarters. James West: A couple of quarters. Interesting. Does this change anything in terms of, Cresco\nwas primarily involved in the medical side, originally, if I\u2019m not mistake. So now it has evolved into a multi-state operator. So is the acquisition of Origin House by Cresco\nan incremental step in a \u2013 or part of the execution of a larger strategy? Or is kind of like an achieved long-term goal\nof theirs where now they can sit back, rest on their laurels a bit and grow organically? Marc Lustig: I would say that is comes back\nto the importance of California. So they had excellent assets, or have excellent\nassets, in a wide variety of very important states, including Massachusetts, which is\na rec market. So even though Illinois is a medical market,\nthat\u2019s where they started, that\u2019s where they\u2019re from \u2013 the company is headquartered\nin Chicago \u2013 they did start to branch out into recreational markets like Michigan and\nMassachusetts. But I would say their interest in Origin House\nfocused around the state of California, and they wanted to be in California. They wanted Cresco brands to have access to\nthe California market. So now we\u2019re starting to get into the very\nspecifics of why this transaction makes so much sense, you\u2019ve got our branded products\nand our brand partners who want access to other states, that can now be achieved by\nour relationship with Cresco; and you have Cresco, which wanted their branded products\nin California, and that was one of the key states that they didn\u2019t have access to. And so that\u2019s where the synergies are going\nto be coming from. James West: Right. That makes perfect sense. Great. So what are you going to do, now? Marc Lustig: I\u2019m joining the Board of Cresco. I\u2019m going to be on the senior management\nteam, and you know, obviously we announced this transaction this morning; I\u2019ve been\nasked all day about, you know, what I do now with my stock, and how do I look at this after\nhow well the Origin House story has gone. And I honestly believe that my wealth creation\nand the shareholders of Origin House, the most exciting part of our transition happens\nright now. Like, I think there\u2019s more upside from here\nthan when we started this, you know, even though the stock went public at 2 and closed\non Friday at 12. And this transaction is around that level. So I honestly believe that from here, we could\nbecome the most valuable cannabis company. James West: Interesting. So the consolidation impetus in the market\ngenerally, I mean, especially in the United States \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of people who think,\noh, well, there\u2019s, you know, a limited interest in consolidation while there\u2019s still this\nsort of ban on inter-state commerce in cannabis. But would you say that that is something that\nactually in the process of accelerating rather than seeming to be so sleepy and quiet? Marc Lustig: I mean, look, there\u2019s so many\nthings that you\u2019re touching on that are probably worth your audience hearing. First of all, the reality is that you\u2019ve\nhad an investing public in the United States who didn\u2019t have access to many names to\ninvest in that gave them exposure to US cannabis assets, and that\u2019s why you saw this massive\nflow of capital into Canada to invest in Canadian licensed producers, who were very smartly\npositioned. They started listing on US exchanges, and\nthat was what got capital into those companies, and probably has a big part of the valuations\nof those companies. Lo and behold, in the last six months, and\nthat\u2019s obviously Cresco became a public company in Q4, and so did Acreage, and so\ndid CURA and Harvest and these types of names \u2013 all of a sudden, the US investor said,\nWhat am I doing? Why do I need to invest in a Canadian licensed\nproducer when I\u2019m comfortable investing into a home-grown, so to speak, US-based cannabis\ncompany? And so you know, I think when you look at\nhow much appetite there is in the US investing public for the cannabis sector, and at the\nsame time you look at how few names there are to invest in, that would leave ourselves\nwith Cresco, obviously, and the names that I mentioned \u2013 where have you ever seen demand\nfor equity exposure into an exciting sector like cannabis, with this few names to invest\nin? And so to answer the real question, it\u2019s\nabout scale. So I think that what we looked at on the Origin\nHouse side was, we built a really strong platform in California; how are we going to expand\nto give our shareholders access to a bigger market? And that\u2019s where Cresco just fit perfectly. James West: Wow, wonderful. Cresco is \u2013 does it, I mean, is there any\nchance that Cresco will step into the international arena at some point, should legislation permit? Marc Lustig: I would say that that\u2019s probably\nlater in the plans. The reality is, when you have 11 states the\nsize of what our combined companies have access to, the potential and opportunity is sitting\nright in front of you, so why would you waste one hour or one dollar not, you know, mining\nout the potential in the markets that you have built out? James West: Sure. Okay, so what is the, what does the whole\npackage look like, now? Marc Lustig: The whole package is the largest\nUS footprint of branded and distribution assets in the North American cannabis sector, that\nspans between 11 different US states including Michigan, Massachusetts, Ohio, Pennsylvania,\nIllinois, Arizona, Florida and now California. In addition to Canada; you remember that we\nmade an acquisition of 180 Smoke, which was our way of playing the Canadian cannabis market,\nand I think it\u2019s probably one of the brightest ways to play the Canadian cannabis market\nthat I see, including what we\u2019re starting to do on the cannabis side with 180. And so you\u2019re left with a footprint that\nspans the US and Canada, has now a combined market cap of 5 billion. If you compare that to a number of large Canadian\nlicensed producers, who have market caps that are 3, 4, 5 X our valuation and only have\naccess to Canada and may have a supply agreement to Germany, but are probably very excited\nto get into the US market, we like how that stacks up for our investors. James West: Sure, you bet. All right, Marc, let\u2019s leave it there. Congratulations on the transaction, and we\u2019ll\nlook forward to following the development of Cresco going forward.", "RoSb5LgZ73o": "hey what's good everybody jay ping here checking in

in trichomes though wow oh man yeah these are going to be two different smoking experiences that is for sure but that's what's cool about cannabis is that the tripping profiles they always are different you can get the same strain you can get similar terps you can get similar profiles but again they're just not going to be the same today we're using napalm cannabis premium rolling papers big shout out to napalm flower bomb recently dropped here we go here we go i'm excited man i've been looking forward to smoking this peaks exotics but looking forward to smoking this man here we go the buds light green over here when broken down there's a good scent there's good trichome coverage i can see the keep down here it's gonna be good man this is gonna be solid just got to make sure it's going to be actually smooth and creamy and that's really all we got to worry about is is the weed going to taste like how it dry hits is it going to taste like how how these strains have smoked in the past here we go all right you guys ready all right first light here we go push this down a little bit here all right all right you guys be good time to like follow and subscribe to respect my region first taste test this is the lotto from peaks here we go oh wow definitely get that doughy gas that's for sure okay so we're gonna marinate on this for a second i'm gonna hit it once talk about it two hits score out of ten three hits give you guys a score out of a hundred here we go it's pungent it's got this doughy creamy pineness to it it's really not like a gelato that i've had because of how piney it is it's really burning my nostrils on the terps on that i really like it taste test on the taste test for this do lotto this is a this is a no brainer this is a nine to nine flat on the taste test nine flat you want more of that gelato in there but it really comes through on the on the doughy pine like that is without a doubt so if you went into this thinking it was going to be a gelato which part of it is because it says do lotto you know that's the slight disappointment i wanted a little bit more of that creamy guess but for right now you get creamy pine which in its own right is [ __ ] fire so big shout out to them let me hit this a couple more times real quick okay okay overall score i'm gonna give this a 92.5 why did my score go up the high i'm energetic i'm kind of [ __ ] up already off of this first hit it's not necessarily making me slow or lethargic it's just making it kind of hard to concentrate and that's one thing that's cool about cannabis sometimes is that it can take the edge off in a way that can help you concentrate or ruin that concentration and so it's been a little bit hard to stay focused throughout this review but 92.5 is where i'm at because it's potent it's definitely potent when you think of the potency on this we're looking at 36.86 total cannabinoids total thc at 30.07 so the reason why is because this is actually very high potent weed so big shout out to the dollato trying to get every extra smoking while i can it's delicious all right so i put it out and we'll let this smoke over here let me get over here to the marathon so i wanted the gelato and peaks to go up against the marathon cultivation because here in the valley these guys are known for cultivating some of the best candidates offering some of the best stuff i mean i'm a big nipsy fan so it's really a no-brainer for me to try this but when you look at the instagram and the people who co-sign the quality of this flower it's there it's justified we've got to figure out if it's worth the price point they sell hundred dollar eights of marathon cultivation in there they sell 60 race they sell 35 race they sell a variety of quality cannabis at canner harbor i'm sorry at cana farms in canoga park so here we go let me get this rolled up this is the kiwi strawberry gelato there we go all right boom boom all right i'm getting so much better at rolling joints big shout out to jazzasaurus y'all big shout out to mama pig here we go on the ones and twos like follow subscribers fake my region marijuana madness versus this is the marathon cultivation versus peaks here we go oh jesus the gelato's crazy 92.5 overall nine flat on the taste test holy [ __ ] this is [ __ ] incredible the taste wow this is some of the best gelato i've ever smoked no questions asked this is more of the the dough strain than it is the lotto this is more [ __ ] electric gelato than anything all right one hit we already did it taste test what's the score um there's no terpene profile on this that doesn't impact the taste uh taste on this gelato i'd like a little bit more of the kiwi strawberry whatever that might mean but this is fruity it's gassy it's creamy it's making my saliva come up i'm going to give this a 97.5 9.75 out of 100 the only thing i take away from it is i don't know if what kiwi strawberry what's the cross what's the flavor i just really got electric flavored gelato i just got super pungent gelato not on the heavy side more on like the wow side um overall score overall score i'm going to give them a 98 out of 100. normally i would dock more points for the terpene profile not being listed and i would drop a full 0.25 or in this case 2.5 but this is just so freaking good that i'm going to take away a half of that normal normal uh uh taking it away and i'm going to give it a 98 out of 100. i still want to see the terpene profile the best weed in the state all needs chirping profile i feel like the state should just make it a standard to put terps and the rest of [ __ ] on there so uh but because of that 98 out of 100 9.75 on the taste test and then on terms of the dollato nine flat 92.5 overall so today's competition the kiwi strawberry gelato does beat the peaks but if you were to ask me which one you should buy support the small business and support nipsey his family and the entire team behind marathon if you can afford both buy both this was 46.75 plus tax in long poke this was i believe 60 bucks plus tax and so some real rapper weed [ __ ] some real fire [ __ ] [ __ ] some real also fire [ __ ] [ __ ] not necessarily that rapper weed hype to it but when it comes to i believe this is a social equity company this is exotic i believe it's growing in the bay it doesn't get much better than that so be sure to check that out j ping here coming at you guys live man respect my region marijuana madness marathon cultivation versus peaks big shout out to marathon cultivation let me know what you guys think in the comments and i'll see you guys on the next review i love you all peace", "_pg1lPaeQaA": "in your words tell me about the very basic difference of ingesting marijuana via and edible versus smoking or vaporizing it sure so so the first thing is your body deals with cannabis very differently when it's ingested it if you're eating something it's actually processed by the GI tract and processed by the liver it changes from Delta 9 THC to hydroxy 11 which is more potent and the biggest thing is that takes time right we when we drink wine with a meal we don't get drunk like that right we let it kind of prickly and enjoy the experience so edibles are very similar when consumed there's other uptake or delivery systems right your oral mucosa is a very efficient delivery system our mints for example are dissolved in the mouth or tinctures right go under the tongue those are quicker one of the hardest things about edibles is the delay and getting consumers to understand that you have to be patient we are not a patient people so there is a learning curve there right education we have to talk about it we have to talk to tourists we have to be able to have a dialogue and not be afraid to ask questions especially because if we do have history with marijuana maybe smoking marijuana it's kind of an instant gratification thing we know if we're at a six or even an eighth about five minutes in edibles it can be anywhere from what an hour maybe sometimes more than two yeah so the the state language is this will this product may be delayed by two or more hours what we see is depending on the product type really you're looking at 30 minutes to an hour and a half depending on a lot of things right are you eating an edible and then putting a meal right on top of that that will get the THC into your system much faster than if you eat a meal and then take something that is a slower process the state changed some of its regulations regarding labeling just earlier this year on February 1st and and and part of that was being more explicit about this could take more than two hours but I know before you guys were before that regulation took place the Dixie had some really creative activation illustration on the back of its products and and I'm wondering have you guys tweaked those since the states regulations have kind of caught up with you guys on that level yeah you know we always continue to tweak those as we get feedback on on how long products are taking to affect someone we will adjust our barometer right it's a strength time scale and one of the things we believe really strongly is we can have a whole paragraph of warnings that no one's going to read or we can make a visual icon that someone's going to see and get information from quicker so when we say that a serving size is 7 milligrams or 10 milligrams and we'll take 60 minutes that is a easier way for a consumer to understand faster what they need to do and and everything we do on our labels as much as possible is to get consumers to understand how to take that product and how to dose that product", "C9fi2Qrg0ps": "I am dr. Faber and I wanted to discuss the medication treatments for anxiety in children adolescents and adults in general these categories of medications include the serotonin reuptake inhibitors some medications such as Prozac zoloft celexa lexapro paxil luvox a second type of medication is called buspar or buspirone and then the third category includes what we refer to as the benzodiazepine medications these medications include xanax klonopin valium now in general with children and adolescents we are not in a big hurry to consider the use of the benzodiazepines these medications will decrease anxiety and if used should be considered very short-term because they can also cause disinhibition in younger people so we're very cautious in their use and generally teens with let's say severe panic disorder were intense separation anxiety and younger kids were excessive worried we might consider maybe very very low dose klonopin or maybe xanax out of it is another type of benzodiazepine but as I said this category medication is used very conservatively in young people in adults it's not unusual to consider the use of either klonopin ativan or maybe xanax for brief use until a secondary medication begins to work so it would not be unusual to give a benzodiazepine medicine with a serotonin reuptake inhibitor and as the SSRI begins to take effect usually within 2 to 6 weeks then the benzodiazepine can be lowered and discontinued now in regard to the SSRIs they are multiple types they include lexapro which is among the newer of the SSRIs lexapro has a dose range generally 10 to 20 milligrams and adults lower dose range to start in younger people it's fda-approved age 12 and above lexapro may cause some sleepiness or fatigue and so considering giving lexapro in the evening would not be unusual the second would be Prozac prozac is FDA approved in children as young as age 7 and has been used to treat OCD and even depression prozac has a longer duration than a medication like lexapro and it does not typically cause fatigue it's generally given in the morning and it may even cause a little bit of activation or increased energy next is Zoloft and zoloft is fda approved to be given as young as age 6 for OCD and is used in older kids and adults for anxiety and depression and zoloft has a little more stomach upset a little more of the GI side effects than the other SSRIs then we have paxil which we don't tend to use with children but may be used in adults paxil tends to cause more sleepiness more weight gain and it's a very short duration of action and a lot of drug interaction too and then there is a luvox which is used primarily for OCD and has been used in children adolescents and adults it has a fair amount of drug-to-drug interaction as well at a broad dose range so these are the SSRIs what they share in terms of side-effects are early on our headache stomach upset a little extra energy maybe some sleep related difficulties they differ based on drug interactions so paxil and Prozac have more drug interaction and duration of action or half-life paxil is a very short halflife prozac has a very long half-life Zoloft and lexapro and celexa are more intermediate in their half-lives and so the SSRIs can be used and indeed have often been used along with cognitive behavioral therapy to treat the various types of anxiety whether it be social anxiety generalized anxiety panic disorder or OCD now buspar is neither a benzodiazepine nor an SSRI buspar where buspirone is fda approved for treating generalized anxiety disorder so for a person who tends to dwell or feel tense on edge headaches stomachaches buspar may be affective buspar can also be added to an SSRI to potentially increase the effectiveness of the SSRI for example with OCD work generalized anxiety were in fact in the treatment of depression so buspar does have a restricted but a possible role and so the anti-anxiety type medications are the SSRIs buspar and the benzodiazepines thank you", "GsVkFM_uRNU": "what's up guys budget baller here with another one take review uh that's my radio voice budget baller one tank review uh this is another three cheap project uh product this is the 3g delta 8 thc 300 milligrams in the bottle that means it's 10 milligrams of delta 8 per dropper you get a dropper with this if you don't know what delta eight thc is or three cheap brand um i did a bigger review or explanation in my three tree oh three tree review of the gummies uh but if you want a quick explanation 3g or delta 8 thc which is uh what they're really touting here is the little brother to delta 9 which is marijuana the marijuana you would normally smoke but the 3t delta 8 thc uh is currently federally legal meaning you can buy here in the united states legally this retails for 29.99 like i said it's 300 milligrams to delta 8 thc compared to the uh 25 milligrams each 16 grummies per pack 400 milligram gummies this also contains uh some cbn which is supposed to give you a more relaxed feeling than the gummies uh terpenes which will give it a plant taste uh but how does this stack up compared to the gummies i've tried both like i said check out my review on the delta 8 thc gummies i've taken this for a while now i put it right under my tongue you can also put in dropper i heard you can mix it with food as well too it's what is called a tincture uh it comes with its own mct carrier oil which uh if you don't know real quick it just comes with a uh like a catalyst to help speed up into your body uh that said it still takes uh where this takes about the gummies take about one to two hours i notice things um about two to three hours with this last about five six hours uh the difference in the feelings between this um the gummies i love they give you a nice relaxed feeling but you're still like aware you're still feeling good in some cases a lot of cases actually it gives you some energy gives you a little go relaxed energy that's real nice that people enjoy especially during the day uh the tincture i will tell you because of its mixture of cbn and other um cbds including uh the delta a thc it's gonna it's gonna knock you out a little bit more so if you're looking for a relaxed but still kind of wear aware feeling uh definitely check out the gummies if you want something at night to help calm you down kind of soothe you but still give you that nice you know relaxed kind of high feeling without the head high because the gummies and the tincture both give you that high without you know feeling real head high or you know the psychoactive properties uh the tincture is better at night i use a drop it says it's only 10 milligram compared to 25 with a gummy but 10 milligrams of that tincture under your tongue it gives you more i think a more uh heavier experience especially mixed with the the cbn and the other stuff in there all together that one that's the one you would take at night uh actually the gummies help just as much or the gummies help very well but these are a little bit more for the people that want to get a little bit of sleep maybe having trouble sleeping at night that's what i would recommend this for once again 29.99 you can get it amazon.com or you can check out your local cbd shop you know they won't have it up but if you go hey man you got that 3g they may hook you up who knows obviously although all they can do is say no and this is why it's a one take review because i'm going because it's getting late uh one note about this it is made to put under the ton it is made to put a drink i heard you can put in food it is not made to be put in a vape and smoked i don't know if you can i know it very clearly boldly says do not do this so i would say do not do that

sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking a look at another drink Dixie elixir that's hard to read as Dixie there di xi\u00e8 elixir there are half and half lemonade NT th C infuse 100 milligrams so I reviewed a lot of drinks here on wheats and I find them to be pretty good there's some really great ones out there cannabis quenchers awesome Jasper's amazing there of course some Dead's out there but on the whole I do like the drinks so I'm really looking forward to this Dixie elixir half and a half a pretty cool little bottle here it's got a wrapper on the outside I kind of like the idea is that the cap there at the top if you want a dose the cap is designed to help you dose appropriately helps you decide like you know oh what's 10 milliliters blah blah blah blah blah what's it what's a dose of course we're going to ignore that and just drink the whole bottle in terms of half and half I love me some Arnold Palmer's which is what a half lemonade half iced tea is love love love them so I'm hoping like this the drinks in terms of taste are all over the map sometimes they're really bad like as Aspen but that means they can produce excellent rewards like zest and sometimes they're not too bad but they often have this really bitter aftertaste and I find that to be pretty often the case with the drinks I'm having trouble getting it off which is you know par for the course for me we're almost there keep peeling this plastic layer off until we eventually get to the goods oh boy there she goes okay there she is all defrocked there's a little cap that you can pour it in so on the back we've got our ingredients and our nutrition information I sadly don't see any lab and testing results but that's okay we're gonna hope that it has 100 milligrams in here it says shake gently before consuming which is what we shall do I assume this opens like a childproof lid it does handsome looking bottle there down the hatch hmm it's okay definite cannabis taste to it more tea than lemonade taste it's not too bad um it's only eight and a half ounces so I'll be done with it in no time again there is a slight cannabis taste to it it's not as bitter as the cannabis quench reserves ASP but but it is there so if you really hate that cannabis taste you might want to pass on this one but for me I'm uh I'm I'm I'm David it's again it's not as bitter as some of the the other brands out there hopefully it means it's still gonna be nice and strong so guys I'm gonna finish this off and then I'm gonna come back to you in two hours like all of our reviews to let you know how this Dixie elixir has landed thanks for watching weeds guys and I will see you in just a bit peace [Music] Dixie elixir half and half and it's pretty good it is in the oh it got me to about a six I'm about a six right now 400 milligram edible that's not bad and one that only costs eleven bucks which I think I neglected to mention the first half I'm pretty pleased with it the taste was good for a drink it wasn't outstanding tasting and it didn't get me crazy high but overall it's a pretty good little product one that I'm pleased with if you pick if you see it at a dispensary near you and you're looking for a drink and they don't and you don't want to get completely [ __ ] up the Dixie elixir might be the product for you I think I might try another one in the future see how it goes for me but overall this is a it's gonna give them my own thumbs up for me not a not a ringing endorsement but but far from uh from a negative review so uh that's gonna do it for this review here guys a nice short and sweet one but before I go and share with you a little cherry on top something I can share with you guys that isn't necessarily we'd really did something I just love that I want to express to you guys and hopefully you will dig as well and this week uh it is going to be Silicon Valley yay there's a little Dinesh in a little guilfoyle now normally I'm very much against these little pop vinyls I think that's what they're called these things just seem like capitalism gone amok but well here becomes capitalism run amuck I think I got in flight two for $5.00 at Gamestop and I was like well III have to have a Dinesh and Gilfoyle so Silicon Valley uh-huh on HBO great great show by the legendary Mike judge of beavis and butthead and king of the hill and office space the movie so it's a great show about that Lampoon's Silicon Valley and I just culture hysterical in its fifth season right now on HBO check it out if you haven't I'm sure you've heard about it from people other than just me and that guys is gonna do it from the cherry on top and that's gonna do it for this review here on wheat thank you so much for sticking around to the very end guys and we will see you on the next review peace", "QzNOv2i_Q-w": "twenty thousand five hundred and thirty seven calories in five days oddly enough I started sweating for my kneecaps which I didn't even know they were like

cord to the brain which interprets the signal as pain Susan understands the pain means she needs to go to the hospital and her body is equipped for survival helping her not to panic so she can seek help many of her neurons are covered in proteins called opioid receptors these receptors act like a brake to slow down the neurons ability to send pain signals when injured her body releases natural painkillers called endorphins like a key in a lock endorphins activate opioid receptors slowing down the pain signal and preventing a panic Susan gets treated for the broken bone but three months later her arm still hurts and now that pain is making her feel depressed and anxious so her doctor prescribes an opioid painkiller there are many different opioids but they all share a chemical similarity to our own endorphins this allows them to bind to the same opioid receptors and stop pain signals but that's not all they do deep inside Susan's brain is a region called the ventral tegmental area or VTA for short the VTA is full of neurons that produce a chemical called dopamine when something good happens dopamine is released giving Susan a feeling of pleasure this helps teach her brain to keep seeking out good things to keep dopamine neurons in check inhibitory thoughts keep the brakes on until something good comes along just like the payment days neurons are covered in opioid receptors when Susan takes the painkiller prescribed by her doctor the opioid receptors turn off the rush of dopamine temporarily eliminates Susan's depression and anxiety and she feels relief calmness and even euphoria as Susan continues to take the painkillers her brain responds by trying to regain its balance her inhibitory neurons work extra hard even when the receptors are activated and it becomes harder and harder for her dopamine neurons to release dopamine Susan finds that she needs to increase her dose of painkillers in order to feel comfortable this is called tolerance eventually Susan's pills run out inhibitory neurons over her let loose clamping down on the dopamine neurons and shutting them out almost completely now not only is Susan in pain but the depression and anxiety come back on top of that Susan feels ravaged by an inescapable physical sickness far worse than any flu Susan's body is going through withdrawal most people who take opioids for a long time tend to experience some withdrawal but they can still stop taking the pills and return to normal but for people like Susan it's not so easy for genetics in the environment she grew up in put her at a higher risk for addiction her withdrawal symptoms aren't just unpleasant they're unbearable Susan thinks the only way to feel normal is to find more opioids and this is how the cycle of opioid addiction emerges driven by a brain trying to regain its balance but there is hope for Susan though the road to recovery can be challenging and there may be setbacks treatments can retrain Susan's brain with the help of medication and therapy Susan finds pleasure in her life once again [Music] you you [Music]", "T2fy2K6YQFw": "lutely so we were one of the initial applicants for the Illinois medical marijuana program we were awarded three licenses and yet we've been operating for a little over a year now we launched our cultivation facilities a year ago in November we had our first sales roughly a year ago in January so yeah we've just been carving out our brand in niche years in the last 12 months you know metered expansion growing with as the patient counts increase so yeah we've been really fortunate to have a good experience in Illinois so far did you know right away how much product you wanted to develop or what kind of strains of the material of the product you wanted to send out we are able to piggyback off of existing markets with respect to you know patient usage numbers so how much cannabis a typical average patient is going to use and as well as strain mix that a medical base or a program would take advantage of so you have multiple cultivars that have medicinal properties that are different from each other that way for a particular patient who might have a qualifying condition they have several options to be able to choose from for their particular treatment the the RMD as far as a manufacturing standpoint is typically at the facility so if it's going to be a flower product we're going to test how long we would need to cure that product for it to have the best quality if it's going to be an edible for example the kitchen is going to turn out that edible product we're going to do a shelf study on it four to four to six weeks make sure that when we finally release that product to the market that it's something that people are going to want to take advantage of from a marketing standpoint from a sales standpoint that's more of our corporate operations so we have an entire corporate team that will go through they communicate with the dispensaries themselves they take the orders they do some patient outreach and partner with the retail side to make sure that what we're doing on the manufacturing side aligns with what the market demand really is you know and it's a unique market because we've seen these transitions in other states but a good comparison would be like an edible based product so that in Illinois currently 60% of total sales are flower so it's just raw flower we also in Illinois have a higher percentage of edible sales than other states do so it might be in the neighborhood of a 15 to 20 percent at best and so you know from that standpoint you know those those do change over time depending on your patient base that our patient base there's a large percentage of female patients or 40 years and over and they really you enjoy those edible products so it is it's a growing process of us kind of understanding what our demographic looks like we have to anticipate what the demographic is going to become from a volume standpoint we know that patients are getting added all the time so we have to do our best to make sure that we're producing products that those patients want and need and we're producing enough of them consistently to make sure that we have supplied for the stores you mentioned female patients depend on - what conditions are being added to the program or certain conditions that have that have more people more patients are gravitating towards the program I think there are certain conditions that you know more people apply to than not you know like like a PTSD would be a good example of someone that you know you don't necessarily have to have military experience or trauma to have a PTSD response and ultimately be qualified for a program if that the condition but you know in general that the restrictions or the requirements on patients can often dictate what kind of patients you end up with so Illinois has by comparison to say a Colorado relatively strict vetting process for an individual patient that they go through a registration process they submit their fingerprints and so by that very nature alone it's going to skew a little to a more mature to a more established patient base compared to say a younger crowd who may not want to take the effort in time to go through that program initially but if they've got that serious condition it just said we tend to see that the the patient population currently is reflective of you know a very protective program of not only the program itself but then also the patient's rights on top of that the both of our indoor facilities as you mentioned one is in Kankakee and one is in Joliet both of those facilities currently cultivate marijuana plants but the Joliet facility currently is our manufacturing facility where we do extraction and we do edible manufacture as well so what our Joliet facility is where all of our product is currently packaged whether its raw flour or if it's taken on the post manufacturing and extracted for its essential oils and either then sold as an oil concentrate or put into a lotion a tincture a gel capsule or an edible so that's the main difference between the two this facility you're in here is solely cultivation and that they will rear and harvest the crops and then will transfer those to our manufacturing facility for further post refinement most notably in production it would be say pesticide restrictions so that as you guys are looking around this facility you essentially have a buffet here for insect tests for plant disease and we're being really restricted in what I can apply for pesticides and fungicides and it's a restriction that is much more strict than compared to any other state in the fact that these plants that you're looking at here that are in this blooming space I can apply nothing whatsoever as far as a foliar pesticide or fungicide other states I would still be able to apply a certain list of chemicals to these particular plants all of that being done without any Studies on the back end to say if I apply a certain agricultural oil to this plant 2 weeks later than if somebody's consuming that or vaporizing it there haven't been any studies to prove that that stay for naught so we know that here in Illinois that I can't spray anything on these plants whatsoever and Jack and his inspectors are here once a week ensuring that all of my pesticide applications for younger plants are logged they're checked on our security footage so I would say with respect to pesticide restrictions and amendment inputs Illinois has got it right they're really taking an extra step and measure that it makes it harder for us it's cultivators like I mentioned that you know common horticulture is going to rely on some chemical applications but we take the steps necessary to make sure that we're functioning under that program and we know that the flower coming out of here doesn't have any of those residual oils be them harmless or not you",

sure yeah so I was in Jamaica and my friends there was like 15 of us got all guys we decided to take brownies one day and like the crew range from guys who smoked weed everyday to guys who had never smoked weed in their entire lives but everyone was no pun intended pot committed to taking these brownies they're like this big I took one we all went to the beach and then like all of us were hit with this ridiculous wave to where everybody was I can't even like astronomically high like I wa I couldn't even cross the street like I was trying to cross the street at this pizza place with my two friends and I couldn't I kept backing up and I can I finally sat down and got food and then we ordered buffalo chicken pizza and I was enjoying it and then my friend said like ma'am I've gotta get out of here like I think like the walls are like coming in and his friend was like a very like he was like the guy who would get so drunk and not feel it like he was like the big type of dude who wouldn't get freaked out and he got freaked out to freak me out then all of a sudden I just woke up and what happened was apparently I woke up on the ground with like ten Jamaicans standing over me and my friend said that my eyes started wrong in the back of my head they thought I was joking they slapped me in the face and I fell off and like I guess essentially having a mini seizure and since then I haven't taken edible it was the only time I've taken edibles and I just have I mean the ruined edibles for me I'm not doing it man it's crazy we went to bed at 4 p.m. that day it was a complete waste

and we've got ninja here a little robbing in the room basically so my son's in Greece so just to move around a bit of a family night where a few drinks got on the live last night but that's why they're here in this review obviously off screen but yeah they're in the studio like they're in studio oh I mean I can't really normally eat that makes through that then one go but again it's an experiment do like sweets but I just have a couple normalling yeah and then I give it to the girls but not the sweets last one here oh if we should look at that one it's ridiculous to my sugar I need

see how interesting this get Sam lots of sugar and now secrets of use got every last bit [ __ ] right mmm well gotta say they went that pretty easy although I do feel like I'm having a real mud sugar rush right now won't run smoothly my sugar on them it seems to be more sugar on them but whether that's where the THC is whether it's infuse sugar or if you sweets I don't know I don't know how to make so some people will accuse the sweets as well as the sugar and some people would just put sugar on it so I don't know I don't know animate I will do once I come up on that because I do really really feel it then it's probably all the way through it I would say yeah as I say I need a dose I need a dose so you have four milligrams Bob's up got sugar all by my side by that guy's normal you see smoking videos to me but you've seen any in video me but I'll say it's a good good cause but suppose if you don't need a lot and you had a pack of those and they're like 50 milligrams a sweet you could probably carry them about stab a couple of sweets at a time and just sort of go along your day we as a nice do it mean put in a hundred milligrams into your body every couple of hours or something like that just gives you that little bit of pain relief and stuff like that I bet so good from that point of view that their portions you don't mean I like the fact they are portion in a way so you can do that I'm still I'm mad I just eat all of them all it won't go basically right long time guys so still on the black cheese but I'm still loving life guys 1190 so please join me peace

you really really soon peace would love guys see you in an hour whoop-whoop", "0L999T92B8k": "[Music] hi it's Barrington Miller from the Canadian Securities Exchange welcome to another edition of hashtag finance today I'm here with Cresco labs and for a first-time we have two people being interviewed Charles back tell the CEO and Joe Celt obiano the president welcome to the show thanks Barrington great to be here thank you tell us a little bit about Cresco and normally what I ask people is why did you choose the name Cresco how did it come about Cresco one of the larger u.s. multi-state operators became publicly traded on the Canadian securities exchange back in December of 1811 State footprint vertically integrated operations as I think you you you need to be you better be if you want to be a top three player in the u.s. space at this time but with a primary focus on the the sort of middle to verticals of a value chain which is the creation of branded products and distribution of branded products so the name Cresco came from to grow in Latin I was actually when Charlie and I and our other two partners Rob and Dom started looking at the space we were on a flight out to Colorado to learn a little bit more and visit some grows and and understand and on the way they're back I think we were searching the internet for the names and and came across Cresco so our partner Dom gets credit for the name I don't think we we give them too much credit for that but ya know it's a it's a great name and your approach to you the industry is seems extremely calculated and extremely professional and direct in a good way it looks like you guys are trying to normalize the industry and you've taken it seems your past life in the mortgage space and applied some lessons learned could you expand on that a little bit yeah we both come from regulated mortgage banking it started out in the mortgage industry it wasn't as regulated as maybe it should have been and when your industry is is part of the economic collapse regulation comes flying at you from everywhere the company that myself Charlie and other partner Rob worked at we were in that industry pre collapse during collapse and post collapse and and we realized that by navigating regulation better we were able to help grow a company scale a company and use regulation as a competitive advantage so when Illinois launched its medical program it really felt something similar to what we were used to from an audit standpoint from being transparent with regulators so we were able to navigate that industry and in the state of Illinois very early on and I think it's helped us form the company that you see in front of you tell us a little bit about some of the products that are available and I was listening to your talk yesterday at the GN P event and you have different lines for different experiences and different points of entry in the cannabis space for the end user could you expand on that just a little sure you know so for us even as an organization one of our core values is know your audience and so when you're talking about products your audience for a product is the consumer base the customer and you know when we want our first licenses for the first nine months we weren't a cannabis company we were a construction company you know building three facilities and and in in planning our first crops and harvests and so we we spent that time developing the brand developing the message and you know we were fortunate coming online in a highly regulated compliance focused medical market east of the Mississippi it made us acknowledge the fact that there was likely going to be more than one market segment that would participate in the program and that you couldn't just have you know kind of cannabis buy cannabis people for cannabis people approach to this you were going to have your traditional cannabis customer which is always going to be part of any program but you were definitely gonna have your non-traditional cannabis customer who has never tried never thought they would try cannabis in their life but their oncologist told them it'll help with the nausea from chemo that same person is going to be walking into the same store as the traditional cannabis customer and they're effectively buying the same product they just want it to look and feel very differently than the other the traditional cannabis customer doesn't want to buy anything that looks like Pfizer made it while the new non traditional cannabis customer doesn't want to buy anything that sort of plays to the the stereotypes of the traditional or preconceived sort of stigma of cannabis so for us it was very important to create brands that spoke to each one of those market segments directly and appropriately and that's inform and that's also in in look and feel so packaging and branding there's there were a few people that we've spoken to in the last little bit that was either emphasizing get your brand out or get your distribution channel set which one would you fall into or which one do you believe if I was to start a cannabis company what would you do first I think they're one in the same I think getting your brand in front of people you utilize your own distribution channel to do that so you know you when we look at the cannabis industry there's four verticals there's the cultivation manufacturing side there's the development of branded products there's a distribution of branded products and then there's brick-and-mortar retail Cresco is built in the two middle ones we really focus on the development of those brands but then you need to make sure you have market penetration with those brands and controlling your own destiny nobody will represent your brand better than yourself so it's it's great to have a phenomenal brand and a great brand story but if that brand doesn't get on the shelves of other people's stores you could have the best brand in the world but it's not being seen by the consumer so I think it's it's really important you can't really choose one and that's why our focus and and recent acquisitions like Origin house dove tell very nicely into that of focusing on brands focusing on the development of brands and then making sure that product is on everybody shelf who will let you in that door during your talk yesterday and just continuing with the brand branding you mentioned I think it was Johnny Walker Johnnie Walker Blue or something like that for the the very high end and it seems that one of the things I've learned by interviewing a lot of these companies is they are borrowing from the different sectors borrowing from different places that traditionally worked in now applying it to to the cannabis industry so it seems to be working and 700 700 stores 700 plus stores yeah I think your products are in how did you how do you do that how does you do it a couple of different ways right you you have to have a big geographic footprint you you have to you have to be in the states that that are important that matter you have to have a nice broad availability to deploy your products into different markets so you know we were in 11 states now that was a big goal of ours to make sure that we had a nice geographic footprint that we expanded very strategically those are states that have big populations associated with them - 7 of the 10 most populated states in the US the only three that we're missing don't have cannabis programs so you know it's it's intentional it's by design and then you also you've got to figure out distribution in California and again that sort of where that origin house acquisition comes into play going back to the brand component of it - the other way that you get distribution into that many stores is you do you know for us at least it was that house of brands approach it was it was creating something that could speak to the majority of the market segments the customer bases that would be coming into any of these stores around the country whether it was a very medicinally focused customer or patient to a wellness and lifestyle category - as you mentioned the reserve brand which is you know and a nod to a Johnnie Walker Blue Label for that for the connoisseur customer segments so it's it's having the products available for whatever consumer customer walks through that door that's how you get a big distribution footprint also well you definitely used a big foot to kick in the California door let's talk a bit about the origin house 1.1 billion y origin house how did who asked who to the dance first what tell us a little bit about that because the beginning of April was the industry was kind of shaken in a really good way by that announcement yeah so we met mark Lustig when we were up in Toronto pre going public mark became a friend a trusted advisor you know origin house formerly candle royalty was one of the first if not the first cannabis company listed on the CSC that focused on the US so mark is a pioneer in the space and built a company that went deep into the world's largest cannabis market and that's California so you know getting to know mark over time we we enjoyed talking to him we had a very similar view on the market of developing brands and distributing those brands into the market our view was a little broader we went deep in states like Illinois Pennsylvania Ohio some of the other markets we operate in and mark focused on one single state and really went deep into that California market so you know as businesses develop as we have expectations of becoming the the world's largest cannabis company some day you start looking at strategic M&A transactions that are dynamic and that changed the industry not just planning a flag in some state to say that that you've got one more state under your belt but looking at channels such as distribution and we've talked about developing brands we've talked about distribution but but really focusing on executing on an M&A transaction that shows the world that we're serious about it and improving the company that we are it's bringing on talent from that team it's bringing on people who know distribution in a much more material way than a couple guys who came from the mortgage banking industry it's people who understand that California market which is the most authentic cannabis market and and one of the most difficult ones to navigate it made Cresco a better company you know the thing i would add is at the at the very kind of superficial optic level it's great right it's the largest distributor and the largest in cannabis market in the world but many of the things that joe mentioned are that sort of next level that talent the experience marks capital markets background up here in canada it's the fact that that distribution model was was built and created by former executive from southern wine and spirits you know one of the largest if not the largest liquor and beer distributor in the US so the fundamentals that are there the foundation that's there the technology that's behind it it does it makes our platform better across the country and the other markets that were in that we're doing our own distribution it also you know again focusing on that brand play for us we love the idea you know we don't have to create all of our own brands we want to fill our house of brands with the brands that resonate most with consumers whether we created it or not so being the largest distributor in California is going to give us a wonderful opportunity to work with some really you know incredible new creative brands that develop in California and we can we can provide them an opportunity to take that scale and that distribution on a national level not just California yeah and having someone like Mark who understands the capital markets up here you know he came from GMP background and banking and and understands this is really the the the reason that a lot of companies are able to list on the CSC is because of origin houses early success in this so you know I think a lot of us owe a lot of credit to those pioneering capital market drivers who've put us in the position to be successful so now when we go out and talk to people and industry leaders and and investors having somebody who has that significant experience as it relates to being a good steward of capital for your investors he's an awesome resource to add to our executive team and our board it's one thing about talking with leaders like yourself this whole industry is working together you know for the most part everyone wants everybody else to succeed and everyone is trying to help and push one another and it's a it's just a different vibe than any other sector I've ever interviewed or been a part of we coined it it's competition yeah that's exactly what it is let's let's shift gears a little bit to the farm bill and the states act so I guess who got listed in around the same time that the farm bill came through in December how was that how has that affected you how will it affect you how will it affect your your plans going forward and then we can talk a little bit about the state's art as well take the farm bill you know as it relates to the core business of Creswell labs really didn't it doesn't touch on it right it's right it's dealing with hemp Drive CBD which for the most part we're licensed and we operate in the in the state regulated THC cannabis markets that said what this is sort of changing landscape in that CBD for his festival specifically with regard to hemp derives CBD has created for us as an opportunity to reach a consumer base that either doesn't live in a state that has a legal cannabis program yet or isn't comfortable with the idea of THC as a cannabinoid based product but is willing to try CBD as a first cannabinoid based product for them or if there is still veca you know comfortable there even if they do live in states that have licensed dispensaries maybe they don't want to go into a dispensary they'd like to try something that's available in CVS Walgreens and Whole Foods so then we started looking at it again from the perspective of a very brand focused organization and consumer products focused organization and realize that this opportunity not only to create a CBD based brand called well-beings as the that we're creating but to also bring our portfolio our house of brands that are appropriate like a Cresco like a remedy and like Mindy's and do hemp derived CBD versions of them and now we can get our house of brands the majority of the brands in our house we can get them in front of those consumers today as opposed to when their laws change or when Cresco actually becomes an operator in those states we can get that mindshare today which is pretty incredible if you consider you know I think Cowan estimates this is gonna be an eighty billion dollar industry by 2030 or I think we're about at twelve eleven or twelve billion dollar industry now the next sixty eight billion dollars worth of consumer that's not from current customers consuming more that's from a new consumer base coming in and this gives us a nice cross channel opportunity to introduce ourselves to them today you spoke yesterday about that middle segment so you have the on one side there is people using it patience strictly medical and then on the other side there is strictly recreational and then there's that 80 85 % chunk in the middle where it's a it's a blend did you want to comment on the state's act or me sure yeah and I'd also mention the safe act you know the what what the farm bill did and what the the last election cycle did was gave this opportunity for these bills to start to get called to the floor so now you're seeing bills come up in the house where the opportunity for these representatives to actually vote on something the bills weren't getting called they've been there there's been 50 bills floating around in Congress for quite some time but they never made it to the House floor so now to see a bill like the safe act go through the House committee which would give access to additional banking opportunities traditional banking we've always been able to navigate banking and we've got 20 banking relationships but to be able to start working with multinational banks to participate in the safe act give some additional layers of protection it seems like that bill will navigate through and get passed then you have the safe of the states Act which again will codify the current situation where it gives the states the rights to operate the way that they they can either participate in a canvas program participate in a medical program a recreational program or choose not to but it gives those states that empowerment and it really makes it that federal authority to push it on to the states to say we're okay with it you guys choose your own destiny it seems like that bill has a lot of legs an opportunity to pass it's certainly DC is a very unique place with a lot of different dynamics that that dictate future outcomes but on face value it does seem that it has the support it's just a matter of working through that snake and DC and and seeing what comes out as a finished product but I think what we feel is whether that bill gets done in 2019 or 2020 it's a foregone conclusion that it does get done before the next presidential election in the United States this launches perfectly into the to the next point cannabis legalization subcommittee of Illinois governor elect JB Pritzker has selected you to be on it yeah that was it was a very cool honor to receive you know I think that's it's a culmination of making sure that over the years we've been responsible stewards of regulated cannabis and and good operators and you know one of our fundamental beliefs is that it's it's program and patient or program and customer first in all respects and only if that program is successful can we be a successful operator within it and so the prioritization of making sure that any modifications right you you want to be sitting at that table with the people holding the pen as thinking about how a cannabis program in your state is going to evolve or mature or otherwise change and it was an honor to be asked by a governor-elect at the time to be part of his transition committee and really represent the industry in these discussions and and really it was focused on on restorative justice and safety and communities so it's the social equity component of when a state starts goes from a medical law and starts discussing adult use you can't have that conversation without addressing the social equity social justice issues in that sort of trailing legacy of the war on drugs specifically with with regard to cannabis and you know that was a priority of ours that we really started focusing on as we started to look at states or be involved in states that were starting to talk about adult use about a year ago and so we wanted to be a leader in that space we wanted to think progressively about it and so you know we were able to participate in that committee and not only bring the perspective of an operator but also you know recommend and suggest and launch some initiatives that are gonna ensure that that bill is structured in the way that you know that address the two primary focuses that the governor had in in wanting to pass an adult use law in Illinois which is social equity and social justice and also revenue generation both of those have to be a proper mix to make sure that the legislation gets passed the social equity component at least from my perspective has really left forward in 2019 which i think is just reflective of where the industry is headed as it matures as it grows as it as it acts responsible it's it's such a good thing all around I think some of the states that you know New York hit a roadblock because they didn't address some of that early enough so I think the states that address those topics head-on and put a plan together will ultimately lead to successful transitions from medical programs to adult use one thing we've definitely learned about this industry is it is so sort of malleable right now right which it's at its infancy stages this can be developed however it needs to be developed and I've never seen an industry before that can create so many win-win-win scenarios as opposed to I think most of the things that get batted around at the at the State House or the legislature where you have to have a winner and a loser that's not the case with cannabis cannabis can be developed cannabis laws can be developed in a way that really addresses all of the priorities of the stakeholders involved it's an incredibly unique subject matter it's fascinating well my last question has to do with this term that was literally made up on the spot called the Darwin button and for your competitors peers what do you see the Darwin button being for for the next two three five years there so I would start with you know this this industry is built on regulation generation 2 of cannabis is about regulation and working with regulators regulators don't like getting embarrassed they want you to be transparent with them they want you to be upfront they want you to work with them to develop a better program for them for the patients for the customers for the the tax basis of the state so working with regulators if you try to circumvent regulators I think you run into some some issues I think that's something that can change the dynamic of the landscape quicker than almost anything and you had you'd mentioned it a little bit earlier the you know making sure that you develop meaningful positions in the markets that you're in I think it's going to be important for our peers and anybody else who's looking to establish a national footprint you know it's it's more than just planting the flag you need to be a participant in each one of those markets that you're in because one expectations are going to be there that you do create a meaningful position and to you you want to be sitting at the table as these states start talking about how that program is going to be modified going forward the worst thing I could think of is is having a wonderful medical program that exists that you participate in tacitly and then a modification gets made to it that doesn't address what you would like to see addressed in that in that state so being a participant having a meaningful impact on the markets that you're in I think everybody needs to strive to do that whether that's one state two states twelve states or more you know really being a material participant in each one of these markets well thank you very much for your time this is your host Barrington Miller and this has been another episode of hashtag financed with Cresco labs thank you so much thank you very much thanks for having us hi it's grace from the CSC reminding you to make sure to follow us on social media for the latest updates on our listed companies as well as new listing alerts be sure to pick up our free quarterly magazine public entrepreneur available online at the CSC com [Music]", "H-KD67mwVC0": "so what does 500 milligrams of THC feel like well I can tell you that it doesn't feel good it kind of feels like this okay so it's a little over two weeks ago that I was given ten drops of cannabis oil and the dosage was played down to me and I wasn't sure exactly how many milligrams I was taking it was said that it was diluted and very weak and I was given ten drops and I have never ever taken anything cannabis related in my life so obviously it's gonna hit me harder I wasn't planning to take it I thought the worst that can happen is I'm gonna be extremely relaxed and calm and I haven't really done a lot of research into THC and cannabis oil and the effects on what it does to you so I took the ten drops under my tongue kept it there had a bit of a bitter taste didn't taste much else and then afterwards found out that there was 500 milligrams of THC in those 10 drops so I didn't know if 500 milligrams was a lot or not because I've never really put much research into the actual effects and what the dose is is law when I read online that 500 is extremely high and I was seeing a lot of people there are regular cannabis oil users or THC users I saw how it affected them I thought to myself well I'm either gonna feel weird and go through like a sleepy zombie State or I'm just gonna feel okay so an hour went by I felt okay and I decided to leave the house because I actually forgot that I taken it I carried on swimming and we were doing a whole bunch of things as I was leaving my skin was so hot like it suddenly felt like in that split second I was fine doesn't feel anything in the next second it just hit me and my skin felt so hot like there was a con air blowing on me and it honestly felt like heat a so I went up to it and I faltered and when I put my hand closed it felt like cold air but as I stood back that that air blowing on my skin for that I was on fire I literally felt like I couldn't handle the heat the next thing that happened is just almost like the wall closing in and like tunnel vision and it was just black everywhere except right in front of my eyes and it felt like like like falling or furutaka like you at the top and as you drop it's like that whoop kind of feeling like everything closing in your stomach jumping and I was horrible I felt like whoa something's not right and then I remembered I took ten drops of cannabis oil and I thought to myself okay maybe it's bringing on some anxiety because I've suffered with anxiety attacks and I managed to calm myself down over the years and control it it just got worse and worse and worse my heart rate shot up so high that it I could feel it jumping on my chest now thought okay it's definitely anxiety but my heart the way my heart was going and felt completely different to anxiety so on my very very bad anxiety attacks where I've got rushed to the ER I had a heart rate of 140 beats a minute now if you think about it to put it in perspective your resting heart rate is about 60 beats a minute it can range between 60 to 100 but usually your resting heart rate is about 67 so 140 is for me if I'm boxing or if I am on a treadmill and I'm running or on the elliptical machine or skipping doing those intense things your heart rate is about at 140 so now I imagine being at a resting heart rate and suddenly shoot up to 140 where it feels like you're running on a treadmill and you're out of breath like you you're running that fast but you're not so your breathing doesn't match your heart rate your brain doesn't match your body's activity and everything's just out of synch so that's classic anxiety symptoms I thought to myself I just gotta calm down so much my heart rate shot up to a hundred and seventy two beats a minute now that's the highest I've ever seen it even when I've exercised and when I used to do MMA training my heart rate ever used to go to 172 I think 165 was the max I've ever seen my heart rate I felt like my heart couldn't take it I had this burning sensation through my chest like almost like when the letter s it is building up in your body and you're training hard and you feel like your muscle cannot take the weight if you lifting a little bit too heavy feels like I'm also gonna take I had that same kind of burning feeling in my chest and my heart was racing so fast on top of that I had this funny feeling like it was it was just like my heart couldn't cope with a the beats per minute and I lay on the bed I got managed to get to the bed and I was struggling to speak because my heart was going so crazy that I couldn't get the words out like I was freaking out inside and I was told with it that's the weird thing I didn't feel the effects of the THC besides those physical responses like I was I was going through all of this but in my mind I'm like just relax it's anxiety and even though my heart was that fast I'm like you're just gonna freak yourself out more and I was talking to myself to calm myself down using my diaphragm to breathe and slow my heart rate slow my breathing control everything but it just got worse and worse and worse when I checked my heart rates again and weights up to 180 and it wasn't like a panic attack where it stays high for long and then oops it just stayed constantly a tip from 180 dip down to 172 to 165 and it didn't go below 165 it was between 165 and 172 for about seven hours so even though the HC is considered safe there are extreme cases where there are complications so if your heart rate stays too high for too long you can have a heart attack my blood pressure was extremely high eventually we call the paramedics because I didn't feel like I was gonna make it now I've seen lots of stories of people taking too much and especially if it's their first time they think that they're gonna die and they have anxiety and freaked out I've been through so much anxiety over the years and has so many anxiety attacks where I was rushed to hospital and this fall so different my mind was still there like I was still thinking everything and I honestly felt like I was I was blacking out and my heart was going way too fast and my heart couldn't take it they called the paramedics the paramedics came my heart rate was still extremely high my oxygen saturation was so low because I wasn't breathing properly I was trying to control my breathing so much that I eventually slowed my breathing down so much that I stopped breathing basically they had to stand over me and told me to take deep breaths because I basically lost respiration and I wasn't getting enough oxygen in my body so I made a conscious effort to suck in air but I struggled so much to breathe it's almost like a disconnected feeling and I have read that so that you could become disconnected but you don't know where you are I knew exactly what was happening around me I could feel every single thing I could feel muscles in my face I could feel the inside of my ears I could feel all my muscles I could feel everything it's scary because then you start feeling so lame almost like I couldn't really move much then I would try shake myself like just like the little jerks and jumps to like wake myself up because I could feel like I was slipping away - I don't know passing out or blacking out and the funny thing is in that clip where you see me laying on the bed there my blood pressure was so high it was 190 over a hundred ten I think somewhere there and I thought I had glasses on I'd fought like you know when you put glasses on they're a little bit too tight and you can feel the bands on behind your ears I could feel that and because my blood pressure was so high my veins were so tight there I didn't have two losses on it was just those veins and the whole time I thought I had glasses on because of that feeling my blood pressure was extremely high my heart rate was way too fast and that's lost him for seven hours it's the last longer but off those first seven hours those were the worst so having a heart rate go that fast for that long it can be dangerous and having a blood pressure that high and if it rose higher along with that heart rate is extremely dangerous you could have a stroke you can have a heart attack it's very easy so even though it is a natural compound and there are no reported deaths from cannabis the complications or ever stating and I've never felt that scary in my life through all the anxiety attacks that I had and everything that I've been through with thoracic outlet syndrome that feeling right there was the scariest feeling I've ever had when I had anxiety I used to think that I was gonna die and eventually you know you're not gonna die even though you feel like it with us I just I couldn't control it obviously I take it such a high dose that my mind was only focusing on negative things as much as I was trying to stay positive and talk myself through it and the paramedics actually brought the stretcher they wanted to take me to hospital if my blood patient didn't go down and they stayed with me for a quite a while because I saw such tunnel vision and my blood pressure was so high I think I just like to zoned in I honestly thought that they took so many hours to get there and it felt like it was nighttime reading where in the clip you can see I'm laying there as it's fall early evening I think there was 10 past 6 or so so I was really like out of it I doesn't feel good at all my whole family around me none of them had ever seen me look that bad I didn't see myself making it out of it my heart was feeling so strained it was about three days after that that I still felt like I couldn't do anything because just getting off the bed walking around the house I felt like my heart was pumping so hard like it like it was overused then drained from the day before so it was just like the next week I had no energy I had left so much energy I wasn't myself at all I doesn't feel good I had the worst headache and obviously such a high dosage was way too high for my body to handle and I had no tolerance to it and it wasn't something that I've ever wanted to try or thought to try so it was a stupid decision to even want to try it and that's why I just got to be careful with what you take sometimes doctors will prescribe you medicines and things and they just don't work with your body they react differently and your experiences can be totally different to somebody else so you everyone can be laughing and having a great time and then you are freaking out and having the worst time and just now you get a complication and like I honestly thought that I wasn't gonna make it and it was an exaggeration because when I look back at the footage that I have the way I look in the video freaked out and not looking good at all my heart rate I got felt that and I can still feel that I can think about it and feel that scared feeling that I felt and it wasn't just because I was having some weird experience from the THC it was just it was pure anxiety and pure fear and yeah it's not something that I enjoyed at all I know I should have researched first it was one of us things that happen so fast that you make a stupid decision and it can affect you it was one of those kind of things because I love to research everything down to a tee before I take it when I had my thoracic outlet syndrome when I was on tremor doll I took like three tremor dolls and I threw the Box away because of all the first of all the way it made me feel I fall I couldn't feel like myself didn't take my pain away and all the side effects so I threw it away and cured myself naturally and this was just one of those things where it wasn't planned at all and just happened like in that split second I was like okay let me just take ten drops I mean what 10 drops gonna be and ya had the scariest 7 hours of my life fortunately I came right I eventually managed to stand after seven hours I managed to get up stand I felt horrible and weird and zoned out but I felt a little bit more relieved that I felt like myself I felt like it just slowed down enough to a point where I felt I felt okay and I could I could go home so yeah that's my experience it's a horrible experience now I know there's I've really got so many messages from people all over saying it took too much and if you want the right those who just message me or if you want proper CBD oil with no THC I'm not interested in any of those things I'm not interested in any of those kind of questions telling me that I took way too much because I know it took way too much for myself but this was just something I thought I'd share because there are so many websites that you read and and obviously it's promoted as a safe thing to take and obviously if it's measured properly and in the right dosages then it can be safe and it can be useful for many things but if you're just taking it and you don't have any knowledge about it and you're taking too much like I did it can be scary and it can be dangerous and just now you're taking a higher dose and your body can't handle it and you end up having a heart attack or stroke or something that could have been avoided because you don't know enough so I hope my experience can just hope somebody make the right decision and not just take some research first I have been struggling to train I've been back to training maybe once or twice but because I've been so busy at work I haven't like got myself back into training and making videos on regular basis so I'll get back to making all my podcast series that I was trying to work on before all of this happened I hope this can help somebody and at least make them think before they try something I'll see you guys soon", "JnAR4kX--yU": "[Music] welcome to meddler she projects the show by all things real estate business market and entrepreneurship each show consists myself Matt Lehrer see remember my team and a guest this week the Matt literacy group team member joining us is Joe Rukh Joe how are we doing today doing all right sun's out sun's out yeah that's exciting for you you're how far away are you from becoming an official stale in July 8th July 8th he marries one of my wife's sisters so it's it's coming up here quick and episode 20 is called the growth of marijuana companies with Cresco labs and today we have Joe call to be on ou with us Joe Matt how are you buddy good good to see ya I struggle with your last name I know you still you've done it for years but you get through it yeah outcome is good but it is very deliberate I prefer just Joey see you know Joey see Joey see I think if your name's Joe I like Joey Joey fresco yeah Joey Cresco Brian yeah we're eights I've been Joey rates before and I'm getting into that but Joey rates yes an early nickname so and and we got to know each other because used to be the number one lender in the state pretty much right I chased you around a bunch of ypn of it I kept telling you you should work with me yeah yeah yeah telling me no yeah no until you needed like a condo done correct all of a sudden you were there now that I was your best friend sent me flowers yeah please chocolates yeah yeah and I did 29 warrant herbal condos for you as bailouts and then we actually started to do real business to get correct yeah so it's a very need-based relationship it was yeah it was a need on both sides so so we started working together and then obviously you you you've really big at you know guaranteed rate and then be loan but what made you pivot to moving to Cresco yes so I saw this industry myself and my partner's Rob Samson Charlie Bucket Alan Dom Sergey when cannabis was starting out to kind of go east of the Mississippi right it's always we had a culture in Colorado and California then you started seeing states like Michigan pass a law yeah I looked at it at that time that was probably like 2012 but it was way too unregulated and myself and my partner's we're always looking at other business opportunities and ventures and invested in various things and when Governor Quinn passed the law you know we started to look at this more materially and it was it was the change in how cannabis was going to look in Illinois that got us excited about it it was a regulated format right and what we experienced in the mortgage industry drew a lot of parallels to cannabis the mortgage industry went from an unregulated industry to a hyper regulated industry overnight right well you're basically blamed for the global economics collapse you can imagine that regulation comes flying at you from every which way right cannabis was gonna go from unregulated to hyper regulated very quickly that was exciting for us because we were part of growing guaranteed rate from a few hundred employees to 3,500 employees in the the team and the leadership was able to do that on a state-by-state basis while using regulation as some way to outpace our peers so going from those parallels that was kind of what drew us toward this and the opportunity seemed pretty material so I see I always say that like the people who are the most success for the ones that could see the patterns so you saw the patterns in the past in the mortgage and start seeing the more the patterns gonna be similar in the cannabis yeah we draw a lot of parallels to it and then in addition like on the personal side I had leukemia as a kid yeah so having gone through cancer and being involved in long-term cancer follow-up and a lot of the charity work that you've done I've you know certainly I've received make-a-wish select yeah you guys for doing all that Josie's always been a supporter charity stuff but seeing the lung as I go in for long term cancer follow up at like Northwestern and seeing the evolution of how doctors talk about cannabis of you know from 10 years ago where they would say it really doesn't do much to five years ago when I started getting the space I'm saying a lot of the people in the waiting room were utilizing cannabis to help nausea from chemo seeing these people that I revere right the oncologists who ultimately saved my life yeah start encouraging or at least not not down talking the benefits of it you knew there was some evolution here that was going to happen and I was in the right place at the right time and had great partners yeah to start looking at doing it so so you said there's there's for partners total right so there were four founding partners and then a fifth really came on right as we like the first dollar we ever raised was a gentleman Bryan McCormack and Bryan was very early on and and really as a founder as well so the five of us put the Cresco team together and kind of went and you're all like equal shares or yeah everybody has similar economic as any we can anybody Trump one or the other we all have similar voting authority okay some of us have different amounts of shares at what I'll say is it's it's very similar from that standpoint as with any partnerships you have a lot of puts and takes as I would say yeah we all have kind of equal voting rights and that's got us through to where we are and we've almost everything we've ever done has been a unanimous decision we're did yeah how did how did you come together with with the group of them and are they also in the mortgage business no so Charlie was in the mortgage business with me rob was in the mortgage business with me Dom I actually met through the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society so Dom sergey's been in commercial and industrial real estate development I've been a longtime friend again met through philanthropic activities became very close friends so myself Rob and Charlie came from mortgage Dom came from commercial industrial and then Brian was actually involved in inner workings EKKO Global Logistics Group on and has taken you know been a part of multiple companies going public so it was kind of the early financial brain so to speak of of all of us so we all had unique skills right I came from the sales side Charlie came from the legal background side Rob came from an Operations background Dom came from a real estate side Brian came from operations in a finance side so between all of us we had a pretty good little team put together where did you guys come up with the name krusk oh I think Dom gets credit for it we still go back and forth what happened was when we started to get in this space what we realized very quickly was the fact that we didn't know how to grow cannabis so we needed to find somebody who knew how to grew cannabis like we couldn't read books so we were flying out to Denver to go like interview kind of operating people for the company and flying out there flying back and I don't remember which we were talking about a name and you know you go through all these iterations and it's hard to find a name and then a URL and all that yeah so then you go into like Latin and and all these other languages so Cresco means to grow in Latin huh so there's actually a little background there but yeah Dom came up with with Cresco I wasn't about Crisco when I opened a pizza place gonna be called crust Co I think that was that so um okay so you got involved with this I do kind of feel like oh you know and back in that up like what is your role at the company so like what is your day-to-day like what do you wish it was president of the company I'm responsible for mr. president president yeah we had by the way for our viewers although we had a red carpet rolled in but it just wasn't time for so as president the company my job is revenue generation not really what I focus on so our wholesale team meaning we do the majority of our revenue is b2b transactions uh selling to dispensaries yeah and then we also have retail stores so the b2c transaction right where the consumer interacts so I head up those two teams I'm involved in our capital market so meaning out talking to investors kind of the investor relationship side you know as a board member you're kind of looking at all of the other components of the business but revenue generation is really where my head is at most of the time for the company what do you like more about working in the cannabis industry compared to like the mortgage industry because you were very very influential in the state and in the country overall for mortgage yeah I mean and I love mortgage what I would I know about myself is when I find something I dive in and and you know work as hard as possible at it and try to become an expert in the field and and I feel like I did accomplish that in the mortgage business yeah make no mistake I loved it I loved every minute of it I loved every aspect of where I work throughout my career and and really built the lifestyle that you know I've grown accustomed to so I loved every bit about it what's exciting about this is when you look at a multitude of different things you look at how cannabis is going to interact with all of us yeah in the next 10 years right whether it's a wellness or lifestyle product that helps people sleep better eat better whether it's a play type replacement for that glass of scotch at the end of the day or to create some euphoric feelings or as real money and real industry starts dumping into this the the medical research that can be done there's something to this plant that is fascinating that is helping people with epilepsy cancer all of these things but it's gonna take billions and billions of dollars in research so if you can disrupt the pharmaceutical world if you can disrupt the nutraceutical world you can disrupt the alcohol food and beverage world those are some pretty dynamic things that I've never seen a product yeah that can touch on all of those aspects and you know as Cresco grows you know we started out more on the medical side and now it's really more of a wellness and lifestyle company because what you're seeing is cannabis if you look at this kind of pie chart 10% of the consumer is really trying to work on maybe some true medical thing epilepsy cancer 10% is out there trying to get as euphoric as possible so like truly recreational but 80% is just trying to get a better life right helps them with their aches and pains they want to get off some opiates helps them sleep at the end of the night things like that so it's exciting yeah so what about I mean I kind of feel like cannabis is like and I don't mean this in a bad way because it's gonna sound bacon but I do kind of feel like it's a little bit like the Bitcoin right now right like it's all the rage like everybody's talking about it everybody's you know saying that are the biggest investor in it every I'm not just saying Kruskal but you hear all these other people like will open up dispensaries we're doing this like I'm in the marijuana field right now like it I feel like it's a really hot topic like why do you think that is so a it's come out of nowhere right so you have an industry again that can disrupt all of those components of health care wellness yeah recreational you can start a small business like I think America's built on small businesses yeah the the concept of being able to start a dispensary in an area where yeah you need a little bit of money but you really need hard work grit and an idea isn't easy to start like a dispensary some markets like Colorado you could move out to Colorado and a dispensary license in an unlimited license framework and it's like a store I told me it's a store okay so it's like opening a liquor or in some markets right that's Colorado in Oregon and Washington California's technique and unlimited license market as well it's just then you have local jurisdictions that may say you can't put it here that closer to school or something like there's rules like that but then literally like local townships can say we don't want to participate in the cannabis program so then you've got to turn your sales skills up and lay them on how but so in theory it's it's really the next small businesses that can start when you get into the cultivation manufacturing side and you're building 40,000 square foot buildings and it's you know 15 million dollar project that's a little bit different but a little retail store people can get in so that's exciting the other thing that's it's it's great and unfortunate the same time as many people have had almost everybody will have cancer touch their lives share an unfortunate fact yeah as people are towards end-of-life and and have alternatives of some type of opium based product or opiate based product compared to more of a palliative cannabis situation they've seen people react very well towards end-of-life so they've had some family relationship that has utilized cannabis and had a beneficial impact on that loved one yeah so I think that draws people to that as well so I think a lot of people are fascinated by an up-and-coming industry the actual opportunity to start a business is really cool and then they've got this emotional tie so all those things combined make it a hot topic how many do you is there a lot of like dispensaries and different companies in Illinois like it like there's Chris Cody elder krusk okay so you know what's what's very interesting about Illinois is this was generation 2 of cannabis it was a limited license market and what had to be professional so instead of California or Colorado where it's an unlimited number of licenses the state of Illinois said hey we want a limited number of operators to control the cultivation manufacturing side and we want a limited number of dispensaries and you do that to make sure the controls are in place and you can monitor the program and you can make sure that product isn't getting shipped across state lines and breaking federal laws so a relatively tight framework just like Illinois is done with liquor licenses there's not some unlimited number of liquor licenses there's not some unlimited number of casinos so putting it into a regulatory framework was something Illinois did how many licenses are there and so there's 21 cultivation licenses and 60 dispensaries okay and then with the current bill that's on governor Pritzker's desk or soon to be yeah it will increase the number of dispensaries up to a maximum of 500 okay you'll give opportunities for more people to apply for small businesses there will be craft grows so the opportunity to create grows and actually build out a 5,000 square-foot grow and cultivation and start participating there will be some format of additional licenses whether it's a a kind of a kitchen license so you can make your own products but still under a controlled and regulatory framework which is important that's that's what excites guys like us about this business is the opportunity to create consistent quality products in a market with 13 million people so there's 15 other pretty much competitors there's 21 licenses there's 14 of us that actually hold the licenses okay and what's incredible is our peers here have really helped this this program was hard to start so when it shifted from Governor Quinn to Governor rauner you went from a governor who supported this program to a governor who was not supportive of the program very early on yeah now you have governor Prince Cruz came on and certainly has a much more compassionate approach to cannabis the opportunity from a revenue standpoint all of those other components but we function in this very difficult market in a regulated environment a lot of our peers are the are the powerhouses in the industry as well yeah so a lot of the companies GTI ataraxia pharma can a lot of these are competitors yeah and it's really coopertition so you guys don't like hey it's not like in like in the mortgage in through you guys like hated each other right I know I know but I'm saying like let's say yeah what I will say about this industry is it's one of the only industries I've ever seen where you can create a win-win-win and my partner Charlie talks about that a lot right so there's the opportunity to help the community there's the opportunity to to create jobs there's the opportunity for companies to make money as well so it's okay for companies to make money it's great to be able to help the community the employment the acts in the in the state all of these components and and do the right thing right whether it's addressing social equity issues early on whether it's addressing criminal justice reform and also stewarding the next generation of revenue for this state so it's an exciting answer you don't I don't have to take from somebody else right for us to win we can win alongside a lot of our peers how are you guys like how is your company like growing like in the last like year yeah so at any given time we have about 500 open job postings out there Wow we our team whose phenomenal on the recruiting side we we hired a hundred people last month Wow prior to that we put out a hundred job offers so employees you got right now so we're at 1,100 employees that's so that's up more than double since last year actually it's up I think three times since last year it's a very fast-paced growing industry as we're in 11 states so we've grown our footprint as well as markets are improving like Illinois and Pennsylvania and all these states are improving are you guys like advertising a lot like how do you how are you able to grow so advertising is difficult again it kind of goes back to our mortgage days where advertising is a very unique thing when you advertise in in mortgage or real estate there's there's regulatory labels yeah so not all communications or advertisements all advertisements are communications so when we look at putting out pieces of information we try to educate the consumer did you know cannabis is now available in the state of Illinois that's a very different thing than come by an ounce of cannabis for 99 dollars at X location right so understanding how you position your messaging to the consumers is how we get our brand out there it's a lot different than kind of that come buy something active asking for something but you're able to snag the guy from Nike right yeah so we've we've got I mean what's really exciting is Scott Wilson I rather than Crane yes Scott Scott's had an incredible career he's a big credible amount of design work over the years for again he was at Nike yeah was at his his company minimal does incredible things their office is super cool over in the West Loop you know Xbox 360 and all of these neat things he's running kind of the user experience for us so he's our chief experience officer we've had just incredible talent guys coming from big beverage guys coming from CPG pharmaceutical all all walks of life so that the ability to attract talent to this space is really neat you think it's cuz it's something fun innovative and different and people are kind of like sick of the kind of people if you are at you know Kraft Foods is down 50% over the last few years that's you know like work right like remember in the real estate not everybody was diving into the real estate industry when it was on a decline in 2009 there was in people right now it's it's but growth industries people like to be part of growing things exciting things things that get them excited to come to work every day and that's typically tied to revenue growth or industry growth cannabis fortunately has both of those things where we're growing you know I think we grew 400 percent over last year that's a lot more exciting than an ABN Bev that lost seven percent last year so you know kind of pivoting a little bit like what kind of products and services is this crass go like offer out there so we manufacture about 500 different products okay great and it's about 5,000 different SKUs okay we don't need to go through all 500 yeah so we what we did when we got into this space we developed a house of brands okay and I think that's a big differentiator for us to some of our peers we knew in Illinois we're gonna have two basic consumers we're gonna have a consumer who was comfortable with cannabis it either used it before and then you also were gonna have a little old lady who never thought she'd use cannabis so but her oncologist told her to help her with a nausea from chemo yeah so right out of the gate we developed a house of brands the remedy brand was for that little old lady so to speak it's a non combustible product so it's pills patches salve sprays lotions tinctures inhalers all of those type of products right then we developed the Cresco brand but it didn't play the lowest common denominator right it's not tie-dyed our Jamaican flag or little dancing bears it's professional version of cannabis getting rid of indica hybrid and sativa instead introducing rest rise and refreshed so talking to them about need states then we were fortunate to partner with Mindy Siegel James Beard award-winning pastry chef Killer restaurant hot chocolate over in Bucktown yeah great date place for sure Mindy helped us launch our edibles line called Mindy's kitchen as well as Mindy's artisanal edibles so addressing that edible market but people's experiences were edibles over the years were not great all the time the consistency and quality of the product vary greatly so we knew we could take the same measurement dosing that we put in our pills right put it in the edibles but again just like we didn't know how to grow cannabis none of us knew how to cook so bringing in a phenomenal chef like Mindy who could then flavor those edibles to make the best tasting edible but it also is the most consistent edible out there was excited so you're able to kind of like understand that you know if we're gonna do an edible we got to do it the right consumers in the kitchen right which like Mindy's wins awards and stuff yeah I mean the Mindy's Mindy's is the top-selling edible in Las Vegas like she's won a multitude of Ward she's been on the cover of magazine she's she's an incredible steward for edibles within cannabis and really kick cooking within cannabis so I'm excited to have those type of partnerships and to do it with somebody local is awesome what about like so like drawers I'm assuming like like so I'm a big wine snob I love wine you know like it only French wines right I like I like Napa can you grow that's it yeah but I mean but like you know there's famous like wine growers I follow you know if all mine Instagram and like I buy it like a lot of their stuff I'm assuming like who got you the best bottle of wine you've ever had I will say Josie did the case Amaya like yeah I mean it was it's so I stuck the box of my house yeah yeah thank you for that by the way but I'm assuming there's gonna be at some point like famous growers sure there are some people fall and yeah I'm ignorant to it so is there certain people are you guys trying to target those guys too you know what we've done is we're trying as a company we the goal for Cresco the mission statement is to normalize and professionalize cannabis right so you've certainly had a culture that exists in cannabis for a very very long period of time we're trying to marry that culture along with big agriculture and we're trying to marry that culture with pharmaceutical quality production right so we're trying to bring in people who certainly stand the cannabis plant but also understand that you've got to hit consistent yields and it's not about someone off plant that was the the greatest single piece of bud that has ever been grown right it's can you do it again and can you do it again and can you do it again so that is more our style of bringing in people who came from agriculture backgrounds yeah have have cannabis Brack background as well marrying that into creating this outcome of professional and normalized cannabis I just see it being like some day like we're like you you're branding a grower and people are buying your product cause of it sure there's gonna be like the celebrity growers like you know top-drawer will be a movie or TV show or something right I mean I'm just saying like there's a lot of possibilities we could actually brand more of the stuff to make some more money off for sure MLG will break out back one of the guys perfect I mean are you guys targeting people like that so like you know I would say we're not as celebrity focused on that yet yeah we are more about creating consistent quality outcome but what we're also doing is we launch more brands and our brand team and you mentioned Scott and there's really the rest of our marketing team we'll launch like a Cresco limited brand will partner with either a celebrity talent we'll partner with a unknown grower and there's certainly some out there and there's people that follow them on Instagram there's definitely a culture that exists that won't be the mainstay product yeah but understanding similar to like sneakers and some of those those cultures that have created phenomenons of when somebody launches a shoe you know thank you yeah yeah but like they don't know like you know it's X guys like growing product and Cresco backs you're like yeah I'm only buying cross : yeah you're seeing celebrities jump into it right like I think Seth Rogen's know into the space and I see him and James Franco probably typecast but it kind of seems like I guess one question going back to kind of like this like the barriers to entry like it seems like everyone always has an idea like random random friends of mine are like hey man I have you know a couple hundred bucks let's let's start a wee business do you see that being a problem and like like do you see and like how long will there be just a couple big players that kind of take over the game like a coca-cola or something I think you'll see some consolidation in the industry for sure I think what's exciting is those people can if you have an idea you have this incredible opportunity within this state this country whatever you want to use to move forward with it but it's it's all about bias to action right the idea is like 1% of that overall piece that makes a company go having that biased action and taking that idea and sourcing money and knowing your strengths and your weaknesses surrounding yourselves with better people like if people can do that I am all for them getting in this industry what I get concerned about is bad actors getting in the space people not getting into it for the right reason it's not a cash grab because this industry is incredibly difficult I think similar parallels to real estate like people look at some of these industries as like easy and I've got an idea and I could do this better it's like go and do it I would lie well combate of people dump jumping into this industry it needs more good players it needs more people with good ideas but it needs a bias to action they need to execute on those plans those are the things that need to happen so I welcome it's a growing industry we need more people in it we need better people in it every day but they need to be good actors so the only thing only thing I would say is I get concerned about why people get into it it's not a cash grab like you're going to get get mowed over in this space if you don't have a plan and know your strengths and weaknesses and understand how you can differentiate yourself just like real estate just like mortgage just like other crabs yeah I mean and you mentioned bad apples now has has they're kind of more mean I mean marijuana or cannabis and stuff it's kind of starting to go towards a little bit not I wouldn't say mange from people are starting be a little bit more acceptable to it are you seeing crime get cut down because of like crime crime on the fact of like let's say like the you know 18 year old that was buying marijuana in the corner off some guy like is that cut down at all like does that affect your you're certainly disrupting the black market right cannabis has been sold for five thousand years right whether it's been legal not legal right you know it's not like this industry came out of nowhere this products been around it's been part of cultures certain markets are different than others right the California the Venice each of the world is certainly more accepting than you know Omaha Nebraska right right I mean certainly cultures have related to this product in a more meaningful way I would say that by bringing thing to tax and regulate you you actually get rid of the crime element of cannabis it takes time because now you're talking about pricing when you tax something you have to typically sell for at or above what the black market is selling at so then you have to explain the benefits to the customer about that product has been tested it's grown without pesticides some of these things that you don't know what you're getting from your guy so so explaining and educating that to the consumer is our job so short answer is yes it's definitely short circuiting some of the black market in some markets where enforcement is lacks that is not quite caught up like LA for example there's still a ton of illegal grows out there they miss some of their tax revenue pieces so hopefully now you'll see some enforcement come on to knock out some of the black market operations yeah in a state like Illinois cannabis has been here for a long time yeah I will say that we certainly have a stronger regulatory framework towards enforcement if you have bad actors out there so you know I'm all for that the supporting of the police and the other activities that it takes to enforce the laws of the land yeah the black market stuff yeah yep correct so it's definitely disrupting it yeah now what about so like you mentioned tax and stuff like that now I don't know the stat but it to me it just kind of seems like smoking in generals down with used tobacco's down I don't I don't know you know know that grant components of it but you know you don't see people asking you like if you want the smoke or non-smoking section at restaurants yeah you're not a plane the other day that had a bolted shut ashtray I mean I'd be a little bit nervous but nobody sit down on that way for the next one but you know so like I'm assuming that the the government's been hurting from the lack of taxes there now if marijuana you know becomes more mainstream and it becomes like something like cigarettes or something like that is there is that tax gonna help the you know the government are seeing it right Colorado ran at a surplus last year so I don't know too many states Illinois certain doesn't run it a surplus we're not doing good right what I'm doing great if you lost your tax bill it kind of shows it yeah so states that have cannabis brings a lot of things opiate deaths are down tax revenue is up those are two huge benefits for state and I think why you're seeing the governor of Illinois looking at rec recreational not only governor the House the Senate all of the various committees it seems like we have an opportunity to push a bill forward how are and you mentioned opiates like I mean I've had I've personally had a lot of my good friends died from opiates and stuff like that and you know I've never understood like how those are legal and I know you know the facts first and of what's happened to it and something like marijuana is like why is that yeah you know what you know there's a lot about why cannabis or marijuana was illegal and and it goes back to racial things is really one of the driving factors like under the Nixon administration so there's certainly some component of that you know opiates serve a purpose I think I would first say that like if you go and broke a leg and are going under surgery or recovering that day from surgery opiates serve a purpose it's the long-term use of opiates it yeah how it interacts with your brain to create that addiction right is the scary part so cannabis creates that long term palliative care of instead of taking an opiate you can take a non addictive product like cannabis that's never been known to kill anybody the opportunity to replace opiates was one of the things that the lasted administration does do a good do a good job of we introduced an opiate replacement bill that if you have an opiate prescription you could take that prescription and actually go get cannabis with it to try to like help weed you off that something very very positive other states New York Pennsylvania have rolled out a similar platform because the opiate epidemic is it's certainly getting attention now it's been terrible for many years yeah you know and it's unfortunate it took like disrupting white suburbia you get that attention that it needed but you know yeah I think we've all been impacted by it and it's unfortunate it took a lot of deaths to start bringing that to light but you know the pharmaceutical industries are powerful powerful industries but you know you talk about how powerful they are what's the odds that they start trying to get into space to try to make up for that you know they've the radio so they had an opportunity to kind of take this space over early on yeah they could have rescheduled the drug they had the ability to kind of navigate their way in they took a much more interesting and antiquated approach of saying oh no it's not gonna help anybody they took the blockbuster approach right they're like hey we have Netflix but like I think we'll keep these video stores on the sidelines so I think they tried to play more defense than being a part of what could it look like sure so then the alcohol and beverage industry really stepped in and it's going more towards Adi scheduling of cannabis than it is a rescheduling of cannabis but I do think you know as as I mentioned early on the Wellness and lifestyle and the fun side of cannabis kind of sit over on the alcohol tobacco lifestyle situation there's still an incredible opportunity to fir firmer to get involved like why do people say that this helps shrink tumors why do people say that this helped with their epilepsy why do people say there's got to be something to it there's way too much anecdotal stuff out there about successes so the pharmaceutical industry still controls the majority of the purse strings so dumping research dollars into cannabis to find some alternative to chemo or whatnot is is really exciting and that's where you'll see them the Rd research that it takes to get through phase 1 phase 2 phase 3 trials they kind of like show like you're talking about like showing like all the health benefits yeah the health benefits are gonna come at some point and that's that's gonna be really exciting you know for all of Cresco strengths like we're not doing FDA style research right that's a that's multiple billions of dollars in multiple years and you need Big Pharma to come in and start looking at that and I think they will they need kind of the at this point they need some type of D scheduling rescheduling passing of some of these bills out there to get them comfortable with the space so like what are some of the health benefits that like crass goes like touts that it has well so with it not being an FDA approved product you can't talk about health benefits yeah you can say that people have been known to experience positive results or you it's not you can't come out and say this does this right and so like they did so that's what you're saying like until they do that billions of research and FDA puts her stamp that says hey this is movin that it's it shrinks that tumor until then it's just kind of more or less it's anecdotal right you can see some some research I encourage people like go on our website at Cresco labs comm there is medical research down there there are papers published by revered doctors certainly countries like Israel is doing a lot of research Canada is doing a lot of research other markets are really starting to take a more proactive approach there are Harvard Business Journal's or Harvard medical journals on this are the Eastern Illinois journals on this now I don't think that okay so there's a lot of other so what about the future are you able to talk about like we're across goes going in the future sure you know I mean as a public company we went public on December 3rd so and Jessen Canada right it's listed on the CSE the Canadian Securities Exchange and then you can also buy through the OTC but so as as Cresco continues to grow we're in 11 states those are important states right it's Illinois its Pennsylvania it's New York its California it's Florida Massachusetts multitude of what we would deem important states the goal for us is to continue to outperform our peers in those footprints yeah and become the most important cannabis company in the country so that means going deeper into those states looking at M&A opportunities in those states but also we're excited about the potential for a recreational adult use in Illinois and being at the forefront of that and making sure we're well positioned to make sure the consumers of Illinois have product as well as the medical patients of Illinois have products I feel like a lot of people already assume that it's going to be recreational like federal-wide sooner or later is that kind of the same assumption that most people in the industry are getting as well yeah it's not if it's when it's really what it is you know certainly DC is a interesting place there's been 40-plus cannabis bills that have sat out in Congress in one form or another but you had a gentleman by the name of Pete sessions who was a a house rep from Texas who said is kind of the linchpin of what bills got called to the floor in the house so when it was a republican-controlled house none of these bills got called to the floor even though they might pass now with a Democrat controlled house you're gonna see bills like the SAFE Act which would allow more normal banking in the city banks and chases of the world to potentially participate in the space that bill comes out hopefully passes this year mixed reviews but but fairly bullish on the opportunity for that passing then you have the state's act which would actually create some level of federal legality it wouldn't make it federally legal but what it would do is say okay we're pushing this to the States you guys have the right to decide do you want to be a non-participating state a medical state or recreational state so it gives them kind of federal coverage those bills are how this starts to change and it's not really a matter of if it's when it's it's whether the they get it done prior to a presidential election or if the Democrats want it to be a presidential topic so more young voters come out and support cannabis and the Democrat candidate or the Republicans want to get it done in advance of that so it's not a presidential topic right so now you're getting into the weird dynamics that exist in Washington politics yeah which I try not to I don't pontificate on a lot Jo but that one's tough what I'll say is I think the stance though is is when not if what would you see what would you say it would be like the largest like fear or challenge to the entire industry like going forward you know if we regressed in time right if the if more jeff sessions of the world come out it just doesn't seem like that that type of person you're seeing little ladies in Florida and nine-year-old grandmothers utilize cannabis so even that baby boomer plus generation who was the anti cannabis generation even come out and support it and try it now so regulatory risk is always probably number one I would say that's the biggest concern that could really take this backwards it's just now you've got 30-plus states that participate in some cannabis program California is recreational right I think that's like the eighth largest economy in the world yeah it's gonna be hard to put toothpaste back in the tube yeah what and then you got by the way Joe rua care is one of the biggest supporters and investors of kress : as well so we're happy to have you on board Joe yeah we've got that's a big thing we're seeing too now is is talking about people talk and we don't want to open a dispensary stuff you're seeing a lot more people wanted especially younger people want to invest in companies like yours and stuff like that which is it gives an opportunity like the e trades of the world will actually support like you can go on e Trade in America in some of those brokerage accounts yeah who invest in a company like Cresco yeah where is the big behemoth large bulge bank like the chases and and well as far goes of the world don't let you actually even invest in companies like us so oh is it true that all the cannabis companies they they're not even allowed to put the money into bank the federal banks right so any of the big multinational banks like Chase and Wells Fargo we've had banking since we started coming from again drawing parallels on our previous industry we've been able to sit down with banks and typically their state chartered banks but I think we work with 24 different banks yeah that doesn't make sense for a company that's doing what we do to have that many different bank accounts but we need banks in every state then you want to backup bank in every state that you operate in interior to be better to have one or two banks I mean it make our CFOs life a lot easier but we've been able to bank we've been able to get dead on real estate we've been able to do things again taking our professional backgrounds and applying that to become a competitive advantage nice um well we have something we call the Fast Five or the coho assess five questions Joe what do we got here you're gonna let him mmm Fast Five so so what is the best piece of advice you've ever received best piece of advice I've ever received you know it's funny I work harder not smarter which I know is unique but I think you have to work harder first before you can work smarter a lot of people try to work smarter first and develop some incredibly intuitive way to solve a problem without having one yeah sometimes it's hard work first then you can work smarter yeah I agree with that do you love to win or do you hate to lose I love to win oh man all right are you look you hate to lose I hate to lose the opportunity I mean I grew up playing tennis right yeah I wanted to win I never wanted my opponent to lose I wanted to pound him into the ground I mean it's a much better feeling I get that yeah I just hate it like the winds are great but like losing and just like that's a different question right well I rather win or not lose yeah probably a little different but yeah I think I would yeah who was your biggest hero um biggest hero like that I knew doesn't matter any but anybody that you draw that you think is you are absolutely big hair that you've looked up to for who knows how long I mean the Lou Gehrig story is pretty incredible too you never miss a day of work to go out on top like that is is pretty inspiring yeah you know my dad certainly been a hero to face adversity and have a kid with cancer and go through all that and raise a fairly normal kid that sits in front of somebody yeah right it could be debated but you know definitely my dad my mom as well same same kind of I put them on the same level but the Lou Gehrig story is pretty incredible to me yeah if you could have one superpower what would it be be invisible all right that's awesome and the last of the five cues is what makes you Chicago you know I mean I I give a pretty good River tour my version of the architectural tour is it is a nice little second to none so I would say that you know I'm definitely a Yankee fan but you you like Chicago born in New York right no I don't know that I'd say that I love Chicago it's a phenomenal place to live but New York is the epicenter of the world debatable so so where can people find you what would you want to plug so you know Cresco labs comm is is our website there's a ton of information on there you know that that would be what I would encourage over to get to or state of relief calm okay so make sure to tune into our next episode and subscribe to our podcast thanks for listening to the metal Ursa project [Music]", "LJbrLSU2Tk4": "your brain is incredible it can learn languages do sums and with some chemical help even make you see and feel things that aren't really there yep I'm talking about psychedelics and specifically LSD taking LSD is also called dropping acid and there's a reason for that it's an acid easy like surgical dye alibi'd if you're being precise the discovery that LSD made you trip is so famous that we've named a day after it that's bicycle day on April the 19th 1943 Albert Hoffman a Swiss chemist have made a new drug based on compounds found in the ergot fungus it's worth noting that this gross fungus caused gangrene convulsions death and madness throughout history and it's because people consumed bread made with rye that was infected with ergot in fact it's thought to be the cause of accusations of witchcraft Hofmann and felt a little strange after working on his new forgot base drug so sensibly he decided to take quarter of a milligram of it and see what happened his bicycle ride home was strange and terrifying he believed he couldn't move and the time had stopped then when he got home his next-door neighbor had become a witch and he found that as he said a demon had invaded me and taken possession of my mind body and soul still he woke the next day apparently feeling amazing and dedicated the rest of his career to studying mind-altering drugs hoping that they could be used in psychiatry so what made him feel what he felt LSD is a powerful hallucinogenic it can make you see and hear things that aren't there one common event is that time can feel like it's as Hoffmann experienced you might also see kaleidoscopic visual imagery feel changes in your body image and have mystical type experiences - all of this is going on inside your brain and LSD is actually incredibly free love about the whole thing it effects ton of your nerves receptors including dopamine receptors adrenergic receptors and serotonin receptors that last one is particularly interesting especially for hallucinations serotonin appears elsewhere in the body but as a neurotransmitter it's got a big role in the brain where it's involved in your mood feelings and sleep patterns the receptor involved in making you hallucinate is a type of serotonin receptor called 582 a now these 5-ht 2a receptors are found in your brain where they play a big role in the visual cortex hence the weird trippy visuals but interestingly they're also found in your gastrointestinal tract and your circulatory system too now if I'm honest science doesn't really understand exactly how LSD acts on these receptors to produce hallucinations there are a bunch of ideas including one from Professor Jack Cohen he's a mathematical biologists he believes that the characteristic lines and kaleidoscope patterns seen when you're tripping arise because the innate tendency of the brain to make patterns when it becomes unstable and is even though a computer model that can hallucinate so is any of this stuff dangerous well there have been very few known cases of LSD overdose and most actually happened when people thought it was another drug in 1972 eight people with stuck it for cocaine and snorted a huge amount they ended up very unwell bleeding internally in a comatose state but all did survive and recover although one recent American study would suggest there is no link between LSD use and mental health the jury is most definitely still out on its long term effects especially for people with a susceptibility to mental illness but in controlled conditions there may even be some positive effects some are arguing for using LSD and other psychedelics to treat depression or even to help terminally ill patients come to terms with their impending death the wife of author Aldous Huxley reported that she gave him LSD on his deathbed at his request and that he had the most beautiful death still the effects of a trip and be terrifying especially if you're in an unsafe space feel nervous or have a history of mental issues plus you can also have flashbacks months later and people have been known to hurt themselves while tripping also because it's a class a drug the people selling it and not exactly mr. trustworthy in 2014 five people were charged with murder when a girl died after taking their synthetic LSD so please don't just try anything someone hands you a party and that goes double if they work for the CIA yeah throughout its history LSD has been used for some pretty messed up things in America in the 1950s the MKULTRA program involved the military and CIA secretly slipping LSD to prison inmates their own party guests and people who visited prostitutes this ludicrously unethical experimentation caused a huge amount of suffering and lies behind many conspiracy theories today that doesn't take the cake for the strangest use of LSD though for my money that would be the 1962 elephant on acid experiment they gave tusks oh the elephant 297 milligrams of LSD and enormous dose he reacted badly and while they were trying to calm it down the researchers managed to kill him poor tusks to end on a happier note you might be pleased to hear that researchers at Imperial College London have completed the first modern imaging study into the effects of LSD on the brain and a crowdfunding campaign to complete the research raise double its original golf now that sounds like a better way to look at the mind no psychedelics required Oh bonus fact talking of animal antics good one to leave you with although LSD has a long association with Alice in Wonderland and white rabbits rabbits are actually the animal that is most sensitive to overdosing you", "YwmemYVLehg": "real life I'm doing it's not okay unless you feel right everybody can hear me okay never done this before so just gotta get the tangle that's okay how's it been doing so this recipe is pretty pretty easy all you need is your strawberries and you want them dry and the nice firm berries you don't want the ones with the marks and stuff like that cuz they'll go mushy if you're gonna eat them lick right away the softer berries are okay but the recommend harder berries let me grab the wrong path and look through them so where's everybody from everybody can hear me okay so what we want to do is turn up the heat to medium so it's about four on my Abu and today you're going to need sugar just granulated sugar light corn syrup maybe it's a little too bright it's not better it's a better Tucson we want the light on or off office more better are we okay so anyways I don't have any long wooden dowels you should probably use those but I'm just gonna use some of the harder to fix these guys got like a bit of a thicker end on them I'm going to just jab the very you just want to take off the end here you want to leave on the the the whole thing and just take off the green bits and then I'll stab oh into there and then when your syrup is hot enough you'll be able to pour it and twirl it let's go as we go and we must get cracking on that because it takes a minute to get up to temp it sir these things are very handy to have their candy thermometers or deep fryer you can deep fryer with them to whatnot but very handy to have but if you don't have him candy thermometer if it takes about 20 minutes that medium to maybe just a little bit higher than medium heat and when the syrup is ready if you pour it into cold a cup of cold water and it supplies and it's cracky then I easily make dog if you pour it in the water into the cold water and it turns hard that's called the hard crack stage so you should be good alright so we want two cups of sugar you with a leftover sugar I'm going to make same banana cream flavor at hard candies because this is going to be way more than to cover these strawberries here all right so two cups of sugar you need 2/3 a cup of corn light corn syrup or in there it's pretty simple to make hard candy it's just a little bit of time and you got to be super in the safe department and then you want a third quarter cup of water I like using hot water because it kind of makes the melting process a little bit faster all right so that's going to take a few minutes to get going get the corn syrup off you just want to leave that be Charlie is doing some editing right now he's gonna taste the teeth it snaps once we're done here you're just being here bothering me anyway so just leave me be thanks for joining in everybody everybody's having to give me some fodder can you consult it we'll just start boiling away you don't need to turn a tournament or anything like that or stir it turn it stir it it will just do what it needs to do yeah he's on the couch jerking I meet some cauliflower soup today you're gonna get that finished up are you in CNF okay take a salt and who's on here and even smart dude over here he's got a new video right now making his brother sick themselves oh hey what did you be enough to diddle you speak a little money it's like the coronavirus is a good excuse for you to never have to come back in what anybody yeah whoa what's everybody teaching on right now 2:30 in the afternoon it's kickety-kick it appears kids get you it's really hard to focus on what you're trying to do and also focus on a chat to talk I don't know if you can see a thought better we've got a boil so Brett just over 100 Celsius and that will be 225 ish Fahrenheit for those folks and we're looking to try to get up to 300 Fahrenheit 150 Celsius everybody getting stuff done around the house since you're trapped there just everybody having right domestic with their partners everybody's just loving to do it all miss a little stink monkey what's everybody's favorite edible DEET is it cookie or muffin or is everybody has anybody like to cook savory foods with their medicinals does anybody have any good recipes it was like 28 questions coming at ya do seven domestics with you solve it just not putting things away you having to tell yourself twice in the eye CVD lozenges there a good burger or something some like nothing CBD or THC and the burger no meat itself or maybe make some type of something that goes on the burger that has the hash parts into it yellow cat maybe like a cheese sauce or something like that he could probably work the hash and you please root is he hopefully everybody let's these cooking shows but maybe give some more room get some ideas on what we might want to try and my favorite are the hard cinnamon candies that's probably not just a few to try and then I'm gonna make the hard candies with the rest everybody could still salt put this up it's a little bit over the way and higher just don't want it in the Chooch I'll get a stern talking-to terrible pretty soon does anybody cheat while they cook no at whenever Chris will bring me in a joint while I'm cooking or something I always feel like pinky Bundy you know and you see it in the beginning or she like drops her ashes into the hammock or something and stuff and just zero [ __ ] are given like that just reminds me of that so I try usually not to teach and cook too much food so just be careful one time my cousin she's wear fake nails and she made this lasagna and lost a nail but didn't know a fishy lost her nail in the lasagna or where she may have lost it right and she brought this lasagna to a family function and people I ate list is long yeah and she didn't tell people until afterwards that was disgusting I was very happy I didn't eat that lasagna so we're just waiting it's about like I said around in the 20 minute mark well it won't be able to see kinda how long the chat is but I figured you know instead of jumping the the candy making process I just show you up you know in full so you can decide if that's something you want to do for yourself or whatnot I'm pretty excited so yeah you just put your little guy on a skewer and when it's ready you just twirl it into the sugar you don't want like a super thick layer though just a nice thin crackly layer yeah do a little dance make a little image something get after net yes it can take a song while we're waitin everybody can hear me right I don't have the microphone plugged in I didn't want too much stuff around baby Jim burly there he is so if you seen puck ones Facebook we're changing the freezer shed into a chicken coop I'm gonna have chicken friends that's gonna lay egg ease for us I'm pretty excited I've already decided one of the chickens names is going to be Mable and I also enjoy the name Matilda need a little uh music maker in here play Jim Burley songs for friend seats make sure you go check out Jim burly's uh I should name one Kyle should night haha that's just chasing things though Jim really put your link up Jim burlap oh we're getting their checks for friggin ever all the frickin time making candies are so good they just take forever these are the candies I mean yesterday little uh marble sized ones it's well I have to get one of them you know salt these uh it's a fruit punch flavor these ones they're not bad at all don't teach the hash at all oh and when we're done they in the mix in just about three grams of rosin into the mixer pretty exciting I've got my two little monk meets on the show when I was a kid I got my ass kicked by a rooster we were playing by the pond and this thing decided it wanted to chase us and I'm not very good at like running and laughing and having a moment so I had to like stop and just scream and hope that the chicken would be more scared of me than I was a bit because like I just couldn't and it was getting me so that was my like defense mechanism it's like I'm an animal and scream at it and then it just left me alone then the next time it it got me and my tactic didn't work the second time because it came and got me and pecked me right on the shin bone big time hurt oh it's my friend of a time decided she was gonna like run - but then lock me out of the truck because that was our like safety thing that you know the rooster couldn't get in there but no no she just saved herself and I got [ __ ] over how are you doing full sand I'm pretty excited we're getting up there I might crank her up just a little bit to make things go a little bit faster but these candy thermometers are mucho good I watched that Jimmy sent me a video today and it was pretty friggin funny let me just socked if I could find it here real quick because it was a goodie you made me dunk my corn that was so friggin funny yeah don't be a [ __ ] I hope mine are nice to me because it will like really hurt my feeling it or not if you haven't paid attention over the years I'm a little bit sensitive in the animal department yeah we're doing it nothing with dipper word all of the sugars just gonna K forever I don't want to be attacked no I want them to be my friend I've been bidding lot binge-watching chicken raising videos and stuff and a little how much for something treats you can give them and different things and hopefully they'll have a good little life and you know as the years go on will improve and probably get more we're just going to get a couple three maybe up to five chickens and see how it goes comma comma comma comma come on sherry boil so what do we think we should try next on the THC well no not free-range so much like they're gonna have an area and stuff to be but I'm not ready for freer and jet I don't think my anxiety could handle it and I just got to see how things go and stuff but like the neighbor's dog gets out and runs over here and the cats get out and come over here and I just want to make sure that they're safe and stuff like that because like I'm not a kind of the kind of farmer that's gonna be like oh that's that's life you know like that's the way of fireman animals get got but it's preventable and you know I just need to do it the way and you give you up for a minute hmm but eventually you know maybe we get rid of some more stuff and make more room in the art and this or not and blah blah blah we could possibly have them free-range you know we have to get a fence yet and all that yeah when we do get the chip in them they fired out the chicken nuggets well I'll definitely cook with them and try to show everybody wall over at just about 250 right now we've got a few degrees go but see how long the process takes in actuality and like mucho danger like hospital up if you get burnt with that so you know don't do a bunch of dabs and carry on before you do you do this like make this a safety first priority not safety third come along to luck one puts the squawking chickens Jimmy Choo bad cuz they're gonna be on the other side of the yard so Jimmy Choo bad and it's not like we're having like a giant flock of them so and I mean it's no different than the dogs the neighbor's dog barked and belligerent but I'd find you know chickens probably less noisy than that well yeah that's exactly we got to like fix the holes in the fence that Rick cut before we could have chickens running around thanks Rick if anybody's in the area of in woods and has like chicken type of stuff or like extra chain-link fence or things like that but maybe they'd like to donate to the chicken kid just get a hold of me how you doing for Massachusetts I'd love to have a little a little piggy to but when we went and seen them and saved them and stuff that you know you

process for me here there we go a ladle little dip it in give it a swirl there we go see you you figure it out as you go I'm uh I like to cook more than I like to bake because you don't have to follow

other mold here finish this up thanks for tuning in with me everybody and I'm glad that it they turned out oh it's open they're tasty big-time you don't taste the hash at all I'm not a big fan of like super Hoshi edibles like no thanks I want it to taste good and you know like I can't I don't know how people do like the [ __ ] bazillion milligram edibles that just absolutely taste like kite I'd rather have a couple candies and maybe equal out to that much if I was if I wanted that much so I in my own baby bird so at least you know with this recipe you can get a bunch of candies made out of

pre-rolls lifts so today's string is going to be the cure lotto this is a strain that we've reviewed in flower form as part of the west coast we tour was actually one of the top strains and top products on the entire west coast today's batch comes in hot at 23.46 on the thc not exactly high thc but terpenes and gelato and curato are always pretty high so good flavors pretty much guaranteed total cannabinoids at 27.2 percent cbd at .05 this was harvested and cultivated on january 29th packaged on february 17th so this is very fresh so the cool thing with these packs is that it has instructions on the back as to how to open this is considered a hybrid pre-roll the ingredients is rolling papers and premium california indoor grown cannabis so in terms of opening the packaging you've got a button right here on the back you're going to push that take the top i'm sorry the bottom right part right here and push it forward and then you're gonna pull it back out just like that so this pack normally has five pre-rolls been sharing them around with the friends to get their perspective and overall the feedback from the roommate the girlfriend a couple other homies that came through is that the the pre-rolls just don't taste as good um as the flower but that's to be expected you know a lot of companies are using many buds smaller buds lower thc buds than the tops of the plants so we shall put it to the test one hit talk about it two hits score out of the ten three hits score out of a hundred let's go you all know the rules man one hit two hits three hits scores let's go show you guys the joint future roll of paper there first hit mainly tasted like piney sweet weed and then the harshness from the paper i don't know if that's a good sign or a bad sign about the paper but it is what it is here we go here we go first it got me hot we got special guest over here mr shangul he's the compound kitty he's over here wandering for breakfast oh wow all right that second and third hit was really good you guys can see a little bit of that ash color there not exactly white but definitely darker i'm sorry lighter gray almost to the white with a little bit of darkness in there uh could be from the paper could be from some organic plant matter again when you're working with littles it's it's kind of tough there's a lighter color when i think of a taste test score this is going to be this is going to be an 8 point this is going to be room 8.5 you definitely get the pineness you get the gelato taste but it's just not as good as the flower form and so if i had to pick between the flower pack or the eighth definitely gonna go with the flower uh i'm sorry if i if i want to go with the lifts pack versus the flower i'm gonna go with the cure lotto flower um but if i'm gonna go to an event or go to a party i definitely have no problem buying these lips and pulling them out and sharing them they taste great people would enjoy this is it the best joint in the market no is it the best joint pack in the market let's say it's a top ten the strain of cure lotto makes this a top 10 joint experience overall i do enjoy the packaging i love the the uh the information the little directions on the back packaging can sometimes be kind of difficult to use and confusing there's five servings in this the directions include remove pre-roll from packaging light inhale deeply then exhale effects may be felt immediately and vary per user new users should start with one two three puffs and increase as needed so you know i really enjoyed that they put all that information on there the little directions i all i'm really missing in terms of the overall experience is the terpene profile um and i don't know maybe that's that's really about it i guess a qr code for test results could be could be crucial um and because of that i'm going to give this pre-roll pack a 90 out of 100. i think that the overall taste could be better if you think they could stick some better colorado flower in here but i'm only saying that because i've smoked so much cure lotto i've smoked so much marathon og that i know what the best of the best looks like from the cure company and so 8.5 on the taste test 90 out of 100 overall and when it comes to the would you recommend i would give this a 95 out of 100 on the would you recommend mainly because it's a pre-roll pack

depression and ADHD. What magical substance does all of this? Adderall. [Reactions intro] Over 25 million people worldwide use amphetamine, which is the active ingredient in Adderall. Amphetamine has actually been around since the 1800s, and has a pretty neat history. First synthesized in 1887 by Romanian chemist Lazar Edeleanu, amphetamine appeared on the market in 1933 under the name\n\u201cBenzedrine,\u201d or Bennies for short. In 1943, the US army began issuing \u201cpep pills\u201d to fight battle fatigue and boost morale. These pep-pills were pure amphetamine,\nwhich is a stimulant. By the end of World War II,\nAmerican and British troops had shipped an estimated 150 million of these pills. Japanese and German troops also used these \u201cpep-pills\u201d and Hitler would get daily injections of amphetamine. American troops continued using amphetamine well into the Korean and Vietnam wars, but stopped once the drug was no longer sold over the counter in 1956. Because, you know, unrestricted access to pure amphetamine is probably not a good idea. Today amphetamine is used in LOW doses primarily to treat\u2026 Wait. What? Oh. Right. Used to treat ADHD. The majority of ADHD drugs stimulate\nthe central nervous system. You\u2019d think it wouldn\u2019t make sense to treat hyperactivity and lack of focus by adding stimulation, but we\u2019ll let neuroscience expert Doctor Ryan Davison explain: \u201cPeople with ADHD tend to have lower levels of dopamine, a key chemical in the brain\u2019s reward center. This lack of dopamine means people with ADHD are constantly seeking stimulation. Amphetamine stimulates the release of dopamine and other neurotransmitters in the brain so those minor distractions don\u2019t cause you to lose focus.\u201d Nerve cells and neurotransmitters act like they\u2019re at a middle school dance. Neurotransmitters like dopamine are on one side of the gym, and receptor cells sit on the other. Amphetamine starts the party by pushing dopamine out onto the \u201cdance floor,\u201d where they then partner up with the receptors. Amphetamine also keeps dopamine on the dance floor, leaving more for the receptors to catch. So before we go, here\u2019s DOCTOR DAVISON with another fun fact that shows why little tweaks in structure can make for BIG changes. \u201cHere\u2019s what a molecule of amphetamine looks like. This little guy is a group of a carbon and three hydrogen atoms, also called a methyl group. If you add one more methyl group onto the end of an amphetamine molecule, it turns into its much more dangerous cousin, methamphetamine. Those four little atoms can turn you from a studious citizen\u2026 into a total tweaker.\u201d So while you\u2019re still focused, don\u2019t forget to like share and subscribe.

There's no straining.There's no spasming big change from the\"[goofy voice] \"oh I can't talk man\" man So there's something in the ingredients in ambien that allow me to speak and relax and You know I can actually talk like a normal person which is great   Ambien is a drug with many faces and not all of them are sleeping best known for treating Insomnia causing bouts of uncontrollable nocturnal binge eating and endowing Tiger woods with enhanced sexual abilities Ambient has another property one that may very well change medical history by normalizing neurological functioning and damage to brains in 1996 24 Year-Old Louie V owen was struck by a truck resulting in an injury that left him in a persistent vegetative state then in 1999 Louie's mother decided to feed her unconscious son a crushed ambien tablet through a straw to reduce Involuntary muscle spasms in his arms to her amazement Louis spontaneously regained consciousness opening his eyes and speaking for the first time in 3 years and So I decided to visit Louie in South Africa and learn more about the ambient effect   I met with Dr.. Walley Nel who has known Louis since he was a child and saw Louie through his zolpidem metamorphosis is me Louie VC, Saw Left man. \nHahaha look on this! [foreign language] Do you know that you? Were the first person in the whole world That took this soul knocks Yes, what still work? Oh? Yes, oh yes, it's still working that was the picture how he looked before his accident Louie was 25 years old and he was working at the Far Eastern hospital as Switchboard operator, and he borrowed a bicycle from one of the frames thing and that knotted about how post 11 He somebody was outside market, and they were calling me there was an accident a bicycle accident so they took me through to the ICU and he was lying there But his head was twice as big as it used to be cause he was brain damaged. It was terrible you know for For a mom, to see your son like that\nthat's bad. New Year's in the solid coma he never said one single word nothing He swallowed the tablet and we were staying here myself and my husband and I think it was after 20 minutes I Just heard things he didn't say anything he just did the- did the \"mmm\" this Like in the past but I said I said sweetheart something and he said \"Bareyne, it's nothing\" and after about 40 minutes He's asked for life. You know love stars It was like twinkling and I said \"Louis can you hear me?\"  then all of a sudden he says \"yes\" He says yes, hello, Mommy andI couldn't believe and I couldn't I just cried and I phoned up to Wally and I've heard my family said Louie can talk! She told me the story. I said it's totally impossible this doesn't happen these things in my time The Brain is dead it's dead. So I came out on the Sunday. We gave him the tablet and I went to stand there me and the family was standing down the bed I saw also the twinkle in the eye, then you started with all your monsters then!  \nhMM He is a rehabilitation Louie had these three tablets a day He's on half twice a day now his Iq 10 o'clock before he gets his tablet is 70 and After the tablet two hours after the half his IQ goes up to 90 what other sorts of brain injuries could be treated with Ambien what we have treated [and] what we are treating as multiple sclerosis a Dementia Alzheimer's cerebral palsy near drownings We've got the problem. We've got the answer But we haven't got the in-between We didn't know we didn't know where to start or how to start until the Ralphie is the big fun be honest on That one there on the explanation part on the more scientific ornament In 1999 Ralph Klaus stumbled upon an article about the miraculous awakening of Louis Vienne and decided he wanted to study the effect further by imaging changes in cerebral Perfusion before and after ambien What happened in Louis' Brian Was that the way these big areas that weren't functioning at all were kind of dark areas and then after zolpidem These regions all normalized so like a day/night difference This this is Louis' brain his original state before was operative and you can see this large decreased uptake in the Parietal region which Normalizes after zolpidem and see with error is there [three] it's about forty percent of normal comes to A hundred percent after zolpidem. So you have these two phenomena. You have the excited toxic effect Which is the same time destabilizing the micro environment say I was almost is suicide cells that offer themselves for the greater good and you have the other cells which are influenced by the GABA which don't regulate and survive.\nThe exact Biochemical mechanism of ambience therapeutic effect in Brain injury has yet to be identified But Dr. Klaus theorizes the GABA-A ion channel Undergoes an epigenetic change after brain trauma Causing an unregulated influx of chloride ions that suppress neuronal activity so you have really two different Gaba-a receptors here you've got the normal gaba receptors which you know it induces the sort of sleepy change then you have the abnormal receptors Which has gone through all these these phrases after brain injury is not the same as this original receptor anymore It is a receptor.which is super sensitive and Zolpidem through distorting this receptor normalizes it again and when that happens Then the brain becomes less suppressed obviously and you see these changes on the brain spect scan or metabolic [tells] and you see the changes, Clinically, so Something works anywhere in this in this in this spectrum, basically Because every way in the spectrum you have you have this this part that is Damaged, dead if you like, all non-Reversible injury if you like And you've got this parallel area of dormancy This is Jonathan pool. He's a bank manager here in Guildford actually and He had a stroke And after the stroke he had problems understanding people music suffers from auditory diagnosis her so he hear sounds and hears words But he doesn't know what they mean Dr.. Klaus, and I went to meet Jonathan Poole the banker who lost his numbers a Sudden stroke at the age of 56 left pool with a lesion in his left temporal lobe That interfered with his ability to read and understand language Dr.. Klaus Prescribed pool Zolpidem and I wanted to see the effects firsthand See I can hear what you're saying very well But if Klaus talked to me, I would not have half of what saying Because this this ear is Doing something funny inside the brain So so when I talk to it like that, I talk quite well But right here from this word my words will come very short the [ceiling] [oh] Interesting and if you see Dr.. Klau's lips while he speaks are you then able to interpret the words? Most of it, but it's a new word like names numbers People Don't hear and this is written down in front of me that I might have a chance to say it See took me nearly Six months to hear my wife's name which is Sue or Susan but it was someone on the phone and just give a name of sue It's all it guh That means no name to me at all It's been very much more easy since he's been under zolpidem. I wouldn't let anyone take him off it I really wouldn't because it makes life so much easier for us all But before his stroke Jonathan was very articulate. It was very good with figures [and] things like that Since his stroke although he can obviously now speak properly. He does still have problems with words He very bad with numbers particularly over the telephone so quite often if he gives me a message over the phone I know I have to check it first because it's quite possible. He's got the words wrong numbers wrong Could we test the effect Dr.. Klaus would you? Write down a few numbers Just sort of more of this complex numbers if it's a give you five numbers right and then you You say them once I say them. I said yes, you know your videos often an hour later. We do the sentence. Yes now He will see something Possible, okay you ready. Yes 583 153 613 377 Something some 291 250..250..251 830   th.. three and I've lost it. I had I think I think I had  three but I've lost I didn't hear it quickly enough So that one I've lost that one yeah 991 171 okay, we asked you five questions and five were wrong. Yeah [Laughing] Let's get your favorite item right oh Even though Jonathan Poole had already taken one ten milligram ambien that morning the effects had diminished by the time we arrived So he asked him to take a second allowed 60 minutes for the drug to Reach optimal Concentrations and tested him again to see if his understanding of numbers had improved 641 6-4-1 198 1-9-8 472  4-7-2 Seeing the positive effects of Ambien on pool and Louie was extremely impressive But there was still the matter of Thomas Rowe a voice-over artist. Who's one of the most dramatic responders to the ambient effect \"that was fun!\" In 2009 Rowe played a tragic visit to the dentist one that left him without a wisdom tooth and without the ability to speak or Rowe's career was ruined and he was forced into retirement at the age of 52 One night. He stayed awake on Ambien to find his voice Had returned this is how I talk now [and] so I traveled to Orlando, Florida to meet Tom at his former studio Sunspots I Spent an hour years here. I was the voice of The circuit city when they were in business for six years I did a lot of Nissan, uh.. \"It all ends tomorrow!\" That kind of stuff. When I hear myself or feel myself speak it's hard I sit, it's hard to believe Ya know? Oh, it was like a country song I lost my career, and then my dog died and what can I do other than if there was a job for someone with a speech disorder It's not so much. I I want to go back behind the Mic again But I would like to speak without pain, 'cause it really hurts. For someone that hasn't experienced anything like this could you describe it feels like muscularly? if you took your bottom lip and Pulled it hard maybe as hard as you could out and then took your neck and grab that and pull it back The forehead and pulled up And your cheeks and pull back And I feel everything thing Turlock only Drug the work is handy in order to test ambience therapeutic effect [I] Asked Tom to promote a Chevy spring event the [GMS] Every spring of that. I'm more patient $8,000 off or next Tahoe [lure], I can hear me And the inside me Breathing that I know the rhythm I know the sound Drives me.. unlike many brain Trauma patients who don't experience ambience typical hypnotic effect tommrow started to become inebriated In a world of giant monkeys only one man will stand above the apes tonight on WGN and Will need to arm them with the skills the knowledge and the confidence they need to be victorious Yeah, that's pretty good. Yeah. He's funny. Can't deny them in his It's working yes, it's not there yet it's working while General Grant was busy with his horses there was something going on Deeper in the South... the sun had set and although Tom had to fight a strong urge [to] sleep his voice was back and Couldn't be stopped. It's Mardi gras at Universal studios. Who are you gonna? Love it [cher] we're gonna have a big [time] Yeah that's no different than what was done when I was there and now with the ambien in full effect [I] once more asked Tom to promote a Chevy spring event It's the [gene] Messer Chevy spring event and we're taking 8,000 dollars off your next tahoe. That's right get a Brand-new 2010 Chevy tahoe at Jean Messer Chevrolet, and we'll take $8,000 off MsRP. It's time for our new Chevy Tahoe from Jean Messer Chevrolet Wow, wow, it feels like being Alive when I do that Don't do that cause [ooh], [hahaha] What started out as a serendipitous discovery may now represent one of the most important interventions for brain Trauma? with time and medical research who knows what the future may hold We try to push along this research on zolpidem all the research that you do is actually just art of interest in Goodwill of Of people who are trying to find out what's going on? It's just scientific curiosity really these Insomnia tracks are not optimized for pattern of brain damage and therefore there is a lot of money to be made but if people develop this and optimize it specifically for for people with brain damage Now for myself getting on it's it's such a wonderful thing.

try the ugly one because it's pretty ugly but it should taste just as good it's what's on the inside that counts right what's up guys welcome back today I'll be making ring shaped gummies with this mold I got from Amazon I'm going to be using these gummies I got three ball barnacles I chose a teal and blueish color to use to make the diamonds and a yellowy color for the ring part of the ring or the balance part you can choose whatever colors you like though I'm using store-bought gummies to save time but you could also use a gummy recipe I'll post it below and you can make it completely from scratch here's what you're going to need half an ounce of that means one and a half tablespoons of water 1 teaspoon gelatin 1/8 of a teaspoon vacuum sorbate mixture and I'll link how to make this below a ring mold and if you like 1 teaspoon of our herbal tincture all right guys let's get started the first step is to sprinkle the gelatin over the water there's no need to stir it just leave it to bloom for about 5 minutes we can also add in our potassium sorbate mixture so you're going to need to use a double boiler to melt your gummies I don't actually have a double boiler so I'm just making my own version here I have a pyrex dish on top of a pot of simmering water and they didn't really have any other glass dishes to fit over another pot so I'm going to use a pot with simmering water and then I'm going to put this actual dish of got me on the strainer I don't know if that's gonna work I really thought I was coming up with some genius invention here but it did not work but we're going to try it anyway all right so I already hit these up and they are simmering so I'm gonna add my white gummies because I have a larger amount or the yellow I'm sorry to this one to melt and then I'm gonna do the blue ones and here hopefully that works so we're just gonna wait for these to melt and we're also going to add the gelatin because I have more yellow gummies than blue gummies I'm going to give the yellow gummies about 3/4 of a gelatin mixture and the other corner to the blue guys so yellow gummies are pretty much almost all melted the blue ones don't look like they're gonna melt with this contraption that I made here so I'm probably just going to use the microwave okay my yellow-belly mixture is all melted I'm just going to turn up the heat and just move out of the way and my blue ones actually are melting they're just taking a little bit longer so I guess I just have to be patient and wait for them to melt down okay this blue book shirt is actually not melting very well so I'm just going to throw it in the microwave yeah so it's been there for a while and like the gelatin water melted but the gummies not so much so I'm just gonna put the microwave for like 20 second intervals so that just melted a little so I'm gonna stir it with us the reason why that blue was kind of separating I believe it's because I was using two completely different types of gummies so maybe next time any bets to just choose one gummy and just use food coloring to change the color but at the same time like I wonder if that'll look cool in the diamond door well I got a diamond should be completely clear so just throw that back in the microwave for a bit okay so I just put it in for another 10 seconds you know I really wish I did put those other blue ones in there but we're gonna have to go with it and just hope that it looks cool okay now we can add our tincture I'm gonna put it just in the yellow part of the gummy but you can put it in both check out the color I feel like I want this to be a little bit more yellow so I'm going to add some yellow food coloring see if I can get a better look of the color here it's very nice and yellowy gold now it is still a little bit too thin to pour into our molds if we were just doing one color that would be fine but because we're doing two colors we hadn't to be a little bit thicker so they don't like merge with each other it's where she's gonna wait a few minutes but keep our eye on them and check for a little bit of a thicker consistency okay so it's been about five minutes and here's what we're looking at for the viscosity of it you guys this was way too thick and you'll be able to see that when I'm pouring it into the molds I struggled quite a bit so I recommend putting it into the mold right after you take it off the stove or even keep it over a warm pot of water all right so you're gonna want to get some of the blue or the diamond color and some of the yellow and we're going to put them in at the same time so I put my molds into the freezer for about 20 minutes they were a bit harder to put out because the liquid was so thick when I put it in so they didn't come out as clean as I would have liked them to alright so I had them in the freezer for about half an hour and now I'm gonna take them I have cut the little edges that I created now I said earlier to let your mixture cool off and making a bit before you put into malt don't do that it actually like cost me a lot more issues so these didn't come out as perfect as I wanted you can see there it's like the color like is coming through the blue and the yellow are kind of merging and then the last one that I was doing I was just like putting all the hearted got me mixture into it and it that one came out really weird but if you don't let your mixture part in like I did they will come out perfectly so I'm just gonna try the ugly one because it's pretty ugly but if it tastes just as good it's what's on the inside that counts right hmm smells good I mean it really just depends on companies you're using these ones are actually good I don't really like yellow gummies but this one tastes like kind of kinda bleep I don't like your local if you do want it ok so I just cut them and trimmed off their edges and now I'm going to add some edible glitter to the diamond part this is some glitter that I got a long time ago and I don't know where from it's just in my baking cupboard so I'm not sure of this exact one but I'll try and post a link of something similar so these are still sticky um so we're just gonna put this glitter on right now with a paintbrush while it's sticky enough to get the glitter to stick to it and then we're just going to leave them out for a day or two until they have dried up a bit and then I will put them into some bags thank you guys so much for watching I hope you enjoyed this video please give us a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe thank you guys [Music] [Music]

beverage um the tropical kush flavor from rey's lemonade is a hundred milligram thc beverage uh it was a great price point i think it was like 18 to 22 dollars i bought this last week so i can't recall the price uh there's around 20 bucks for 100 milligrams which is not bad especially in a single beverage personally i don't drink soda or really juice or anything like that um and i'm a little bit on the higher end of a consumer so i much rather have high dose beverages even if i'm not gonna drink the whole beverage if i want a 20 milligram experience i'd much rather drink this much soda as opposed to two full sodas that are 10 milligrams a piece i know a lot of this this stuff out there is even 5 milligrams it's great for some people but just not for me what i thought was unique about this was the on the bottom i was wondering if this was given to me incorrectly and then i just saw on the side here it's a cert the serving cup so instead of having like the awkward plastic thing with plastic wrap on top of it just kind of creating unnecessary use of plastic it's kind of this nice little cap that also you know you can't really see but you can just set it down so that's cool um i'm not even going to really worry about popping it off because i don't really care about dosing it but it takes a second to pop off so not super difficult um yeah let's get into it taste test okay so it did say shake before consuming before i turned the camera on i did shake it up i just want to give that disclaimer if anyone out there tries the product tropical kush 100 milligrams it smells smells fruity doesn't it doesn't smell like cannabis let's see that's actually good um so it's tropical kush it looks like there's a mango a pineapple on there and a coconut so kind of your pina colada with a little mango in there it's definitely tastes like it tastes like a pina colada second drink a little bit more cannabis in my second drink than the first one i'm trying to shake it even though i did just shake it up pretty good i'm trying to shake it a little more it doesn't look like there's like the cannabis remnants on there does it has a real lemon juice i believe so that's why i encourages you to shake it up so okay now on the prolonged aftertaste i'm getting a little bit more of the the thc that's good for 100 milligrams usually you know 100 milligrams in a single serving beverage like this it's going to be very overwhelming this is not too fizzy there's a little bit of fizz really good on the on the flavor it's not it's not like overwhelmingly sweet or artificial tasting um let's see if the ingredients could just be artificial flavor no carbonated water sugar lemon juice uh concentrate natural flavor citric acid something for color i'm not going to say because i don't want to embarrass myself it does contain coconut okay cool so marijuana desolate oil is in this product uh using ethanol uh alcohol extraction um so this is good on a taste this is an easy nine nine you know honestly maybe a nine and a half for a 100 milligram beverage that doesn't i got to do i know we're supposed to do like two tastes and then and then rate it but yeah i think i'm that's a nine and a half to me on taste easy easy maybe maybe even a ten you know that's a really good taste the cannabis comes out on again on the prolonged you take a sip tastes good let it sit taste good and then the cannabis comes in there at 100 milligrams with uh with the distillate it's going to be impossible to fully mask that but this is really really well done in masking that taste um so yeah easy 9.5 for me out of taste overall you know as far as beverages go man i might i might go with the same the same thing and give this a 9.5 um so let's see it's got the manufactured date best buy date um it's got plenty of information you know there's not anything about the strain but in a beverage you know some people might be i want strain specific or full spectrum or this or that i don't know i don't personally necessarily care about that but there isn't information on that so you know if we're really knocking maybe a little bit on that but not really i mean the packaging looks great 100 milligrams in a single soda with very very minimal cannabis taste until the prolonged uh a 9.5 on the taste and i i will probably give this i think a 9.5 um across the board um i might have to to drink the whole thing to see okay was that was the flavor was a little too sweet halfway through or something but i mean we know we drank a little bit through the neck there and um you know i i'm liking it it's my this is definitely something i'd buy again", "VMcmw2EAt74": "all right today's a very special day it is November 1st and we are headed to the world's largest cannabis dispensary in Las Vegas [Music] what you think about it inside opening day this morning would you think it was awesome I really check out this [ __ ] fountain right here this powder is freakin amazing what you see inside they got an interactive floor where you want one thing they've got these book they're like planets but they're balloons with motors on them no way lights inside and they do it to music and these six balloons do this choreographed thing inside the building with lights on they do about every our purest distillate you can know know BHO it's all gotta be you know either co2 real clean [ __ ] and I think it's 90% tm8 Goethe babe okay okay sure this is a birthday cake child even before I got into the store I met many cool people outside and there was just a sense of excitement in the air the place looks beautiful this fountain is just absolutely gorgeous and I was just excited to get inside to see what they had and once you get in you can't mistake that you're in Vegas I mean it looks like a hotel and it sounds like a club this is a dispensary holy [ __ ] I've never seen a dispensary that looks like this so this is the main cannabis shopping area and it's laid out kind of like a donut the outer and inner walls are lined with registers and there are no lines you kind of just walk around and peruse when you know what you want or if you have a question you just find someone with a red or black planet throw t-shirt and grab them and they will help you with whatever you need I found out all the bud tenders that planet throw team were really friendly I'm really helpful you could just tell they were a well-trained staff so the meat that the doughnut is filled with all these cannabis display cases they're grouped in sections by type so you have your edibles over here your vapors and your shatters and concentrates on this side and then you have flowers all over on another side you can get a good look and you know no one really bothers you you could just take your time throughout what you want and when you do need help you grab someone I must point out that planet 13 is one of these dispensaries where you cannot touch or smell any of the products so that's the downside Vegas has no doubt become a cannabis tourist destination and this set up is great because it allows tourists time to ask questions peruse but if you know what you want you can actually just jump behind one of the registers grab someone and then purchase what you need pretty quickly now I know some of you guys are taken aback by the price is shown here but let me tell you I come to plan 13 for the deals and also the product here is always top notch for example this is their mid grade XJ 13 and honestly it could be top-shelf at a lot of different dispensaries that I've been to and their top-shelf stuff is super super super high quality the thing is this is a dispensary that is located ten minutes from the strip so the prices you see are really meant for Taurus if you get on their daily deals SMS what you find is that they give incredible discounts for example this top-shelf a dub and grape valley kush normally 110 dollars sometimes it goes for 75 for a couple days they even had a fifth percent off sale let me do the math for you that means for this top shelf ounce you can get it for two hundred and twenty dollars for an ounce of some of the best flour that you can get that's a great deal you're paying way more for that if you've go to any dispensary in California and I don't think the stuff there is as good as the stuff I find here at Planet thirteen quick we got buns we got hand sanitizers we got pins we got shades and the colors lanyards we've even got some freaking headphones [Music] alright so we just got done with planet 13 and I think I was there for over an hour and a half pretty badass place definitely it was a pretty cool experience I can't wait till they open up the lounge which I have learned that is gonna happen in about five or six days they said November the 6th so we can come back here and actually you know smoke and that would be awesome I had a great time meeting other people here it was super cool and everybody was in a great mood you know definitely a new standard for the dispensary experience and they overall I guess cannabis consumption industry all right thanks for watching see you the next one have a great day",

with another taste test video and today we're trying pioneer squares from craft elixirs these are their vegan kosher gluten free um thc infused edibles this is their sour cherry fruit nom so go to get a good look at that there's a little whiteness or redness in there for the cherry contains all vegan kosher and gluten-free ingredients they use a alcohol extraction for their cannabis there is high fructose corn syrup and light corn syrup sugar and then some flavor extracts to add to it each of these are 10 milligrams of thc each they are by craft elixirs i've had their edibles a while ago like early in 502 and i thought they were pretty good um this is the first time i've ever done a taste test video on them i really like the packaging for just these singles um i think this works really good as a way to try a variety of flavors they do come in packages of 10 as well and then you get 10 of the same flavors i haven't seen a variety pack although that would be something cool to possibly explore the idea of i think a variety pack for edibles would be great especially if it gives everybody an opportunity to try a variety of different flavors uh it's packaged just in like this little bag cardboard backing with all the information on it so let's let's get to trying this i feel like it is going to taste a little bit like um i guess not like a sour patch kid like some of those gummy candies that we used to get kids used to eat all the time i need to find some keys real quick or a knife actually to get this open so let's try this packaging for edibles is never easy obviously they have to make it child proof so let's see what this first taste test tastes like it is kind of like stuck to the package i don't know if that was intentional but some of the cherry stuff came out it tastes a little bit like cherry cough syrup i'm not really getting like that sour bit kind of chewy it's like a like a soft sour patch kid almost with less sour like hard to chew but pretty good um first impressions were very cherry not as sour as i expected your cheek and i was kind of like stuck to my teeth but i would recommend these to anybody that's vegan gluten free and we just want like a a different taste on the edibles not always like the cookies i have to eat vegan and gluten free so the more i can find edibles like this the better so if you're in the wa in washington oregon or california and you have recommendations on edibles that i should review specifically vegans and vegan and gluten-free ones i'll be sure to drop those in the comments subscribe to the youtube channel

Xanax is one of the most prescribed psychiatric\nmedications in the United States., It\u2019s the brand name for alprazolam, a drug used\nto manage anxiety and panic disorders., It has also been used to treat depression, PMS,\nand chronic pain., When used as prescribed, it can be very beneficial. However, because of its calming effects, it\nis often misused to achieve a tranquil high. And taking more than the prescribed dose,\ntaking it more frequently, or taking it with other drugs or alcohol can be fatal., In just the first half of 2008, this class\nof drugs accounted for the second highest amount of overdose deaths in the state of\nFlorida. Of these 392 deaths, Xanax was responsible\nfor nearly 300 of them. The number of people admitted to addiction\ntreatment facilities in the U.S. for Xanax use has rapidly increased.

Xanax is a member of a group of medications\ncalled benzodiazepines., These drugs affect the central nervous system - the brain and\nnerves - to decrease abnormal excitement in the brain and create a calming effect., They do this by increasing the activity of\na chemical, called gamma-aminobutyric acid or GABA, that inhibits brain activity.,, This\ncreates less of a restraint on the brain\u2019s dopamine producers resulting in more dopamine,\nwhich controls the reward and pleasure centers in the brain.,,, This creates increased feelings\nof pleasure and decreased feelings of panic or anxiety. There are many potential side effects of this\nmedication, ranging from headaches, drowsiness, and nausea, to more serious ones like hallucinations,\nloss of coordination, and suicidal thoughts.,, Prolonged use can lead to dependence, and\nif stopped abruptly, patients can experience withdrawal or seizures.,, Dependence occurs when your body builds up\na tolerance for the effects of the drug, requiring a larger dose or an increased frequency of\nuse to achieve the same effect it had when you started taking it. This can develop into a physical dependency\nwhere your body doesn\u2019t function properly without it. Dependence can often lead to addiction or\na substance use disorder, which is generally defined as compulsive drug use despite the\nharmful consequences.,, If you think you have an addiction, contact\na treatment expert immediately.

think I was gonna get a Scooby Snack in this but like the stem is straight down there and water I mean obviously I don't know why I had to explain that to a lot of people who are probably getting stoned right now probably with a bubbler Oh speaking of this bubbler that purple color is so nice I think I don't know if you can see it but I know actually it is on the side it's kind of actually all in this backside and stuff but yeah I think it's really cool I wonder if this is gonna get like a lot of darker or something or like a lot more solid I guess but only time will tell so I know I I don't think I've ever mentioned this before on my videos but I want to start a restaurant where I infuse meals it was like everyday meals even salads just Medicaid pretty much anything even make raw cannabis smoothies for those who don't want to get high but still need like the relief from THC a like the brought a CA that's juice is like still really good so I want to do that but it's really trying to Park to do it restaurant style because or at least in Denver I as far as I know where the rules kind of like don't work out that way but I know there's some place here in the mountains that they do and fuse meals based on their the taste of certainly weeds I guess but cuz like this orange Hara wanna even though it's a really Orange II smell it tastes really mesquite and like is that the word I'm looking for smoky barbecue II so like it would be good on ribs or something excuse me but yeah so weeds weeds it sounds like I'm talking about like weeds that they grow in the grass but weed doesn't taste like it smells all the time so you kind of have to taste it to know what it tastes like you can't just smell it although sometimes it does taste like it smells so there's a thing that I kind of want to start doing like you know questions from various social media and I got one on Instagram today because I because I posted a picture and I said that I wanted to make a video and I didn't know what to talk about like things I asked for things to talk about and maybe some Q&A questions or other and I got one that was actually kind of interesting and it made me think that I really kind of want to keep doing things like this like go on Twitter or tumblr and ask people what they want to know or hear from me or whatever or something yeah there was a bug but yeah yes I am progressively getting hired in this video I mean not that that's surprising but it's a little surprising for me somebody who has a high tolerance and so I know you're waiting for me to state the question and the question was about smoking before sex it doesn't make it feel better and do you last longer smoking before sights lake doesn't make it feel better yes me partly because I do typically experience painless sex I have like many ovarian cysts I mean it's fine it just it's painful I guess that's what my doctor gave me basically but there might be other problems too but that's usually what I got sore so it does make it feel better but in terms of like if I wasn't in pain and if I smoked and buh-buh-bah or if I didn't feel pain and I was I did smoke before and had sex yes it does but it's also like I'm so engrossed in the situation like based on like touch and just even also like seeing it's kind of like a movie I guess like sex becomes an adventure when you're high I guess but and the last part is do you last longer I guess I really wouldn't know that because I haven't really timed the difference I don't really think about how much time is passing either so I mean and I also um I am generally high so I don't know when the last time was that I had sex I'm not high like completely sober so but if you want to answer that question leave it in the comments down below I'm about done with this bowl and I think I'm about done with this video stay starting everybody", "Hq4C4NRsrEc": "we'll put some more water these are his antics with the tools in the back supposed to be two milligrams annexes and they're all floating up like this that's how you can tell when you got fake xanex try your first ones try your first ones they dissolve like that you're getting [ __ ] so the whoopee-doo there's ass", "OL318Xj8pfI": "see a lot of people talk about the fact magic number of two milligrams xanax two milligrams comp and two milligrams what is with these with with two milligrams I don't understand it if you are trying to get off xanax or clumping or anything within the bends up medication family you know no matter what amount that you're on either two or four even a quarter of one and one day you will pretty much have the same side effects and if you're trying to throw you will have the same type of well yet you will eventually have the same type of withdrawal symptoms I've heard of people being being on xanax like maybe 0.5 milligram of xanax or clomping per day or 0.25 and they struggle they they go through the same type of symptoms as if somebody was taking four so it doesn't matter for taking two four six or or one milligram of day.i you're going to suffer the same so if you're not on xanax where any type of benzo I would say way from from it personally but if you think that you need some go to your doctor I hope to god that he won't give it to you okay just stay away from it okay if you liked this video you probably didn't because I'm running through a short series of videos on a xanax hit the es subscribe button underneath the video I would really appreciate it thanks guys"}
