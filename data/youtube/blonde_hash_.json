{"hzeQXnnbb20": "[Music] all right know what's going on everybody welcome back to a sight for sore eyes today's episode I've got some flour and I'm bringing out some Egyptian blonde hash now it's been a little while since I sat down and smoked on some hash myself so today's session is gonna be pretty lit we're going to take some flour and we're gonna take some of this Egyptian blonde - we're gonna break it up we're gonna put it into the old bong and we're gonna smoke it and see how it feels I just want to take a quick minute to thank everybody who's a new subscriber and all of my old ones thank you guys for watching and thanks everyone for hanging oh I hope y'all been having a great week so far things have been pretty good for me got to see a couple of my friends as well got to go check out a friend of Mines a male plant that he has on the go he's crossbreeding and it's about to produce seeds so I thought that was really cool so I wanted to show you guys back but other than that today is going to be fun so if you guys are looking to hang those in sesh along with me make sure you guys pack up a couple of bowls and break co2 dab whatever it is you need but we're getting into this so let's get down with this hash episode hope you guys like hash and I hope you like flour let's do it welcome back guys I'm actually pretty excited about this combination will go to do here it's been a bit since I've got to actually sesh on some hash and it's one of those things that I really like to have like you ever even if I'm not smoking it at the time it's nice to have a good chunk of hash you know put on reserve say Oh stashed away for another night I find hash is really good for like an evening smoke when you want you know some extra pain relief and sometimes you know your flower you just need to put something extra on it you know and I don't always like to use Keef sometimes I don't really get really like catch Mikey for anything at this point so I'm not like storing it so I don't put that on top so when I get something like hash it's always good to throw it on there and get a raise but no key here so I've got this rig all cleaned out we've got fresh water in here and I think it's time to get some smoke again so let's do it alright so the flower we got is some violator all right so we're gonna go in on some of this violator which is a really heavy indica but this particularly phyno I have is incredibly fruity the last strain of violator I had was very pungent kind of sour and sharp almost but this stuff it's definitely got a sweet berry kind of flavor it's pretty quarter number eight break open that nut man who smokes who lets her pee it's like blue a bit of a licorice and berries oh we're gonna we got some we've already busted up in the grinder here we're gonna load that into the bowl and then we're gonna burn up some of our house we've got some flour in the bowl here now we're gonna take our house and the way that I like to work my house okay so with this hash it's super song the only I can really is super solid the only like you really get it off is to like slamming of chunks or we're gonna try taking a lighter to it using it up and then now as you can see this is going to be used efficiently but it'll work for them all right so you got some cash flow just one up a nice half full and there's some good chunks in there we got another big chunk we're going to smoke but this is just a start so those are some big chunks and no whole our plan that's a good step 15 alright guys so here we go we've got our hash in the bowl which is the main thing so I think we could hit this make sure you guys are ready to go let's do it [Music] who you could definitely taste that hash or does it go very mild mild hash kind of flavor in the back you know how I was that like that deeply I don't know how to explain how now listen let's go with round two oh my god that is really smooth it's light I'm starting to get the hash actually burning in here now reason I've been going so slow is cuz I don't want to pull this whole bowl with that first puff I want to make sure I get all the hash burn oh my goodness so clean taste it like like for smoke being in your mouth it's like it doesn't give you that heavy tar kind of flavor you get from smoking normally very nice now you'll notice that there is a little bit of a black chunk there that didn't quite burn all the way but that's the game we play so let's see let's get another bowl ready to go can see we think alright now that is the second bowl you've definitely got a good-sized event a hash on here now so I think it's time we get it alright guys we've got a really good bowl loaded up here but what I'm gonna do just to touch off on it but just just to add to it a little bit its take some flour on my finger here doesn't crazy and we're just gonna get this on top and the idea behind this is hopefully that it's going to give a pretty even burn and this way we'll get all that hash burning the same time so we can crush the bowl seems to make sense right let's find it alright guys here we go oh it's so light so smooth oh I don't taste the flower at all and the [ __ ] later is strong [Music] [Music] Wow like that is super heavy and milked up really thick but my goodness like it's not hot in the lungs it's not hurt in the chest it tastes nice I've got at least one more bullet ash you at least so let's go ahead and finish this off finger greens oh yeah - alright here we go let's do this I don't know how that looks from you guys thankful but me I think that Ash got me oh definitely definitely a strong feeling I can feel it behind my eyes I can feel like my stomach is sweating my head is sweating however my lungs actually feel pretty good for the fact of just you know going through like a whole half gram of hash slamming some flour in there I'm feeling pretty good man so I hope you guys did get to smoke along and hope you guys enjoyed this video man there's anything else you guys want to see make sure you take the time to comment it down anything you want to see me upcoming episodes we can make that happen otherwise you know I hope you guys enjoyed the video but I think that's all the time we've got for today so with that being thin until the next time I'll catch those eyes around the way [Music] you", "mnqSYJhebyQ": "hey this is uncle stoner today we're going to be doing some various pressing we got some nice moroccan blonde hash here right there it's a nice hatch uh we also got there we go we got some cd celtic breath is what it is celtic breath see how that smells real quick oh it smells nice look at that you can see that still some uh water a little bit of a nice little crystalline leaves on there and stuff we're not going to trim it up we're just gonna smash it like that and see how it turns out so we got that celtic breath and then we got this new one that no one has ever seen it's a new one that just came out and it is called dorotheo g right dorothy o g o og dorothy og they say there's some uh water leaves on there stuff there's still some nice all right i don't know that well we're gonna show you how we're gonna take this and plus some old keith keeps you see the color right there from uh gdp from ken's gdp oh gd uh gdp 90 purple yep all right some old school granddaddy purple right there it is of course the color there let me show you is a little a little dark but still has a nice terpene smell to it i mean it is going to turn out a little you know a little dark when we press it so there you go and then of course then as i said the moroccan which also the moroccan because of it the way it's they they make and everything no matter what when you press it you're still going to get some dark rise from it it's going to be dark it's not to come out nice blonde or anything like that it will be dark because well start out dark of course once you put on a microscope you can see the difference you'll see gold beautiful but the thc level of this is that i'm multiplying it's going to go up high we've squashed some stuff like this over in amsterdam and it went up to over 70 percent thc level after squash so that's gonna be good so all right so we're gonna go ahead and get everything ready and loaded up and we'll start doing some squashing here thanks all right so we're gonna load this up in here it's a little sticky in there nice and sticky this is four grams of lebanese blonde hash you know it's a good stuff if you have a gold stamp on the back of they actually stamp it with this gold leaf stuff all right so we got the rosin bag all loaded up there ready to squash we're gonna do doing a 166 temperature right there all right so right now we got the hash loaded up into the press and we're gonna start pressing it in one second all right so we got it loader up there now we're gonna go first lower it down to right when it hits the material right now okay so it's sitting there you want to let it sit there for 10 to 20 seconds the best way to do work with hash i've learned is you push it down once you feel it hit you hold it there and once you can sit there and let it press down a little bit more without resistance you keep on letting it go because if you press it too fast and too quick you can wind up having a blowout okay so you see there we're already getting uh some rosin coming out right there we also got some coming out on the side back here also if you can see right back there where it's dark and stuff that's also the rosin coming out we're gonna go and pull this one because you can always re-press so let's see how this one turned out as i said it's going to come out dark but the potency level on this is going to be very insane and very high pun intended and of course i said you can repress that because you can see that there is still some rosin in there so we'll repress that bag again and get some more yield out of it so there you go there's some squash and some rock and hatch excuse me lebanese hash next because it's the same temperature we're going to be doing this keefe we already started to get it loaded up in the bag there and this is a what 25 micron right here we're using i believe oh 37 micron alright so we got the bag almost all loaded up that we should get a nice return on this as i said i'm not sure if it's gonna be that light it might come out a little darkish because this is some older teeth right here i'm not sure exactly how old it is do you know about half a year about a half a year old so this is about six months old or so all right so the keith and the flower is from celtic cannabis all right and we're going to double bag this because i think this is gonna be a little viscous and it also hopefully it'll keep from having any uh first bag burst we're gonna do this one low and slow same temperature as the ash all right so we got it all load loaded up and let's start to press all right you just want to let it hit there we go let it sit there all right so we're gonna polar up you can see here coming out a little bit there this is the key we did have to turn up the heat just a little bit just to get her oh look at that there we yeah look at that and i said there's still some more more stuff in there that we can press out of this bag all right so check out the next video for us pressing the flower", "ijtZJKrfSGw": "what's going on YouTube straining of you Saturday today we're looking at my black hash here supposed to be 1/2 ounce buddy said it was made from just like the trim from everything all the different strains

hash to a hundred bucks for a half ounce it's better I had gotten that kind once and uh that's a lot harder a lot greener this is still good though like for 70 bucks can't go wrong oh yeah I forgot to lay it out for you guys getting too excited and jumping the gun Triton meanie 70 bucks not bad see how much this one weighs 8.3 1.46 see how long this little chunk last me see that I don't know if that's from the coffee table that little leaf it's gotta be yeah it's from the coffee table oh yeah man ash I love having this kind of hash or any kind of hash actually I got some of the the hybrid from the mystery cannon here just a little bit check out my Instagram guys it's Gaucher grows famous my YouTube handle it's got all the pictures and stuff on there of all this I was excited for hash

the Samer can make about thirty five US dollars a day cannabis and hashish product derived from the resin of the plant is being produced here much of it by Syrian refugees desperate for even risky

[Music] you", "94iivc9-ByI": "[Music] [Applause] hey howard is everybody doing out there hope you're all staying safe and healthy out there listen we got a new video coming up here for you it's kind of a a repeat of something we had before but um i thought maybe some of you guys uh wanted to see this again and uh we're gonna show it again so um we're gonna make some tumble some i'm gonna tumble some herb we're gonna make ourselves a nice nice little ball of hash kind of our old school way we're gonna tumble collect the kif and then we're gonna we're gonna bind it with some nice pho honey or something or or some isopropanol oil we're not quite sure yet but the first step of the whole thing is is tumbling out the uh the goodness out of this so uh we're going to use this this tumbler that i built in one other episode um showed you guys how to build one of these you know if you were handy with stuff and uh this is what we're gonna use so uh let's get it going um first thing i did was i i vacuumed out the chamber just in case there was any dust or dirt or pet hair or anything like that in there and uh this weed i'm using is just let's get the rest sticking to the side of the bag it's just some uh just all some um cut offs and trimmings from from the last one so uh yeah little bugs inside lots of nice little button there so what we're going to do is i'm going to load this thing up and we're going to uh we should make sure that we don't have this inside the machine because you don't want to drop any leaf in there so let's get it started all we got to do guys is open this chamber up i'm going to take this out of there and i'm gonna i'm gonna dump bag one in there just like that oh stevie's so allergic to this dust it's crazy man he just sets him off or a guy he can smoke it but he can't really handle this stuff okay so there goes number two all right throw in bag number three even and lots of little butt in there and a hell of a lot of leaf all right just like that let me get the lid close that up there shuffle it around i'm gonna okay the chamber looks pretty clean i'm gonna add this in there down it goes okay i'm gonna get the cord and plug it in just give me a second and i'll i'll get this all hooked up okay all right guys i got it rolling um i want you can see it's starting to fall out of there like crazy already i want to close it up because it's currently flying out too look at that really starting to come out so uh we're gonna close this i'm gonna run this guys for 15 minutes that's it and then that should give me the blondest of the blonde uh crystals and not too much leaf and dirt in there so um i'll show you what it all looks like okay all right guys we're back and uh this has been exactly 10 minutes since we started let's pop it and see excuse me oh here i'll lift it out we'll see it actually smells pretty spicy oh wow looks pretty good eh oh i bet you that's a lot once you start scraping it let me see i'll check the screen okay let me grab a little scraper and let's see what it does this looks like nice material though that's what it does today wow yeah oh does that look like nice material nice and blondy beautiful make sure your stuff's nice and clean yeah you got to go through it yeah so listen um this was a 10 minute tumble that's all i'm gonna do with it um from this point here we're gonna save this and we're gonna make ourselves a batch of hbo honey oil and then we're going to blend it so we'll get back to you on this when we're ready to blend it okay right nice powder smells good so anyways you know when we ex did this tumble for the hash um we ended up with this much um i showed you last time there we're gonna we're gonna use this to make some of that old school hash where we where we end up binding this with some we're gonna bind it with some honey oil that i'm gonna make i had some other uh some other shake kicking around some trimmings to it i tumbled it for 10 minutes and i ended up with this so i got i got two here that are gonna work pretty good this was already getting packed in there but um this is what we're gonna use i'm gonna start with this stuff first and then if i need more i'll add some of this to it so uh come with me and i'll show you how i'm gonna start making the honey oil to combine with this kif to make some nice hash all right all right guys so i'm doing this outside because it's a lot safer do this outside whenever you do this but um i've been extracting with the green machine here um butane extraction here with some of the cuttings i had and trimmings so so far i have already done uh a couple tubes of this already and i got one more to go here that i'm gonna run through uh with the green machine here and uh get it going there see it's starting so i'm going to finish this extracting and then i'm going to cook this stuff off into some honey oil just evaporate it good till all the bubbles are gone and then we're going to bind it with that kif i got all right so stay with me for now all right guys um i've been evaporating this for a while on the heating pad here i got it cranked up to 160. um it's pretty chilly outside we got snow out here see so um i'm gonna get this till it goes down all the way and then i'm gonna put it on a hotter element to make it into honey oil before we blend it with the uh with the kiff okay yeah so we'll let this we'll let this keep going for a little while here yet all right guys so i brought this inside now because it's it's kind of doable like we got like lots of ventilation in my garage here but um as you can see it's getting down getting down it's almost down all the way here um i'm just going to keep showing you as i go along here as it evaporates so it's picking up speed a little bit because it was so cold outside i couldn't even get this to go to 160 but um it should come back up here and and melt all that down and then we'll put it on a little bit hotter heat to get rid of all the butane all right all right it's still going here that ugly waxy looking stuff all kind of melted back in now because it's warmer so uh it's bubbling away here it's got a little ways to go and then we're going to get ready to add some of this nice this nice kit here we got okay i guess i got a little too closer with the lens all right yeah hey guys so i've um i've switched it up now from this pad that i was using right here this little uh like digital one which is really safe to use at the beginning when there's lots of fumes and stuff and you don't want nothing to ignite on you this is the way to go but it only goes to 160 mine and it just doesn't seem to get it quite quite hot enough for what i want to make into honey oil so now i've switched it up to this old one element uh old style here because the fumes coming off here isn't gonna be nothing real serious i gotta watch because i got some air move in here there's at this point here there's there's still some in it and it is ignitable but it'd be easy to put put out so i feel pretty safe doing it like this um so see how when i agitate it there's lots of bubbles still coming see that so i i like i like a temperature more like about 180. it seems to get it going just a little bit extra i know heat you know kills a little bit of the of everything from it but um trying to do this demonstration for you guys making it quick um so once this once this keeps going and i'm almost free of bubbles and it's turning into some nice honey oil i'm gonna then add the kiff like i've been saying to you guys to make it into hash ball so stay with me okay hi there guys so so it's almost there now ready to mix with the hash i got it there's some micro bubbles in there but uh it's close another couple minutes and i'm gonna wait till it's really clear like this and then i'm gonna take it out and uh i'm gonna take some out and leave some in the bowl and then i'm gonna add the powder to the bowl and mix it in this bowl it's all sticky already so um give me a minute i'll find myself a container and we'll carry on with this all right all right guys we're back so i ended up taking that much out of it and i left that much in there now i'm going to take the kif that i have here i'm going to dump some in there i'm going to dump more in there turn it in there like i'm making soup i'm gonna put more in there more put the whole damn thing in there i'm gonna mix it this is nice honey oil now i'm mixing it with so this this is going to take a little while and i got extra powder here to make the texture just right because it looks like there's a lot more oil right now than there is a kiff here okay let me uh at this point you're right i like to use a spoon nice clean spoon here sort of press okay so let me keep turning this this lovely goo it's way way too uh oily right now so we're gonna add some of this other kit we have get all this stuff started to clean out pretty nicely looks like we're gonna probably need most of it oops i see i uh a hair in it there looks like we're gonna need almost all of it i bet any money so guys i'm gonna keep turning this stuff i'm gonna i'm gonna probably put it into a uh a ziploc bag and uh step on it crush on it and keep working this all in there together see that oops texture is looking pretty good eh it's like once it all oops once it all comes together starting to get there look at that so let me uh let me work this a little better okay and uh i'll show you uh a little further down the road all right guys it's looking pretty nice i'm gonna i'm gonna put it in a bag now and and start to really uh squish it really good okay okay so i got it all in a baggie here now all right so now i'm going to uh now i'm going to start working it squishing it all right so i turned it here for a few minutes in a bag i'm still work i'm still working it but you can see how it's starting to turn all black looking really nice feels like really nice like a i nailed the texture the combination between the powder and the and the oil oh yeah it's a real nice ball it's it's getting there i'm gonna i'm gonna keep working it and then i'm gonna show it to you guys once i pull it out of the plastic hey guys so uh finally finished that hash and uh just trying a nice little nice little reef rubber right here is it ever sweet tasting tasting so nice well after i had it in that baggie and i squished it in that baggie and i i put that baggy i had the baggie in my shoe and i i walked with it underneath my heel for about half an hour and ended up with this nice nice nugget of it here um so nice this is don't forget this is some good kiff now and this is blended with some honey oil it's a little sticky on the outside as you can hear okay but um overall it's going to dry out it was just blended i'll crack it open i'll let you have a look on the inside look at that isn't that some nice hash look at that you can just see the crystal in it look at that there beautiful blend but anyways uh yeah so this is how i like making my hash this is nice strong hash and i hope this has been helpful uh hey um wanted to let you know so this this was all made um with the cuttings and trimmings okay and i ended up with this much honey oil too which is really nice nice honey oil here see-through this is what i use that i used to put the kiff together to make this so thanks for watching stay in touch keep your green thumbs up and we'll catch you on the next one right on [Music] you", "kBu2G1-upTU": "okay so if they were making hash bricks have two bowls 47 grams of Bruce Banner keep two bowls of 45 grams gold and ice aluminum brick and a couple of these parchment pieces brick is presses a brick of hash perfectly take a spoon take our key oh my cause on us so very pretty stuff press it down press it into the corners to the edges gently this is a fluffy Keith takes up a lot more space than it usually does and every strain is different can you grab me a business card kind of just flatten it out on the top roll around the edges this is because you want to be able to tuck your parchment into these edges nice type of cover battle machine in search ii parchment drop the top of the brick very carefully say you know ship the parchment around we lost about a third of a gram right there but such as like things happen give it a good squeeze we're gonna wrap it a couple of sheets of paper towel and we were going through our vise Jimmy because it will not fit into our press unless we clamp it with everybody so I'll be back in just a minute one all right so we're starting with our brick this thick and we are going to squeeze it down until it is about half as thick squeeze it hand tighten the vise at room temp flip it over just so this is even as we can make it and then it's back to the heat press it's now that thick so we have our heat press heated up to 105 degrees ours only presses on the bottom so we have to keep it sealed to get heat to transfer to the top and because it only heats on the bottom we're gonna take the thick chunk of our plate and put that on the bottom that's where most of the heat needs to penetrate this top plate is much thinner and much easier for heat to just pass right through so it'll go on the top side which is warm but doesn't have the doesn't have the extra power that the bottom side has this will lose its heat very quickly we only have it up to 105 degrees because we don't want to squeeze our our hash out through the sides this will want to retain a nice brick form we wanted to only really hash over on the outer layers and have the inside remained remain as a pristine as possible so before I run and I want to show you what it looks like well I guess I can't this papers aren't your type it was very tan yeah it's a very blonde and yellow when we put it in open the press fixing it on the bottom Center it in the press lever shut I always forget yeah to make sure it's nothing it's not squeezing too far give about 15 seconds and then you're gonna pull it out and it should be a darker color with a really nice gummy consistency something kind of like oh I don't know yeah something like that now these little blocks often get stuck if they do you can use where's my little rubber string use one of these little things to get up in there kind of force the park I didn't take a lot did it down to parchment one does two fingers push it down a little bit the other side two fingers in the corner and fold it up okay very clean you get a look closely camera yeah not a lot of residue at all it's good brick has been sufficiently cooked trim up the edges a little should you do that with a knife but don't want to cut your little papers cuz these things take forever to make and there you go oh wow yeah break a hash and a consistency go a little lower with your hands there you go oh yeah what kind of smell would you just go coming off that very high and carry off lean carry a filing tomato tomahto very high in Mersin kinda like cheesy mm-hmm grandma's Bistro mouth mm-hmm yes that's how we make a hash brick awesome and then for chopping so plate clean this is for chopping we just have it Oh first we should weigh it we going wreck it this brick weighs 47 grams pretty much every brick weighs 47 I'm sure those chocolate we I set it long ways yeah something like that tell is epic and then yeah it's chopped but we want to do that here at here as well yeah thanks a lot elbow grease doesn't it oh yeah whole lot of love goes into this product if you are a consumer and we're unaware takes me a whole lot of blood sweat and tears to make your tasty hash there's no real blood here but yeah hopefully no sweat yeah making some nice tootsie rolls huh yeah this stuff stuff is quite gummy it's very easy sometimes it's kind of powdery doesn't want to cut up very easy every stream behaves differently and also ending on how old it is how cold it is ki prefers to be cooled and also just the different temperatures at which you press this break out if you use no heat it will not really form up into this gummy consistency a more powdery want to fall right apart to use too much heat it'll turn black nasty and might squeeze up out the sides of your press all sorts of problems this looks like chocolate doesn't so yeah break me off a piece of that fat hash bar seriously oh yeah a little farther down there yeah beautimous ha and yeah that's how we make it that's how we make it guys and won't you tell the folks who you are I'm Josh I'm the processor here tops off campus for a little while longer this is my keys my process hey guys I'm Mike thanks for watching if you like to see please like share and subscribe we love you Josh", "hQ-2ooQuUkU": "[Music] hi and welcome to canada basics today we're going to learn how to make bubble hash [Music] bubble hash is one of the oldest and purest methods of making concentrated cannabis and uses only ice and water as a solvent it's easy to do but requires time patience and some elbow grease so let's get started here's what you need to make bubble hash when it comes to making bubble hash you are going to need some bubble bags and these are usually vinyl bags that are designed to fit inside of one gallon or five gallon buckets and they have a silk or micron screen bottoms and those that vary in different sizes 25 to 220 microns and you're going to need three to five different sizes of those you can find links to those kinds of bags on amazon in the description you're also going to need a wooden dowel to agitate the cannabis you're going to need some ice about 10 15 pounds of ice you're also going to need some cannabis you can use any grain of cannabis that you want for here we're going to use about three or four ounces of outdoor grown cannabis if you're using outdoor grown cannabis or any kind of cannabis you're going to go ahead and manicure it down to its buds so go ahead and pull off the major portion of the leaves until you get down to the pods unless you're actually using shake and trim which you can also make bubble hash out of shake and trim but we're using the buds and we're going to go ahead and manicure that down the next thing you're going to do is to layer your bags inside of the bucket we're using a five gallon bucket you may use a one gallon bucket also depending on the bags that you have but the thing that you want to do is you want to layer your screens inside of the bucket starting with the smaller screen first so in this case we've put our 25 micron screen in then we put our 73 micron screen in now we're putting our 160 micron screen in and then lastly we'll be putting our 220 micron screen back in and micron screens and that a micron is the measurement of microns with 220 microns means that 220 microns will fit through each hole in that screen and then so the smaller the number the smaller the size of the holes so and now that we've added our screens and layered them up and now we've added our cannabis into our 220 micron screen we've added about three or four ounces of cannabis and then now we're adding in ice now the ice is being used in this case to lower the temperature so that it freezes the trichomes and so that the stems of the trichomes are brittle and the trichome heads break off into the water so you want to use as much ice as possible so we're putting as much ice in we're covering up our cannabis and we're coming about six inches from the bottom of our pocket and now we're also going to add water and you want to add water so that it covers up into barely covers the cannabis which is in the the bottom of our top bag so you can tilt the screens or tilt the bucket to find out if see if you estimate if you have enough cannabis enough water to cover your cannabis but that's the idea is that you want to have enough water to cover your cannabis as well as up into the eyes and what we're doing is we're freezing the the trichomes so that the stems become brittle and the trichomes heads fall off and the idea is that to break and agitate the cannabis so now we're agitating turning and using our wooden dowels to actually literally just agitate and mix the cannabis being sure not to poke holes into our micron screens we're going to keep agitating as much as possible you can do this for several minutes 15-20 minutes or so and then after you do that you're going to let it settle and we've uh what we've done is we've broken frozen those trichrome heads and we've letting them uh fall into the water and then they've fallen through those micron screens and this larger micron screen we're now taking that out it's been several minutes after it's been agitated and it's been sitting for about 45 minutes and now we're taking out the the top screen the 220 micron and setting it aside and now we're going to pull up our first green which will have trapped some of the uh larger pieces of cannabis and our thc and trichomes and also some plant material so this first layer of screens that we're pulling out is going to be our least pure it's going to have our most plant material it's our biggest micron screen and most of the thc has actually fallen through this screen so but you can see there we've pulled out a little bit of bubble hash there and it's a darker color hash and then now we're pulling out our second screen and in order to uh save the cannabis that was left on the screen that we didn't wash off we're inverting it carefully and then dipping it back into the next green down into the water that's in that screen and that is to wash the trichomes off into that next screen so now we're removing the second screen out i believe this would be our uh 73 micron screen and we're we're letting the water fall out of that we're not going to squeeze it we're gonna let it fall out and then you can see now that the trichomes that are left there a little lighter color than the first set and there's also more of them and there's a lot less plant material here as you can see compared to the previous hash that came out it's a lot lighter color but again we're rinsing the remaining hashtag we didn't scrape off into the next batch or into the last screen so we make sure our screen is nice and clean and then we've come to our last screen and this is our 25 micron screen and we'll see this is the finest screen and this is going to make sure that pretty much anything left on here that's any thc is going to get trapped in this screen here and as we scrape that up you can see it's pretty easy to collect the cannabis or the thc that's collected there or the hash and it's a nice uh lighter a little more blonde color than the previous two a little bit more pure and you can see that's why those screens are used so that you can get different grades of hash and the next step now a lot of people would use a micro on screen here we didn't have a micron screen we're just using some cheese cloth or a muslin cotton muslin bag here and we're squeezing out the water it's just being pressed out gently with some palm pressure there to press out the water and what's going to be remaining is bubble hash and what we've got here is three different grades of bubble hash depending on the three different screens that we used and and in the end we're actually going to combine all of our hash altogether so i'm just showing you the different screens there for demonstration purposes but if you're only going to use one grade of hash in the end uh there's really no need to have multiple screens you might just use one or two screens in that case but for demonstration purposes we're using multiple screens to show how you'd get different grades of hash and now that we've uh we've gone one run of our canvas you can do this two or three different times or even up to five or more times with each batch of cannabis so this is the second run with the same batch of cannabis just with another run of the water and ice this one actually sat overnight this second run we got a pretty good yield off of it even better than the first and then we even decided to go ahead and run a third run off of the same batch of cannabis and so even after collecting two pretty good batches of bubble hash with it we went ahead and decided to go the third one and even after the third running we're still getting some more hash out of it you can see after the third time the cannabis is getting it looks like a lot like seaweed it's very foamy it get agitates a lot easier and it also gets foams up a lot easier as the last two or three batches were gone but once they pressed out the the phone goes away and you can see that there are three different batches of bubble hash there at different stages of drying out and you can see that the uh the newer batch is much muddier looking uh the batch in the center there is the first batch we did is dried out from overnight this episode of cannabis is brought to you by the

"you're live um blowing out all right so when i'm doing um dry ice what i gotta get together is i got about 15 i'm gonna guess about 18 pounds of dry ice the 5 gallon bucket um and a bubble bag so the bubble bag i like this one is a work bag um i would guess this one is like a 220 micron so it's pretty breezy so i use um whatever bubble bag is your work bag that's pretty much where i base my stuff out at and then you go about grades about how long you shake it at that point instead of trying to go through micron bags the super easiest way um so i already got a couple of things in there so what i'll do is i will fill all of the flour in there this one is fresh cut so i'll just take it and with my index finger and my thumb just pull it and then just pull it all clean and not have to trim it in there this is a super easy way when you have to do a lot of material you can just get it done quickly and then it really just doesn't put a lot of resin on your hands still because all that resin's pretty much on the top of the leaf so we're going underneath all that you can imagine if you got a lot of outdoor this would be like so quick and fast and then when you see the process you'll understand how you can get a lot of material done especially let's say if you put it in like a five gallon bucket of water and kind of let it sit there for a while while you're doing the rest of the plants but this is a way that if you have all that larf if you have any extra bud that's just small or some plants just didn't turn out really good all the way this is a way to just get a whole bunch of all the trichomes off of that thing in a matter of a couple of minutes and then be able to smoke it right down so you're not wasting anything i already trimmed off pretty much all the leaves that weren't sugar leaves and then i'm pretty much left with just the material you can do this dry um i've done it dry a lot i take off everything that isn't sugar leaves if it's dry and then what i'll do um is put a hundred grams into this five gallon bucket with about 10 pounds of ice is is a great ratio i like wet or fresh because um you get a lot a lot less organics in there and all you get are the trichomes because you're not breaking up the leaf and then the leaf is falling through along with your trichrones because they're getting busted up and becoming smaller all you got is trichomes because your organics are still wet and the fiber's still there to keep everything together so that's why i like doing it that way what i'm left with is how i don't know maybe like one fifth of this bucket full of fresh the fresh is starting off looking like that not superpower but enough to where when i'm done i'm going to be super glad i went through this process i spent 22 dollars on my dry ice and then um after that's done then you add the dry ice be uber careful you can think i've been burned on this a couple of times and i'll show you where i get burned but this stuff will burn you but i try to get it down to about um half the size of an ice cube and then some ice cube sizes you know some bigger so i will add everything on the top oh yeah this piece is wanting this big chunk together that tells me that i got some pretty good dry ice really fresh stuff if i didn't get fresh stuff i would be looking at um and i'm closing my eyes while i do this if i didn't get flat stuff they would come apart a lot easier oh man if your chunks are too big they'll just pulverize it and they won't really get everything critically cold you don't want all big chunks you want even some fine powder in there that fine powder gets everywhere and it will seriously get this stuff to core temperature really fast i am going to have to use a different tool this is providing a little bit of a problem come in with a hammer thank you beautiful assistant all right [Applause] a little bit to mix everything around and then this is the point where you want to leave it sit a sec now that that's going down i'll take my bag and i'll pop that bad boy over the top this goes all the way down until i have mine goes around the side and comes down my work bag so i get to actually have a lot of area but you want all screen on the edge of this bag and then i take this zip that pretty tight this will help for when we're popping it upside down because all this bag is going to want to do is slip and then from there you want to let it set for about five minutes so it can get super duper cold this is the part where i usually smoke a bowl because this next part sucks balls and once you start you basically can't stop the next part's gonna take about 30 minutes there's two eight to ten minute sections where i'm gonna take this bucket turn it upside down if i turned it upside down then i'm going to be shaking it over the the paraffin which is going to catch all the key and then later i'm going to be able to scrape that up and do a second one and then a third one my first run my first eight ten minutes will dump me a nice amount of keith that's gonna be top shelf keith great smoke your first um even couple of minutes will be blonde so if you even wanted to separate that out you could separate your blonde out and then keep going and then your second 8 to 10 minute shake will be a really good smoke but it starts to get a little bit of organics in there your third shake and you can do that until the end of time and that will provide you with all your cooking material you can put that in olive oil you can put that in anything and it's seamless you can't even taste it um usually i use that for oils and alcohol expression you'll also notice when your bucket's getting good because the sides will start getting frosty and this is telling me that the bucket's getting to temperature i don't really want to shake it until it gets to super temperature if you shake it too early before then what you're going to find is it takes a while for the keith to actually go through and then at some point there's this flood that starts happening and that's when it's at core temperature so you want to do that right away and not rough up as much organics as possible and that's what's happening by your second and third one it is pulveric by the time i take this off and show you the material it will basically be down to ground dust so that's why you keep degrading as time goes on but i definitely like this better than water because you don't have to dry it you don't have to filter it through that 20 micron bag that takes like an hour to eight hours to overnight to even drain out and then you're smoking it right away and i've had blonde hash out of here as blonde as almost the card that i scrape it with white so i mean you can get really good quality and the amount you get out of this is way more than you're gonna get out of water and um man almost as much as you're gonna even get out of bho you can take the keith and do just about anything with it i smoke it with bud but um you can smoke it straight which i will do right away my favorite part of this whole process the fresh keef basically tastes just like scissor hat it's something that people don't usually experience this is really super [ __ ] cold on my leg now i'm going to turn this over and right when i turn it over it's basically up now i'm gonna have to at some point turn this back over and take a rest because i'm not he-man or superman or even a muscular individual really so i have to take breaks with this 10 15 pound weight but um when i do that sometimes ice gets caught in these crevices and then when i flip it back over and put my pinky on it like this what i'm actually doing is contacting the ice that's how i freezer burn my finger a big hunk of skin fell off it kind of sucked so i'm really conscious of that part that's at this point probably the only way you're gonna get burned [Applause] all right here we go i like an up and down motion [Applause] that'll give me a good indication of how good okay that's the first minute out of our let's say eight or ten our first run so this would be like our blonde hash let's see where we're at also we don't want any wind current in here this stuff will drift like everywhere and my wife will kill me so let's see where we're at i mean i wouldn't say that it's blonde like white but i would definitely say if i slap that on the table i don't think anyone's gonna be like oh dude i don't smoke this has a ton of terpenes in it now that it's fresh this has like a ton of terpenes versus dry the only thing that i have to be concentrating on with using fresh versus the dry is i really need to dry this out this needs to set out and not in a plastic bag or anything i usually just fold over one of these paraffins for about 48 hours um it takes a while to get this all dry there's the ama card that's one minute it's probably enough to fit in the palm of my hand that's pretty awesome sample one plop that so let's go down the rabbit hole see what seven minutes with us because i'm guaranteeing now we're at core those are temperature favorite part i bet this is my family's favorite part too in the living room i still only got one viewer sometimes i gotta scrape the ends too because it gets a little stuck on there [Applause] so dude i gotta get lacking too i seriously gotta get a credit this is like that sawyer like this is actually a lot of fun like i gotta really say i'm having a blast doing this are you sure you don't want me to operate the camera you get it behind here and shake a couple 20 minutes up so i can on i don't have to scrape it off of both just have to scrape it off oh man this stuff's so wet and gooey i don't have that option sick so that is probably like another five minutes you can see the color difference right off the longer i go the more i start popping in some more organics which if you flushed everything and have everything right it's actually not that bad but if you didn't flush everything or you had a mistake that you had to harvest early because something happened and you didn't get to flush it in time um that first batch last really still tastes good once you start integrating that non-flushed organic now you're asking for it mine happened to be i would say pretty flushed so i should be straight but still i know if the second batch could actually be not the best badge or it could be all right which the way this is shaking i think i hope it's all right no questions yet because i'm so [ __ ] thorough with this goddamn tutorial sweet i like that [ __ ] cobra cat even though that's wet you can get the and i'll still pop that in the bong and it'll go down to white ash that wetness will go away real quick [Applause] oh yes drop [Applause] absolutely yeah okay so one it started slowing down and two if we start looking at the color now we got green that's telling me this is the very the very cutoff of smoke ability once it starts going green i have a lot of trichromes in there i have a lot of really good active organics in there but what it's probably going to be is a little too harsh to really be called good keith so if i keep going i'm going to be going into baking territory which honestly i could eat an honest amount i could eat a yard amount of edibles and not get high so i don't really want to go into cooking territory so i will stop here so let's see we got cause i'm betting the shit's fire what did that take like 10 15 minutes if this was dry i definitely would have gotten more out of this but since i did it wet it's actually going to be a little bit more quality but a lot less quantity usually what i get back is about anywhere from 20 to 33 percent 25 return on dry totally easy so this will get a 25 return on your dry if your dry is any squat of good even doesn't even have to be super fire oh i thought that was gonna be a lot more [ __ ] rounds dude it was a little disappointing this not like my material was super fire to begin with and had a ton of trichomes to begin with so honestly this kind of makes sense you know usually i would be expecting at least probably double this to three times more so this is cool but how much dry ice did you use there was 15 18 pounds in this one that's pretty good exactly like it smells um super smooth i cannot hardly even feel the smoke it is wet so you would think this is pretty much the harshest doesn't necessarily have to be that way when it dries out it can get maybe a little harsher when it dries out it could actually smooth out so that's why you want to let this dry out usually what i would do is just fold it over tear this section off leave it overnight and then flip it like a pancake every 12 hours or something and then make sure the other side dries out and yadda yadda because this as you can see it it wants to stay it has the consistency of um that play sand that you can form that's exactly how this feels so it wants to keep that form and that's that's why it's hard you got to get all the way in there to get all of that moisture out and yes i'm going to smoke this whole thing so i'm grabbing it with my goddamn fingers if you are wondering so uh that is the whole process for making ice hatch so if you have a whole bunch of larp at the end whole bunch of plants that don't make it good at the end um no one's gonna [ __ ] do [ __ ] with them you want to even cook with them turn them into keef this keef is going to go into butter easy oil easy you're not going to have to do this double boiler you're not going to have to do a straining process you leave that keith in you don't even have to straighten it out so you put it in oil heat the oil up boom you're done and it won't even taste like there's cannon in there so you can put it in stuff like candy and everything that would be frankly kind of weird it tasted like that cherry canna does not taste good pineapple can it does not taste good either i found so i kind of use like this stuff and then you could even use this stuff for cooking but um usually what i'll do is dry all this out put it in a bag after it's all dry and dusty and then i will put like an ounce into that bag here and then shake it up and then you have keith covered um buds are called out here they're called moon rocks basically so yeah that's what you do with all the stuff that you usually put in the garbage or not know what to do with bam i got mine at safeway um i think it's like 210 a pound that's basically it y'all i've had a [ __ ] of a day you guys got any more questions see what the difference is i wish i had actually had a torch for this it is pretty flat that great's not that bad either i could almost mix those together but i don't want to do that i think i want to separate those yeah they're still a little wet but it was it's not that bad at all i definitely know that green's probably something i don't want to [ __ ] with but those two first grades are actually pretty good i would say i got probably close to 27 grams between those two grades i would bet somewhere pretty close to there maybe 20. let's be safe at 20 and 21. but um pretty good amount for just putting some stuff in that was mid light that was mids for sure and then that came out really good now now it's something i can actually be enjoying the smoke i'm gonna wake up and then just be like oh hell yeah let's pack a bullet you know i wouldn't be waking up and just being like oh yeah let's wake up and fill a whole blunt full of mids yeah [ __ ] that but now it's actually something that's desirable um and that i can use so i will see you guys later", "AORyULfIRe0": "yo yo yo what's good youtube welcome to another live stream i'm going to raise you up just a bit sweet so gopro updated and um my new wi-fi router is in we're showing signal strength here for the stream decent it didn't show that before so now that's pretty good to see anyways let me go ahead and share the link out to instagram and we're going to go ahead and get started uh all right cool well glad we got that up and running let me go ahead and uh get this stream up on my computer oh you're right let's see i'm sure you guys want to see some of this stuff that i have here before we even get started right let me show you what we got going on first of all we weighed everything out earlier we uh pulled it out of the freeze dryer fresh this morning fat fat nineteen point four percent yield killed it one thousand one hundred and thirty grams of nug went in 220 grams of full spectrum hash came out as well as 19 grams of 25 and 160 micron so this is our test press that we use for edibles and then we'll go ahead and press out the rest of these full spectrum pucks i loaded them by hand into the bags and then after putting them in the bags i pressed them down in a rosin evolution pre-press to make sure that they stayed nice and tight and they are evenly distributed went up from uh the small little four ounce jars and uh upgraded to the six ounce jars i got tired of filling those little small ones to the brim and i said it's time to upgrade baby so we got the jar all weighed out we'll be able to weigh this when we're done tonight and see what our final yield was on this run now i'm a big fan of doing my presses a little bit warmer than what most people would i'm using my stool for you guys today so i'm gonna do this but um yeah you guys that watch me often know i will press anywhere from 200 to 225 depending on the cultivar depending on the hash um not all hash comes out the same um for example we talked about trichome density before right we talked about just because it looks like a lot of hash it may not be a lot of hash because um the oil inside may not be full you know what i'm saying the trichome may just be partially full in that case it's fluffy hash where it looks like a lot but it doesn't weigh a lot that's why this 25 micron and this 160 micron it looks like a large puck but it only weighs 19 grams compared to this puck which is smaller in comparison by about a centimeter right and it's not as fat but it weighs more probably about five to six grams more and that's because this is the full spectrum 45 through the 159 which contains higher density trichomes that are full of milk oil compared to the 25 and 160. so just a little throw that in there for you interior genetics what's going on asteroid farms if you guys aren't following asteroid farms on instagram go follow so old homie of mine platinum grove colorado who used to have a really pimp-ass girl room the nasa lab right um one of the inspirations for me initially stepping up my garden well now it's his turn to come back and he just got a brand new house with a nice ass basement and guess what it's time for a brand new build out so we're gonna help each other out take some ideas off of each other and i'm basically gonna have him record the whole thing and um show you guys how he does his build out you know and he'll give you guys pointers along the way and uh you know show you how to build a grow room so by the time you know he's done with that uh build out i'll be done uploading my video on how when i built out my grow room and uh his will be pretty much part two of a series that i'm going to be doing where it's going to be either build-outs brand new or remodels or upgrades and you guys will be able to pay for each episode um individually and absorb all the information that went into that whole build or remodel so it was actually his idea and we're gonna do his build out as episode two so it's gonna be awesome it's gonna have amazing information in there and it's gonna be great for you guys because instead of just seeing my room all the time and you're like oh that's great but not everybody has your room like yours or not everybody has a layout like yours you'll get to see different layouts different places different um climates right you're gonna get to see it all and you're gonna get to see the different thought process that goes into building these so it's gonna be really cool but anyways go check out his instagram because he's already started posting updates on it and it's not often that you get to jump on board and watch it build out brand new from the start most of the time you hop in and it's like uh the person's halfway done they've already done a bunch of [ __ ] you kind of like feel like the new guy you know what i'm saying in a crowd of old guys that been around for a long time now's your chance to get in on the bottom floor be one of those old guys he's been there forever by the time he gets done finishing you could be like i was there when you were still drawing the blueprints yo whippersnapper some of this blue icy and then i'm going to glove up the press is set to 175. we're going to do a low temp press on our test bag it's not going to be a clear indication of how the full spectrum is going to respond but it's going to give me a good enough idea to know whether or not 175 is going to provide the flow i'm looking for or if i'm going to need to go up to my 204 temperature 202 maybe i will put a link up right now i'm not sure that you guys can do it that's what's up jinder mah what's up dude i haven't seen you in forever holy moly so yeah check out asteroid farms what's going on viper what's up slug upstate what's going on we're just

already know we got it we gotta swap out the battery we don't want it to die it'll be another short live stream i had to find it i couldn't forget i couldn't remember where the [ __ ] i put it down now i can't remember which batteries are charged now let's see lucky number nothing they'd be lying sometimes you got to pull them out and pop them back in they're not lying tonight [ __ ] [ __ ] well one of you's got to be higher than 25 [ __ ] percent let's find out i i don't feel comfortable knowing i've got 25 percent left on the battery i just took a fat ass dab and i'm about to start pressing i'm gonna get excited forget and this is gonna die by the way if the stream does go down unexpectedly please stay tuned because i will bring it right back up this is a non-stop party tonight that battery was at 100 you [ __ ] lying ass charger all right all right so for those of you that are new here i do a [ __ ] ton in a very small space so this is where i'm going to be collecting at when i'm all done here okay we're gonna move some [ __ ] out of the way shout out to roz and inc i want you guys to look at something real close here custom product for who that is who has bags like that who has bags like that do you want to know why he carries these two and a half by four and a half bags hey cuz of me baby who wants some bags i know some of you press and some of you need some bags all right anyways we've got parchment laid out we've got our bags ready to go okay and here you guys are going to go you're going to go right here look at that just for you how's that view yeah you could just chill set you down now is a good time if you got to use the restroom you got to go grab a drink you know what i'm saying whatever you got to do go handle that let me figure out this lighting i don't want it to be too bright for you guys oh [ __ ] that's too bright all right i feel good about this you guys are ordering from rosin inc make sure you guys use my coupon codes they're on my site solventlessbnb.com let's get ready get up there get up there just a little love from my homie right there you know all right remember you guys we're gonna be doing the 160 micron and the 25 micron mixed together as a test press before we move on to the full spectrum presses here we have the uh [ __ ] puck come on turn on screen doesn't recognize my gloves oh well anyways i hope that you guys were able to see that now this uh this is just some uh edibles mix of some uh the last strain that i pressed out which is the grape cosby little dark but it is [ __ ] chirpy and delicious and it will do amazing for edibles because the flavor that it will add is not too over the top but it's definitely like you notice it notice it so we're going to drip this into that edibles jar this is probably not going to flow crazy this is a test press a low temp test press at 175 all right i honestly feel like i should go up a little so so so so oh that looks like it's gonna be good well i think i found the temperature i'm gonna try for the first full spectrum maybe it'll flow a little bit more i'll take it for edibles siezer um don't worry that was just a plate on top of the press jumping around my cold plate up there good extraction well the flow was okay wasn't quite what i want it's kind of a weird flow so all right well not quite what i'm looking for believe it or not 185 that's gonna give me that awkward drip i'm gonna hold pull my audience to see what you guys think the temperature is that i'm gonna go with i already know what i'm going with i'm gonna go with uh my usual all right well we're gonna go ahead and do the first full uh spec press now all the same size that one was at 175. small bag we'll do this one first oh jesus 224 no too high 202 202 202 that's that's where i'm feeling 202 today i can feel it in my huevos rancheros pressing some cool spectrum once cash baby all right the room temperature is 74 degrees i do not believe in running a cold room during the pressing stage now bear with me you guys this is going to be a tad bit awkward as i have to deal with not only the um press this new jar which is larger and doesn't sit on the edge so i have to hold it like this in fact i don't even know what your viewpoint is now does that make sense right there where it's at for you guys i mean all right here we go we're at 191.1 191.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 six that's how slow my press heats up i love it i don't care what anybody says it doesn't overshoot temperatures during pressing because it sleeps it heats up slowly it doesn't like jump up all crazy because it has some overpowered 150 to 200 watt heaters it just has two 100 watt heaters nicely spaced out let's take a dab again next time tomorrow it sounds delicious this [ __ ] is like caramel taffy uh oh uh oh ah excuse me i felt like my nose was gonna run all over camera i didn't want that oh yeah what's up mommy my [ __ ] that'll do good that'll do oh that gets the job done i'll tell you what how you guys feeling about this prize we're at 199.7 199.7.8.9 200. 201 i'm not there and dad just [ __ ] knock me on my ass about let's get ready to remove look at that still plenty of paper towel left to clean bangers with throw that away save that puffing my man it's a good night when my boy puffin comes to visit you're pressing yourself right now huh hell yeah get it dog we are warmed up to 202 degrees let's go this is gonna be a second test press slightly lower than my normal but for some reason i'm feeling this temperature why i saw gonza say 204 and i'm like yeah yeah that's my normal i feel it but then all of a sudden my balls rumbled and spoke to me from deep within and they said no 202 now they're all right [ __ ] it the balls haven't lied yet oh what would you look at that there already me gusta come here come to daddy a little [ __ ] go what i say i knew it i felt it i felt it in my huevos rancheros oh yeah let's get messy somebody's got to make a meme out of the next big bag that squirts all over this jar so i'm feeling good about that that's a fish grab that and we're gonna move this over here i'll turn you right now 202 my [ __ ] i want to know did i get it

let's let's see what am i checking your story i don't know maybe i jumped in at the wrong part of that conversation oh elevated uh nah there wasn't a lot on the parchment there was barely anything in here really maybe like two to three grams that was a small piece of uh that was small and that was 19 grams in there and uh [ __ ] dude not a lot left in there it's all over the [ __ ] sides of this jar is where it's at you guys want to see a big squirt huh all right let's get it gotta get off this cyber dream stuff though um all right let's get it big old fatty this one feels like a 27-30-ish somewhere in there all right let's go i don't want to listen to trap sorry i gotta get i gotta get the right music on first this is bothering me put on some good old tj hotto all right let's go i'm gonna fold this one down the center i just pinch it crease it down the center diagonal the other diagonals and that gives you kind of like a good flow right there already and then you just pinch the sides together and it's like let me check my battery here 85 percent go dude i'm all smoking one squeeze okay shout out to my man mysticalgo my official artist on sbnb records back down oh yep bomb extraction on that one let's go cross mountain ranges split cells of tomorrow it flowed so well there's like not even that much on the paper let us go yes uh let's keep this party [ __ ] going good over here peace i think i put some information in the description maybe i didn't add that i guess but 25 micron double bag from rosin inc for the uh for the bags my bad y'all i tried to put some information in there and i left out that one yo if you guys can't catch the live streams sign up for my patreon i upload them there so come to daddy um is i'm the master of my own fate i determine my own yield i grew the flowers this is the source of the single i am my own god excuse you uh is that's why i keep the ends of these parchment pieces wrap them over the parchment paper i wish i could slow this down listen listen did you [ __ ] catch it though my man [ __ ] threw it in putting him on game yo understand he let y'all know i'm putting y'all on game for free i'm gonna i'm gonna take it back one time is it too loud uh um let's go ladies and gentlemen it's time to flow i'm gonna bring you guys back some i feel like i'm not bad hold on you guys don't really need that flashlight i don't think anyways let me take it off and passed wrench squad hold it down here's a pro tip on really fat pucks make sure you leave a little extra space behind the puck so that you don't get a blowout but i can mute it that's fine didn't need that light but i'm not liking how that's lining up on the [ __ ] plates i'm gonna move it over just a tad real quick like uh is i go go go go go real big extraction what is it [ __ ] this one's really done i'm calling it now it's gonna be a dumper is nobody [ __ ] with you you know what as a kid i actually did like origami and [ __ ] you know what was better than origami paper [ __ ] planes god damn it paper planes with a [ __ ] i could fold all types of paper planes you guys when i was a kid not now you know why i can't do it now because i lost the book i didn't look that [ __ ] up read that [ __ ] in the book you know what i mean books are cool as [ __ ] you can learn how to make paper airplanes and [ __ ] who would have thought mm-hmm starting to get good at this [ __ ] so um okay well brown is foreign i until you quit this next one's gonna squirt like a [ __ ] so um okay i have that camera ready i'm gonna record this one on my phone i'm not sure how i'ma do it watch me money money all the time hey money please no worries it's only 200 degrees touch it with your [ __ ] hands that sense sorry i'm trying to align this a little bit differently here safety reasons there it is my press has a ram that can adjust positions so um it's a little bit different than most the ram isn't stationary which means that it can come out of alignment sometimes if i move it or whatever but it's all we're helping to make good taking care of your summer projects is a breeze bam summer savings on all your favorite brands make things even easier so freshen up the deck and fire up the grill summer's here and it's as close as your home yard get more done let's get it i've used this prosper [ __ ] ever you're biking like five years now i just let go of the [ __ ] bar my bad you guys the camera is on a very unsteady amount kinda i don't have the tripod leg spread out very well all right is to the place whoa the puck slit in the plates when i was adjusting it apparently almost popped out of the front no blow out though but i gotta pull it out real quick and readjust it i'm so glad that didn't blow out but somehow that slipped out that's a trip i'm so happy that i didn't blow out that's crazy what the [ __ ] i've never had that happened that's a trip that's a trip son experience saved for real he wouldn't would he he [ __ ] would let's go back on the plates you go you son of a [ __ ] that was a trippy trip trippy trip trip this thing is about i was like why is it not going like it should be leaking way more and then all of a sudden the handle slipped and i was like what the [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] what happened put that back on the plate for a second up a let that so hmm who's your daddy who's your daddy what a safe uh is before oh yeah good extraction i'll take it oh yeah let's power through it two more to go parchment gets added to the jar everything i want everything together mixed together equal even steven the stuff that sticks to the parchment might be different terpenes might be different different [ __ ] you know you don't want to leave it out shop from the comfort of your home at sprint.com that's not a lot of work bro i know i'm saying it's already time to upgrade the jar again i just got this damn jar i'm upset it's not fun i thought for sure it was going to be good enough we knew get a bigger drawer uh bertha it's time to go squirtle what the [ __ ] it did it again something's going on here is it sliding something's happening here there's no blowout but it's sliding off pressure's not being applied evenly to the plates somehow or they're too tight or i pre-packed them at an angle never had this happen okay i know what i'm about to do fix this i'm going to have to increase the pressure even slower every problem there is a solution hmm leaned on him to apply pressure for the pre-press by doing it evenly i had to have been time to upgrade and put my bigger plates on i guess for these bigger presses right inside there i hope you guys are watching this if you guys aren't [ __ ] paying attention i don't know what you're doing right now when i mess up that's when you guys need to pay attention because i don't mess up very often not to sound cocky whatsoever but i don't so if i make a mistake that's resulting in some type of mess up it would benefit everybody around me to pay attention and realize what i'm doing wrong so i got my light that's fine before i make sure i got the jar underneath there i didn't think it was going to squirt like that still this parchment is heavy from the [ __ ] first part of the press but it's still flowing good that's all that matters and no blowout fan dumb strong on the top setting don't you get a damn hum my curl is my rocker maybe i choose you and i don't even have i don't even have um i have a couple theories for what it is lots of adjusts right now it's increasing pressure too fast and also i have the press at a a pretty good angle right now leaning towards the front and i think that the hash is melting and making the puck inside uneven and then it blows out the front like that so i think i'm just going to go ahead oops just hit the table i'm going to go ahead and flatten out the press a little bit more risky with this puck anymore how would i do on the save [ __ ] crazy giving her incredible so okay my battery at 34 okay um check the alignment of the plates one more me come on gloves don't stupid i know it's not that cold in here but then mm-hmm little 74 degrees in here oh missiles contemplating life changes foreign foreign let me grab some parchment hold on i got an idea not so much as an idea that i just want to do something for this press just insurance actually all okay searching for savings on descriptions is so complex it's like getting a documentary unfortunately you just savings period not all patients eligible savings so um me yes i haven't even hit one ton of pressure you guys think i'm kidding look so just hit two and a half oh figured it out right pressure was increasing too fast and the angle probably didn't know so so well aren't you guys glad i got the internet connections really good attraction well wow please so um batteries are charged let's get a battery swap in before we do anything else we'll go from there sound good oh think so okay all right so good job bertha good job baby we're gonna take a dab and then after this dab i'm going to um go ahead and collect what's on the parchment and get it added to the jar while it's still warm man that's heavy that's heavy i mean yield wise i'm thinking it's got to be it's got to be upwards of 80 it has to be you know there's it is no [ __ ] way it's not it's a little harsh didn't it that's okay i'll turn it down i knew there was a little [ __ ] nap thingy in here a little [ __ ] flew right on me else we know there's never a good time to run out of fresh luckily our delivery and free pickup excuse me so whether it's a few extra guns from the back all right i mean you can't help it i got lights on in here when i come in through the garage little [ __ ] just came in with me i guess oh boy oh what are we taking a dab off i mean this is the 160 and 25. this [ __ ] is looking better than some people's like 90s come on man this is my throwaway edibles what's your calling air force reserve af reserve dot com all righty i got the drugs already got a little bit of runs on here i'm gonna grab some more though on the outside of one of these parchments but i smeared i know there's like a bunch on the outside i could take so i don't have to dip into the jar or anything i'm i'm weird right now you're like call that fresh press man i wish i'll give you a melt so like wood that's runs wow wow

there in the [ __ ] house it is the one the only Justin's world with another fantastic review in the house so hope you're well wow I'm just chilling before mmm a little bit of a point there hell I can now do a little bit of a review on so I know we've done the blonde pollens before this is obviously a different batch does look a little bit lighter than the other one as you see I have done some close-up shots all that so by all means if you've not seen those on dr. bong Tings channel by all means go and have a look at them so nice bit of blonde fauna I hope you're well thanks for watching thanks for tuning in we're just going to go through a little bit of smoke Thanks so one get your split sight get your bomb sight be it's AB sight roll up yeah smoke up sit back relax get yourself a nice cup of tea like I've got yeah and we're just gonna relax it's a nice it's a nice morning no damn it the Sun is really really shining like that looking really good so I thought what better way to start the day with a little bit of the blonde pollen CBD hash from buzzing footer guys absolutely fantastic really really nice hash sort of real nice press to it as you can see there's like layers on it come closer so you can see I say there are there are better close-ups of this guys so foil means go and I will look at but this this hashish the CBD $0.08 is a [ __ ] cracker Roy it is a cracker look at it really nice guys so you can't get better than that cheapest chips you do the odor Snapple up a lapper dish ready guys Oh sexual look at it Oh guys nice you can actually see the layers when when you've done that now it's a really light color you say but yeah it's a really nice it's a nice smell to it it does smell again very very very hashey very when I say Hashi I mean sort of a little bit sort of so far you can smell it but it's so light to sort of flavor to the soap bar than what you would normally to be fair so we're not is strong bitter but like I say a bit of a dilute it sort of found sort of flavor to it basically but I've by the old pipe I'm just going to do a little bit of a different smoke and review on this one I will do it obviously in the fond but I want to try the new pipe this one guys to give it a little a proper little you know go so what I do tend to find is I do tend to find it's good to put a little bit of light on it not too much just give it a little bit alright not too much just soften up a little bit yeah don't want to overcook it but it just makes it go so much easier mmm lovely oh look just crumbles beautifully into a pony there so I'm off camera so you can't see that but trust me it's just perfect don't overcook that a lot of people like now you got just like so you've got to soften up a little bit with the flame it just Plus that nice there and then you get a nice consistency of hashish I love hashish all forms whether it's CBD or when it Weber its THC I love it it's all good stuff it's all concentrated as you can say that's the old [ __ ] little pipe so I [ __ ] filled up the bowl massively guys so get yourself one oh I know a lot of you have tried this now I know absolutely raving about it so palms up guys yeah [Music] oh it's a good [ __ ] hit from that point [Music] oh nice nice little to that I like it tastes a little bit different in their little points and it does the bouquet and the the bomb it just gets a bit hotter in the punch is really nice oh really nice laptop sneak follow it up with a bouquet so bear with me boys we'll just warm this up a little bit again again you don't have to do this you could do this with your fingernails and just chip it off which when I first got it that's why I was doing it but like bring it one day I thought you guys [ __ ] Burnett but you mean just Burnett I mean it's just that stood despite not too much just a little just but almost wave it on Brett yeah I just tend to find that works me that's all piece wound up guys yeah it's cool guys so it's cool hashish I'll say you can get this from veggie burger calm so by all means get yourself over to posing put a hat obviously I don't work for posing put out but I just try a lot of that products and if I find something goods I will say to you guys job saying I'll say it's good yeah I know I've done a lot of person for their videos but the reason for that is because unlike the company I like the company I like the products they make me feel [ __ ] nice so alright so we got the yoga bomb guys the bomb the bomb just make sure I've got [ __ ] back on all right so I'm prepared in two seconds fatso can use that last point that's what you sow yeah cool right hand let's get ready carry through the bar so here we go let's all have a bolt and we all get along peace enough yes yes in the [ __ ] house well then so just [ __ ] of it I'm feeling a worry mine that's really like her your ring so like take cheese from the body feel relaxed guys really relaxed so peaceful now I was a stone cut out one packing it's just like a watered-down soap bar it's very very pleasant but don't be expected to have you know a huge amount of flavor profiles were there it's not as pungent I don't know cleanse it's the right word but it hasn't got that kick of obviously CBD hash because it's seen beginning it's going to be different it's very difficult to explain it if you've not smoked down but I think for the when the first time you smoke it you get that what the closest way I can explain to you is it is like a diluted so far so if you dilute it a soap bar flaying the pipeline 50% that's what I'm getting with that you're mean it's almost like a very very watered-down version of soap bar very very pleasant very very easy and smoke goes down as you can see really really easy and on a day like this where I haven't really got that much but it's left to be fair this is perfect on the block of this in your drawer and I said this on the other room so I'm a blocking this drawer for a day like this it's [ __ ] perfect and I can tell you now I feel this satisfied smoking this that's what I do take saying it's too great you know mean well yeah not like say you're not getting a psychic you know all that basically and you know you're not getting that side of it because there's no tasting it but what does do meg is it just like say it just creates an absolute real nice well-being within myself I just get all this stuff - I'm saying so unless I smoke too much of it and then I go to sleep it's too much it does make you sleep boys I don't know if you know that but yeah too much CBDs yeah definitely but I was struggling I have been struggling to sleep as most people are sort of shift Pat and sleep patterns all [ __ ] up at the minute naso but I've been having a little bit of the CBD hash or I've been having a little bit of the CBD Isis that before we got that and yeah we're in about twenty minutes sitting on the couch after having a couple of bowls of that my Michelini always are only long who sleep so really does does good and not yet our um it lets me sleep all the way through into uninterrupted normal a bit Restless through the night but if I have to see big deal I don't get up half as much to be fair I pretty much stay there until them all then I get my sleep and then I go I'm fantastic so from that point of view it really really helps so what I would say to you guys like now if you are struggling with sleep and you're on the is eats all the time it's because you're smoking it probably just you need to balance it a little bit with obviously CBD now an OC BT came to rocks the effects of THC and a lot of people like no I don't want to [ __ ] my buzz up and that you won't trust me just take a little bit CBD with it you will feel it within yourself yeah it doesn't doesn't get rid of the THC all together it just doesn't I like taking a little bit of THC on top it just it feels nice it feels nice at the end of day I don't get high anymore guys I don't know about you but I've been smoking so they've kind of sthe for a long time and I just don't get high anymore yeah I'll get warm I get fuzzy I'll get comfortable don't get high anymore guys it just nothing really hit to me like that anymore and nothing's hit me like that for a long time to be fair probably the last time I felt like proper [ __ ] high was in Amsterdam when I took that red velvet cake that I have explained about in previous videos but yeah that [ __ ] me that put me back to where I was like 20 years old and take my first [ __ ] hit of that hey Emma sniffles somethings you up saying it really really took me back but generally nothing really does it for me I know when I've had one obviously but it doesn't get me high like it used to it just doesn't I pay for that all you would pay for that to get back to that but maybe I need a tolerance break but hey I just find it comfortable just smoking there being a name it's not always about getting high VOC I'm another one so we're good for the little little pipe again boss made me feel quite chilled out guys I've got to be honest I'm going to make a separate video on this because I've got a little bit if this well quite a lot of this CBD ash to get through but I want to obviously smoke it with you guys so I'm also going to do this video well I'm going through it again on revising the product if you like like so because no no piece of hash is the same everything which is which comes out is always gonna be very very slightly different so short meaning that's because the plant material you can use it's not always going to be consistently consistently the same alright so it does change and so does the quality of the hash which is why you get darker lighter different consistencies off color off it so but really like a really like the flavor that I'm gonna do like say a separate video but I'm gonna take this and I'm gonna mix it with the Eisler because that's what I've been doing on the night time I've been doing a nice little Bowl of this and then just a sprinkling of the CBD I slit on top sparkly yeah and it [ __ ] works yeah because a lot of people says you can only dab it you can oh no you can't you put it in your splits and stuff as well really really good but yeah if you want a strong strong dose of CBD that's what I've been doing all night time it's a [ __ ] snitch they care and faint and really nice [Music] yes yes my dad will tap a little bit guys scrambles like lovely I hope you're well today no you'd [ __ ] suck air you're having a nice little bit from NIH in array that's like what I like to imagine is on what I'm making these videos that's what spares me on its to think that you know I've got the cannabis community sat out having a bit do you know just chillin with me basically having a smoke watching me waffle my [ __ ] and just talk about the things that I love to talk about with shops there is cannabis and cannabis relate here it's kind of a dial CBD you know anything to do this [ __ ] plant mate I [ __ ] love it right [ __ ] it out I will pack that little bit I'm just trying to get this all to sit nicely guys but [ __ ] it out look at that oh that's a bit of a mad bastard pocket oh my a [ __ ] mule may it's very pleasant because they there's something as cheap as what it airs - bye guys bye so get yourself a number look how cheap it will give the Buddha some traffic even if you not gonna make a purchase just going out but I've left go on the website level that helps more traffic or help so but you'll be amazed at some of the products but they've not coming out it's just [ __ ] just blows me away every [ __ ] time and I'm really looking forward to trying some of their the little hashes they've got come out at them Annette I've seen strange check than a review on within the amnesia the other day so that was a [ __ ] good review that straight Jack really liked that and I want to try that I'd love to review that product so I've been a few people may say you know talk about that one and say I [ __ ] good at s and I've not tried yet so that is definitely one I want to get on the channel you know it's one of those a lot of stuff with the Buddha does that stop them very very quickly going so you've gotta be quick you've got to be quick because sometimes you'll see these reviews and before you know that it's that stock so get yourself on straight away have a look yeah don't miss a don't miss a load this up again as you can see I'm quite enjoying this do a [ __ ] stonker this time shine when it build this right out then I'll show you a camera on a [ __ ] build this way up but don't [ __ ] laugh if I took my [ __ ] guts out don't laugh at me yeah can't wait to do the legs as well guys just want to put the camera on now and just do it though

cannabis community channel this is VA oh I like this one she's not I know when stated big glass [ __ ] it is because somebody said to me they went to get it and it was gone so if you do go online to have a look at these guys and they are a stop I do apologize but I would say that they're pretty consistent if they are quiet stop there they're pretty good at getting stuff back in again if not they'll have done up probably quite a close alternative to it so do have a bet yeah noise very [ __ ] satisfying they say very satisfying I love it don't you say that's kind of a smoker as well so I know a lot of people like CBBC biddies but what cdb do these all know it's cop eat it eat it eat it eat nicely guys try it I'm a bit out in your drawer I own for a rainy day right even if it's not

ten that's like say that's based on the price of air you know because it is is that the beginning of the scale of price so you know this is the best place you'll get on any of it is cheap and chips so so yet based on the price taste smell how it smokes you know it's an 8 out of 10 all all day long and it's just like Janine you see ya you would you door direct you'd see it on the less and you'd see the price of that and what you can get for your money and you go to [ __ ] hours tremendous value which is like people buy big blocks and it yeah because it's affordable it's affordable no cash and a bachelor party show live everything about it mmm that has made me feel so incredibly relaxed sworn-in night like say there is just no need to solve how many takes you to be found there's just no need

you enjoyed that last one if you haven't go back and watch it yeah yes yes okay gonna get a few more reviews now and again thank you very much - Jase for this one we have got the Train rack hash basically trusty vs. 8% trainwreck hash mister CVD smells very old-school very Hoshi very soap barring again that sort of sick bastard a flavor to it by all means check out dr. Banton for some close up there guys if you want to see some close up so but by all means have a little luck or just there is very very nice nice bit of hashish yes yes going so yeah it smells very Hoshi smells as it should basically as you'd expect it to but yeah it's got very very nice hash Oates cool sort of flavor to it basically so I'm going to stick it into a bomb and then we'll see how we go along window so right now let's have this here wait am looking forward to this one hash always goes down wow I'm a big hash lover just gonna put a little bit of flame on it guys yeah does smell proper old-school quite quite solid crumples barely very nicely though once you put the flame on I'll show you in a second a while its laughter but yeah that just reminds me of SOPA I'm being honest oats cool soap bar nice I just love hash guys I love it yeah even feels the same as the old school you know the way it's crumbling the consistency are there you know that's old school man is old school nice right and that looks good right then so nice little fatty toys as you say no messing around yeah so eight percent trainwreck \u00e7b day let's see oh she [ __ ] those guys one love it's me it tastes quite similar to a like the blonde pollen very similar to that [Music] mmm again also quite similar to the plant of life one and they do right there which out there is queen it's quite expensive on the high street you know they sell it in one of the shops up here yeah so that is really really really nice dooon't chunk at all on that very smooth a very similar to a pollen type flavor so if you do like your kind of your your blondes sort of pollens and that's all flavor I quite like hashes and get a like this but yeah very very similar that hasn't made me cough which is always it's always the good test really isn't it for me that's what I know if something's good or not basically bomb number two guy so Coyle means get yourself a spliff a DAB however you want to take your medicine yeah nice I think you'd be pleased to there Saul you hash lovers eight there it's just crumble a little bit more guys so yeah well I'm enjoying these reviews enjoying these guys I love it by all means anyone else got a fit to review just hit me out by all means I'll be more than that they're got plenty of space to do some more reviews it's the Boyle mainship yeah as you can see I'm quite a happier dad I'm back to my normal self cuz I'm working I'm working now I feel like I'm working I feel like I'm doing something you know I mean I'm not bored I've got something to sort of look forward to so but yeah this is nice so far so yeah what can you say what can you say guys one love [Music] [Music] yeah it is nice very smooth very pleasant like a diluted soap bar flavor not strong like it's so far but if you imagine again at a diluted version it just tastes like a very good blonde pollen to me mmm Carmen I feel like I've calmed again get that sort of CBD calmness to it where you just think oh it's just like breathe all of a sudden so nice Pleasant no champion in that at all nice bit of a shot Jase I gotta be honest no I spit of ash that quite impressed with that quite depressed I think it's a little bit harder then but is blonde Paulo it's a little bit more firmer but as far as the taste and smell it's very very very similar to that if I was going to try and describe it as some of them to you guys but yeah I'm liking it I am liking it so whoa it's bear with me a second but we'll have another one inside but a mites I've got a little bit of CBD left just a little few little crumbs here so I'm going to use this and I'm gonna build a joint so don't make many joints here for you guys so just see if I can make one out of this just get the best of it it's just a bit of that just a CBD shake I've got leftover basic okay so we'll get that put into it and we'll see what she smokes like in a joint cuz I know a lot of you guys out there do like your joints obviously I would never recommend to build a joint with tobacco because obviously if you do that then you're only going to get half of your CBD content you know if you're doing it for you know medical reasons you know you wanting that CBD relief don't mix it with tobacco the best way to do it is basically just to smoke it pure so like I have done in a pipe and I'm obviously just going to mix this CBD shake with a little bit of the Train wet rack eight cents just for purposes of spliff test for you guys so you know I think that will probably do it so yeah it's just a little bit of shake down in there get it in the grinder sorry but now he's being dang guys but you're not saying I have to make the [ __ ] spliff in it there's the what we've got then so doctor dens has sent me some papers so love a little look what you have them click the papers then so thank you very much dr. dents we'll try your clipper papers nice dice got those with the owner I'll look at that the roaches on there as well just what I need Gosei not try clipping papers before because I haven't been smoking spliffs for a long time so very nice all intensive purposes they do look a little bit like a rule oh look at that I love these with a little aah just like in Amsterdam guys absurd a coffee shop baby so went into grey area on my birthday and I told him it was my birthday basically and he gave me a pack of riskless like yes but gray area ones but like this with the perforated richness decent paper as the heir Mon yeah Mon well then so while I'm doing this please obviously roll yourself up split a dab or whatever really really you should rather split for me because I don't have splits I'm doing this year for all intents and purposes you should be smoking me a nice big [ __ ] spliff we're just get our CBD in there [Music] it's not really a huge joint [Music] you know let's get a little better spirit into as well so we've got a combination of the two [Music] nice yeah just reminds me own school really crumbles in just just into kinda basically just again like I know I keep referring to but the own soap are you saying the good so far not the [ __ ] one nice it's gonna be a bit of flame on that look at that Oh [Music] make sure you get nice of powdery so you don't get any of those blend burns there guys those who no no I am for intensive purposes I think that's probably enough for a joint so we'll see oh she smoked she'll just pop this back in the bag cuz we need to do another bond yet we're gonna do a free bond test obviously so they just thought yeah we'll do it do you know I mean since it's not then sent me through these richness we'll do a little test [Music] [Music] nice nice nice it's gonna be a little stubby short one this one guys just tear that off there nice nice I quite looking forward to this little joint [Music] nice nice nice right em it's a bit unusual for me to do this so cheers guys one left to each and every single one of you it's my little boy little doobie [Music] taste on it like those papers then I sell he's 12 we're gonna say it tastes nice is a mixture I'm gonna say I will go back to the bottle and do another one on the bomb officer I can't mix it I don't want to mix you a tobacco I didn't want to mix it with normal weed I just wanted to keep it as a CB d joint you know I'm saying that's nice very nice hmm I should smoke more joints on the livestream so got something to chill back with really oh nice [Music] this smokes really [ __ ] wedding - joy I've gotta say I'm not one for enjoying joints but that's going down incredibly well nice bit of medicine just get lost in this it's got very nice taste with the flour mixed in together taste very very nice absolutely complements your joint you don't mean so just another way of smoking I guess you don't want to just do it I'd like me every now and again I just fancy a joint so it's just nice just to have something a bit different [Music] that [ __ ] Ludo really well [Music] okay [ __ ] marriage tada okay very nice very very pleasant think I miss joints a little bit when they like ass [Music] yeah I think I like it make sure it goes down really well let's get it back in the bomb oh yeah makes my nose itch a little bit yeah I'm sure me I'm really liking this I'm really liking the flavor of it feels nice feels quite nice and Carman quite subtle of Beck's but nice the main thing is is flavor may taste it's how you smoke a boy is and how you doing how well it sort of goes down and it just it just slides down this one is lovely yeah and it is impressed with its little one it's a lot of little hashes coming out there's a lot more right all right no dice oh but piece one laughs there we go cause you say I'm not smoking at I did fill the bowl cheers guys it does taste very similar to the high street world I can say very good [Music] have a look at my raspberry CBD hash review it reminds me of that one all right why why Weezer okay well that very very well Don that but this is because I was a greedy bastard and I filled up the bowl a little bit more that time T just calms it down to that but have to free poms what I say well it's nice crumbles up nice taste ice smokes well what more can you say really late to be fair that just you know but it hits all the spots really doesn't it it seems to be nice and clean it smokes incredibly well it was really really run in a bomb it goes really really well in a split common of fact quite subtle not strong but with eight percent CBD you and expect it to be you know a Paris but certainly you have free rips of a bomb like or not you your CBD date mate you've got a nice relaxing effects that you need hmm I need a joint I keep saying this I'm really enjoying it I'm really really enjoying it mmm flavor just marries together but how would I rate it I mean for a hash you know it looks nice crumples Wow you know I mean quite hard consistent saying you know nice flavor you gotta be looking a good sort of you know eight out of ten haven't you really I'd say for a blonde pollen it's a good sort of eight out of ten all that went to be fair so I'm really enjoying the hashes at the minute so you see we need companies like that your name third page of you stops you getting all these sort of hashes out there onto the market I think it's brilliant art the art of hash let hashish CBD house all the way to be honored to be there well I say more and more people are getting switched on to it now and you know being this just it's one of those things that there's more and more coming out onto the market it's so fantastic saying from somebody like you know from my point of view that a few years back we didn't have anything like this going on today you know the UK market and now all have said that it seems to be wherever you look there's CBD companies popping up all over the place with different products different hash it's a different you know fantastic now you can see all really [ __ ] enjoying that really enjoying that but yeah thanks for that chase a tight add to the train wreck CBD 8% hash yeah definitely would recommend it yeah so yeah if you guys get a chance to try it and by all means try hmm we leave that one there so always I'm just gonna bug in oh [ __ ] it just smoke it so you don't with that [ __ ] me I feel relaxed after that bit more of a children bit more of a children so I

"[Music] hello everyone welcome back to rows of green and uh today i'm going to show you guys how i make hash so uh first off what i do is i have my bags here and buckets and i have a 190 a 160 45 and a 25 my 190 bag that's what catches the contaminants and then uh the 160 bag usually has some uh has some good hash in it and then the 45 has some real good stuff and the 25 is like a lower grade but uh what i do is uh it's fresh frozen so i got the other half of the bag here i put about a pound in at a time so i'll just put that in there like that spread it out a bit and then what what you want to do is cover it up with ice [Applause] so and then uh yeah so basically that's it and then i will fill this up with water and then i will uh turn on the machine and i'll uh show you that after i fill it up okay so here we are i got the washing machine i got my weed in there and i put the ice in there and then uh what you want to do is uh i'll do my first run for about uh five minutes only uh just to see what i'm collecting to see if i could pull out a bag or not sometimes i'm able to pull out the 190 bag and then just use the 160 as a catch uh depending on depending on how big the trichomes are how much to harvest and whatnot so uh my first goal i what i did use the 220 bag then i realized i could go down to the 190 and then now i might be able to just use the 160 because we're not getting much in the 190 so what i'm gonna do here now is i'm just gonna turn this unit on and i'll let it run for five minutes [Applause] and it's very important for your water to be freezing cold you want freezing cold water for this so anyway i'm not gonna keep this on for uh for the full five minutes just thought i'd show you guys what it was doing and i'll turn it back on when i start to uh drain it okay so here we are i'm gonna undo this drain the washer just stopped after uh six minutes and we let it drain then that's just catching uh the contaminants i don't use work bag there's no need for it but i did modify this pipe i put a bigger pipe on it i just went to the hardware store i think it's like uh three quarter inch or a half inch but you can see it's nice and it's got a color to it so it's gonna be uh it's gonna be a good little catch and it smells delicious absolutely delicious so then i'll go on to wash this a couple more times uh my next wash i will do it for 10 minutes and the one after that will be 15 minutes so i'll show you once i start pulling these bags okay so i pulled out uh the 190 and this is what's in the 160 there's not very much in there i'm gonna remove that and i'll show you guys what's in uh at the 45 okay so here we are uh what i do is i i got a trick from frenchy cannoli and i use the uh frisbee just like him as it uh really stretches out your bag good works well that looks green but it's not that is totally blonde i think it's just green because of uh the frisbee but that is 100 full melt there we go there you can see it there now it's blonde and i just take a knife and clean it up and put it on here before i uh screen it yes i just showed you that part what i'm doing is i'm just scraping off all the trichomes there we go and then what i'll do is i'll let it dry out a bit and then i'll take this screen and i'll i'll go over top of pizza box and i'll sift it like that and then it will sift out and i'll show you how it dries so i did this one yesterday and so that will dry almost clear uh once uh you'll be able to see it real well later once more water evaporates out of it but it's uh basically clear once it uh well transparent sorry once it's uh dried see if you see these smaller pieces but uh yeah so i just dried on there for about uh say five six days and i keep it cool uh 13 degrees celsius with a rh of about 30. uh you want it to be uh dry and cool so anyway i hope you guys enjoyed that video on how i make my hash if you have any questions feel free to comment down below like this video share it and we'll see in the next one peace out", "cm7unA6p-1w": "um right i've made these for ages since the summer since the summer um and ella suddenly decided she wanted hash browns so we're using white cabbage so obviously normal hash browns grated potato i'm using white cabbage as the alternative i'm just weighing it out because we're going to stick to the recipe um believe it or not every time i say that i go steady on yeah no no um so and i'm going to do both different uh hash browns that are in in ffs um i've got corned beef for mine and ella's gonna have the cheesy um hash browns this is best made in a little food processor otherwise you've got to grate um the cabbage quite small so you do want it into sort of almost like fine shreds this little chopper probably would be fine for this i didn't want to get the big chopper out um we've got the little chopper out so actually for the youtube audience i sometimes get questions about this where's it from this came from aldi however little have got their own little version money sandy right uh little i've got that no wrong way around so this came from lidl however aldi have got their own little version of a again what they call they've got their own little version mini chopper um it's a little unit so it's not the same as this it's a little sort of it's a tinier bowl or a smaller bowl and a tiny one smaller bowl [Music] now i've already put too much in in one go to it although it's not it's almost there it's almost there i just want to get rid of the bits like this you still want some texture yeah and you get the very fine bits again you don't want it sort of um i don't want it watery right so it is all now um i'll use that bomb it is all now blitzed down i ain't got a minute uh blitz the cabbage first then add the rest of the ingredients except from the oil bliss again but i'm gonna mix it into the bowl because this is a bit of a small bowl to be mixing the cheese in with it yeah everything else is just already mixed if your chopper's got a bigger bowl then you're gonna do it all in there [Applause] so a little bit of shallots um these are about 40 grams each now i don't know why but there seems to be actually 30. confusing information about the carb value of shallots we have people saying oh i thought they were like what 12 or whatever but now they're three grams per hundred shallots no difference at least uh does anyone understand why uh i don't there doesn't seem to be any dispute in the fact that shallots are about three grams of carbs per hundred grams um same as leaks although i did see somebody post um earlier in the week or did they send us a message uh emailed was it okay somebody sent us a message i did see it about if leeks are 12 grams of carbs why are you saying they're better to use than red onions but they were using cooked weight yeah so use raw weight in raw weight values when you're um when you're doing your measurements right away even then 12 grams of carbs a cook weight it's it's still high i feel like yeah it doesn't eat all i did is i i compared all the raw weights and use the um tesco it didn't sound right in in the slightest and again there's no dispute i mean there are some really random readings you have to be aware that when you're um when you're using a tracker of any um brand um they mostly allow people to upload their own data that data might be wrong so you know don't take it as gospel um right so um christ we've been going for ten minutes i've barely done anything it was a bit like michelle um cabbage uh shallots i'm using some grated mozzarella so there's 100 grams of grated mozzarella in there we're just going to add a little bit of seasoning to it as well so obviously salt salt is needed especially with cabbage especially cabbage i've got some nice mixed herbs in here as well just half a teaspoon and oh we needed some cilantro as well didn't we the psyllium husks that we use and they added they're a really good term um oh it might have been chelsea she said like blonde yeah so you don't want the the gray or the the the thorny colored well no this is gray isn't it really so the psyllium husk that you're after is this blonde and it's like a fiber it's the best i mean it is fiber i know that's what it actually is but it feels it's sort of not the dust it's grainy yeah it's slightly grainy this will help sort of bind it so again 10 grams of this it helps bring it together and then i'm gonna mix the egg in i think i've done that in the right way right order the the unfortunate thing is i'm not wearing my glasses i'm reading the instructions and i can't really see them properly oh yeah pepper and i've just realized look we've gone through it yeah yeah we've gone through the enormous amount of pepper all right because we have cabbage a lot yes and cabbage and pepper go really well together quite right right and then the egg and then we're done and then i can mold and cook so are you doing are you frying some of each and then baking some of each do you want me to use the ninja i want to see how crispy they go okay because the courgette fritters go amazing i'll do half and half then so emily says i use rice cauliflower when i make my hash browns what's the difference with using white cabbage we think it's the texture isn't it yeah i think it's the texture so it's like grated potatoes to be fair the rice cauliflower oh yeah it'd work definitely yeah i mean it would have a very similar texture is it wrong to use the seasoned coconut oil what's it seasoned with smoked paprika and no you guess oh wow a small whiff of smoked paprika so they might take the color a little bit so i mean this is cooking coconut oil that we used a couple of days ago to make the crispy chicken the egg white oh yes yeah so we did some like uh kfc style keto fitness chicken the little hash browns so little hash browns so i've got the ninja tray so if you are gonna use a ninja um we're not sponsored by ninja by the way we're not sponsored by ninja um but you you would be advised to get one of their their trays because it fits perfectly unless you can find a you know other other version but they um obviously their trays are going to fit exactly that's all i'm saying they've got this round tray there is a um a bread tin and um and there's a little pizza tray i'm not squeezing too hard but they are firm and they are holding together um right so quite a lot of them yeah you get i mean it says um four portions so really you're looking at sort of you know well it's got to be eight hasn't it so i've actually maybe got a little bit too big there to get eight of that those sizes there but that's that's the four that are going to go into the ninja right that's done i can see it's sort of smoking it's on medium it's on five it's going to spit a little bit when i first put these in i do want it reasonably low because i don't want them to break up and i suppose i've got i'm going to get seven out i went a bit wild on the first two um now these are going to be more colored um they're normal because the oil is seasoned with paprika and garlic so yours won't come out looking the same if you're using clean oil can you freeze these and if so yet you would absolutely cook them before freezing absolutely so yes they'll freeze but yes make sure you cook them first otherwise they'll just disintegrate right there you go first one done how long will they take again i don't know when you fry like this only take a couple of minutes yeah but you don't want to move them until they are cooked all almost all the way through because they will break up otherwise so how do you know um well i'm gonna leave them for three or four minutes and just let them cook away i know that's not a really good answer no but it's good enough yeah you just you just don't want to be messing about with them put them in the oil let because you you want them to solidify you want them to heat through yeah and that will sort of help them stick together um so the one side will be more golden than the other side right so repeat so this is the corned beef yes i've got a tin of kombu yes it's not 100 clean i'm going to replace the psyllium husk best binder i was thinking this we've tried coconut i tried yeah go on you have a look i did try this this was a a recipe that i tried over and over again we tried with um coconut flour it didn't quite hold psyllium is one of those things like twice a week gluten you just can't sometimes tried with chia seeds that didn't hold either um the only thing that i can think of that might hold would be looping right so you can't uh no you can't probably see this but i'm able to turn these so they're holding together looping flower yeah i think looping might work they are beautifully golden brown on this side that one needs a little bit longer it's a little bit soft there again you don't want to move them too soon that that worked really well i thought i was about to figure it out not the spatula and it actually flipped right okay so those that have now been cooked on both sides yeah they're they so they're nice and firm now so i'm just gonna let them finish off so about half an hour ago um i suddenly saw the little one run past me with a bit like the toilet roll advert with the kitchen towel and off she ran trailing behind like come here little git that's a lovely color yeah i mean again they're going to be cooked um slightly darker on one side than the other but you went completely out of um you said you were going to make them into triangles yeah no no i didn't want to sort of mess about the cooking process right so that's those three that's the cheesy ones obviously we're gonna have a look at okay see that they've they've puffed out a little bit but they seem to have shrank a little bit they've puffed out i hate doing these it's the only thing about corned beef tins why don't they redesign them they're absolutely lethal i know there's tricks to get the bloody thing out easier i can mush this in i am just cutting into little so 100 grams they're looking good oh yeah they're almost going to be like little not fish cakes but that's sort of that sort of appearance rusted yeah right now i like wow the look of these right so they're softer uh these are softer maybe stick it on aircraft because yeah they're not done so actually i'm wondering whether i put them on the the ninja pizza the tray so i'm just going to turn them over so what was the underside they're cooked you could quite easily happily put them on your breakfast plate straight away but there won't be ash browns because they're not crispy yeah well they're crispy on top but they're soft underneath so we're going to turn it over i'm going to whack them on air crisp there you go can you can you do the nutrition because i don't know what the 2.9 per portion okay so that portion is about two of these per portion is that the same for both or are they um macros are calculated for the cheesy ones but the corned beef ones are very similar right so you just frying those are you gonna injure them as well i think i'll just fry mine for speed now right there crisping up really quickly i'll give them like another minute and i'll show you those and then we'll bugger off beautiful wow oh wow look at them yeah so that's the cheesy ones that have been yes baked but yeah proper yeah amazing there you go that's that's that's my preferred way of doing them you've got the three that i cooked in the oil and then the three that have been cut four that are cooked in the ninja um let's grab a little taste [Music] that's one thing the youtube lot wanted is they wanted to see like yeah you're eating it why do you want to watch me eating i don't know they're way better right so i'm gonna quickly pan fry these on the second side they've gone nice and golden on this side right so i'm just going to give them another minute or two on there just to brown up [Music] you", "TJBbdr_oq48": "one should i do the dude are we live does this i think we're live aren't we what's going on dgc it is scotty and it is monday i know a day it is because we're live actually and we're back we were banned on youtube we got our wrist slapped for uh for what a week for the what the fourth time now got our wrists left by youtube you know youtube is powerful they're cool it's amazing to be able to speak with everybody and have the chat going by the way what's up chat but damn it's like having one of them crazy stripper girlfriends you know what the hell's gonna happen next man anyway today we took the day off of phil actually i guess we are filming but uh off the show because we're making hash we actually have i don't know if we can see it well actually can we flash over to max over there yeah that's potency max potency we've decided on what's up brother making a recharge all day a little hash work in the middle bubble bag that is awesome so what are those are the 10 gallons that you got there yeah yeah and then we've got the bubble magic machine dishwasher bubble magic yeah that thing so it's basically just like a small scale i swear if you go to china you'll find those as washing machines over there i wonder if anybody in america we were talking about this before has rebranded the rebrand of yeah they're getting bubble magic they're like people would use this the washing machine but um man we figured we'd [ __ ] a little bit about the process i don't know i figured actually i just got back and i'm not even all that high so we got a bud cam oh yeah butt game's on by the way we're playing with some new studio equipment here warehouse kyle running things over there thank you so much brother what is good all right hey check this out man this is that mac and cheese that i've been showing off recently as a matter of fact uh little bonuses of mac and cheese last weekend you guys enjoy it oh my gosh it's great i did enjoy it were you here when i got i want to show you one more so this is actually a shout out with natural alternatives yeah [ __ ] yeah they got some nice flower the flower game is is being stepped up uh they're starting to talk about actually there's just good growers to grow are the people that make really good hash ah geez they make good flour too it's i mean it's a fire in fire out type thing with especially with like rosins and stuff if there's a company it's a rosin company and they have fire rosin they have fireweed that they turn into that rosin so if it's like leaf or laser cat or 710 those dudes have fire flower because you have to to have that fire a rosin uh audio problems man can you hear us sir all right and then it's too low too much guru i will uh hey max get over here then come hang out with me and check out so this is the difference i don't know if you can show the bud cam or not but dude this is what happens if you just get like the house special and this was [ __ ] just as much i want to say this is are you sure on the boat cam boys excellent man that's [ __ ] and i mean i guess it's not terrible weed but it's not good i don't [ __ ] trust popcorn notes that's so different man that's what you want yeah 200 an ounce colorado price give you a little fall prohibition report two hundred dollars an ounce for i think that's leafa grown that's mac and cheese this [ __ ] if i seem a little shot out of a cannons because i did smoke a singular bowl ah that's a jack herr cross right there i love jack jesus christ man as a matter of fact i'll smoke a bowl of that with you i smell this though smell that what do you get man it's kind of fruity a little bit blueberry are you guys good man um dude you got some ground yet i'll smoke it with you you're welcome to keep the bud cam going yeah we're on it all right check this out man i will show you this so there's also we're having some audio issues we'll deal with them but i did want to just show off some of the wheat i just got back from the dyspo um what's it mean when i bought rosin at the dyspo and you guys were making rosin does that mean i don't know what that means but uh just if you're not it's just this is like a colorado fall prohibition report since we're just chilling and since we're uh who the [ __ ] knows what's going on man this is kind of like i don't hear this is i'll shout them out this is turtman and rosin right there turtman and rosa can rosin and oh check this out and just got a weird color to it kind of orangey it's very orangey and now since this is a hash making video is that because it was allowed to oxidize is that i mean it seems like it's getting a little darker now i have started to realize that the color of hash right not the best indicator of quality of hash right um you really gotta just try it and see the how terpy it is and see what turks are there all right so this is what i'm used to this company i'll give them a shout out this is viola where are we at there there we go viola and really good value i mean i think these are three for a hundy and that shit's delicious man i'm happy with that smell that tell me what you get right and i want to hear like rotten gym socks and [ __ ] baby poop no it's like fresh like let me smell that baby poop kind of like cleaning products all right so hang on a second so that is this is durbin no this doesn't smell dirty it smells very durable i see man here look look everybody it's orange oops it's orange cookies orange cookie right what the hell's that man i think be careful it contains marijuana make sure to keep it away from children hell yeah hey i do have to as long as we're just bullshitting a little bit where's the puffco guru i have to publicly thank you for fixing my popcorn for me it just needed a little upgrade it was close this is just neat i didn't really get it i was scorching the bowl every time oh all right somebody didn't clean this bowl and it wasn't me hey but luckily it's a silicon carbide one and it's literally completely nonstick holds yeah i don't think i can get it in there but this is that was the d-nail it's like black so it's pretty hard to show on on camera but yeah that one specifically is from d-nail would you tell me just not no don't tilt this is what you told me the main thing with it is keep it level when you're hitting it so that it doesn't just slurp the hash back into like the air pathway through the slurp so anyway man hey tell me if you guys think st stay on this for two minutes so tell me that's that's an orangey right there and i would not call that orangey no um orange is in the name how much do you think the processing kills a lot of the flavor a lot of the unique flavor it depends they've gotten pretty advanced with the bho stuff that they're doing now if it's not crc i mean they're doing a ton of different stuff to it or using uh not just using butane or propane right but using like a blend of different solvents to make sure that they're less selective about the stuff they pull out this is good though viola makes some fire stuff holy [ __ ] dude look at this man now this is something interesting because we were talking about old school strange that if you came to market with an old-school strain would it sell and now this is double hash plant and first off somebody [ __ ] smoke some of this yes does it smell like cash plant oh my god dude it's like being in a field of hash plant two in a long time hey what am i doing see unless you have [ __ ] guru to help you with the goddamn puffco that and the main computer sometimes i'll hand my phone to guru and just be like dude just just just do it good deal hey i was showing off a little bit more of the hash this is slightly different help me out with the heat one up with you cheers come on is it cheers come on man that's colorado cheers right there what is up with uh the different colors just because it's a hash show this [ __ ] about it we have zero uh script or set up here i mean there's a lot of different variables oxidation how long it's just set around obviously can make something turn darker um but also that's what's going on with trichomes when you're letting them mature on the plant so the further mature a plant has gone the darker the extract from it is going to be just because your trichome color is what you're extracting right so some of the super super clear stuff people are just uh extracting and they harvest a little bit early well you don't want to harvest at 10 this might not have been that good of an idea here i smoked this if you got amber trikes you're getting amber concentrates oh yeah i guarantee you people are freaking out clear or milky at the at the latest but and and then it really does matter so just i don't i know it's a big repeat but i know i know right let's take a wet flower ear air live means that the heart plant was harvested wet right you're harvesting that plant you're never dressed frozen and you [ __ ] just take fresh plants put it in a freezer yep and then you take it out of the freezer and you put it in can we show them what the whole set setup was with the bubble bags because then you pull that [ __ ] straight out of the freezer and you go right into the washing machine yeah and so you just put ice and water in here and you can also put dry ice in there as well there's some dispute about the dry ice but it's definitely going to act as a solvent-less um yeah well dry ice beats the [ __ ] out of it but it um and we're using dry ice in a different way than you guys are both thinking of it oh hold on we're we're not putting just dry ice dry ice in a bag with weed and shaking it right that does break it up it does we're not using the dry ice as like to beat it or get the keef off of it right it's to keep the water temperature closer to freezing instead of we're in a room that's like 40 50 degrees when we were doing that yeah you just had a t-shirt on man i'm [ __ ] cold dude that was house was cold for a while from the second you stopped putting ice into the water its temperature is rising putting the dry ice in with the water and the ice will arrest that a little bit and slow down the speed at which the water starts to warm up you get a bit better yield with water hash that's awesome remember jason's out in terms of food grade co2 everybody i did buy it from the meat department yep why there's a difference in dry ice yeah just in the amount of it's your truck residual stuff there because i don't know if you ever noticed you can get dry ice and leave it out on a plate and if it's not good dry us there would be like a greasy film left from it no greasy film never killed nobody no it didn't but it's still there nice man so okay so you're just taking it just wet and just i'm sorry frozen do you guys grind i noticed you didn't even grind it up man you don't really need to it's frozen already it's gonna get jostled around in here too and the idea is that if you jostle it too much or [ __ ] with it too much the chlorophyll comes out of it right yeah that and that's part of the reason to stay cold too the closer freezing got it all the plant material will freeze and it still has water in it so it'll stay frozen and we can just work on extracting the tricho heads off of the top easy enough man easy enough so how hard would you guys start you guys started pretty early this morning with a [ __ ] big cooler full of ice yeah you definitely need a good setup that setup's [ __ ] awesome hey actually explain that setup because it's uh that's a good 10 gallon setup right yeah this is like the primo setup that you can get we've got the 10 gallon oh it don't matter bag and and other than that so there's four layers and what is the deal with the first off man you did go i demanded that they go to home depot and bring the bubble bags and just kind of put them over at the home depot and make sure they fit and i'm but um so we got a two bag set is that correct four bags we did get a four bag so is that include the first bag is the big giant strainer bag that's like a 220 micron right yep do you got that can you show that off so that would be that's the that's the first oh you're talking about the first one that one goes in the washing machine so yup that thing right there that's this big old tea bag right here so then it comes out the whole idea what the washing machine is then it comes out that little pump right yep so it comes out over here and we pour it into the bubble bags and now from there you're getting some finished product from there yeah so you're getting that's going to be so what is the first sift that green bag is going to be the first the bigger trichomes the heads and the more intact yeah that's pretty much junk and then the second the second the first one's junk yeah so with this that green bag is another 220. oh thank you so like the ordering of the bag it's the green one is a 220. the gray is like a 130 i think the second layer and then there's a 75 75 is where it starts getting good and then a 25 that's where it starts getting good yeah we actually and it really is strain dependent everyone's smoke uh how big the head of your trichomes are right um will vary from plant to plant so the micron bag that is going to have the best of the best you'll have to try it out and see with which strain and if it's dried or if it's fresh frozen changes which bags are going to have the best highest quality material in them garu i know i've told you this story but can i tell you the story about when i first found bubble bags it was probably like game changer it was like yeah i had so much i was a grower had just so i always had so much uh just popcorn bud and just you know unsellable crap and i was like what do you know i try to make like bubble hash i'm sorry i try to make like scissor hash with it or i'd have scissor hash i'd be like [ __ ] how do i make this i do the heat and pressure like the old like how they made chairs and people swear they were smoking my skin so they didn't like that but they um you make that with gloves on too i could i guess man but i went over i visited the dude went snowboarding with them when we first met each other man maybe 2000 or so it's when i first met my wife as well and that was like one of our first trips away and the last thing i saw like the last day i was in some kind of like smoke shop or a head shop and i saw bubble bags and i don't have much money and i was like dude i need you to empty or explain what they did and i was like they were like 270 bucks and i was like dude i need every bit of money we have and we pulled it up we had like 280 bucks and we spent our last dime on a set up i think it was a set of seven bubble bags though and she was like uh what the [ __ ] are we doing and i said just trust me all right and yeah those things were pretty awesome but it wasn't lead in the gold though it was if you took care of your trim and you separated your fan leaves from your good trim and then you've sifted that good trim or actually just washed it i guess is the right term and we would just start with like a wooden spoon just like barely agitated mixer on the drill i was the paint mixer guy and don't be the paint mixer guy be the artist with the wooden spoon man but my buddy used to make my buddy who was an artist used to make some [ __ ] amazing it was very similar to like scissor scraping because what it would come up with and dude in 2002 2003 that [ __ ] was all right people dug it oh good bubble anyway so that's what you're making there right yeah basically good bubble yeah really good bubble so that green one is is your second basically filter yeah it's essentially one of those 220 and then the next step is a little bit higher i can't find the tax form but so the bottom bag is always going to be the finest the best stuff that we want sometimes the second to the bottom but really but yeah that's what we're scooping up and putting into trays and then putting it into the freezer freeze dry if you're real real special about it you get a freeze dryer yeah we got a freeze dryer man i figured we had it i need every every bit of help i can get all right if i'm gonna make [ __ ] look good and that's actually a huge deal i mean in terms of not having to microplane everything out and expose it to room temperature for a prolonged period of time the freeze dryer is baller it will whatever terpenes you were able to extract and save with the tricho pads you have right the freezer like locks all that in and saves it for you and the idea is oxidation like rust or i don't even know what else oxidizes but you know things get hard you leave something on the counter it gets crispy and hard that's basically oxidation and that's what we got that's what happens with the hash yeah just agree with me yeah yes it is is it chemically changing from just being exposed to oxygen and uh heat that's out there so in the freeze dryer you can make sure that like almost none of that happens and you lock in all those terpenes yeah that makes sense because terpenes want to volatize off you leave you leave this [ __ ] that's why i call it the terp burglar because if you leave this how stinky this is it's not gonna stink like that forever if you leave that out like that you're gonna come back in two hours and it's not gonna smell like anything and it's not magic the terpenes [ __ ] went away man they've all tied off pretty easy all right man so uh keep this baby on is that what we're gonna do i got the freeze dryer going on here that and that is a hell of a hell of a thing to have that is pretty neat we're gonna have some beautiful blonde are you gonna kick that on really that makes it right [ __ ] it man i'll smoke man let's choke you camera yeah so clear probably ain't so good clear me it's not a ton of trichomes right although you probably don't want it too thick you don't want that [ __ ] too thick i mean if you got a bunch of plant material in there yeah if it's really green then you know you got some issues what's up what's a batch like what are you putting in about a pound something like that yeah yeah we're doing about a pound in these bags right no when you pull that you're not gonna you're just gonna [ __ ] pull that and clean it well i'll say no but pull it and it goes into a tray yeah it goes into the freezer and then you don't [ __ ] with it at all right now you don't have to dry it out or anything we're gonna we're just freezing it in the freeze the free dryer acts as a freezer too and a dryer and a dryer so it's not it's not pulling a back on anything right now so we're just pulling the tray out when it's ready to be scooped scooping it into the tray right right back into the freezer do you think there's a big difference in quality with them without a freeze dryer or it's just for looks no it makes it so that instead of having to microplane stuff out and hope to god you don't get mold in your hash this eliminates the risk of getting mold in your hash and makes that multiple week process take 19 hours it's awesome man while we're killing time man you said don't get mold in the hash and it's making me think in the new grow room i'm excited for the [ __ ] real psych man i actually made the statement that growing ain't that hard and i said that only because i knew that somebody was gonna build me a [ __ ] perfect girl you're talking about vacuums in the walls and stuff the house i grew up in had one of those vacuum things where you just plug it in right right man you must be rich man no it's a house built in like the 70s did it have an intercom also no no it did not but we were talking about like the different drywall and stuff like there is like we're gonna order mold resistant drywall um we're gonna [ __ ] put vents where they need to be we're gonna [ __ ] have it so it's you can vacuum [ __ ] up without anything you know without leaving moisture on the floor there's all this little stuff i think that if you have perfect environment uh or it makes growing a huge environment and i was talking to my wife about that and she was like i don't know and i was like remember when we lived in florida you could just take a plant throw it on your [ __ ] back patio as long as it didn't dry out you know it's getting hit by sprinklers or whatever it [ __ ] go grow like crazy you know it's like used to say it's like living in a greenhouse over there oh there especially with a greenhouse with too much sun yeah you gotta shade stuff out so if you make it i mean thank you hlg you guys hooked me up when i've got that 550 i've got some of those 360s that's plenty of good clean light you get a good i got a two ton ac in there make sure it's clean everything's mold free um man i'm feeling good feeling good about it you know actually i think even bruce banner said he was gonna give me a couple good strains you know and by the way isn't that half the battle i don't know i i see it i see both sides of it having a known proven winner of a clone it's cool to just pump out like super dank super derpy weed um finding your own super dank mother from seed is also pretty cool and like the lottery like gambling aspect of it where like am i gonna get a winner from this 12-pack i don't know yeah when you do get a winner from that 12-pack it's that's a pretty cool feeling versus i don't know i just see both sides of it seeds are fun seeds are more vigorous than clones i just want to go like this and whip out some dank and be like yo man check out how frosty this is you know i don't have to i don't have to invent it all right let's go from cook um yeah it's like i said banner's gonna hook me up i know there's uh you know you're doing all right when you have to decide if you want the sour diesel or not the original east coast tower diesel i said yeah oh yeah all right what do we got any progress report over there on the max cam i just put down some parchment on our little tray that we got and then i'm gonna spoon it out from the filters i'm gonna be the big spoon with a little spoon i'm always a big thing all right nice man did you even smoke yet i took a dab with you and we cheers to him but i don't know if you smoked another one cheersing the dab seems like a bad idea man seems like a bad idea hey i still have this what do you think this quality will look like you know i'm wondering it was pretty like clear this is this isn't our first run on this back right now this is [ __ ] we harvested in a rush because of [ __ ] you know talking about fresh frozen this is bro well it froze and thawed yeah this was when was that when what a couple months i don't know man very end of harvest we had a couple more weeks to go i would have liked to have waited a couple more weeks and all right i was in charge of the heater all right my pulse monitor could have saved me that day all right it would have or at least would have given you the ability to save it yourself it wouldn't have like been in there like oh i need to turn on the heat because it's not a controller right but it would have sent multiple texts to your phone it sure would i certainly could have used that but anyway so there's nothing no kind of like showpiece weed right here this stuff we harvested kind of quick very sadly and we always always intended on making some kind of extracts with it but uh i do want to see i don't say it's lead into gold because this was good stuff and we just harvested it and uh and kept it frozen i mean we did care for it properly yeah it's been taken care of it's restored properly right so there's going to be some fire hash to come out of it not sure how much you're good it does look good quite a bit how clear it was from running see that scares me when it yields a lot man god damn this is good i tell you what i was just stuck up on viola a little bit little it's hard to find that [ __ ] man for sure hey um our buddy uh olio that's what i've been saying let's see that let's see what the difference is with all that [ __ ] this one's almost gone but i mean you can just give it a smell good looking out guru good looking out man delicious i can't smell [ __ ] and like yeah and but i mean part of it too the dabs i bring with me up here there's certain dabs that just like don't leave the freezer unless they're like being pulled out to take a dab so it's got to be like my bottom shelf stuff is i'll bring up here because the top shelf stuff can't be out of the freezer for more than like five minutes you're really that big of a dab snoop man oh i couldn't give it to you you just need to come see the house and uh hang out for a minute all right take a dab there because that's where the good dabs are hey don't spoiled it but you know what's on the next waking bake dude started taking dabs and swears he's not getting high yeah all right we need the dude to come visit no no not to do there's a guy on from the dgc hadoop me and dude we're talking about i'm like saver for the show but uh yeah i've been thinking about that one i might have said that my buddy kenny in florida swears that the pen doesn't get them high anymore that can be maybe true just where those pins like the black market ones are thc distillate and then they just put like blueberry flavoring i got so pissed he's like dude i got these they're amazing man they're right from a dyspo and it was crap and it was from a medical florida dyspo and i was like you guys are selling this it was a ppg you know blueberry strain and it's freaking just fake blueberry favorite [ __ ] no i want my weed pins to taste like weed or really good rossignol and you know what's [ __ ] up by the way i was at the dyspo buying these i didn't say this max dude the average age was 50 there man everybody was so goddamn old and happy and just not worth seeing [ __ ] like that when i go to the center it was so cool man i used to hate seeing the old people oh i can't eat those in front of me online at the dispensary because i know that they're going to take [ __ ] forever but other than that oh what do you mean the worst is the person that's just [ __ ] got their card and it's like holy [ __ ] man this is so cool yeah or i mean i don't know i've definitely had people come visit before and want to go to the dispensary for the first time right and they go in there and ask a million questions and then the dispensary uh like blood tender doesn't always give the best like uh regularly a recommendation for stuff i'm like y'all should just listen to me right i know what the thing the dang weed the dank dabs of the dispensary is but like some people just want that like experience of like going there and talking to a bud tender and like seeing what they recommend and stuff so i get it i'm used to going to the med side is the first time i went to a lot of stuff in colorado the wreck side gets the drop and the med side kind of gets the seconds so i had to go to the rec side to get this man and yeah there's i tell you what there has to be max you go to that dispenser there's got to be 75 different types of weed that are just in these little you know little gram cases that you can look at god forbid you really gave a [ __ ] about shopping man he'd be there forever yeah although you can rule out like 90 of them [ __ ] like that i try to stop my fingers they're so loaded with ross it barely works bring it man let me scoop all this weed off the finest and this is a few runs deep all right pretty green that is kind of green man i'm not all that psyched i think you're pulling a little bit of chlorophyll no but here let me let me hold luke's getting on the camera though so okay so now that's a tray that's a freeze dryer tray right yeah so we're gonna talk about that into the freeze dryer but that's just the second to finest bag right can they need more bags to scoop there you go and now this isn't our finished product of course whoa that is green though man baby poop green baby poop green and i guess those are the different runs because you can certainly see the different colors of it you know all right so how long does it stay on that freeze drive for 19 hours 19 hours what time is that what does that mean actually that works out it'll be tomorrow it's 19 hours under vac too so it's not even started quite yet once we get it all loaded up okay we don't have the vacuum pump on you yeah the oilless vacuum pump deal and then so then after that though then we squeeze it right yep that's the final step and by the way you could literally just take this flower put it in the rosin bomb and squeeze it and get some good [ __ ] dabs out of it yep but this is with the connoisseur process right here i guess that this you are getting plant material because you're squeezing you're gonna be squeezing some plant material out yeah depending on how care if you're really careful and you seal up the bag right right not that without it blowing out it will catch all the plant material on it because it's so like a micron screen really guys i mean we have gotten some good ass [ __ ] uh by squishing top quality bud yeah we've definitely gotten good ass flower rosin yeah and on that what's the variable on that it's heat and pressure temperature and pressure temperature and pressure and then i mean bag pressure is what really matters with it but that is more math for oh it's it's how like the surface area of the plates and then how the volume of the bag and then the pressure that actually builds up on the inside of the bag right it's like the actual method and it don't matter but yeah especially with like the rosin bomb yeah super easy to do like 185 um and squish it all the way for two minutes and do like a pre-press right 30 seconds right pretty easy and what you're it was like some people were saying they're getting like 30 yields out of [ __ ] that seems insane i don't see how that could be with i mean some people are saying it i don't know if they're getting a bunch of plant material out of it as well but i have heard things like up to 30 yields uh yields of off of squish and flower squish and flower that's yeah that's pretty that's pretty ridiculous ridiculous i mean there's people getting 60 70 percent uh squishing hash because they're taking the hashtag basically already good making water hash and then squishing that and you get a lot higher returns too yeah or even just shaking co2 or uh shaking dry ice in a bubble bag onto like a piece of glass collecting it and squishing that stuff that's what my lazy ass used to do is that you get it on the internet you get a lot of plant material you do it definitely [ __ ] with the quality but if you're going to be squishing it anyway true yeah i mean i get i see your point keeping as much plant material is out or out as possible and what we're talking about is you just literally take your 220 micron bag the big the like the biggest bag the one kind of the one that was in the washing machine too you just put dry ice in it you put your plant material in and you shake it it comes out like a [ __ ] salt shaker man i always use cheesecloth just wrap the [ __ ] out of a bunch of meat and cheese spot oh yeah yeah weird everybody everybody's got their technique that's why we're doing this comment let us know what you think we're doing something wrong let us know i'm sure i'm sure they are oh [ __ ] i said we need to add somebody to do the uh the live feed they'll let us know what's going on over there the chat will let us know if something's up that's about all man just hey it's what we're doing today and uh how many more runs we got max this is it this is it yeah this is the last one the [ __ ] you make me buy 10 bags of ice though just for this bag this is the it's done i don't know how many more bags we have left i think actually if i'm not mistaken we'll be doing this for a little bit yeah good [ __ ] this is what we're up to today we'll see y'all tomorrow dude's excited too i think got awake and bake talking about some cool [ __ ] dude and i had some good conversation this weekend okay [ __ ] save it man save it but that's about it so till uh manana thank you so much for hanging out and uh i will see you tomorrow take her easy guru take her easy max she's easy to take her twice

ashes yeah definitely so a bit of a eucalyptus sort of flavor so excuse me nice bit of ash so what will do is will it's very very crumbly I mean that I'll show you how come me I just do this with my fingers that just comes apart very very soft like so you just get that sort of that black eucalyptus type sort of flavor with it let's get in the bar gonna see if this was as good as the last one so really really impressed with these guys Pollux so far very nice we'll just do a nice big fatty in the air so you look and see me choke point guts up because I know that makes people laugh so there you go so girl well like that get your bombs ready right because it's now communal boiling split time guys are like you ready for this so just you can see again as a fatty in there [Music] bonds up guys peace enough [Music] [Music] oh it does it does it taste like the black ash like a squidgy black or anything like that it takes more like a like a rock here or a soak our soap a sort of flavor to it very strange nice very nice gotta say the little hashes from there that they are fantastic you know I can't knock the hash at all from this place it's just [ __ ] second to none so we're making little joint guys it swaps I know you might enjoy the joint test so again we're using the raw paper skies so obviously they're not bleached there's natural products it's making a cop there guys little ticketing yum down you know white so add a bit of white CBG and I've mixed it with basically the cookies crush what's goin on that guys don't [ __ ] know series only [ __ ] Michael [ __ ] off go away

guys choose my apologies there guys yeah so again thanks to dr. Danes fair around clearing up obviously the legality I was very confused about that I've read a lot of stuff by yet I've gone to a lot of forums the fact that we've got you know the CPG shopping Tang which is basically being set up is like a little at some coffee shop place so I can't see that last very long if if it's illegal so basically as far as a food supplement it's not illegal put it into food or spying and all of that but as soon as you you burn it yeah then effectively you're turning it into something illegal ain't all you so don't do as I do do do do is you want basically it's your lives you have to make your own decisions on this I've always smoked cannabis I ain't never gonna stop people ain't let's stop Meg you know is what it is basically but it just shows how close we are to it you know when you've got all these Street places which is selling it you know next to a police station basically so it's only a matter of time basically before things do become legal I think all rhymes I think it'll all become eagle so shortly but we'll say I've been saying that for years and years ago exactly let's be honest but I think we're closer than we have rough being now so we'll see we'll see why so get your joints ready guys my knees just about that yes and that's obviously we've gone for that the non [ __ ] copy white type of music right now cuz I don't wanna get myself in trouble or we're doing everything correctly I want to keep the channels go in or what the channel to grow and you know be successful [Music] hey guys I'm back and I'm ready so bottoms up guys Pisa respect to one of you she's honest wit yo faculty first guys one love yeah right here we go I've got bit like say white CBG we've got bit of cookies and we've got obviously the magic ingredient which is the Lebanese all CBD guys perfectly perfectly awesome you know there's no tech jug putting this at all so literally it's all from the product side the three products I've just ordered from hemp ash the white CBG on after the review on it I wasn't impressed with it to be honest review so I make too much length to put the video I or not I didn't like it compared to their other products it was not a patch on it i mean this cookies taste like skittles it's [ __ ] beautiful but that's not bad really and posh to be fair that I say ten product I've tried of yours there's only one I don't really like anything else bad and the only they all in this stuff is a taste it's a plain prisoner it's do you like straw beauty like orange do you like lemon you know we've all got different you know different practices to what we like as far as the flavor goes same with the older you know does it smoke - good-bye fight this CBD doesn't compare to normal weed it doesn't burn the same yeah so eight with a business knife yeah like I said I need somebody to do pocket split desk is they sent for me guys alright the [ __ ] balls man I'll put my bombs all day [ __ ] long so nicely smooth hmm more enjoyable than some of the other ones definitely [Music] yeah nice like I say the cookies is nice really with order the cookies again guys [Music] I just need some more products to review now because I'm running late so I've done what I can so we staying - people like that - you know if they want to support me they want to see that products on screen you know and then once we promote by all means they say hey it's up because I'm doing this on the long term yeah some white guys [Music] no BOTS got that cookies taste is coming through it there as well mixed in with the hash 24% CBD this is so again that's that's how they get away with obviously selling it guys because they've got the word bag quite clearly souvenir so it's not being sold to do what I'm doing right now it's being sold as a souvenir and that's the legal loophole bass bit well I'm not for that more [ __ ] pong me cuz it's just like backbones me no sorry [Music] yeah so rank chain of the bond so guys get your bombs out if you watching me you're a bone man you know get your bones out definitely Nik like you know I see you on the phone all the time mate with Danny so join me for this one guys yeah Peter that's all you so have another communal bomb to Gary have peace Lebanese 24% CBD not legal [Music] so far [Music] you can just tell on the exhale you just get a couple of CBD notes to it you guys you slug the CBD hash down that a bit but you'll know I mean you get that initial it tastes just like hash and that's all as I'm exhaling look at that a little bit of CBD taste to it basically this is really hard to put into words but you guys take them you smoke you'll know what I mean it's a bit sort of a bit of a grass you know that you kind of get at the end of it basically it's not gonna [ __ ] a bag just gonna smoke no sniffs no we're not let's get all the review you guys like a longer review because I know you like to sit here and chill and have your Biff tears and you know effectively you're in here with me you're me you're taking part off the justices world CBD show right now sipping tea ah I guys I love tea probably my favorite drink it is to be fair right now should we go for bomb number three I think this is really gonna [ __ ] kill me this time guys oh man Oh coughing a lot I ain't got no [ __ ] coronavirus so I've been feeling too great so I get out oh got sweats for that oh dear wait yeah

and then at the end you get a bit of an aftertaste of the CBD would order again I laugh because it's the second time I've ordered this get with 10 pains from hash let you smoke three quarters that your window the Grammys just not enough of this I really feel my inside you know like just dispersed it's [ __ ] up out the door right now it's gone fine [ __ ] off cm8 literally my whole body just feels I can oddly speak to those of you it's had so much of an effect sweat it it's not like in the ads like in the tha I can't describe it it's just like for me I get this anxiety and this feels like I've just got a big bubble all around me it's just like knots and it's just like it doesn't does it it doesn't does it and then I just feel like just released I just feel like quite normal like it's really hard to describe if you haven't got you know anxiety issues basically but why that's the fastest thing to get rid of my anxiety even above th e to be fair I thought that is works better but I do think they work in conjunction with each other I think any time a little bit both personally that's what's worked for me but really really good I really like this product guys order it get yourself on hip hash and all of the products and let them know that you've got the idea from Justin's world CBD because they've got sent me any freebies yeah I like to buy already so all you guys out there thinking that you know this is free and I'm moving the way this and that it's not free I've paid for it I pay for out my own money I'm not any help on this show what to really to be back financially

for the next review thank you again doctor dance and I will speak to all you guys tomorrow ladies nice laters potatoes", "dUPAm55aL3o": "so this is inside the grow room one of my other smaller rooms this is my master room must the grow room for some clones going on I've got some hash I'm you know this video is gonna be showing the different types of quality of hash so I'm gonna let you know what is the best what you have to look for when it comes to speaking about hash so basically what you do and let me show you the first one this is commercial and what you'll see with commercial wait until we give a bit of heat it takes a minute or two to show what you want so when you give heat to the to the hatch once it's in powder how about is the first stage when you get the hash so the second stage is making it into what you can cut into and cream and paste and this happens when you apply yield and pressure what happens with number bag number one is this stuff doesn't have it has very little bubbles when you burn it and that will show you the quality only good stuff will show bubbles and it will go black the that means that the oils are coming out and that means that this hash is gone nice always if you'd seen this one when you burn it it turns black easier quicker sorry so and you can see it starts to get bubbles because this stuff here is better than the first one so as you can see it gets stuck very easy and it turns in easier to paste and this makes this this one in particular you see the bubbles there that's the oil look the hash this is a better quality hash than the first one and this is even better stuff so again you get the powder and you can see in this one when you burn will turn even quicker black and you'll get bubbles quicker look at the bubbles and the smell on this one it gets very smooth the better is the smooth that becomes and the more like sticky and black and more bubbling once you see bubbles now those bubbles now with bubbles all around this stuff is one of the best quality and how sticky it is so here we go after that this determines the quality of the hash and this one is back here is got the best the best policy for chrysalis content of audience speaking so you can see the first one has it got much all yours the second one fifty-fifty and a third one it goes black and oily and it's got like that shiny towards itself because first category second and third and this is the powder so this is the first the first stuff that we'd burn this is the second and this is the third this is the better quality stuff you can't really see from one to the other the qualities of the of the hash until you start burning it and applying pressure so this is ways how to know the quality of hashes in any good and this is about it", "Lpc-eiRyrG4": "what's up what's up what's up welcome back welcome to it just want to show you a little hash program that i'm throwing together here i uh filled up my [ __ ] bubble magic 20 gallon the bag is stuffed i did a layer of ice roughly 20 pounds on the bottom threw my bag in with about three pounds of trim and buds mainly all buds and then filled it up with water and topped it again with about another 15 pounds of ice and it's sitting here for about a half an hour and this system works really good uh up here is the uh timer so you can set it for increments of uh 15. uh what i'm going to be doing is running two rounds of 30 minutes probably three rounds of 30 minutes more than likely depending on how much i get out of the second run and this has a great feature on it for uh you see here on the left soft normal and hard so i set it for normal uh depending on your preference you can do whatever you want on your extraction so it's been sitting uh the great thing too so you'll see it turns up real nice stops and then reverses to the other side so yeah i'm gonna let that go for about 30 minutes and uh then it's got an auto drain here so i'll spill it off into the sink it'll drain off and the two bags that i'm working with here i basically got a 160 for my contaminant bag and a 45 on the bottom i don't catch anything in them in the middle because this is for my own personal that i basically press into rosin and i like a full spectrum rosin so all of the middle bags that you see here i actually will um uh not use any of those so nothing else better to do while you're making hash than eating some seized candy and drinking a nice bottle of woodwork so hell yeah that's what the [ __ ] i'm doing right now i'm gonna get lit i got enough ice in the icebox uh to keep this thing going so show you guys what i'm working with this is about half of my inventory that i have to run uh so basically i took the bottom layer off which was half of this bin this other half right here it uh still needs to be stripped off of the branches but then i've got some of um freedom farms uh agent orange trim i've got some other stuff that i've been keeping for hash and then like i said this is about half of what i've got to run so basically the three pounds that's in this machine now will take three runs to be done and then i go ahead and switch over and do another run so you can see this is time consuming for the amount that i've got but it's all good that's what we're here to do and uh we're gonna keep it running what i'll do is i'll give you guys an update on uh what i pull from the whole run and uh let you guys know what the total hash amount was a bubble hash that i end up getting here i'll dry it out and um and then what i'll do is i'll press it so all what i'd like to do is show you guys how much i end up getting uh from this run from this magic bubble machine bubble magic machine and then based on the amount of hash that i get uh i'll do a giveaway and you guys can guess how much rosin it produces so last year just to give you an idea my um uh my blue blue mist that i did all of the extra that i had from that i also had uh made some other different stuff from it and some batter and give some away but i ended up having about a 63 gram jar of just the blue mist so that gives you an idea of how much rosin is going to be pressed so yeah i am in the kitchen as you see nice and cold so things are a little out of array but it's all good kids are away big boss will play oh yeah hey if you guys haven't touched on that right there dude let me tell you this is a sleeper woodwork oh so good so tasty all right guys i'm gonna work on this bottle and get this run gone uh stay lifted if you got any questions about how i'm doing my hash blah blah blah feel free to leave uh the comments below i definitely will answer them i will tell you that before i do my runs i like to spray my uh my mesh screens with alcohol and then i rinse them so that way i get full flow you'll notice anybody that's done hash before you know that that's essential to keep the flow going through the bucket and on this bucket you see i cut out the bottom so this will sit in the sink and the flow will basically just dump right out make it really easy for me and uh the ice stays in the machine and then i'll run the whole bag again so that's a system that i run very simple and like i said you can add the middle bags if you want uh to separate your spectrums but i do a full spectrum i don't need to [ __ ] around with a bunch of different ones and see how they are i just kind of like the full deal so uh right now i'm running black dog and that's basically what's in this bin right here is all black dog and then the agent orange and then i've got uh some of the um uh gorilla mints that i've got going so we've got a lot a lot to do so i'll show you this run i'll show you what the amount will be for the second run and like i said i'll show you the uh full amount of uh finished hash that comes out of the project so yeah again everybody smash that like button you know what to do right now if you're a new subscriber this is just a little in turn video on what i do between the seasons and uh oh yeah i'll show you guys these because this is some big ship popping uh this is officially 24 hours in the water oh yeah uh max stomper we've got 30 seeds in here and generally the ones that go down to the bottom are the ones that will pop first and i think i even got one popped already in there uh but this is mac stomper crossed with something else somebody this was somebody's project that was gifted to to me through a friend and uh this is gonna be my next um clone project so we're gonna pop all 30 weed out the males and these will also be going outdoor for my first uh for the first outdoor grow and those will be light depth so yeah thanks for hanging out in my kitchen tonight everybody all right guys take it easy peace", "mk2TVegWRu4": "[Music] hi guys today's video I teamed up with David from Lucca fur salon and he's a professional hair stylist I get asked a ton of questions about hair color and I am NOT a professional at all so I thought it would be helpful to have someone who is a professional answer some of those questions about bleaching and just how to achieve that ashy or gray colored hair and thanks to David I was able to have a little bit of fun with my own hair in the process and we did sort of a semi-permanent silvery gray look but now into the Q&A so some of the most common questions I get are how to achieve in a she blond hair color and what are the best products are bleaching what are the best products for toning and what levels is least to use and all the above so what would you recommend for getting a hair color like this I went from super darks to really blonde and it took me probably two years and I think a lot of people don't understand that it does take time especially if you want a nice blonde yes yeah a lot of people don't think it was like it didn't dyeing their hair very dark for years the whole statement from there do you need to list up with one stylist my doing this is a very high-level drop button I will leave that the same time but that might damage the hair looks better to go a bit slower and like maybe like taking three five lines of your year two years or something on what the kind of like hair you've had about them to achieve like a very light platinum the thieves don't want that as a hair I think it's great great yeah exactly so for getting like an ashy color to your hair you have to list your hair to be a certain level for it to take this silver tint right well basically you want it as light as well well depending on how like platinum or like since there's different levels of blondes right you can get darker blonde there to be very very light almost like white we want a little bit more silver with your donor today but like the ellipsis so it's all burned you want as the least possible yellow thereafter the zucchini crispy black bear but for black to blonder stem level the pair of colors naturally floating starter blackish number one and envy like the white block we wanted to be like towards the level femme for like the Platinum every peso so yeah I'm hopeful like black have like under lighting the ribs so brown hair that is a like being in orange and blonde as a member I think gala so it's even this longer specific about super platinum because it looks very faster that's good through to little from red to yellow yeah but yes is doable but you want to take your time doing it yeah be observes out there unless you want to provide hair hey doctor girl we can do yeah all slowly for the basic reaction is but depending talk to your stylist you'll see like what kind of like a sheen if you want when people wanted with more silver some people just want is like a lighter white be quite long and it's fine even imagine yeah so basically choosing this owner with your stylist a little bit even vfp today for example we've little 11 to LinkedIn hi lip balm yeah and I use 11 hash and I add a little bit of stuff pilot pigments to its example even get more yellow zone mm-hmm yeah so bleaching the hair basically removed the color whereas Tony has certain things I've done it because when you because we shun the Herakles be meeting away didn't like Batman it's just literally going in the air and it's actually removing pigment that's why you see that underlying pigment coming group yeah and basically you have to really shift user with sort of Shaymin to be put pigments back into the hair because it can be this wide open basically with no pigment the hair is like before acceptable to Allah losers come in that's where you find more grassiness like even if you achieve like a really nice launched by reaching you want to look like these new your pigments tips I block anything for coming and acid hmm while you're bleaching your hair there are like different levels of cues and I know some file if you like a forty developer and then there's as well as there's a little something brand liberal yeah like a three or two level yeah I'm a three-point question beautiful notice what they have yeah but there's no ammonia in the colors and most alert research on ammonia and well you don't want to use like 40 volume on ability to climb hair because I would just like very like where did the famous way to pass and creates a lot of damage yeah and yeah so we can really melt off yeah the higher the volume of developer the more damaging to social the faster and it goes basically like this is using some volume on somebody with your natural level like a brown hair yeah there's some things to always platinum still take a longer time yeah processing or do you all your 30 volumes a little link oh really faster that everything is a disaster well for they're very harsh on like a fine hair follicles those are probably more from coarser hair tie personally never use a higher 30 when bleaching therapy among people is very great so I guess the moral of the story is if you're wanting to go from dark to like a really ashy blonde it's going to take time and let me want all your hair to break off it never happens overnight just a lot of patience and going to salon and to talk to your stylist yeah you know I should set a goal and your stylist just like this you know like how long they estimated with me yeah and most people shouldn't come in waking like oh it could be done in two hours yeah very long time bro so keep this area there you really don't want to damage it alright cool I think that answers pretty much everything so playing career being a part of the video today and hopefully that answers a lot of your questions that you guys have been asking and I'm going to be writing a blog post about this as well so I will link that down below if you have any other questions feel free to ask and I will see you guys next week in my next video bye [Music]", "9YJQLjO4dXM": "hi there welcome to my youtube channel my name is ben aka notions i'm just going to show you how crumbly this stuff is that i got off braided raidedgreen.com it's called premium bubble hash and if i take a little bit just crumble it into a tiny single skin joint as you can see it crumbles pretty easily with just the heat from my fingers so i put a tiny bit of what fell off it in and now i'm gonna roll it up and maybe add a bit of blood first so yeah this is 20 premium bubble hash which is cbd of course 20 cbd uh percent wise and it i look forward to experience the taste of it and in fact so thanks for watching bye for now", "LDjBIEdGjIo": "oh what's good youtube welcome back to another live sesh today's daily dab we're taking some dabs checking some ph runoff adjusting ph and most importantly pressing hash got some master kush trim hash that we were watched uh late last week that's been sitting in the freeze dryer waiting waiting patiently for the press trust me this is super fast so we're gonna get into this i'm gonna get into it real good but first but first the routine can't [ __ ] with the routine so let me get the chat pulled up apparently i need to get some music going so i can stop making my own let's go with no copyright strikes today we're going to play some uh hmm let's go with the coffee shop what's up grower bobby fpv ocean dad lisa good morning good morning everybody there it is yes there we go i guess clear those turret caves [Music] super super clean rig just cleaned it last night i took two dabs out of it gotta keep that [ __ ] fresh son fresh to death [Music] oh yeah looks clean smells clean it tastes clean l runs mendo roaning let's get some more of this wet ass mendo probably gonna finish this up in the next day or two i better conserve i can't really tell how good that light is either maybe i should be more like [Music] voila little piggy piggy pinecrank i'm gonna eat it i hope you guys have a productive day positive nothing but positive vibes you guys cheers [Music] [Music] so almost got me drooling already i haven't even really gotten the hit hit i got the terpigs [Music] wow never fails oh yeah fire [Music] oh cheers everybody [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] [Music] wow [Music] [Music] yes oh bad let's go do our little walk around check on [ __ ] you guys already know [Music] first things first this room has been staying pretty cold i haven't been keeping it at 58 but i've been keeping it at 64. which is allowing me to keep the inside of this tint area at 76 and 49 which is definitely not high enough humidity and the temperatures are a little low so they're a little stressed out looking right now as you can tell but as soon as i uh harvest this hash out of here today i'll go ahead and adjust the temperature back and we'll be good to go but uh these are all doing good i mean they got nice little thick stems on them nice nice branching i'll be able to go ahead and pluck uh all my clones that i need off of here pretty soon decent roots for not even being on a drip system right now just being hand fed still we still got the uh chopped cream doing the uh three leaves the polyploidism real nice yeah it's just it's looking good they're all doing good remember these are all already uh females confirmed so we don't worry about it go ahead and put this door back up keep it warmer in there [Music] now in here let me grab my coffee what the [ __ ] first of all let me pull up stream on my phone that way i can take the chat with me and uh we're gonna do a couple things real quick before we even go in that [Music] room we're going to go ahead and pull up our aqua x for our history there it is all right so last night i collected more runoff that the uh the ph was still pretty high in the medium coming out at 6.6 ish so i went ahead and adjusted the inbound ph to 5.02 5.3 and started pushing those nutrients through and you can see here on the mendo you can see that calcium magnesium deficiency here and it's on every plant you know um some more than others but on alien og you can see these leaves are just barely starting to show signs of it otherwise they're pretty happy so definitely need to increase the ec overall right both both strains are showing you know similar issues um that means it's time to bump up the feed so what i did is i increased the ec from 2.5 to 3.5 a whole ec bump um i'm pretty comfortable with that you can see the type of stacking we're getting here [Music] [Music] so what i'll do is i'll continue to catch my runoff using my clone tray trick cut a clone tray in half wedge it so it slants use a root riser or an extra riser if you need to so it doesn't sit in water and then you can run off at the end of every day and see how much your one-on-one volume was as well as your ph and your ec and uh my ec is usually within one ec or two ec of whatever i'm putting in and the old theory that it should only be within a point or two of you know what you're putting in that's not true because we do what's called ec stacking where we're getting the ec and the cube up to four or five even six you know overnight in the morning when they start getting watered again they're gonna be getting flushed out from that you see build-up and it's gonna you know make it look like it's a higher ec on the runoff when in reality it's not really any anything to be concerned about you know if you're monitoring your medium you see which i am removing some of these affected leaves and also making sure that everything stays nice and open so that these side branches continue to develop the way that they have been the plan here is you can kind of see hopefully you can kind of see i've got three nice rows going here really good even canopy the way it's lined up with you know top top top and then the whole line straight down pretty much in one row of squares same thing here what i'm going to do is i'm going to not top these i'm going to super crop these right so you can see how this auxiliary branch this one they're all almost caught up to the net right this one here so if i were to take this top now maybe like right here at the net and super crop it i'm not going to do it right now because it's not time backwards and down and put it underneath this net now it's at the same level as everything else on the plant but this will be the main polar spill and i'm going to get a nice sexy row of main colas with a bunch of very nice even supporting colas throughout the canopy so that's the plan i've got the same you know set up on both sides as far as three and three so you can kind of see the same thing here go down this aisle here [Music] and i've got another one catching a runoff here if i measure two places move this one over here to this side and again these are going to get the same exact treatment i'm just coming in making sure that all the uh affected leaves come off so i can see the new growth coming in nice and healthy and making sure that we leave the canopy open for all the lateral branching that's going on you can see some plants were affected more than others with uh the higher ph and the lack of available nutrients so i flushed this one this one plant and uh this one plant was about 2 000 ml each last night by hand and that seemed to have put them back on the correct path sooner than uh just letting them go with the irrigation so today will be the first full day with them getting 3.5 ec that 5.2 the reason for that is because we're still getting a slightly high ph runoff and we want to make sure that we fully correct that in all cubes before we move on so right now we're sitting at 69 percent in the cube and uh 5.38 for water ec it is um [Music] 9 21 right now so they're about to get irrigated uh here in a minute now the reason that this particular cube is at such a high um saturation point already is because i watered it like i said first thing last night i went through and i hit a couple by hand and i wanted to flush out the one that had my moisture sensors in it get it up to full saturation so i knew what my full saturation percentage is right now it's about 65 on troll master i'll show you over here [Music] or on here it's about 75 percent i was able to determine that last night and now that's going to help me dial in my over my drybacks as far as when my last watering of the day is and when my first watering of the day is so that i can achieve the correct percentage or drive back that i want to steer growth appropriately whether vegetably or generatively so there's so much that goes into that though that you need to be able to a measure your runoff your daily runoff percentage you need to be able to measure your pore water ec and your water content your volumetric water content percentage and you need to be able to do all of those simultaneously in order to create the graphs and the longitudinal the longitudinal um you know historical data that you're looking for goons what's up brother appreciate you man thank you for the support terpene junkie what's up bro show a close-up of the leaves affected hopefully you saw it i don't know if you did if not i will definitely go back and show that so calmac deficiencies really in my experience in hydroponics like rock wool and deep water culture everything except for like cocoa basically calmac deficiencies show up slightly different and in cocoa i noticed in soil and cocoa they the the calm deficiencies kind of expressed themselves a little bit differently in my experience i'm not a soil grower i've done one soil grow i've done zero cocoa growth but i've consulted on a lot of everything and um yeah so in my experience of like rock wool and deep water culture things like that um calmac deficiencies usually express themselves as a splotching on the leaves all right um it looks like a dark brown splotching almost like somebody were to take a cigarette and put it on your leaf but instead of burning black it burns brown and it burns from the inside out and it spreads and you'll start getting more and more splotches the worse it gets and then once you reach a certain level of splotching it'll just look like intervenal chlorosis to the maximum which is when the individual pieces on the leaves start to brown out and then once you get past the necrosis stage then you really start having issues because now not are you only just super deficient on calmadd but now you're gonna start becoming locked out on a lot of other things because your calmac's missing if your calmag is missing you guys know mulders chart and you guys know liebig's barrel or leibig's law right your yield is limited to the least available nutrient right such that once you increase that nutrient to sufficient levels your yield is then limited by the next most deficient nutrient so if calmag is deficient it's going to start [ __ ] up everything else you know um and then you start seeing the chlorosis of the upper leaves and a bunch of other stuff um cocoa is buffered cocoa is 100 buffered that's why i said you see it differently right hydroponics is not buffered so let me go show you real quick typically um the first the first signs in my opinion that you're gonna start seeing calmac deficiencies on is going to be the newer grow all right because uh calmac believe it or not is not super duper mobile it's a little bit mobile a little bit but not a lot so if the plant needs it and the newer growth where it's growing it may send some from the older growth right so you may start to see the deficiency first on older growth a little bit but you're also going to see it at the top row yeah i wasn't covering the mic good so if we just look at these first few plants here and i know the white balance and [ __ ] is all rough but look check this out so here's a good plant to look at here is the telltale signs right there this is an advanced stage of calcium magnesium deficiency this is not the beginning stages if you were to see one or two little spots not even looking let me see if i could find a top leaf a top leaf is not going to have it as bad see that's a top leaf having that issue but not as bad you could see the small necrosis spots right here on the on the leaf edge right um let's see let's just fan dammit this one doesn't have it much yet these are small plants but not a lot of demand but yeah that's that's like the best example right there like legit that's a really good example that's what it looks like when it first starts out this is what it looks like when it progresses okay that's straight up cal mag but it could also mean that the plants just need an overall higher ec also um calmag does weird [ __ ] to growth because calcium calcium is used as one of the major building blocks of the cell walls um it creates a lot of the plant tissue itself and if you have a lack of calcium what tends to happen is you'll get twisted growth along with those splotches and the necrosis which is the telltale sign on top of everything else if you see that twisted growth calmac deficiency i'm almost 100 sure if you have those other signs perfect example look at this lower growth right remember i told you see how it's starting to contort a little bit right that was because when this plant started it had cow mag deficiencies this was at one time a new leaf it doesn't turn into this if it comes out a straight leaf it pretty much stays straight unless it gets really [ __ ] up and dry right like this leaf it came out pretty healthy it's going to stay straight even if it goes deficient but new growth like this [ __ ] up here you can see it was kind of starting to twist a little bit and then let me take you to where i i know it's the worst i think it was like the worst back here i might have seen one or two plants starting to do it which is how i knew it was starting to get bad let me see if i could find it [Music] so here's some more new growth with that issue cow mag easy to see [Music] i might have already pulled the leaf off i can't find it now but basically the leaves will be contorted the new growth the leaves will be just weird twisted and funky and they'll be looking they'll be looking like this coming out of the new growth but maybe even worse that's a really good way to tell if you have all those other signs as well that it's a calmag issue another leaf i could spot that's doing it i'll just pull it off and show it to you look see the twist in the leaf weird [ __ ] right so that's why i went ahead and bumped up the ec yesterday from 2.5 to 3.5 i'll give them one full day on 3.5 irrigation at a 5.2 ph to bring down the ph into my comfort zone of 5.4 to 5.7 once i've achieved a runoff value getting into the 4ec range and that ph range i just mentioned and i'm hitting a poor water ec value of you know six to seven then i think i'll be happy right now i haven't seen anything over you know five five point seven on my poor water ec which i could be going as high as seven without issues right now so like right now we're at 69 and 5.4 that's going to go down more over the course of the day but overnight when we do this drive back tonight that's gonna go back up so that's what's going on but um i mean that sides obviously the taller bigger clones that i put over there this one has some smaller ones like this front light the rest are all about the same size as those now they caught up and i'm gonna go ahead and give these about one week basically they're gonna finish this reservoir all right once they finish this reservoir i'm expecting to have everything 100 dialed in i'm going to strip them to the top three nodes on every main branch that i plan on keeping i'm gonna super crop the main stem the primary branch i'll super crop i'm gonna drop the net down on top of them and then go ahead and give it like two days and then i'm gonna flip so it's going to be a crazy week coming up i'm going to start hitting them with some power si athena ag stack which is the kelp and uh some ipm and uh they're gonna get hit a couple times a week probably two times a week for the next week or two and then once we have bud sites we're gonna stop and i'll start upping my ec in the reservoir so probably around you know getting close to four 4.5 um me personally i this is just a really really really hungry [ __ ] cultivar the fact that i'm pushing you know 2.5 ec and i'm hitting five 5.5 ec in the medium during dry back and they're still going deficient that [ __ ] goes to show you that they want more ec they want it they [ __ ] want it and i don't give a [ __ ] what anybody says if i have to push this crop to 8ec again on the inbound nutrient solution i i will will trust me i will hopefully i can avoid doing that but um the first week that i think that these are like 100 healthy or as close as i can get it i'm sending in lab samples sending in inbound nutrient solution runoff nutrient solution i tested the medium yeah i'm gonna cut a chunk of rock wool off and um leaf tissue sample and i'm gonna do that for two plants i'm gonna do it for amino breath and i'm gonna choose one of the alien ogs what that's gonna do is it's going to enable me to get feedback from jr peters who was then going to tell me okay on your inbound nutrient solution here's your actual ppm levels of every single nutrient an element in micronutrient right on your runoff here's the same exact thing right so now we can tell what the plant is taking up and then they're going to look at the leaf tissue and really confirm what it's taking up right and all of those things are basically going to enable me to make very good decisions about do i need to simply increase the ece more do i need to increase a specific nutrient more do i need to decrease any am i wasting a bunch which means i can decrease the amount that i'm feeding or just increase the uptake uptake is one of the most overlooked things there is right it doesn't matter how much you're feeding your plants or how little you're feeding your plants what matters is how you're driving their metabolism and through that and the dry backs you can control the medium you ec and really spike it and make them have everything they need available if you drive their uptake correctly but some plants are just going to want that higher ec right so it's about finding the balance and that's what that's what all these data points are for that's what we talk about every day on the show so those of you that are new here today i don't know if there is anybody welcome to the channel 24-hour light during veg versus 18-6 i think that you should look up dli and you should look up the circadian rhythm and you should think about how it would affect your body if you had the lights on all the time and when you tried to sleep if the lights were blazing and if how that would affect your sleep and there for the rest of your day and your processes what's up j-rock check my email real fast sorry there's a chilly one in here i don't feel like doing that right now sorry paul it's not gonna happen you're gonna have to wait buddy all right and my meetings are [Music] mother [ __ ] empty let's go monday you're treating me right no monday meeting no monday meetings confirmed sweet well with that said i wanted to take some readings in there while i finished drinking my coffee do you guys want to go with me all right we're going to take a bunch of readings after i change my battery i gotta um start using this [ __ ] log that i created because what the [ __ ] did i make it for if i'm not gonna use it wham bam thank you ma'am all right and i made it into a pdf but you know what i'm actually gonna do i'm gonna turn it into an excel spreadsheet and then based on that excel spreadsheet you're going to be able to [Music] automatically have it graph things for you so you can see your trends and your [ __ ] like that so as long as you're going in there and doing your daily checks it'll it'll log the information for you and kind of create a nice little data analysis trend let's hit this runs baby oh my god the sweet runs some gmo rosin gross gross garlic butter shrimp farts how hard would it be to switch from 24 hours to 18-6 without messing up plant sex what why would what i'm not even gonna answer that somebody else handle that [ __ ] please thank you cheers oh i see a little fuzzy i need to make an emoji on my [ __ ] youtube that's the what emotion but what sometimes people ask me questions you guys think toy story 4 when the dinosaur is like hey woody i've got a question actually woody i've got all the questions buddy i have all of the questions when people ask me questions that confuse me that's what i feel like saying like what i've got questions about your questions like i've got all the questions about your question [ __ ] excuse me though i don't know how you guys like that gmo oh my goodness i can't do it i just can't cheers [Music] uh huh [Music] oh yeah y'all know what time it is it's time for that adult swim um that's right big i smoke fresh breast usually when i press it all of a separate like a little jar full it depends on if i have other [ __ ] to smoke on at the time but usually i like to give it a couple days because i like to to get the consistency where i want it it's more so about consistency than anything because once it comes out of the freeze dryer it's usually all the way dried already so i don't have to worry about moisture or anything like that it's more so just a preference laughs squiggly oh right single source what's up homie number one fan that's dope dog i appreciate you homie yeah just off the press yeah i smoke it absolutely yeah fresh press it really depends like like hemp said there can be some moisture in it if like it just depends right it depends on how much hash you're running through how it how the cycle went sometimes there can be still a slight amount of moisture in there that is good to let kind of go before you smoke it but you'll hear it when you dab it when it's fresh pressed if you go to dab it and you hear the crackling and popping then you know there's moisture in it and you need to go ahead and let that shake cure before you start dishing it out otherwise people are going to have cracking bangers and going to be like what the [ __ ] why is your [ __ ] popping so to really master like freshly pressed hash to be able to go straight from the plates to smoking it it has to be just completely dried you know it can't have all the excess moisture so people that try to decrease their dry times in the freeze dryer and speed up the process or they're just trying to quote unquote preserve terps and not dry them off too much you're not gonna over dry your terps on a standard 9 9 through 12 12. you could do up to a 12 12 um which is a 12 hour freeze 12 hour drive and you're not going to [ __ ] hurt your terps you know um it's the temperatures that you gotta worry about you know at 55 fahrenheit shelf temp you're not gonna hurt anything when you're at [ __ ] it you know when your [ __ ] resets and you're at 120 degrees because you didn't check your settings first you know always check your settings before you start every batch on the freeze dryer every time it doesn't matter if you unplugged it even if you didn't turn it off check the settings before you hit start every [ __ ] time i'm gonna say it one more time for the people in the back check your settings every single time before you hit start on your freeze drive every [ __ ] time not once not twice every time one more time every [ __ ] time why did i just say that 20 [ __ ] times because i guarantee you the fact that i just repeated it 20 times is gonna save one of you guys thousands of dollars in hash i [ __ ] guarantee it because there's been at least three to four times where i've went to go start the freeze dryer and i was like i got a feeling and i checked the settings and the settings were off why because it's a harvest wrong there doesn't have to be a reason it just happens all right if your [ __ ] shows up it works you should be lucky you know what i'm saying so look i know that was a little annoying but i guarantee you me saying that that many times just saved at least one of you guys thousands of dollars cash because i've had numerous people in my dms hey bro i keep getting no yield when i go to press my hash what's going on i'm getting no yield what's happening what's going on and the reason that they're getting no [ __ ] yield is because they're cooking the hash in the freeze dryer do you want to know what these home units reset to by default usually if their motherboard goes wonky they reset to 120 degrees on the shelf temperature do you know what a 120 degrees in a vacuum is going to do to your ash for 10 to 12 hours oh limonene mercy gone all of them just start naming turps start waving them off like a [ __ ] parade get your princess wave on bye-bye it happens at least once a week that i have to [ __ ] very very sadly informed somebody that they need to start checking their [ __ ] settings because they just cooked their hash and if they would have put a plate on top of it they made it they could have probably made rosin honestly at that temperature a little bit of pressure 12 hours you could have some rosin in there baby so it's like it see it happened to you no oil is left at all see and it's not the hash the hash was probably bomb as [ __ ] the hash was probably i saw your hash actually your hash i was surprised that your hash you were getting the yields that you were getting because i didn't think that you even washed that much and you were pulling a pretty big spoonful out of there and it looked really good but yeah so that hash that you were scooping out you put it in the freeze dryer and now it cooked and lost all your oils and then you probably want to press it and you probably only got like if you're lucky 20 of what you should have yielded it's so unfortunate so unfortunate oh my tits are [ __ ] freezing son cold in here oh rolling lamp oh man anyways let's go uh change his battery out i think you're about to die eight percent yeah yo like i'm not gonna say i was ranting i was monologuing yo i'm a [ __ ] pretend i'm a villain and i was just monologuing i almost let the battery die though i can't do that fantastic oh it's [ __ ] cold all right i got a couple things we got to do let's go take some measurements get in the warm room and then uh we'll come back and we'll uh press some hash and the press is up to temperature already so all i gotta do is [ __ ] uh sift it load it in the bags make the parchment you guys know it's going to be a little bit of a process but what the [ __ ] are you here for if not for the process all right you guys already saw the log i [Music] think [Music] special um [Music] all right so first things up is uh environment we're gonna go ahead and check the ambient temp relative humidity leaf surface temperature vapor pressure deficit and co2 and then we're gonna take some notes i am going to check multiple sources or check this one here we're going to check troll master of course and i calibrate as often as i need to when i find a discrepancy between the two of them when they're placed in the same spot right now you can see where my troll master is placed i'll keep it here kind of close to the planet too close but uh land bam thank you ma'am put it there kind of want it to be in your canopy you don't really care what it's like up here you want to know what it's like where the plants are at right [Music] all right now because we have that over there we're going to take this over there we're going gonna check the same thing make sure that's calibrated first and foremost then we're gonna go ahead and check around the room see if we have any major fluctuations and uh let's check what troll master says right now trollmaster is saying 82.3 at 58.3 and 14.69 82 is 58. [Music] so we're at 81.9 and 57. that's pretty [ __ ] close good enough for me so now we're gonna go around and verify what's going on in your neck of the woods tony 81.7 and 55. humidity's higher over here i need to put another humidifier in here it's not much higher 82 and 57 looking good come over [ __ ] here stuller hold you strong oh yeah oh yeah we're sitting pretty in here when everything is nice and even like that within a couple degrees oh [ __ ] yeah okay that's that we know our numbers are looking good there so um yeah let's start recording some of this [ __ ] i gotta write it down i need a pen i don't i don't think i have one out here hold on [Music] oh that garbage can stinks [Music] [Music] lapiz i don't want to [ __ ] use a marker i'll be back you [ __ ] you sit here and you look at my ugly garage that's what you do you know what here look at this gentry rig isn't that exciting this is for you guys right here this gentry rig is for you guys look gentry gentry glass it's for you guys no [ __ ] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Music] [Music] okay man i love my kids so much every time i go in the house i just i get caught up i want to just stay in there and play with them like [ __ ] you guys look at this pop let me finish this coffee i don't want to waste my coffee today i always waste it because i'm sitting here [ __ ] around talking to you guys and it gets cold and it's gross oh i'm sorry deep in bothering there you go no more beeping no more beeping no it makes me to me i'm a [ __ ] stoner bro i don't hear the beeping what turn this [ __ ] off what the [ __ ] man why is it on but if i hear the deep thing i'm like hmm there's hash in there let's go so when i pull the hash out i turn it off usually not before then all right oh it's more than a gentry giveaway it's a big giveaway all right let's go we're gonna get this [ __ ] done [Music] so um all right so we got a what's today today is monday september 14th all right so we're going to go ambient temp in here right now let's cool 83 to 84. right now on this i'm not just recording the actual value i'm recording what my set points are too right so i don't know if you can see it but there's a set value an actual value and that just allows me to see if my du and my ac and my humidifier are keeping up with what i'm telling them to do or if i need to um factor in some type of offset right so set actually so right now my set point is at 79 for my ac my actual value is 83 to 84. and then my next value is my rh my relative humidity right now my set value for that is at 55 and i'm at 54 so it's holding good there my leaf surface temperature i'm going to go ahead and collect that right now 80 81 82 79 81 81 81 81 81 81 81 81 a1 212 [Music] so we're looking good but i do want to lower my temperature just probably one degree because i would like my leaf surface temperature to be more about 78 79 instead of 80 81 so i'm probably gonna go ahead and make that adjustment but i'm gonna record it as is right now so leaf surface temp we are at uh 81 okay and then co2 well we'll measure vpd based off of those calculations and then we'll put co2 for co2 right now we're at uh we were at 14.50 when i walked in now we're at 15 12 but i've been breathing and [ __ ] but our set value i believe is that 1400 right now uh no 1450 actually so we're holding good right there so our co2 is staying good and um let's see so now we're going to go ahead and calculate dpd and i'll go ahead and show you guys more [Music] now if we were to drop our leap surface temperature down a little bit that's pretty good [Music] now if we were holding at 55 that's where we would be at right temperature down a little bit i'm going to aim for like 82 air temperature which should give us about about 78 79 leave surface temperature and then we'll keep the humidity at 55 and that'll keep us at 1.3 kpa which is pretty good not too high not too low okay now some people say you know they like to run higher humidity like 60. that's cool but you're only at a 1.1 kpa right there you're not putting a very high demand on the plant for uptake and so if you're starting to see deficiencies sometimes you might need to put a little bit more demand on the plant for uptake which is [ __ ] with the kpa right not necessarily the light intensity you're not trying to make it drink more you're just trying to make it be able to utilize what's there right so anyways that's the that's that but right now based off of the numbers that we had we were at 83. [Music] we're about 80 and 55 so we're at a 1.38 kpa so okay that's that and then um the next thing that we're going to monitor is the irrigation we're going to check the troll master which is our reservoir and our water content sensor we're going to check the tarots and we're going to check our runoff and see how the runoff is looking today since normally this would be like a weekly check but i'm actually trying to correct the ph right now and i'm chasing down this nutrient deficiency so i need to be monitoring the runoff almost daily right now so let's go through this ec ph water content and temperature easy peasy baby reservoir [ __ ] 3.5 and 5.3 okay so i need to get this printed out on excel sheets and i'll just do this all on my phone from now on but uh you see we are at uh 3.5 and that's on both blue lab and on troll master so we're good there okay so um 3.5 we're at 5.2 on the ph i can even add like a blue lab section in here because troll master is at 5.3 blue labs at 5.2 okay uh water content and temp so we're at 69 70 water content we're at 62 percent on troll master we'll get to the taros right now and run off blue lab doesn't have water content we're going to check this cube we're at 66 and 5.5 76. and ph tarot doesn't do and then we'll go ahead and we'll grab the runoff and runoff doesn't have a water content percentage um the next thing also is going to be the start time for the irrigation shot size and duration frequency and last feed so right now my start time is at 730 the shot size 45 seconds um roughly 60 milliliters frequency it's um 7 30 8 8 30 and then from there i believe we're doing every hour and a half two hours every two hours so then every two hours the last feed is at 8 30 p.m two hours before lights off [Music] and then we'll go check some runoff so here's an easy way for you guys to collect runoff take a cup preferably one that doesn't have a bunch of [ __ ] in it come down to the plant that you want to collect runoff from which is going to be this one going up only one the other one hasn't hit run off yet because we're not pushing that much volume anymore and i wanted to make sure that basically i'm not getting too much runoff every day so i lowered my feed volume but this one i i flushed last night so it was at full saturation so it's giving me runoff already like it should the rest of them i'm going to manually get up to full saturation so that everything here is fully saturated and starts off the same with the dry backs tomorrow but i gotta figure out what's going on first if my flush through worked on this one last night so we're gonna see what the runoff is so i'm not really sure maybe right there in a good place so the easiest way to do this the reason i cut the chrome tray in half is because no matter how big your plant gets you can just slide the [ __ ] clone tray right off the ladder without really having to do too much right so i just move this slide this tray out from underneath it [Music] cut this down now i've got all my [ __ ] runoff right here boom if this starts to get a bunch of salt build up clean it off because it'll affect your reading [Music] slides right back [Music] so the other one let's go see what's going on where we have here no but i can tell we're almost at saturation that's good [Music] all right so we're going to go ahead and take this now [Music] we're going to pull out here and these are all going to go in there [Music] sorry i'm doing this one-handed so bear with me [Music] well we're getting a good ph 6.1 i still would like to see that come down a little bit saying 4.6 6.1 [Music] i'm not sure why this errored out look at this one in there by itself [Music] here we go so five is saying we're just over five i almost filled that it's saying we're just over five but i'm going to use the troll master one because the troll master one goes over five and i have my blue lap pulse that goes to 15. sorry runoff is somewhere between 4.7 and 5. [Music] you may need to clean these i'm not liking that there's a discrepancy in the reading but it is what it is if i put them both in there together i mean this one doesn't read over five so either way we're [ __ ] on that one but ph wise they're both coming out at 6.1 so that tells me that flush through that i did last night money baby so i'm gonna go ahead and [Music] manually flush every single one of these with at least a thousand to 2000 mls correct that ph because these are growing like crazy already so that same trick i just used where i gathered the runoff if you start with an empty measuring cup and and your dripper lines at the beginning of the day and an empty runoff collection tray at the end of your day or before the irrigation starts the next morning which would even be more accurate you can collect what's in here see what the total volume is collect what's in your runoff from a plant then you know all right this plant got this much total fed throughout the day and then boom that's how much the runoff was and the runoff values were this boom [Music] so our runoff ec was about five 5ec the uh ph was 6.1 and the temp was like 70 something i forgot 70 something lol all right so i mean that's that's pretty good what we're putting in and then the runoff and remember the runoff is not like really really high that means there's not a lot of salt buildup going on there's just a little bit of salt buildup the intentional salt build-up that would you can see our poor water ec here is still pretty good it's at 5.5 and so that means we're maintaining a pretty good balance right now um i'll go ahead and measure the total volume um tomorrow or later you know because this is going still and uh i'll see what the volume um and then the last thing that's going to be is the plant health toxicities deficiencies cranes demonstrate so for those toxicities deficiencies alien og is looking good um deficiency appearing on newer growth the mendos they're having the same exact issue but it's just a little bit more exacerbated overall the growth is still really vigorous right now and is improving um don't pinch test this feels pretty solid i don't feel any pith autolysis at all [Music] yeah no hollow stems they feel nice and good thick the smell is already pretty [ __ ] ridiculous just on touching the stems wow no hollow stems here either new growth coming out good slightly uh slightly lacking the chlorophyll on the leaf tips just like you would expect that's not a deficiency or anything that's typically leaves come out and before they're able to start producing you know a lot of chlorophyll that the t the tips are bleached a little bit you'll see that on almost all new growth there's some more of that calmag deficiency over here [Music] so overall the plant's health is improving over previous days the deficiencies seem to be getting corrected by bringing the ph down however they still do seem to want more and i'm going to gladly give it to them and what i'm trying to determine now is if they want an overall ec boost or just a calcium magnesium supplement and i talked with athena ag yesterday and they agreed with me that i should just go ahead and bump up the ec so that's why we went from 2.5 to 3.5 we'll give them a day at that then we'll see what happens root health and tell me got roots busting out this [ __ ] air pruned you're not gonna see long ass roots in my craze [Music] can't wait to get my zeratol in [Music] and these are the small plants too [Music] good [Music] and i've been running hydrogen medical grade hydrogen peroxide at 5 ml per gallon and i'm still getting that algae so you guys can't tell me [ __ ] about hydrogen peroxide and how [ __ ] good it works i'm so tired of hearing about people hitting me up very tall it's just hydrogen peroxide no [ __ ] no it's not god damn it hydrogen peroxide does not work the same i've gone through three different [ __ ] bottles of brand new medical grade hydrogen peroxide for different things and it cut cut that [ __ ] out so they're tall from now on so let me record this [ __ ] um overall i'm not seeing any toxicities um deficiencies cow mag issue getting better with fixed ph [Music] seven or an eight out of ten you know looking around definitely seemed better i'll give him a 7. and uh stem strength we're getting a four out of five on stems purple getting better nothing hollow and um root health [ __ ] 100 all right i think that's all the information i need right now i'll make some informed decisions based on this and um i think it's time to request a sample i'll give those to seed right now i think it's time to request a sample from j.r peters um i guess we could watch the [ __ ] pc and [ __ ] chain on the moisture console so this says 66.5 and 5.6 this is about 61 so let's see where it goes after the feed this changes in real time so pretty good jump short little feed we're up 70 that means we should be hitting uh runoff on that one which i believe we are [Music] i don't think we're gonna be hitting run off i'm curious to uh go and measure that other one where the runoff's at but we'll see we'll let it we'll let this [ __ ] ride out all right we got our information let's go and [Music] we're gonna drop that temperature you do a couple things today now that we're done with that we got to knock out some other [ __ ] got me in i mean grow mode right now i really want to go in there and do some more [ __ ] no the battery's fine it's just the connection and the uh the garage so okay so yeah i'm really happy that we just got all that recorded now you guys see what i go through just if you could spend the time to do that you know um and and to be honest we skipped over a whole [ __ ] section we didn't we didn't gather any of the lighting information um but we'll go back in there and get that in a minute i'm pretty sure i know what that information is already i haven't changed it um but i know not everybody has all those tools just do the best you can with what you have if i could recommend a couple of tools that are not that expensive i would recommend the az7755 it's a it's a decent um measurement tool for your temperature humidity and co2 it's mobile walk around check different parts of your canopy and it may not log the information for you but you can at least stabilize some [ __ ] you want to see the light numbers i need to get some light numbers for quantum right now anyways let me um take care of a few things oh [ __ ] roddy it's time to take a dab and then we'll go in there and get some light measurements okay all right so i believe that homie quantum wanted to see 100 all the way with 70 on the intensity at 29 inches away denny what did you want to see 90 and 100 on all spectrums how far away now you guys can go ahead and get the cheaper version of this sensor i'm about to send you it may be the same exact thing just rebranded i personally don't know but i made sure that i got the one that said on it not the knockoffs that just said temp co2 humidity on it so this one cost a little bit more than the other ones the other ones you can get for like 150-ish this one's like 280. i don't know i was like 130 dollars more for the peace of mind knowing it's one that i know works from the legit company worth it cool no problem so so there's that one i highly recommend that um if you can get a tarot 12 with a pro check i i recommend it i will most likely be making them available um to people but we will see all right let's get this dabaroni in i knew quantum was about to ask for the link that lazy [ __ ] that's why i already had that [ __ ] copied ready to go here you go lazy [ __ ] lazy [ __ ] so 9 inches 90 intensity 100 oh cheers ah me dirty but this is more than a co2 meter it has temperature humidity and co2 and it's all in a mobile hand unit that's been calibrated and certified if you got a really small grow i'm with you 100 or do we know that [ __ ] the whole thing temperature humidity co2 everything everything however it's not really a good long-term solution for most people especially because the sensors that most people pair with arduinos are not really meant for a grow room environment especially with the higher humidities so it's just uh personally i i stayed away from the arduino just because i'm not in a you know a cabinet though or a tent grow and not knocking the smaller grows it's just it's a lot easier to implement a diy system on a smaller scale setting up ro water what do you mean setting up ro water use buy a filter hook it up to a you know a hose bib and run the line where you want it to go with the float valve and then turn on your filter voila all right i don't think content is in the house he might not be able to talk if he is all right hold on i gotta get my boy quantum in here real quick my boy quantum is in the hizzy and he needs to be able to talk all right my boy my boy talk to get the me chat going yes i already know bam done done all right should be able to talk now still all right let me go get these measurements almost ready for you so my lights are a 100 minus the intensity hold on wow i went on a hunt for my tape measure and it's [ __ ] right here behind the camera plants specifically this one is three feet away okay so i'll just leave the tape measure there i'll put the lights on whatever intensity you want me to put them on and then i'll just measure at whatever distance so let me go back to the chat real quick and see what's what's up first actually [Music] all right um what do you want me to do brother what are the what are the tests first what are we doing here nine nine inches 90 intensity 100 oh it reconnected good okay so here's the deal i can't do it i gotta go grab my tablet if i start [ __ ] with the the lights from my phone it disconnects the gopro because the phone has to use bluetooth to connect to the lights so it disconnects from the gopro which disconnects the wi-fi so that's why it almost lost connection right now let me go grab my um my tablet i [ __ ] i think it's inside it's not charged yet but i should be able to get it charged and in the meantime we'll [ __ ] with the hash sound good good well you know what hold on before all that let me tell you let me tell you what we're at real quick i can at least tell you right now that we're at 65 percent with 100 on all spectrums so let me give you those readings at least so at 65 percent and three feet away i'm at 400 cars that's right here on the edge of the tables right if i go more direct underneath the middle of that everything we're looking at a 425 430 now if i go up to two feet right in the middle of the light two feet i'm at 600 par 600 dpfd okay if i go out to the edge of the light at two feet i'm at a four seventy four eighty okay now if i go up to one foot away right in the middle of the light sitting at 650. now remember i'm at 65 intensity 65 okay so let's i'll do 18 inches away um 18 inches away we're hitting about 660 right here 640 660. um up here one foot away kind of further back not dead center but over here 550 this is right underneath this black spot right now if we start here's the weird thing about these 120 degree optics i don't know how far up you could see but the weird thing about them is when you get further up into that sweet spot like right here at about eight inches away i'm hitting about a thousand ppfd and i'm only at 65 percent so imagine if you were to boost these at nine inches away you're [ __ ] blasting those games baby and if they could take it then [ __ ] yeah make sure you up your ec make sure your dpv in check and [ __ ] blast off bro hopefully that helps right here two feet away you can see we're hovering like i said around 580 580 to 600 at two feet away it's just all about the overlap that you have in your garden though or your tent those things are gonna highly affect your ppfd as you move around sorry i couldn't give you more solid info on that right now so i can't [ __ ] with the intensity right now i can't because if i'm on my phone and i'd switch to messing with the lights then it disconnects the gopro so i'm at 65 right now and i just measured at three feet two feet and one foot so you know you're looking at about 400 you know to about 600 650 once i get off the live stream i'll take those more detailed measurements for you and give you kind of like a good good little par map to go off of um let me go grab some [ __ ] i'll be back so so i had to sneak my tablet out of the house so my kids didn't see it because they'll want that [ __ ] so quick all right cool we'll give this a little bit to charge i haven't used it i don't know how long and um first and foremost you know i really just gotta prep so i'm gonna set up the camera in an area where it's easy for you guys to see and i'm going to knock out some prep work so hmm that work let's see that might work two [Music] [Music] two so [Music] so [Music] so cheese [Music] so [Music] [Music] thinking maybe up there isn't the best spot for you guys i'm thinking maybe you guys should just get up here does this work for you guys up here [Music] i don't know except you guys tell me [Music] so [Music] [Music] school [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] hold on bear with me see like we have a couple little pieces right here that didn't sublimate properly [Music] it's rare occasion that that happens to me i usually don't even [ __ ] with it i just need it if it didn't process right it didn't process right you don't want to force it into the this you know look at the quality of this [Music] don't [ __ ] around and put that in there some people will save that some people give it to homies some people will smoke it [Music] i trash it call me crazy i trash all right [Music] ain't got time to [ __ ] around with that time is money [Music] thick there was some thick ass patties of ash in there [Music] involved [Music] [Music] so [Music] so master kush coming to a banger near you [Music] [Music] so do [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] so oh my bad i'd take care of some real [Music] quick [Music] to [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] you guys dabbing on while you're watching me do this because you guys are quiet you guys at work right now how many of you guys are at work watching me do this at work school are some of y'all probably just chilling at home huh all this [ __ ] going on [Music] so [Music] foreign [Music] rdwc airstones [Music] if i were to ever go to rdwc again i think i would use [Music] an electrolysis machine [Music] ah video sucks alone you're at work [ __ ] it but you've got it is my channel safe for work or is it not safe for work i don't know i've never thought about that [Music] okay [Music] okay make sure you pack those bags good because when you go to stuff it into the second bag i mean it's like pushing rope you guys it's like trying to put a condom on a half chub you know it works better if you got the full thing [Music] so [Music] hey i mean some of you guys will get that some of you will [Music] my channel would probably be safe for work if it wasn't for all my crew jokes [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] but that's not all folks [Music] for the edibles [Music] [Music] bam [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [ __ ] man this looks good [Music] it's almost a shame to not include this with the rest of the rosin i don't know how well you can see that really", "WY5ypYzYs1A": "[Music] what's good do to is your boy CBS won't doctor back with another review if under 21 years old you need to leave this video now all right this is for adults only and see me be smoke doctors 10 who is now spongebob firm Valley Farms now let's get right into it we have four products that we're gonna try out today guys and these products are we got to which is gum hash then we got two flowers things so these products are coming from a company organic CBD if you go back until my videos you will see that I have done videos for the company before I think it was the kool-aid and a few other strings I think it was pretty cool y'all go check it out and I also go check those guys out there on Instagram they also have a website I'll leave the link on the bottom of the video for you guys so one of the flowers were gonna try is the miranium haha yeah Morini and pie looks beautiful too so we got the miranium pod and we have the Mountain berry alright so those are the two strains fly what we gonna try out but we Billy here today guys good just company now offering hashish so this one is the Colorado cherry and young guys already know I mean definitely gonna give you our guys closer looks and all of these products this one here is the lifter yes the lifter okay so matter of fact let's just start right now with this one this Mountain berry let me get these out in a way it's we about to get into this thing so I'm gonna throw the flower move this over to I'm gonna put the flower on here I use this for the flower matter good look at that house seats because that thing is nice and dark I think so let's put the flower like this right here from xlr8 excel baby yeah these guys are really good over here that's a nice shot down here in Georgia and they some whole bunch of things over there alright that's another story so we're gonna open up this mountain berry it does smell like the great outdoors I tell you that so this is the mountain berry get it out so the only thing with this mountain berry is the trim gain could have been better but it's still not a bad looking flower by far me a couple of fan leaves on it no problem now let's get the remaining pack this one looks really good also bears now this one has a skunky smell which I like I really like that so as you can see these are definitely two different flowers hmm with two different phenotypes they look totally different this one is more red it has lots and lots of red pisser's all over it well this one has more of a steady green bright in strong green and it smells chunky too and this one smells just like the great outdoors like if you were walking through an oasis that's what that one smells like let me get another whiff for that yeah smells good so I'm definitely about to give you guys a nice close-up of that but before I do let's take a look this hash right so we're gonna open up the hash and this is the lifter hash okay so this is the lifter hash this thing is stuck to the top guys it really is let's give it over though so this is the gum yes guys it's very very sticky yeah see how when I squeeze it it turns brown looks black mmm smells real potent it smelled up it smells like a pineapple now later after you chew it up yeah that's what it smells like that's a pineapple not only after you chew it up let's get back to this I'm gonna give you a quick look at it Morini Empire looks pretty good doesn't it guys this one is the mountain berry now I'm gonna give you guys some close-ups but I just want to open up all the products because I'm excited I haven't had in a long time I mean since my THC day so now we got the CBD has think I might start doing my own concentrates segment now because uh and this one is the Colorado cherry hmm Colorado Henry smells great pink smoke great so let me see if your you know look at this what happens when I squeeze it see that gummi god I mean well normally what I would do with it gummy hash is break it up and sprinkle along you know whether it's a blunt a joint whatever however you guys want to do it a doobie however you want but what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put a little piece of hash on each one of these flowers all right so we're gonna get ultimate potency let me give you I got some information on the flop okay so we're gonna start with the rhenium pile okay that's this one here on the left this bright green this one has a great moisture level of 11.3% then you have your total CBB level thirteen point four two percent alright and this flower is on the zero point three percent THC matter of fact all of these products are let me just get that out of the way now okay and let's move over to the Mount in Barry okay the mountain Marion has a total CBD percentage of nine point four nine percent and the cannaboids my weight is ten point six percent just in case you guys wanted to know now I have the lifter here but I don't have to lift the flower so we're not going to get into the lifter and to be honest with you guys they do have the scannable co weighs on the back of these packages I just ripped them up so I really can't give you the full co A's on the hats I'm sorry about that guys being excited and tiny that's why we smoke so we're gonna get right on into it I'm gonna give you our guys some close-ups and you know let me know what y'all think about this flower and give you our some close-ups of this hash I you so now your guys got a good look at the flower which is not bad looking at all like I said it's just the Mount Barry could use a better trim game that's about it with that and like I said these both smell pretty decent I mean not the best but they smell pretty decent they look good as far as the hash like I said we're just gonna throw some of this on top of the flower and let's see how that goes if you guys would like don't just leave a comment below and I'll just do a separate video on a hash alone if you want to know more about it so I gave you all the information you guys need on this flowers away now let's do with the smoke on so let's get our lung dirty guys so right now I'm gonna crush up this which one is this Iranian power we're gonna crush summon add up Iranian Barry okay all right so now we got both of those flowers crushed up and ready to go so I see mm-hmm all right I'm gonna put some of this one in here okay we don't want to put that much we're gonna drop the Colorado cherry on top of that one that's this one here just gonna take a little piece and you can also take this hatch you can throw it on your wine however you want you can smoke the hash straight up if you want to and your pipe paper how do you want to do it guys then we're gonna pull out the okay and we're gonna go with the lifter hash with the hangs so this is my angst flatten it out and I'm

update I'm sorry I've been slacking on my weekly Guardian updates I've just been busy trimming my memo was done I probably got about 2 ounces left my last plant and I just also feel like it's a little bit unnecessary to have a update every week in your grow room there's not much to talk about I still have the same 3 plants in there as I did three weeks ago my flower tent I am about to transition a couple more plants from veg to flower probably tomorrow or something so you'll be able to see that the next week's update anyways today I decided to try and make some bubble hash that was my first attempt and yeah these are my results so this right here so I ran I had six different runs I did three runs of two different batches so you'll kind of see here there's a left and the right on each pad kind of thing on the left one I was the first plant right one it's a second plant so anyways this one I just kind of combine them both because I don't even know if you're supposed to smoke this this right here is the stuff like I had my two 20 micron bag these right here but from my 190 micron bag this one's for my 160 this one was from 120 just a lot as long as my 45 micron and this one was from my 25 so I'm just kind of breaking it up just making sure it dries well oh yeah that's it for this week I'll see you guys again next Thursday in the garden have a good one", "C7bm45frMwc": "what's up everyone this is your homie maoti and of course you're watching multiwatch people today we have another review this time hashtag by the way this is harsh what i done myself um hot bottle technique um that yeah quite interesting uh to share with you uh that this is blue dream a little piece of hash not a lot however um hey it's always as we go let's say that it's time to change our view and show you this little bad boy there you go a little piece of blue dream and as i say it's uh how she's done by the myself it's in the front kiev uh press within the hot bottle and later you don't work out and finger but they come i must say come quite nice look at that nice cakey this looks very nice [Music] um i'm really uh interesting how calm um very gooey nice this is good [ __ ] um i'm really interesting how let me take off little pieces um i'm really interested in the how and the flavor we go now uh because blue dream mostly of times of course it's in the you know um healthy and piney um most time of flavors it's done that i'm really interesting how these flavors be with this hash that people of course will use my sepsi pipe what is traditional malacanang pipe for a smoke your key for your your hush but i love this uh this pipe you you put a very small almond and really uh work well um there we go here we go our pipe is and the nice part and we will be trying this little by the way let me say that it's time to change always be again here you go change the view people you know how we do it um that of course that they say a little safety pipe and we've been out trying this as a bad boy um to really check how blue dream is different uh to be smoked as the flower and compare now with bloody maharash foreign piney and healthy however it's more condensed compared to flour almost woody and the flavor and this is not because i smoke my pipe that people look at beautiful arch nice color that good product of course i make myself using the my kiev what i have little and decide to do it the people yeah blue dream quite nice i think and they're nice and more concentrated and normal blue dream flowers that this is good as well that work very quick on you this is what they're like with harsh video and work quick and it's quite strong people say that thank you very much hopefully you enjoyed this video and the video from hours and the harsh seasons and people thank you very much and see you next time", "RSXLA9iB11A": "hey hey how are you doing great how are you guys here with jillian our hash team manager that's awesome um yeah so we were trying to sign in under the pure pr ig but um we're having a little difficulty so we just signed it on on my account okay cool well thank you guys for carving out some time and joining us today really appreciate it uh how's the audio on your end can you guys hear see everything okay yeah 100. okay awesome so i say this every time i'll probably say this about four or five times throughout the broadcast but thanks everyone who's tuning in uh shout out to rackhams and foxtrax we usually have a lot of great hashmakers if you can't tune in to the full thing we'll have it up on youtube and instagram uh shortly after so today i'm gonna introduce ghee and jillian with papa and barkley and papa's select uh two of our favorite brands out in california i'd love it if you guys could give a little intro on yourselves and then you know we can hop right into some questions yeah absolutely uh co-founder of papa and barkley and of course we have our hash brand papa select um yeah so jillian crawl i actually met um game prenilus and mj biz cons a few years back and we stayed in touch and when they started the solventless line i had been making bubble hash for several years and so joined the team we started a god over two years ago now time sloane so awesome so when did papa's select get started because that was actually after papa and barkley like a couple years right yeah so i think it was the last actual official rigging on the river which is a festival that we have here in um um you know reggae on the river is on the eel river here uh in southern humboldt and it's a pretty big festival um before adult use it was definitely like a traditional market gathering place and we met brady of select solvent was there and you know it was luckily we had some money we're like let's just get into this and it was kind of something separate for our core brand we started really you know washing in cans we really didn't have a lot of space and then uh actually when julian joined the team she started really like professionalizing it and that's when we built our we were building our facility here at 2nd street which has a big walk-in cooled area so that they can really wash in the right temperature controlled environment um so that was about two and a half years ago i would say uh and it started as just a small project but then as we started to buy more fresh frozen which you know and really start to build a supply chain just as a company we saw the value in being able to partner with farms we wanted to like partner with farms in a way that our core products really didn't let us but when you're making hash you get to honor the farm like we love that concept of like being able to call out our farms in a way that we can't do in our core products so being able to partner with them go and get the smalls for the fresh frozen get trim at the other end for our core products really started to build that relationship as well that that's awesome and sorry jillian do you have anything to attack on there no but that uh yeah crediting our farms has definitely been the biggest thing we've done since day one because without them you know none of this matters and it is really interesting to see how different strains perform under different appellations in different terroirs and it you know will never really be the same and i do love just seeing those varieties from growing patterns to different nutrients and different strains so it all comes back to them and we couldn't make the hash we do without the amazing farms we have and you know we just really released to public for sale at emerald cup 2018. we've made you know big waves in just the last 18 months so it's been exciting yeah so you know i i'm more familiar with gee we did a mj biz panel which i was happy to be on and he was really hyping up solventless uh it was a really cool experience so we've had some experience together but jillian you know could you give everyone a little bit more info about your background and kind of what got you into cannabis and hashmaking i mean it's awesome to see you know female hashmakers it's such a male dominated industry so it's pretty refreshing to have some some high tier women on the show uh talking to us about hash because it's just all dudes right now so tell us about yourself and what got you into hash oh well you know like almost everybody in here i started on the traditional market you know god probably longer ago than i care to admit probably close to 20 years ago and had been working in mendocino with a really great farmer who got me into the industry and really taught me a lot and then the first time we made bubble hash was probably 2005. long time everybody else it was you know what we do with all of this trend and it started out very basic you know in the redwoods under a tarp using up our trim because at that point it was all waste and what we were able to make with just that was pretty amazing but it was you know block ice chipping it by hand working with a paint mix harvesting and jumping over and pulling bags and you know it's just insane what it's turned into and i worked on that for several years and then kind of let it go by the wayside for a bit experimented with a bunch of different products but i always came back to solventless it's just to me the truest purest form and i do enjoy smoking it so much [Laughter] you know i really think there's no better expression of the plant than just beautiful solventless extracts and so yeah i you know made the full circle and tried a lot of different processes and just came back to this one and it you know really been passionate about it worked my way from traditional market through the medical market and now to the rec market and you know what we've seen in the last 20 years is pretty incredible and yeah i'm really happy to be part of a great team and you know we're doing amazing things so it's pretty exciting that's that's awesome to hear your journey it sounds like one that's pretty similar for a lot of the people that we talked to who started making bubble hash so long ago uh and gee you know i'd love it before we hop into some more questions if you could give everyone a little background on yourself too because i know you've been at it a long time yeah yeah you know similarly to jill i started here in california in the traditional market uh first cultivating um of course as jillian put it when you cultivate you tend to have this byproduct uh in the form of trim or in the free you know bag appeal was a big thing so you have these but people you know they're not big juicy nugs they're not have all this product um i started not with bubble hash but with bho and right down the street from you i i bought one of the first ets units right down the street from ets um at a lab in colorado where i was able to blast of course you know to be told i was already blasting here in the traditional ways that we used to do those things um and so yeah so i you know just really started getting into extracts through bho had a vape pen company in colorado um that's where my you know this whole continuous we're talking now in the world of social justice and all the things that are happening i realized in 2012 2013 that you got to be careful who gives you money right because you are beholden to them and unfortunately uh you know coffee can money does not work when you're trying to establish a legit business right you need lines of credit you need grid money as they say in a bank account but you know the folks that lend you that money they need to be right-minded so the folks i partnered with in colorado were not as green in their hearts as i would like so uh luckily partnered with adam here in in california and he had developed the bomb for his dad that was a you know a really solid product that worked um we like to say that you know papa barkley owns the first cannabis conversation because you know you can give a newbie a topical and you know it's just non-threatening and now at least they understand thc they understand cbd putting it on their skin they're getting efficacy maybe they move to a tincture maybe they move to capsules maybe they move to edibles and so that's what we call the cannabis funnel we've seen it here in california where our retailers are like you guys draw people in and they just walk down the funnel usually ending up in like a vape pen or something convenient especially for the older folks but with select we we like to think that papa select owns the last kind of cannabis conversation by the time you're fully sure and you understand what a trichome is and you understand where the medicine is and how that can be captured especially in a good you know six star hash where you just see literally balls of trichomes if you educate enough to know that then you're having that last conversation you know um so that's been my journey basically you know just you know there was a point i i always i did advocate for a while with montel back in the early 90s right after proposition 215 here and was doing the advocacy work but i was also growing and you know anybody that grows you know those two lights become four lights become eight lights and back then every harvest paid for itself and you just kept growing and growing and at one point i i took 10 years where i was like well i can't really advocate and grow all this week like i can't be local and still be you know for me it was like look you can advocate or you can provide safe access right and i've always been a big proponent of safe access like cannabis like should not be something that you go to shady areas or get under like on street corners that's just not it's just not right that's not right for all narcotics by the way specifically i was passionate about bringing safe access obviously with patients first you know and even now as we are in adult use there is this thing with patients being left behind so even plugging a product we just finally got into the edibles category in the gummy category and we decided to be true to ourselves and say we're gonna put out a wellness gummy like not all this sugar not all this craziness but a zero calorie you know zero everything zero sugar gluten free keto friendly all those bugs anyone can have it right 5 milligrams sick whatever and it can taste good too is it as good as our friends as some of the other ones maybe not but it's for what it is it's still on point but my point is uh it's been a long journey for myself uh and anyway well no that's awesome uh and i love when you know the people that we have on the show go on these great tangents i really love your explanation about you know the funnel of how people you know experience cannabis and cannabinoids through all the different ways they can do that that was a beautiful explanation and one that we'll definitely want to highlight down the road for everyone who's tuning in thank you for joining us uh if you've got some questions you want to ask them feel free to put it in the question box below i'll be sprinkling in you know viewers questions uh jillian and gee these are some real real experts here so don't be afraid to ask questions uh i'm sure they can drop some big big knowledge like they already have so i kind of want to go back a little bit to what you had said jillian about growers and the relationship with growers and the material you know when we had soil grown phil he was on the he was on the show last week that was one of the big things he said is like love your growers make great relationship with your growers that's what it boils down to for the material what are your guys's philosophies on growing material uh and you know just that whole topic of sourcing great material how do you guys think about that well it is step one and you know you'll never have the highest quality product if you don't have the highest quality and we are lucky to be in the heart of humboldt and not only that the heart triangle and it is the best animus in the world hands down and you know if you take all of that but you have these farms and these families and they've been you know cultivating and learning these secrets and learning their land and how to best produce it through generations it's about trying to keep that history intact and trying to keep all of that knowledge here and not to just be run out by some of the big farms that amazing things but you know it is just that that history and trying to keep it up and going and so many of these farms are smaller farms and their family farms and trying to get through into this white market times where they're trying to get licensed and they have to go through just crazy hoops and the regulations and the costs and the permitting and the licensing and it's a very expensive very long undertaking and we're really happy to be able to help so many of these guys and make it through this transition because it's you know we've seen people just struggle through it and so not only that you know i think we're keeping the heritage of humboldt alive and through the emerald triangle and so that's always the first step and you do find that where you know what you can produce on one hillside is completely different than somebody in the valley below you i love taking those and just learning the differences and we have a lot of farms that have you know produced the same strain across multiple farms and it is about finding the one that reacts best to that strange genetics we test wash in so many strains and i would bet less than five percent of what we test makes it out to market because wow it is about finding just the best of the best the cream of the crop and we're lucky enough to have the best input and the best farmers to choose from that is why we're able to produce the highest quality but it is just those standards yeah we look more broadly you know i think in all extractors we'll say that input product is king regardless of how you're extracting but for us there's a an underlying philosophy in the approaching select we cannot like so we have a blessing and a burden in being thought leaders and growing this industry right we're lucky to be here at this point in time to grow this industry and it's on us to make sure that cannabis doesn't make the same mistakes that other markets have made it would be farms to aggregate and get bigger and bigger start mono cropping and then we start to look more like tobacco more like all these other places where there's only one kind of canvas that cannot happen variety is only inspired when you have small farms all over the place trying to figure out how best to get their appalachian their particular land to produce strains also in in canvas we have this legacy of what we call pollen chucking but like every year there's new strains there's new phenos coming out julian didn't have to hunt it's not just it's the pheno like if the like not everything well with ice water right so forcing now the pharmaceutical iterate right so last year thc bomb might have been it what do you think it's gonna be this year the hotness that's what everyone wants to know strains and genetics are going to be a hot topic for everyone tuning in so any insight you have there people people really want to learn from the experts so think about it and i've finished this point that it's super important like look we are lucky in our core business it's you know we raised some money and it's kind of like a traditional cpg we have these core wellness products that we put out but having select i always felt like select gave us our cannabis street cred because it shows that yeah we could go to like some big farm and just get the cheapest trim possible infuse our topicals and our tinctures but that puts the industry on the slippery slope where those are the people we're empowering we have to empower what we want to see for ourselves i want small farmers passionate farmers to grow magical plants you know i i met with i won't say the name but there's a premo company out there and the gentleman is telling me that oh well we'll just buy the farm and you know we'll just grow it ourselves it's like have you ever go can you say ah how hard is it and i'm like turns out it's like cooking food it's like yeah i guess it's easy but it's also extremely hard at the same time and you don't get that passion to create new strains to perfect new strains to work with your extractor unless your heart's in it and that doesn't happen from some mega farm right we have made that mistake in other agricultural products and we can't make that here you know and so being able to support these small farms even if it's a you know a lower margin product uh even if it's a niche product it doesn't matter whatever we can do to make these farms not have to sell out to another farmer and aggregate into these big gigantic farms the better off we'll all be in the future right because we might the newbies might start at the top of the funnel like we were talking about but we all end at quality right everybody wants fresh squeezed orange juice at the end of the day yeah no that's yeah no please go ahead there will always be a bug but there will always be craft beer and you know we just choose to be that craft beer that's where our passion is that's what our love is and yeah we don't want to lose all of these decades and generations of hard work and it does come down to that you know i don't think a lot of people realize how long it takes for us to find some of these strains and phenos and things that we were hunting last year are only finally coming to fruition this year so we may find a brain that has the proper genetics and it has the terpene profiles that we're looking for and so we made phenol hunted but it'll take you know from testing it and it'll take a full year to get it back into actual production so we are in it for the long game and it does take you know what we're seeing coming out this year is work that was put in place over 12 months ago and so you do have to just have the patience and there will be limited releases something you know people are working with so many farmers and life is life sometimes things go wrong we will be having limited releases of amazing strains that were lost for one reason or another or the trust but they didn't work for the farmer you know they meet their criteria it has to meet their yields their growing patterns as well as what we are looking for and so keep your eyes out because there's you know we've got a great one coming in just two weeks it'll be amazing and unfortunately it'll be the last of that that um but it's you know it is just the long game and that's what we're really in it for and it takes you know a lot of time and a lot of work to get to where we're at yeah we're only now turning the corner where you know we can shout out some of our farms humble kind emerald queen farms that we've been working for with for a while and you know kind of like locking in certain key strains you know again going back to the business case you know a lot of our investors that come from traditional cbg they're like but you have an inconsistent supply chain i'm like yeah that's why it's farm to table and our the you know the scarcity uh is one of education it's like yeah we may only put out a thousand units of something and then we drop it on ig or blast it out to people and guess what folks who want it show up right and additional businesses they're like no you got to keep the stones shocked and you got to make sure you have a tight supply chain yeah that's how other people do it but you know what when folks are motivated for quality they will figure out how to get it and yeah certain things are scarce and there's nothing wrong with that you know there's a huge impetus in business and i get a lot of pressure to scale right and we've talked about how passionate we are to scale solventless but i'd like to scale solventless we'd like to scale solvent list in the right way not in a way that cuts corners or marginalizes the concept you know every like look i guess the most american thing is making money right so we all want to do that however we want to try we're going to raise the bar and try to do it the right way like not by just trying to like mono crop or find some strains and like buy a farm and be like just grow that like we never said to a farm just grow the garlic cookies because it's doing well one well garlic cookies was last year or the year before this year i don't know right and so uh that that that part it does not jive with traditional business practices it's hard to standardize right we have to be out there hunting for phenos working with these farms over a couple years sure you get a few strains that you can encourage them to grow again or you know they get a sense of like you know the size of the trichomes or what you're looking for or what well you know in that dialogue definitely helps but at the end of the day it's not a ooh scale and forget process you know yeah no that that makes a ton of sense uh and i know you guys have taken home some awards at emerald cup for your solvent list uh when we put this post up on our instagram letting everyone know uh busy something he was he's either in here now or was was saying that you know he's smoking you guys over 710 nowadays you know you guys have got a lot of love uh on the post we put out so clearly the quality is there uh i think people are really stoked on the brand and you know you guys haven't been around super long i think you're building a huge name for yourself we had a question come through that i really wanted to ask you guys which was can you guys tell us what your favorite hash rosin consistencies are and why and if you see any different test results between jams and cold cures and some of the various ways that it can go so kind of taking the conversation from the strain selection and the philosophies there to you know some more topics on the end products you know how do you guys feel about hash consistencies and textures and solvent lists well you know i honestly i'm just really passionate about hash and that is to me just the epitome of perfection when you find just those beautiful sandy trichome heads but then as far as when we're getting into working with sauces and batters and rosins a lot of that comes down to the actual strain itself you know we're pressing out some dozy zos5 from sunrise mountain farms today that is just beyond beautiful and it would make nice spectacular rosin but i know from working with it last year that when you sauce it you just get these big beautiful sugary crystals in it and some of it is how that responds you know the banana og the rosin is a lot less stable than some of our other strains so i tend to always batter it because it's about keeping it consistent from our lab all the way out to the consumer and the best way to do that too is just to learn the strains and the oils and terpenes that that particular one has and then you know maximizing its potential really so i don't based on what i prefer you know you kind of try different things and experiment and yeah some of it is not a guessing game in the beginning but you know you're still experimenting and learning and as we've gotten through these regular strains we now know what this one reacts best too and how that one you know ends up when i batter it out i have this massive terp layer on it and it's beautiful or if i sauce the dosi's os5 it has huge crystals and i don't think i could ever pick a favorite you know for traveling batter and sauce is amazing because it's super stable right but it that comes down to two not doing major cropping and growing you know varieties of spice to life and i never want to be held to just one consistency but also with echo that you know i think that's where the hashmaker's skill comes in is in knowing how to get you the right product from the strain sure if we all just stay in the cold room right next to the freeze dryer we could all just smoke six star hash all day long a lot of that stuff wants to butter up like you know as soon as it gets to a certain temperature it wants to change consistency so it's on the hash maker to understand like what's the best product you know to make out of this you know hash you know so it all comes out of the freeze drive what should we do with it what's the best way to deliver it to our customers so they get the most value out of it um you know again as we start to get more educated on this even the folks on the call it's like i view humboldt where you might come visit us we have a dispensary that we're opening perhaps you come visit us and then there are some of your favorite strains that you've only gotten you know in roz and or only gotten in batter and you might come and see the crystals because we're right here in the lab and you know they're still frozen and like you can see them you know it's like you know those of us who are super nerdy about it have our turnt lockers with our cool pad in it yeah why have some stuff that joe's giving me that just stays in my fridge and my wife's like what is that i'm like just leave it and i bring that right up to it you know and that's not true actually no look props to puffco pete but when it comes to six star hash the rig has to come out you know something you know yeah it's a ritual right that's what phil said last week he gave us a really good explanation about you know whether he he prefers hash rosin most of time but that the six star not only is it rare but it's also a ceremony to get it right to heat it up to you know get that little tiny it's all you know the wafer or whatever you want to characterize it that that's so that's that's interesting to hear a ritual just like we're passionate about tourism here in the emerald triangle the rituals of cannabis like you know i i feel like it's a thing that i've been joking about since college like long etiquette weed etiquette um and now that we do have adult use it's like those things are happening like you know if you think about scotch or wine there's always special glasses special decanting special ways of doing it and we just that nomenclature and those things in our industry right and eventually as lounges start to open up yeah having a proper rig having your you know six stars served to you while it's still cold before it butters up you know getting your temperature right all those things are you know in our immediate future yeah that that's awesome and one of the words that you specifically used very early in our conversation jillian you know the torah uh probably not even pronouncing that completely correct either but uh of the land and the specific hillsides and all these things you know those are terms that i think wine makers have traditionally used for a lot of their products and now i'm starting to see a lot of that terminology come into the hash world and the growing world so do you guys think that you know micro dabs and swanky lounges are going to be the primo cannabis experiences of the future 100 100 look i think that now is we're getting more educated and like cannabis is as nuanced if not more nuanced than than wine we just haven't had the same time i'm not a wine person i haven't gotten educated on it and i know that i'm not educated i do have friends that go to wineries they're super educated they understand the different kinds of grapes the size of grapes they understand the rain like whether it rained how juicy the great all these like cannabis is the same as julian explained like from one valley to the next you know in in our law n64 is an appellation from humble we hold possible that humboldt may only grow certain kinds of phenos and strains because of the land and the environment that we're in the concept of ocean grown here you know where we are uh in eureka closer to the water versus inland in willow creek versus down south of mendo we see subtle changes so what does that mean when we start to get other appellations from other good cannabis places whether it's overseas what was going on in colorado the stuff that's being grown now that uh you know there's some outdoor growth some sun grown going there i should say we're also big fans of sun grown i spent a lot of time indoors but that was because helicopters and bad folks looking for us right right this is the power of the sun i strongly encourage all growers to stop using ac stop using electricity you know if you want a good greenhouse with light depth that's great you want a greenhouse with some light supplementation and some environmental controls that's great but in our world now the carbon footprint to grow indoors is just not needed anymore and harnessing the power of the sun is awesome i also firmly believe it grows bigger trichomes which means better hash yeah everything everything we release here is all sun grown and i did grow indoor for a long time and you know they they each have their positive marks but i found you know indoor depending on where you're at is oftentimes your only choice but you have just the perfect environment and you're in that perfect land like we are here nothing will ever compare to well-grown sun-grown cannabis there's just something that cannot be replicated indoors so just so i'm getting my definitions here right because i'm a big stickler for nomenclature and terms in the cannabis industry which are it's the wild west right now people are calling this that the other thing when you say sun grown do you also mean in greenhouses you don't just mean strictly outdoor correct you mean no supplemental lighting i mean i guess if you could define your guy's definition of sun grown that would be awesome me sun grown you know i mean they're definitely you know light depths and stuff that we use where we have additional lighting and that's just to one open up the time period that farmers can grow in and to help them you know maximize their profit but to me sun grown is just something that where they get you know the greatest portion of their light from the sun and what that's altering the time of day a little bit that's completely different than indoor where the plant is never stressed conditions are always perfect and pretty but i feel like the you know when you get into the tripods i don't want to say it's hollow but um you know life builds character and character builds flavor that's right that's a great line it's a good point stress is a big part of the canvas plan if you you know again understanding the trichome and understanding its real purpose as a protective mechanism for us we love it the plant just wants protection and so you do get more out of stress i mean most indoor growers towards the end start to crank up their dehumidifier start to lower their water because they want to stress the plant into pushing out more oil that happens naturally with all the different things that happen in the environment when you're doing outdoors i do agree with jill that you know as long as most of the light is coming from the sun if you have some supplemental light during the winter to like extend your you know your your veg period or your whatever um or if you're doing hoop houses in the you know height of the summer you know to get the depth going that's all good to me but i i would i do have a question for jill have you noticed any difference between the full term and the light depth that comes down during like the off season um i have definitely you know i mean nothing will ever be that full term you know october harvest and you know what we get off of our winter runs is you know maybe not quite as potent maybe it doesn't yield quite as much i won't say quite as potent it's generally more in our yields and so it's just altering that you know but it's the same for the farmers they generally don't yield quite as heavy either and then you get a little less yield as far as our hash and rosin processing but it's you know it's still incredible quality material which i would definitely say is a little a little less in the winter yeah okay that that that's a great explanation about you know what sun grown is you know on your guys into things i'm hoping someday that all of this will be you know put in a book somewhere that we can all reference the same thing solvent list or solvent free i think we're starting to get there for everyone who's tuning in my regular announcement we'll have the full conversation up on instagram today and youtube next week we've got ghee and jillian from papa and barkley and papa's select here with us if you've got a question use the question box at the bottom so that we can put it up on the screen a lot of good conversation going on in the comments got a lot of hashmakers and growers here talking with each other it's really cool to bring people into the conversation who are even talking amongst themselves so i'm going to jump in we've had a couple good ones come through thanks for joining us there we've also got solventless mind who makes incredible hash and edibles uh shout out to a lot of hatchmakers here that are on the show too any tips for home hobbyist washing without access to a cold room you know we like to talk about big business and all the tools and tricks to make the best but what about people at home what could you offer for them look i i i like the analogy you know beer you know where people don't have a cooler to put their car boy in and you need whenever you need environmental controls you just got to get creative it's just that simple so like for instance uh back in the day we would wash only in the morning right um this is before papa's like and even before jillian had her proper room you know we had the ac put down all the way and like you know it was cohabitating with our bombs so you can imagine folks are pouring tincture on one side of the lab right and are freezing and then on the other side you have all the hash kids with their coats on it's not it's not cold enough you don't have access to a cold room you have to get creative maybe you have to wash in your garage at night maybe you have to do it in the morning maybe you can only wash the winter seasons right but the fact is yeah you're right at night pre-chilling your water goes a long ways maybe lots of ice on hand because we've done that through the summer months and the first thing and it's just about you know it might not be ideal for it but if you can keep your water cold keep your sprayer cold make sure you get it frozen right away all of those things can be worked around and so yeah you're just going to go through a lot more ice and water to keep that chilled and then of course make sure you have the best water you can get because that is cleaning it with so we always use ro water and our i know that's not always available but if you can just try to find the best filtered or the cleanest sources that you have and it's about keeping your water as cold as possible and freezing everything you know getting it as soon as it's collected get it into a freezer yeah that'll go a long ways for it okay no that that's great and that actually reminds me of something that nicotine said on a previous episode was that like cleanliness of your lab is is such a big thing so obviously the cleanliness of your water is critical cold temperatures um that that's a big one so for people who are watching at home a little tidbit is try not to use distilled water because if there's any issues in your water like residual pesticides if your water treatment locally isn't very good it will distill and concentrate those so our water really really helps we've preached that all day so i'm glad you guys brought that up for sure yeah it is and it is about being clean like nicotine said you know clean everything top to bottom every morning and every night and we're actually inspected once and they came through and looked at the equipment and the inspector asked well you know this brand new equipment you just unboxed it you know it's been in use for six months so where's your cleaning log in our sop well it doesn't count if you don't have it on paper but you know we keep you know immaculately clean and so that you know you look at it and you do think it's a piece of brand it would go that meant for sure any contaminant any particle of dust anything we've been killing the maintenance team with ventilation and all of our filters and everything but it is you know it does come down to it to keep that quality as high as possible yeah i mean we're dealing with micron size particles right and the last thing we want is for somebody to spend you know 90 to 100 bucks on a gram of our hash and have like you know anything in there i mean like with products it's like creative hair and we're afraid of like you know any little particles but with our ass we're literally afraid of like a speck of dust right the smallest speck of dust in your golden rose and you're like what is that right and so yeah from whether it's the brew this is or the peer pressure presses like everything cleaned regularly because every time you go to press you you can you know like if the plates have any it can be no contaminants basically on any of the equipment because it might show up in the rosin and you're trying to have especially for our products a lot of times like clarity is important like consistency is important and like want to be to know that nothing else is in there you know yeah and anyone who is familiar with having macro photography done of their product will have the most golden melt and they'll look at it under microscopy like is that an amber head what is you know what what am i looking at uh we had eric nug shots out here about a week ago doing a bunch of macro photography and we're just starting to get some of that back and i mean it's crazy at that level like how small particles can be that can change the quality of your hash very quickly so that that's an interesting comment i'm going to throw another one at here at you guys here we got foxtrax with us he was on a previous episode great guy great cbd hashmaker um what are some favorite strains you guys got going on to consumer process or both um we've got some really good ones coming out this year and a couple more that we'll be testing in the next couple weeks um right now i've really been loving on some tropicana cookies we got from down south and it's just got this incredible profile and it is hands down the best pain relieving can ever have so is it washing purple for you guys we've definitely seen the modern classic get all kinds of anthocyanins in there she's still been super blonde so cool partners that are really excited to work with and that comes down to two where you know got two different amazing farmers and they're both growing this but they also have another handful of amazing strains so it is about working through that finding out which strain comes best from which farm or if they're different you know running them both so but yeah the tropicana cookies has been a really nice enjoyable um change for me the last couple weeks yeah and for me i haven't had a chance to uh process recently with the team so i can't really speak to that i have been making some products that i want to talk about because we do intend on uh expanding our select line uh yeah but consuming i like going from you know extremes like i love going from like a gassy like garlic cookies to like a super sweet pink lemonade like dad for dab because it's just constantly blowing my mind oh yes exactly garlic cookies and pink lemonade we only have been putting out our first press the very best of the best right and then i think we did a run where we did some second press which was a little bit more affordable and same quality definitely from a trip perspective i mean he told me clarity is awesome and that's what you pay for and if you're a true canister you should go after it but the second press is often just as terpy just as heady you know just won't the clarity just won't be there right um so i like to go between the two extremes um and then yeah in terms of expanding the line the thing i've been working on with jill is uh i have this vision that one day a treehead can go in and get our awesome concentrate have a tincture that tastes the same and also from that farm to that the flower of that strain that of course smells and tastes the same and then a an edible product like a gummy or hard candy it also smells and tastes the same and like i'm not talking about looking at the coa and seeing the terpenes i'm talking about smell and taste we've got the tincture where you can smell the concentrate and you smell the tincture and you're like oh it's the same you taste the tincture and you do the dab and you're like clearly green right that's that's what we're that that that aspirationally uh you know it'll take us you know probably throughout the end of the year to get these products out but hopefully there's a day where you walk into your local dispensary and you're you know psyched on the you know uh tropicana cookies and you're like oh let me get that oh and you have the tincture of it oh i might as well get an eighth of the flower you know and then if i have this edible product as well you get all four products from select all with your favorite stream and not just i'm not i just don't want to tell you that it's your favorite strain i need you to be able to smell and taste that it's your favorite strain and that starts to lead into our next thing where just like the wine folks you know people have to develop a wine palette i don't know france from a thousand dollar bottle of wine right but in cannabis i will be able to know the difference and so i want folks to start to understand like whether it's an edible whether it's a tincture what is the taste of cannabis right i don't want a strawberry gummy i want a pink lemonade gummy i want to taste my screen and appreciate the flavors and nuances the cannabis has to offer not just in a smoking or vapory vaporizing form but in a tincture form definitely in a flower form and maybe in some animal that is an experience i would love to have with your products uh we had solventless mind made a good comment here just you know momentarily ago about you know the difficulties of going from a tincture to a gummy and the d card process and how that you know obviously the some of the volatile terpenes disappear uh not asking for your secret sauce but you know do you think that there's some pretty big challenges of getting to the edible portion of that end of the equation does that neces necessitate some reintroduction i mean he's right on the money with the the challenges in the d card process with edibles yeah yeah so first of all shout out to someone i had a chance i uh tiana shared with me some of the cube gummies they make and just hate straight up like i love it right it's like but like those things taste like cannabis that's the way it should be that's what we're going for it is difficult to capture and harness the terpenes and have them express themselves in a candy product the gummies are harder i will throw out there that uh hard sugar candy was a little bit easier um so like the hash product it's not every strain not everything is going to express itself uh in an edible like a fruitier strain like tangies pink lemonades those fruitier ones definitely you'll get a hint of them um in the gummy it's much harder in the tincture not as hard right um to get the taste of the different strains to come through so yeah it's difficult uh i have some ideas of how i'm de-carving it and how i'm retaining terpenes i can tell you one thing that we won't do and it's not that i'm opposed it's just not our style i'm not breaking the plan apart and returning so i'm not going to fit and attempt to capture the philippines in a cold trap and reintroduce them that would not be my what i the way we typically like to do things is truly keep everything whole plant the whole source less refinement so if i can create these products with the least amount of refining the better off i'll be so yeah but i have to apply heat to decarboxylate i of course run the risk of burning off those vocs those while organic terpenes that's that's the trick right of course i know i could heat them up off gas the terpenes capture them in a coal trap reintroduce them but i think we can do better gotcha no that that that's a great explanation and you know what we are hoping to do and kovid put the brakes on everything for us in this filming category and why we're doing so many of these ig lives is we have our solvent list review series where we sit down with hashmakers and producers about their products and you know consume and enjoy the product we're trying to get out to california when it's safe and we would love to hit you guys up and have you guys on an episode for that where we film and you know talk about your products in person so keep an eye out for that hopefully this winds down a little bit so that we can make a move there i'm gonna go ahead and talk uh through at least one more question that we got from the audience then we can go through some other ones uh someone you just shouted out nasty nate any new cultivars this upcoming fall from our family of farms i know that you probably don't want to drop everything too early but is there anything you can talk about on this one um we have just a laundry list of new strains coming and it has been nice to get ourselves really well established last year and we have everything from some crazy gmo crosses to some gap crosses we've got you know a dozen new farms that we're working with we've got a lot of great crosses coming we're getting into you know fatso and sunday driver some of those that have been around a little bit but just trying that those prime cuts but definitely a lot of good things in the work i always hate to name them out until you know how they're going to do because again so few of ours actually hit our quality mark and you get people excited about something that's never going to actually come to fruition but we do have a lot of you know uh we've got some grapes and creams some some other really exciting things coming so as soon as as soon as we get through another stage or two of testing we'll start dropping those names but yeah that that is what is gak if i'm not familiar with gak uh what what is that strain uh we've actually got a lot of bad crosses and i am blanking on its lineage right now because my brain is just fried with but there's some really good cat crosses we've got coming too so hopefully by the end of this year nobody will be asking what is gak okay yeah including me uh people in the comments talking about third gen farms as the breeders for that one so that's awesome excited to learn some more i'm always trying to keep up on my strain knowledge and see what else is out there so you know please go ahead that you know that we should maybe mention here is like you know you talk about nomenclature that's one of my favorite words for the canvas because no we don't have a we don't have like a codified nomenclature people use full spectrum whole plant solventless solvent free and all these terms yeah and and they're not exactly been really defined in a way that we all approve of more importantly the lineage thing is great like again using our wine friends as an example you know they have lineage of grapes right they and usually it's about the land and so on and they've kind of like settled on the kinds of greeks but yeah right now as we do these crosses the tracking of lineage right um and where strains come from and how they've been crossed and who the breeders were it's kind of like amorphous and uh you know i think in the future you know there's a couple of coalitions out there but really getting together as an industry and trying to put some rules and some nomenclature uh and you know codifying and recording the lineage and having maybe some ways to breed and that all leads me to the point that one thing we're not doing in the cannabis industry enough now is saving our tissue cultures and understanding uh and learning from agriculture some of the pitfalls that happen when we do scale right um i recent this is just new knowledge for me but i recently became aware that in the uh ornamental flower market years ago they had a huge collapse of their market because all their plants essentially got viruses and whatnot and they were going from clone and glowing some teeth but when you go from clone and seed those viruses continue right so establishing tissue banks where when you go to start a crop is coming you know that it's clean in terms of virus is super important but how do we balance that with the farmer's ability to want to constantly pollen chuck and basically cross breed new phenos new types new strains right um yeah i don't know what the answer is there but it is important to note that as we scale this industry and get bigger and bigger and bigger we have to also start to be a little bit more protective of the drawbacks of scaling in terms of viruses in terms of the bad things i guess one way to think as we get bigger the bad things get bigger right so when we're making you know why those small family farms you know that better than you know something that gets into these massive acreage farms where spread technically but there are a lot of farms too that are doing some really good uh work on that line of keeping those viruses out associate gardeners is super knowledgeable on that and it's you know it is nice that it's finally coming but it has been all about education the last couple years and even just educating shops and bud tenders and people how to smoke our products and how to process them and now it's going to be about educating farmers and we're just on this you know curve of knowledge for us all because we've all been so limited in so many years and so i think you know the changes in the last couple years and the changes that are going to be coming in the next five or ten years are going to be just astronomical it's really exciting to see the future happening so well let's talk about the future you know we've got about eight minutes left before we wrap up here and i always like to ask everyone who comes on the show you know where do you see solvent list going in the next year a couple years five years you know down into the future uh everyone is always trying to see what's next so you know please give me each of your takes where where is solventless headed in your opinions i think to me it's pretty straightforward solverless is the future um i often the example of um fresh fused orange juice versus from concentrate or tang we solve it list is definitely that fresh squeezed orange juice um i think people understand that quality once they're educated i feel that right now the reason why we don't use like solventless extracts and even our core products right is because of a an economic barrier right so i think as we scale this and as we um have just more we'll have more solvents right so right now it's the top tier and it will mean that i think that top tier is just going to grow a little bit more and be a little bit more accessible as the public starts to understand oh wait there's another way to do this a good example is cold pressed extra virgin olive oil you know it's like three times the price but most people are like no i get the extra virgin cold pressed olive oil i'll spend 15 as opposed to five dollars and usually you might get the five dollars if you're doing like a brine or something like that right maybe not but like if you're gonna be using it on your salad you're gonna get the best that you can i think that that's the same for the cannabis industry right now we have a lot look this is nothing against vho it hasn't you know how i feel about co2 so we're going to go there where's jimmy when we need him some of the cryo ethanol folks you know they're doing some good work as well um but i do think it is and i think even as a society if you see it in the last 10 years across so many different avenues where we're coming to be a lot more aware of what we put into our body and how that affects us health-wise we've seen a big push in the last decade towards you know small craft wineries small craft breweries back to farmers markets i think people are really starting to take into effect you know the quality and what we're putting into ourselves and how that um comes out in the long run and health wise and just what we feel and you know even taking my mom who came from out of state and we were at one of the grocery stores and she was like well this is expensive i said yes but the highest quality produce the best tasting vegetables the freshest meat and we want to make dinner that night and she was just blown away and it is that where you know i think people are really getting back to their roots and are learning the places where you know they want to spend those couple extra bucks and they're finding that it's it completely is worth it yeah and look i i also want to just shout out look we have a national cbd arch line of products important that people know that that is also solventless we have some good partners in colorado and vermont one plant this hemp thing you guys that's the feds just [ __ ] with us again one plant agnostic of cannabinoids you grow the right plant to grow juicy trichomes filled with thc or cbd that's your choice grow the right plant when you're growing the right plant you can then wash it or keep it or do whatever and colorado cbd quote unquote hemp plants we mechanically sift them we dry sip them you know so we keep them and then we press that kefin rosin and i you know i'm just gonna throw out there but we've partnered with a large uh manufacturer of uh of uh herbal products and we put them on the fact that hey you should be using solventless everything you do is better than an organic and all this and they didn't understand cannabis they thought co2 is the only way to get the oil out they also i think thought the oil was in the leaves and stuff i was like no no no no no the plant ready for you and i guarantee you i can get you the same 650 milligrams per gram oil right without literally touching it with anything at all right drive press and you're good to go and so now we're starting to uh sell that b2b to other suppliers and like at first they're like oh is that a conflict of interest i'm like no we need more voices amplifying this song in this game we need more voices talking about the value proposition of clean unrefined unadulterated no chemicals touching it oil right so yeah the cbd markets yeah educating them the cbd market's taking off and they're using distillate is i 100 opposed to that that's not that's not whole plant cannabis that's never going to be full spectrum but we can now on a national scale give folks potent cbd 650 milligrams gram rosin that has literally never been touched by anything other than some cold you know dry sifting and some warm plates to press it into rosin and they're really starting to eat it up and so the same thing we do here in california we intend to do it nationwide with cbd and of course intend to push solvent lists throughout the nation as thc and all that debates that that's amazing uh you know it's been awesome to partner with you guys on this too with that and i really want to highlight for everyone who's tuned in right now what you said kind of at the beginning of your explanation which you also drove home really hard when we did that panel a couple years ago which is that it's all the same plan it's just different manifestations different cannabinoids that are being represented by the various phenotypes and all the different strains but it is one plant so when people categorize it differently hopefully we will get to some better nomenclature like we've talked to all along to get these terms figured out because that's what really lends so much legitimacy to our industry when a solvent free concentrate is one that's had the solvents removed it's not a solvent list concentrate they are different things so we've only got a couple minutes left here and every time it literally goes down to the last second and who i'm with gets cut off and it's kind of awkward so i'd love it if you guys could tell everyone on the show you know where can your products be found for papa's select and pop and barkley you know give us your pitch and then we'll wrap this up yeah absolutely so here in california we have great penetration approximately ninety percent of the dispensaries so i would say most local retailers carry papa embarki products select the same penetration that's because of uh just the scarcity of the product um but you can look on the website for the to the store locator to see where it is and also follow us at papaselect you know for the ig drops for when new stuff is coming out um yeah we actually don't really do we haven't had to do any marketing for papa select it's all there it's not good boards and um our amazing instagram followers so we're always trying to post something new that's dropping and then feel free to dm we'll find the shops in your area or shout out the shops you want to see and we are working really hard to get that um knowledge up and running out there honestly sometimes they drop and they go so quick it's hard to keep that up to date but we are it's a big project this summer to keep you know weed maps and stuff like that current um so but yeah in the meantime instagram is a great way to find out anything and it's getting bigger you guys right now as we speak we just got approval to build a bigger freezer you know storage of fresh frozen is super difficult la i just quickly last year's power outages get the [ __ ] out of us i bet you don't want to have a million dollars to [ __ ] use my language a million dollars in a freezer and and get a report that the power's out so back up gators larger freezers larger economy of scales more place for the team to pack out and wash all that's coming so hopefully uh next time we talk i can say we're in every dispensary with both products papa select and papa and barkley and just go get it well that's awesome uh i would love to have you guys back on the show in the future we already have episodes booked out into september so we have tons of good hashmakers and people coming on the show thank you guys so much for joining us we'll have this up shortly uh really appreciate your time and thank you everyone for tuning in awesome thanks thank you all right bye [Music] everyone you", "XmyRYtIMcnQ": "all right getting this instagram live started today roz and ryan thanks everyone who is tuning in uh roz and ryan should be here in just a minute i literally never know what to say before these things get started so let's get it going for himself all right cool he is connecting now hey hey how's it going man hey it's going uh pretty darn well how are you doing pretty good over here yeah oh you're at the lab yep yep i actually uh went to the house for a little bit figure i'd come back and do it uh at the lab so okay awesome well thanks for joining me today uh i say this every time but for everyone who's tuning in i'm going to say this about three or four times throughout the segment you've probably seen it uh solving this hash q and a with the man himself roz and ryan in the lab super stoked uh if you've got a question pop it in the question box at the bottom there's a little question uh there's two little boxes it's a lot easier to keep track of it i'll keep an eye on the comments but uh how you doing today ryan it's been a little bit yeah i'm doing good as good as i can with all the crazy [ __ ] going on uh in the world right now yeah case in point i'm i'm here at my house and you're at the lab mask on you guys have a covid protocol yeah we're all in our own little stations we've all got to have the masks on we've all got to just do the normal uh stuff over here but yeah we've actually kind of had to space out our areas a little bit um especially with trimming and everything like that as well um just trying to stay as separate as possible really yeah well still making tons of hash have you guys ever seen a lot of demand it looks like sales are definitely up yep yep and we uh just expanded not too long ago so we're just trying to see exactly how much we can pump out in a day with uh keeping up with quality and stuff right now awesome so you guys are kind of pushing the limits right now over at oleo huh yeah i think they're washing around 50 pounds a day right now wow that's crazy uh i see foxtrax wrecking we got a ton of night ton of great hashmakers in here thank you guys for joining us so i'm gonna i'll go through some questions man and let you take it away um if there's something you want to talk about feel free to just jump in but for everyone who's tuning in who's you know not as familiar with you or your work as maybe i am uh tell us a little bit about yourself and how you got into making hash in the first place yeah i'm in the uh the rosin presser at olio the rossignol extractor um i've been with the company for almost about over four years now uh started as a packager went on to hydrocarbon extractions and eventually you know went to the solventless world and this is you know my love uh this is where i'm gonna stay awesome so what what made you take the jump to solventless if you were doing hydrocarbon before it seems like a lot of hash makers i've talked to on the show had a very similar path yeah honestly it was just it being presented to me i never had access to uh fresh frozen material uh back in florida or even when i first moved here so getting to work with fresh frozen and as soon as we were starting the wash process we needed somebody to press uh you know toots is washing all day so i was you know the first to just kind of raise my hand it just was a very lucky little little uh position i got to be put in honestly that's awesome so you've been with ole has has it been oleo for the past four years or so have you been with some other places too um no well the company we started out before oleo um we split with but yeah i've been with oleo since the very beginning of oleo about a little over four years now wow and has the company changed a lot since then i bet yes honestly we've gone from just the the basic growth practices that you know we had before we've really had to alter to spit just for solventless hash you have to alter your tech in such a way you've done so much trial and error i think we've just come so far as far as quality since the beginning has just been incredible to see uh our team is still small we we've only hired a few more people since the beginning so we're still a small little company so you guys run a pretty tight ship over there uh you are the only person pressing rosin for oleo right now is that correct i actually got an apprentice at the beginning of the year my buddy adam's been helping me um just with the the quantity that we're trying to push out uh it helps to have somebody that's able to prep bags able to do second presses can i can trust them you know doing the whole entire process if i'm not here um stuff like that it really does help uh after about six or seven hundred grams a day that's when i notice i start needing a little bit of a hand six or seven hundred grams a day okay you guys are seriously moving some product and you know i've personally noticed that quality has obviously just continued to go up and up and up to be you know one of the top hash companies in the state i mean what are you watching right now that you're excited about what's new uh in your lab as far as new stuff um not too much i'm trying to think we just got a bunch of like ice cream cake crosses and a bunch of other new things that we're about to pop um that are going to be coming through the line here shortly but honestly right now we're focusing on our main hitters getting those to the highest quality we possibly can like honestly we're focusing on consistency right now i'm not doing too many like new texts or worrying about any you know new things i'm really trying to dial everything in right now so to just get that super consistency that's scaling your consistency that's the name of the game right now exactly exactly we got to keep this consistency as we grow and expand i don't want this to fall off at all yeah so obviously the hash that people are smoking is a reflection of your work uh what are you guys doing to ensure that consistency because shelf stability is such a hot topic in the industry right now and i know you guys are actually absolutely one of the best at that you know how are you guys scaling that consistency it's a lot of note-taking it's a lot of keeping the things that work and ensuring that we keep those going every single time even if it takes a little bit more time we cannot cut corners uh that's where i feel like a lot of people fall behind as they scale up is more corners are being cut as you do it um we're always just trying to get better i don't even think you know we're satisfied just yet as hash makers about where we are so i think it's that too is i'm never really satisfied with the press toots is never satisfied with the wash and that is a good thing we're always pushing uh the growers are never satisfied there's no real peak you know just yet um as far as shelf life and consistency and stuff we just it's so funny but i i never have like an actual sop that i'm following every time most of my stuff is visual it's just gotten to the point where i can see how something's coming out in the jar and i know you just it's playing with the hash so often you get used to it that's the only way honestly um interesting involved in the hash that's the only way so i mean you know that's definitely the skill of the hashmaker to know the resin and one of the things one of our previous guests said that i'd love for you to comment on is that you know the a true artisan hashmaker will know what a material can make in terms of textures it not dictating it the other way around so when you're pressing stuff it's telling you what you can make with it would you say that that's true or not true no it is it is to it to a degree so i can take a strain and make you know a variety of consistencies with it but when i'm squishing that strain i can tell i'm i want to keep this one fresh fresh i want to i know it's if it's super sticky and after sitting for 24 hours in the jar it's just leak and terps i want to keep that as a cold cure batter i don't want to heat i don't want to put that one in the oven you know what i mean so it's certain things to look for like that where you know kind of what it wants to do exactly like there are certain strains that uh i don't really like to put in the oven but i do it only because we get requests for you know the jam um there's certain strengths vice versa that you know i think jam out great some people like fresh press so it's all different yeah well explain to me a little bit more about and just as a disclaimer to you and everyone who's watching you know share as much or as little as you feel comfortable you know we respect the hard-won secrets and techniques that you guys have put your time and energy into but when it comes to a cold cure versus you know in the oven and warm cure for some of the people that are tuning in can you explain the difference between those two yeah so the cold cure is getting no additional heat it's even sometimes literally put in the cold to to gain that terp layer over a period of time this isn't something that happens overnight either these certain batches that come out extra terpene that have that nice turp layer i think you should honestly in my opinion you don't need that extra heat you should be able to make some nice batter out of that just as is uh sometimes the batches need a little bit of extra help though the heat people look at as a bad thing or like you're ruining something um but we've done enough we've done so many terp tests it's going to alter the terp yes it will but it's not going to destroy how many like the terps you think it's going to destroy but in my opinion if you have that natural terp layer and there's those are our really good batches if something's coming down the line that i post a picture of and it's got that amazing tour player on top you can almost guarantee that i'm not gonna put that one in the oven okay so the cold cure common to the popular phrase is often room temperature is that what you're saying yeah and i know other people call their cold cures different things so i know uh other labs might have different things but our cold cure batter is no additional heat whatsoever and usually it's stored in the fridge afterwards and stuff like that too so it's just no additional heat whatsoever okay interesting you know a topic that we discuss all the time on these q a's is you know what the terms mean and that so many different terms are out there in the industry yeah so it's really like personal like what what you want to call it you want to call it the jam you want to call it sauce you want to call it cold cure um i and there also is you know i know ways to you can put the batter in for weeks at a time and also get that same turf layer it's just a matter of time as well we can leave a jar out for a day and see a little bit of you know that layer you can leave it in for about a week in the freezer and just start begin to start seeing that as well okay so is does that kind of come down to the the actual terpene concentration of the hash itself or like what are the factors there i mean it seems straightforward but as someone who doesn't press rosin all day like you do i you know i trust the experts here what do you see there i think it's strain and how well it came out in the ground um it's because you can have two side-by-side you know runs of whatever and the one that uh performed better in the garden that that was healthier that healthier plant is probably going to have a higher terp content um yeah there's so many different little variables honestly so have you seen you know differences in hash in the same strain just depending on like how it was grown that that's how different you're saying it is yeah yeah totally totally wow and what's the method to grow that you guys are using over at oleo um ours is just a basic uh like cocoa grow i think they're using like 15 gals they're pretty big pots um we use a steak method it's just it's honestly it's like a basic basement grow kind of blown up you know what i mean yeah so taking what works the masters of the staking over there that's awesome so do you get a kind of pick some of the material that comes to you or how does your process selection with toques work yep so yeah toots is the the man to pick all the strains and stuff we kind of just go through we know just based on history most of the time unless we're doing a pheno hunt the history of how well the strains wash so we'll be able to go through you can literally we'll go through and pick right away this is going to this this is going to that um sometimes if we have little splits at the end we might get extra uh bho might get a little extra so it sometimes at the end we'll we'll split a strain or something or just to see how it performs in bho if we haven't done it in you know a little bit okay so do you guys test wash or you know do you commit to a big wash and just go for it or how how do you not lose your ass there no no uh twos likes to do a little testers before he goes in with the big one um it just some of those washes especially the size they are now you don't want to take up half your day um just washing something that ends up just doing horrible it really is it's a downer yeah yeah something we've heard a lot in the pursuit of the best flavors a lot of duds out there are there any strains that like you loved but they just didn't yield enough to be a regular production plant so many i i honestly i wish i could write down all the ones that we thought were going to do great and then just didn't do good or the ones we really wanted to do well and then they still just no it sometimes it's just not meant to be honestly you can love the term there's actually two that we have around that just they're not really good washers but i will keep the j i think we'll keep the juice man six forever just because it's so damn good what is the cross on that one i'm not super familiar with that strain um that is papaya and fabuloso nice so do you guys are you seeing yourself running a lot of crosses from oni it seems like you guys are kind of the masters it seems that they do so well that you're like all right well let's try another one let's try another one um but yeah we're going through a few few others right now i wish i had some of the ones that are going to be in rotation soon that we're popping um i wish i had the names of all but yeah uh oni just does well for us it seems like they breed for hash oh are there any other breeders or geneticists that you've seen coming through the lab a lot or that you just are personally fond of um exotic swamp boys canerado i feel like i've said the same ones on other podcasts and stuff but those are just like the staples um yeah i know there's other ones out there yeah have you been pressing anything cool uh last week or this week that you're excited about because for people who are tuned in who are in colorado you know what what can people expect to come out of your lab soon let's see let's see what i i'm here oh man we got some la cush gas tanker i did juice man six gas man which is a combination of gas tanker and the juice man um our day glow has been coming out amazing um it's a citrus strain nice yeah um and we got a bunch of ice cream cake and gmo mixes as well wow stack lineup coming out of the lab exactly um we got some lucky charms um that it's one of the first few times we've ran it so i was just kind of seeing how that one did for us how did it do because i've heard of that strain like maybe a while ago or maybe i'm thinking something okay i'd have to look at his chart to see what it did on the ice hash uh it actually it didn't yield the best for me either so i don't think it probably did that great for him but yeah yeah i actually can't say i'm the most fond of the flavor either but whatever some of them aren't you know keepers so but um chem d uh is making a comeback our old school chem d i-95 oh nice yeah so that is a that's a super gassy one that i've always enjoyed um since i started here really well what kind of strains do you like personally i mean you as i think a lot of people respect you obviously for your posts and being a terrific hashmaker but tell everyone like what are you into personally in hash i'm into terps uh i honestly it's literally my like just my mood i i don't smoke indicas at a certain time or sativas at a certain time it's honestly what i'm just feeling like tasting yeah uh i'll take big old banana dabs in the morning and i don't i don't care if it gets me sleepy sometimes i just want that terp you know it really just depends on my mood i've really always loved fruity and citrusy stuff i know that some people you know really don't go for those but i love them man um i'm not actually a huge fan of cookies or cake strains but they yield so well you probably have to press them all the time exactly some of them are good uh like cookies and cream and stuff i ta i think tastes great it's like a uh i got i like i like everything honestly nice so a bunch of different profiles i you know personally a huge fan of the balancing the orange terps i think that's my favorite profile tropicana cookies gets me every time do you guys get much of that in your lab uh yeah we do some trump uh i we like to see how it uh turns out cause sometimes you know wash is purple and we have yet to have that like purple rosin just yet but we're always we're always hopeful kind of yeah well that would be cool to see and i know a lot of people who are tuning in i'm sure would love to hear a little bit more you know i think you're widely credited as being one of the people that's really taken the jam consistency and made it popular um is that a shelf stability thing is that a personal preference is that consumer demand like where did the jam come from and kind of how did you figure it out um well it came from just watching kind of what others were experimenting with on instagram and i was just trying to follow along and with the information that i was getting i just knew was not correct so that came down to just doing a whole bunch of r d in the lab um but yeah it honestly comes down to a personal preference and shelf stability issue um the fresh press as everybody knows if you don't leave it you know put it back in the fridge and you leave it out within a day or two it's you know it's starting to degrade it's starting to butter up you're losing terps you're you know you're kind of have a lesser product than you did just a few days prior if you don't remember to put it in the fridge um this was just literally how can we mimic live resin and make a product where you don't have to put it in the fridge it actually it's nicer to dab after it's been left out at room temperature um it's like saucy it drips off that dab or you know like you can see the visible crystals inside of it i think everything about that was just kind of appealing to me okay that i mean that makes a lot of sense and i remember a while ago you put out some test results on your jams that took a ton of comments to get through that people you saw a higher terpene test result after you had jammed it is that right i mean and we've done this a few times and i'm trying to get a the the most you know accurate representation of the sample so i'm not trying to pull terpenes from the top of the jam jar i was trying to mix it around and really get some of the crystals get some of the terps and then compare that to our classic rosin and almost every time we saw a significant increase and when i first posted that it was more of asking a question it was more of can somebody explain to me why this might be i know it caused a whole bunch of controversy but uh i don't know i i really do think it's just the ratio of fats that are gone in the jar and other factors i i don't think it's actually like there's no way it's actually like growing terps out of thin air there's i know there's no possible way i just wanted to know why the ratio was different um and i was trying to take accurate you know sampling um i'm not just taking the juice off of the top so so what kind of is your current thought on the matter if it's a little inconclusive right now i honestly think it's just a ratio thing i think that the terpene profile is altered slightly and it's actually uh depending on the strain as well you notice some of the fruitier strains they get altered a little bit more than some of these gas ear strains uh at the by the end of the jam process so it's there's a whole bunch of things okay so solid changes i mean i remember one of the things that ken wall told me a long time ago was you know he was a chef in it in a former life and he said that he modifies things just like you said it doesn't necessarily destroy things so on the topic of like the warm cures you don't think that you're necessarily always losing something when you're warming it up in the jar or explain that to me it seems like it's slightly altering the uh the terpene profiles honestly um certain monoterps turn it's it's it's it's honestly pretty complicated i wish i knew the science behind exactly what was happening inside the jar but um i can tell you that it there's it's the fats you can visibly see them melting down um all that all the opaque lipids that you normally see in rosin you can watch them kind of melt in the jar which if you were to ask me this two years ago i would have said that the terps would have melted way faster than the fats inside the jar but it's clearly not the case so now it's kind of the other way around yeah honestly i've we've just done so many tests now it's just so strange but i mean i love the jam i smoke the jam i'll dab the jam all the time i i thoroughly enjoy it i don't feel like it ruins anything yeah no i i it seems extremely shelf stable and we've bought a ton of oleo at the office and cliff who's one of our uh one of one of our top dudes he smokes a lot of oleo and he said that he's had some of your jams out at room temperature for like over a month and they literally do not change it all nice awesome that's awesome to hear yeah are there any other consistencies that you guys are putting out a lot of i mean it sounds like you're not super big on the butters is it a lot of just jams and fresh press or what do you guys mostly put out fresh press um we're doing cold cure uh and heated batters and then the jams as well and then we also are doing the rosin pens right now well tell me a little bit about the rosin pens how long were you guys working on those because we've heard that the viscosity is a challenge yes it's a challenge and finding that the hardware has been painted honestly we've had quite a few that we think work and then we'll go to do a mass you know drop of them and we'll get a few complaints about the hardware it's never usually the the flavor the anything like that it's the hardware it's pulling through it you know all this [ __ ] it's kind of hard to find like a really good hardware and we don't want to copy another you know high high-end brands pens and go with the same one because everyone will think you're just kind of copying somebody so we're trying to find another pen that's you know also going to be able to perform like we wanted to i mean what what do you think some of the hardware is lacking is it you know not is it getting too hot is it i mean i know that there's just two things honestly i think it's finding a perfect aperture hole it's finding the perfect voltage because obviously these things you don't want to heat up really like you would uh any type of other you know dabbable product you want the rosin to be heated at i want it to be a low temp dab kind of like yeah i want these things to be not burning the hash so it's been a challenge for me to find something that that works on a mass scale that people don't complain about or i don't know it's that's been our biggest issue honestly not funny strains or you know different flavors to put in the pens it's it's all about the hardware really right now and i think we've found one that we've kind of have been using for a while and i think we found to be reliable but we'll see in the long run uh what we end up sticking with yeah so for anyone who's tuned in if you know someone that's in the cartridge manufacturing game please tell them to put a little more time and energy into some rosin cartridge hardware because this is something that we've heard repeatedly yeah i know there are some great ones out there and stuff like that and um i personally know some guys that are doing great stuff out there uh with the carts but it i don't know i guess the the managers here we just haven't found one that works on a mass scale just yet so yeah and the voltage thing is worth lingering on for just a second because um mikey from harvest moon gardens on california i went to emerald couple while ago and he said that the low like the 2.6 if you're really using much higher vultures than that he thought that the it was really just burning terps and not giving you the optimal flavor profile do you have like a voltage that you guys have found that works best or like a range i would honestly be the last person to ask i am not i am i am even i'll take a rig on the go man not a cart man person to ask about the pens but i honestly want to say they're in the low twos but i would i would have to ask uh our pen guy shane so the the proper way to get the real full flavor profile cannot skip the rig yeah i mean if you're on the go though it's just so nice to have a little pen but i know i understand why people love pens too um but they're just not for me it's literally a personal thing no no and i say that knowing that i think rosin cartridges and i'd love to get your input on this are probably the best way to open up solvent lists to more consumers and more casual users who might not be the level of connoisseur that you are but they still want to enjoy a super high quality product would you say that that's right exactly a lot of people are just intimidated by the torch and the nail and everything like that when you're first starting out just to see that i guess is kind of intimidating we've been doing it so long that it's second nature but i guess if you uh are dabbing with somebody that isn't used to it that's that could probably be pretty intimidating especially if you glob them out too hard and then they're never the same but exactly well we are about a half hour in here this conversation is absolutely flying for everyone who has tuned in we've got ross and brian with us this conversation will be up on instagram about five minutes after the hour i will get that posted and then in a week or two we'll have this up on youtube as well if you've missed any of it you want to watch the whole thing so i'm gonna throw in a question from the audience here uh we've gotten a couple let's see um foxtrax is asking how much are you pressing at a time i'm pressing about 20 grams at a time i do uh two really small bags side by side on my press um and i'm using the two and a half by four and a half bags i'm plugging you in here i don't want my phone to die while i'm doing this here oh you're good um so i have two tiny little patties side by side on the press okay 10 grams in each one so about 20 grams at a time okay so you're doing the small presses have you seen better results on your end doing a small press it sounds like you've been doing that for a long time yep i love the small presses i i get more clarity in the presses um i don't get as much of the micro bubble thing going on um okay yep i i really just love the quality control that i get over the the small presses i'd rather do more and it take longer honestly to preserve that quality that you're looking for it sounds like you guys are obsessed with that which is key yep exactly awesome and when you're pressing do you press at a variety of different temperatures depending on what you're trying to do i mean again you don't have to tell us your trade secrets but like no what what's your temp range and what do you like to do with your press i can i can tell what tempo i'm gonna press it at just by how sticky it is the bags are in my hands while i'm prepping them um if they if they aren't really that greasy i can you know press up to 200 degrees if they're feeling real greasy and nice i could drop it to 170 160. so it really just depends um how the quality of the hash in the heads okay so is like 160 around your lower threshold have you ever gone much lower than that um back in the day when i was doing experimenting when i first got your guys's press i was oh is this bothering you two with me being the other way here [Laughter] it's the it's the audio that matters for the most part but that's that's better if that will work for your phone there it's balancing on a little charging cord there um no um oh yeah what were you saying oh just talking about you said you're doing some experimentation on like a really lower threshold yep um so when i first got the press i wanted to see literally how uh how how low i could go uh so i was pressed at like 120 130 but um you would get hash come out and stuff and it'd look amazing but the yields are just so low in the first press that you're essentially just having to go in the second time and get you know everything out again and if you weren't going to do a third press it was almost like that second press was the first press so it all is just like a fine line okay so you could go up and temp a little bit get just as good quality and then not have to press it three times basically exactly it's finding it's finding the the golden temp is what i call it's where i can get an amazing first quality press nothing's even close to buttering on that first press i'm still getting a decent yield and then i can go back and squeeze the rest of the hash out the second time so when you do your second press are you going up in temperature or are you just hitting it again um if i'm already up in temperature near 200 i'll keep it the same i don't ever go above 200 degrees on anything either even second press um but usually i will go up a few degrees and i'll hit pressure quicker full pressure and it goes for two to three times as long okay so that's just getting it all it's literally getting all the hash out okay and do you pretty much do a second press every time or do you get it all out sometimes um some of the really greasy strains um you'll just get an amazing first press yields you'll get like 75 80 almost in the first and then you'll just have a little tiny bit in the second oh so for those ones it's just kind of using all parts of the buffalo exactly those those really good heads and stuff though uh most of the time like you said will come out in the first press okay and as far as clarity goes have you noticed that that has a lot to do with when the plants are pulled or the strain itself like clarity is such a hot topic i'd love to hear you know what your thoughts are on color and clarity so color is where that comes into play pulling early and stuff is color uh we don't really believe in having that white hash is really the the biggest concern for us honestly we've i mean it looks great don't get me wrong but yeah if ours is yellow but clear as can be the clarity is where i feel like the quality comes in honestly oh so key distinction there and a good correction for me color clarity often confused or used interchangeably you can see very different things pouring out of a press but if you look closely it's all just bubbles um but you can also have amazing blonde white hash but it's super clear that's when you know you have that quality so what do you think so that opaque nature translucent nature of it what like what does that mean when you're looking for something that's really clear what is it that's a quality indicator in your world yep i i that's all in the grow um that's if things aren't right in the grow you're gonna get a ton of micro bubbles and foamy foamy hash going on oh and do you have any idea why that might be tons of additives in the grow improper flushing a lot of people think you need a bunch of stuff that you really don't need um for making that for making the plants pretty intense and bigger and all this other stuff where when it comes down to the tri-cad you're actually just kind of uh screwing yourself over so growing uh plant and buds for shelf or you know bag appeal that's a total it's totally different for solventless especially because you're really just resin farming i think that's the exact way to put it yep we have buds that if if we were to go sell those as flour they would look so mediocre you'd be like what is this but you you actually look at the trikets they're so bulbous and the ratio of the the heads to the actual surface area of the buds it's like that's what you're looking for it's like those thin membranes the fatty heads so do you guys ever get down with like a microscope and look at the plants yeah they're they're checking them out with the loops and scopes all the time that's awesome that that's so cool so okay for everyone who's tuned in that's a super important nugget of wisdom is just if something doesn't look like it's gonna make the high times cover uh it could still be a total winner for solventless it sounds like yep that's another thing too uh with having these like big old dense buds sometimes it's not that those dense nugs that are really going to wash good anyway you got to get inside the nug so sometimes a little bit fluffier is uh better oh and you know we hear a lot and we see a lot that hybrids are hybrids and indicators seem to be the things that are pressed the most especially with hash has that been your experience are there any sativas that you've been messing around with too well there's very few sativas that we found to wash honestly i was just reading somebody made a post the other day about some haze cross that looked pretty interesting they said wash pretty pretty decently but on our in our experience we haven't had too many sativa washers man we've tried a few times and they just yeah they don't yield oh that's too bad do you do you think that's because of that bud structure because i'm sure twox would have a lot to say about that but i think that's super important in the wash process i honestly think it's the the trikes uh the shape of the trikes and just how they attach themselves to the to the membrane of the plant itself um i think that needs to be looked into more than just the actual blood structure of the plant um because yeah you would honestly think that those would wash great because you can get inside all everywhere you don't really have to agitate it too much you would think that all those uh trikes would just fall off in there but sometimes that's not the case sometimes you know there is no real stock for it to fall off of sometimes it's like attached to the plant itself and i don't know sometimes those just aren't the good washers even though i would love them to be i love lemons and like heavy orange like hazes and stuff like that but yeah we've just found that they don't uh they don't wash that well right so for commercial production it's not going to pass but it's like trichome detachability and i think i just wanted to stop for a second everyone's out of here so okay yeah you're like okay yeah nice well there's roz and ryan and flesh uh for everyone who has not seen some of the weakness trichome stuff do you follow i think it's schwall i'm hoping i'm pronouncing it right but they yeah thank you for correcting me i know i i actually don't i don't know how to uh pronounce it either so i just call it swallow but okay well that sounds better than what i said so i mean have you seen those macros of the weakness micro uh the weak neck trichomes yes and i also seen it was he the ones doing some of the uh the uv pictures with the the macros and stuff like that i don't know i think so okay yeah oh that's interesting because it seems like that's exactly the topic that you know we need to learn more about is more about detachability so that you could identify something before you ever wash it exactly yeah that'd be really nice to be able to do yeah well again anyone who's tuned in please help us out here uh if you've got something that you could bring to the table to get some more macros and help us learn a little bit more that'd be great so yeah like fox just said like the length of the trichome stock like honestly it makes sense the longer it is the more bulbous the head it just wants to get knocked off of there yeah okay and do you wash or excuse me right away for this would be do you press a lot of mixed micron for the most part do you guys do single micron pressing how do you how do you make your selection there so every single batch we do has 90s and 120s they're pulled out of our first wash so we separate those and i press them separately and then everything else even 90s and 120s from the second wash onward that's all our mixed micron all together 40 to 179 you technically if you want to get technical um i like getting technical yeah so so yeah we uh we do mix micron of every single batch and we also do 90 and 120 of every single batch okay do you guys ever play with sift or you guys just do ice water it seems like we're about to here pretty soon uh we have so much going on that um i think we're gonna introduce kind of another line maybe down the road cool of just a little bit lesser quality rosin um made with some of our partners dried like our trim material and dry sifting that and kind of refining our dry sip technique and maybe doing some rosin with that down the line um that's something we've just kind of talked about cool and do you see promise for solventless based edibles or like food grade oil i mean i'd love to get your take on that um yeah i know i mean i even enjoy a nice hash edible high a little bit more than a distillate um i enjoy that body buzz i enjoy that heavy um relaxing high that the hash edible seems to give me more than the distillate edibles so yeah i think there's a huge market for that um and people in general that are just against distillate even though you know how it goes yeah i think that you have done a great job historically as long as i've known you and in your post and following you about being pretty neutral when it comes to a lot of the extraction topics and not necessarily saying you know one thing is the right thing to do but you're right that there's a there's a lot of opinions when it comes especially in the solving this community exactly so everyone's got their opinion so i i just like to say everything you know is my opinion don't get offended but yeah yeah i'll smoke it all i'll i'll eat it all yeah i mean it some of i mean distilled edibles are the most common obviously or co2 but it's a little one-dimensional to me that that's my issue yep yeah so anyway i don't want to talk about this a little too much but that's funny that you know there is there are some distinctions there is that something that you guys might do one day or is that not really on the menu that's probably one of the things that's not going to be on the menu um edibles is a whole different beast within itself um with [Music] the fire department and the just the uh the other things you have to go through the hoops you have to go through with an edible company are so different than with a extract company or a grow i don't think we want to get into that just yet so yeah kitchens exactly we'll leave that to the um to the professionals if we ever go down that road we'll probably team up with somebody or do something like that no that that's awesome uh all right i need to make sure that i can i can put uh some questions to you because we're getting a ton here but i can't get through them all all right here's just a quick one just for fun what do you think where are you at with the added game uh ttrs for sure yeah that's where you drive right i i wish i just drive a base tt but it would be nice to have that five cylinder no that's awesome i see pictures of your car all the time and uh i'm pretty envious because that thing is awesome so okay uh addie makes a great car check out his pictures if you haven't already um do you press in a cold room um no actually it's just room temp right here so this is uh this is like 68 to 70 degrees in here yeah have you have you ever pressed in a cold room or do you think that that's important or not um honestly i could actually see that being i actually have never pressed in a cold room so i don't know um it might actually be really easy to collect the rosin now if it's all nice and stable it's pretty stable at room temperature so i could imagine it might even be like that shatter that you have to be careful of folding the parchment so it doesn't fly away yeah so i don't know honestly yeah hey well honestly good ours is just you know room temp though um and we have a lot of people will probably wonder like i have my can you see the oven right there uh-huh it is right next to the press so i'm always pressing and just watching what's in the oven i don't have a set timer that these are going in oh okay visual okay so do you have any advice for new hash makers that are trying to learn and to you know read the resin that the way that you do what what would you tell those people well honestly the first thing i would tell them is to get acquainted with the plants in the grow that's that's what's going to help more than anything when you're with these plants all the time you're going to be accustomed to the resin that they're producing you get accustomed to the resin it's all just like a chain so honestly that would be the biggest thing i would i would say honestly is get used to the plants being around plants get used to the hash play with hash as much as you can even if you have dry sift play with that if you have bubble hash it's it's trial and error it's playing with hash it's it's um you gotta want the results too it's not gonna come you know the first time is usually the worst for most people unless you have just amazing luck but yeah yeah it's there's only up to go from there so it's just playing with the hash all the time so you've you know clearly had some hits and misses along the way so if i'm taking something out it's don't get discouraged but keep going yeah i mean there's literally been batches i've ruined here at oleo because i'm trying to do r d or messing with stuff it you cannot get discouraged ever um you might have a bad batch in a room come out um there's all these things that are going to happen if you ever grow anything in your life you're going to know that it's not just you know that the sunny days there's there's like a gardening is hard work those guys in the grove they crush it they are doing way more physical [ __ ] than i am uh pressing rosin nowadays when i used to grow and stuff myself and harvest and make my own hash you really see the whole picture um of what goes into this yeah okay so you started with growing you know obviously a lot of labor of love and i've heard from so many of the other hashmakers we've had on the show that like the respect of the plant is where it all starts so your experience with growing probably helped lead you to where you are just like you said at the beginning oh it definitely helped so much learning learning about the plant helped me learn more about hash in general yeah yeah no that's that's awesome and i know i've been a lot of fox tracks questions not even all right well we'll see if you feel like answering this but if you don't want to give away your secrets you don't have to but any general advice on how to help people with their jam this is probably why half the people are tuning in right now yep so like i said everybody it's all visual if you put something in and you set it for a timer for an hour you could come back to it being completely decarb and you can't do anything but make mediocre pens with it because even then you put it in the oven too long to make pens with it um i have my oven set at the same temperature as most of the time i'm pressing 180 degrees fahrenheit it stays at 180 degrees fahrenheit um i actually have a little sticker on it now that says like do not touch it because i've had a few people touch it but uh yeah it's 180 degrees it all depends on how much is in the jar and the different strains also can take a different amount of time if there's more fats in the strain if there's more thc there's more chirps so when you're doing a strain you're checking in on it a lot it sounds like to figure out what that time is because i'm sure it's variable right yeah it's all variable and all my batches aren't the same size either so if i you know do a batch of juice man and i have a 150 gram jar but the next time i do juice man i can't just try to guesstimate a time it doesn't work that way honestly okay so and i mean it's all visual and what are some of the visual cues that you're looking for to know if it's heading in the right direction or not you will first start to see the rosin begin to bubble and it almost starts looking like it's boiling up um it's still completely opaque uh it'll start to turn into that butter you'll notice your fresh press your transparent fresh press will turn into a butter and then the butter will start to like bubble up and you'll start to it'll look like a batter inside the jar and then as it begins to melt down even further you will see from the bottom up it actually starts to get transparent again you can see the fats inside the jar melting down until it almost looks like a lip it's completely liquid almost in there i could reach inside there with a gloved hand be careful it's all hot yeah and tilt the jar on its side and it will completely move it's it's just like the water in my glass it'll move like this it'll almost move like that yeah there'll be a little bit of foam on top yeah it completely changes the way it looks i've posted a few pictures of right before i pull it out of the oven but i should honestly post a few more so so i'm reading somebody here writing too it will get darker too so don't be scared of that it'll it'll look darker then it will eventually become once it crashes out and you know the thc starts crashing so tell us a little bit more about this because this is a question we get a lot about you know the nucleation and the crashing out of the thca how does that process happen and when does that happen so i'm gonna actually uh here let me show you here because i'm in the lab this is why i came here hell yeah yeah and let me show you too so here's like my little station as i'm pressing i'm literally looking over just just seeing how it looks that's that's my timer literally just oh it's all visual and here's here's oh here's all the crew i drew nice sketching it out well yeah here let me show you something real quick yeah give us a little tour yeah so uh this is like the post production area you can see there's like the back ovens for the bho and everything there's you don't use vac ovens though you're just using straight non-pressurized yep i just i just use this little convection oven oh easy don't need anything crazy yep yep just just a little one um we got just our like packaging areas and stuff over here nice so you guys have a tidy operation yeah i don't want to get too close to anybody i'm staying away yeah so this is like our freezer room where we keep all our frozen stuff and this is like little my little uh like rosin station so i'll have all like my bags and stuff and i'll just kind of prep you can see that this fits perfectly [Music] oh nice yeah okay so it's just nice so i don't even i'm not i'm not even working in a cold room it's just staying cold from the uh from the freezer no that that's cool do you have any samples we could take a look at or is it all packed i'm actually going to show you right now what i have going on back here this is what everyone tuned in for this is my nucleation area so it's literally and i pulled this off normally you would have i don't like any light going in there so i have you just like a little cloth on both sides just kind of is that because the light degrades some of the cannabinoids and terpenes exactly and these are going to be some really good ones i'm going to be posting pictures oh i can see the liquid from here i mean that's like half liquid it almost appears look at this yeah wow this one's crashing out like crazy so again tell us a little more about the crash process while you're walking us through here this one so yeah so they all get put on the heat map after they go into the oven and they're all oven for very times like this one barely got put into the oven this one's gonna be a batter this one's gonna be better and i'm not gonna open up any of these just yet they're not quite ready um no they're coming we can see it open them up but yeah so these will be better i mean you can see this is like going to be a really wet batter thin layer on top yep yo yeah okay i see exactly what you're saying it's all it's almost like honey that has been in the microwave or something yeah so these are almost going in order of time based on the oven so that one then this one which is a super wet batter which went into the oven for even longer yeah okay once we mix that up it's gonna look insane i might post this one up a video of it tomorrow and this one was melted in the oven for the longest and now it is really crashing out you can see there and you can see it this is how when i say it looks darker at first you're going to be scared because it's going to look like this but then it's going to get lighter as the thc begins to grow so it's this whole conversion process that's interesting yeah it's it's really cool and usually they don't sit for longer than two or three days oh so that okay that's that's pretty quick eight eighty percent of them are done within two days that's awesome i wish i could smell it that's the one thing that i'm really missing right now yeah oh cool any anything else in the lab that we should see or that you're allowed to share i mean honestly it's just uh the basic stuff that the vho set up is the back here we have our c1d1 room it's all explosion proof yeah we got our pen set up over here it's it's pretty uh pretty basic no that's awesome and i think what a lot of people don't realize is how some of the best hash in the whole world is made at a station just like yours and literally at yours that it's not this gargantuan production line that it's like one man with a team behind him working at a press making some of the best hash in the world i mean i don't think a lot of people understand that yeah literally i got one assistant helping me out now uh but for a while it's literally was just a one-man team and we can go we can make now we know we can make 25 to 3 000 grams of bras in a week no that's cool right here and i'm uh i'm roughing you guys today thanks i appreciate you rocking the shirt for the ig live man i know you've been with us for a long time oh yeah for sure well we've got about six minutes left here and i've got maybe two more questions to ask for everyone who's tuning in uh remember you can catch the whole thing on instagram right afterwards if you want to listen in tons of good info here totally recommend listening to the whole thing rosin rather ryan's got some great info and then it'll be on youtube in a week or two as well so what do you think what's the future of solvent list in your world man where do you think solving list is headed right now uh honestly i think everyone's just the the quality game is gonna improve everyone is just stepping up their game and uh you just see everyone else and it kind of at least me i'm i'm loving it i'm seeing uh what these other guys are doing and i just want to keep pumping out fire and get new genetics for the lab and putting out new flavors and consistency keeping keeping this up um that's what i just really want to see for the future so same quality at scale more flavors better are the better are there better qual right okay good again another good correction even better quality is where we're headed i mean do you think solventless is is the pinnacle of cannabis concentrates again it's just my personal opinion of course yeah i do i really do now that's great and are there any other hashmakers or people that you would recommend others who are tuned in would follow like who are who inspires you honestly this is one thing i wish i could i wish i could write down so many people that have like helped me out through this whole entire thing there's honestly been so many um i know sam um mile high um he's he's been one of the nicest kids there's honestly so many locals around here that i've gotten to talk to and meet that have been great um but yeah i i really i wish i could link up with some some more of them too um i feel like i'm in my own little world too i'm you know out here i kind of do my own thing but yeah i look up to so many different hashmakers it's ridiculous i i wouldn't even consider myself you know at the very top of those guys well i i i think being humble is a is a great attitude to have when you say sam you're talking about sam wise uh you used to used to work at essential extracts yeah yeah yeah i think he's a great guy there's so there's honestly so many other guys out there i could be shouting out right now too but yeah that the the hash game right now is just it's incredible and is it demand is it people want to get into this like why is solvent what's going crazy right now what do you think i really think people are realizing i mean just other than the cleanliness of the hash and just the whole organic aspect of the process um it's just going to come down to people that always wanted the best flower they're realizing now that some of the best flower is making some of the best hash and it's just that connoisseur mentality of people always wanting the best and i think people are out there you know looking for that that's why like the black market is so strong right now those home grows that are killing it um people just want to smoke really high quality heads really honestly what it comes down to is uh is quality um yeah oh that's awesome so with the remaining time we got left i got one last question for you what advice do you have for just new hatch makers in general we talked about really becoming acquainted with the plants the flower what about in the process of learning you know what advice would you give to anyone who's tuned in right now just be open to you gotta be open to learning you gotta want to learn um you have to love hash and the plant itself um you got to be excited to dab what you're what you're making i i honestly think that's what it comes down to is like being so excited watching it come off the press that you cannot wait to dab something and for others to want to dab it that's the only way uh but honestly working hard is what got me here i started as a packager just letting your your dreams be known um i always want i moved here to make cash this is what i wanted to do i had a goal and i you just got to work hard and eventually you know the right people will take notice um that's really all it comes down to that's awesome how can anyone find your products uh you guys are in just colorado right now is that correct yep just colorado right now we'll see what the the future holds yeah and you can find some drop locations on your website or how do you get tuned in with the olio drop so people can pick up some of your fine products yeah um we got a website um we got the instagram uh dabolio 710 it's got a link to our site and stuff they should be posting drop info as well um and just call your local dispensary ask if they carry oleorosin or any type of oil products okay awesome so for everyone who did not write that down just took a dab or is super stoned and won't remember i will put that in the description uh of the instagram post too so everyone can find out where your rosin can be found awesome thank you guys so much i seriously appreciate you doing this and i appreciate everybody that's watching right now thank you guys so much yeah thanks for taking some time out of your evenings everybody i know it's uh after work for some people so appreciate all your time make sure to check out the full video on youtube in a week or two when it comes up ryan thank you so much for joining us i appreciate your time man thanks again eric all right

160. i haven't make one of these in a while now let's see what we uh we got yield wise right i'm curious are you curious i'm curious hello 0.0 grams 11.1 out of 17.7 nope it went down to 11. so we got 11 grams out of 17.7 that's a 62 percent return on the 25 and 160. not bad at all it's not bad at all hambone how do you want this you want this in some jars you want to do some parchment you want in some ptfe what's up what's up what's up tell me how you want it i feel like i should shove it into a couple of jars but right now i'm going to take a dab roni so beautiful [Music] break me off a piece of that [Music] oh i think that's a good enough dab i'm sorry hambone i had to do it don't get mad at me bro [Music] come on i love your dog but i'm about to dab it [ __ ] out of this i don't care how much it is i'm gonna store this here for now i'm sure i'll be back later how many different jars do you want that's what you got to tell me i don't know how many jars you want it's it's 11 grams so i can split it up into however many you want all right i'm sorry i'm gonna have to sit down for this this is a this is a a boy sit down it's like a dab this is the type of dab you take standing up and it's gonna tell you shut the [ __ ] down boy what's wrong with you all right [Music] coffee going and i found a little [Music] thca chunk to throw on there [Music] death [Music] step by dab i'm gonna give you some some [ __ ] love on instagram right now [Music] now bone garden that killer collab that y'all never saw coming what's up athena alex back burner what's up let's get it just pressed up a little bit of that hambone gardens this is the 25 and 160. yo yo yo this is the hambone gardens 25 and 160 right here hopefully you can hear me now that i turn the music down let's get it fatal tester dab we don't take no baby [ __ ] dabs around here oh yeah oh yeah i don't want to miss this one hmm jesus take the wheel um hmm oh yeah don't sleep on it that was the 25 and 160 let's go oh my god that felt like i was smoking some of my own [ __ ] ham bone you did it again you know what i like about hambone the first thing he told me i don't care about quantity i care about quality don't go for yield go for the high quality bet money homie that's what i like to hear [ __ ] me my bad i knocked you guys over that's what i like to hear my farmers say because if they're going for yield they know the quality is not good but if they know the quality is good they don't want you to go for yield keep the quality good oh my god yes sir that was like smoking on some of my own homegrown gave me the dab sweats it was smooth the entire time it cleans up extremely easy regardless of how big the dab was i mean hard to tell it is it's clean in there man it's nice so holy oh dab switch my turf caves are [ __ ] running but it's time to get into the full spec presses we're gonna fold up some parchment real fast for that and then have at it man good yes good dab good good good dab probably a little bit bigger than i should have gone for this early in the morning considering i still have work to do man [ __ ] turd caves sweating holding [ __ ] devil's ball sack it's warm in here now [Music] it's smoky in here too jesus louises i think we're gonna go with a 180 on the full spec see how it how it flows if the flow isn't there we're going up to 202. word word let's [ __ ] go all right so here's the plan parchment first okay and you guys are gonna get plugged in right now while i [ __ ] no every time i plug you in it [ __ ] disconnects when i [ __ ] unplug it so i'm not even gonna [ __ ] with that we're just gonna fold up our parchment real fast [Music] [ __ ] hambone [ __ ] ham bone good [ __ ] dude good [ __ ] [ __ ] hats off my hat's off i don't give a lot of props to a lot of people because a lot of people don't [ __ ] grow really really high quality [ __ ] like this i'll take it all day long brother you know something that's not often talked about is the uh the relationship how you have to grow with your farmer or hasher whichever way you're going you have to grow and collaborate together to improve the end product 25 and 160 mix micron test press dab let me add this real quick before i forget last time i forgot to [ __ ] do it um pull up my [ __ ] chat here god damn it oh my god that dab has my head spinning right now like i just down the [ __ ] bottle of patron all right yeah man that's that's that's no [ __ ] i don't give a lot of praise to a lot of people so ham bones my dude you crushed it and i got nothing but good [ __ ] to say for i can't wait to see what you do once i put a 20 kino in your head [Music] brick by brick by brick by brick by mother [ __ ] brick we are about to build this hatch house so something in my gut now is telling me to go up to my 202. something in my [ __ ] gut what is it what is it what is it it's in my gut it's in my [ __ ] nope it's deeper than my gut it's my nuts it's my [ __ ] balls my balls just spoke to me and they said why are you going to do something different than what you normally do don't change [Music] [ __ ] i don't know balls my brain is contesting you i just saw some [ __ ] on the press with the 25 and the 160 at 175 that was leaking but it wasn't a whole lot of it to leak so it couldn't really you know but then again am i just making excuses dilemma what say ye the people so i know i watched pedro's press this morning actually it was van ness how much pedro and i have very different styles of pressing but we both get very very good results at the end and i think that's a very good example of how different paths can lead to the same house you know um and ultimately because we both are experienced hashers both he and i know how to end up working the material after the press to where we can make it look the same you know in the end anyways you know the post-press manipulation is just really stupid these days with what you could do okay there's this next to the largest one we're gonna do it now a small one and this is the one we might test for 180. but i don't know i feel like we're entering the doodoo zone those of you that watch my stream know about the duder zone at 180 uh really 180 or 200 it's kind of like doodle [Music] dude hmm all right [ __ ] it let's let's test it on this small one that's what the tester is for right if this tester doesn't [ __ ] bleed beautiful [ __ ] terps i'm turning up the tab mister [Music] the [ __ ] go is in the house bro we've been bumping your music hard you've been busy making music [Music] he was live on instagram this morning too [Music] [Music] so oh my [ __ ] oh i just got that [ __ ] my balls just tug doggy from the inside you're like don't do it it's not hot enough it's not going to bleed fast enough don't do it [Music] so [Music] so [Music] what's up elite welcome to the grow room gang homie i appreciate the support nah [Music] so so [Music] so [Music] by the way if anybody's curious my directional flow fold is the easiest most least complicated easiest to collect off of method that i found i watched all those [ __ ] videos on youtube and these [ __ ] origami guys doing all this stupid [ __ ] not real origami but i mean all these rosin press dudes that are just doing the [ __ ] most and i feel like man one piece of parchment right you fold it twice on the ends so that way you can pinch that fold in and it doesn't leak out right you fold these sides good put a good crease in them okay don't fold the back too hard don't put it too big of a crease in it you might get a blow out if you the bigger the crease the bigger the chance for blowout all right then for me i know i need to cut off a little bit right to get it to flow into the jar where i want it and then fold it in half like you're making a [ __ ] paper paper airplane all right you guys remember this old school [ __ ] paper airplane [ __ ] from no time but you're not making the regular slow glider you're making that [ __ ] that fast one so you want to do the the um right that's what you're basically doing you're making that oh that paper plane right now when you open that up you get these beautiful folds where everything leads straight to the middle okay and you open it up what can i say except you're welcome for the tech that i share on this channel there you go now when it flows it's just you open it up you collect off one sheet you don't have like three different pieces of parchment to collect off of i mean come on kind of [ __ ] that's not good tech man you gotta [ __ ] collect it off of like three different pieces of parchment just so you can make it look cool i don't like that [Music] oh no too much what happened let me lose please talk to me seamless can you talk to me calm down you guys it happens it happens you know how many times i've accidentally muted somebody or put somebody on timeout all you have to do is accidentally rub something across your screen for like two seconds of the charging wire your hand if it's in your pocket whatever and you can like literally ban half the [ __ ] chat it's ridiculous i've done it like three times to people ocean's account was banned for like a month they didn't even use that account anymore it didn't even use it he was like [ __ ] it i'm getting on a different account [Music] so crazy that is craziness all right y'all remember the tech all right paper plane tech don't fold it straight to the the halfway point where the the fold is because then you might jam your rosin flow up a little bit especially if you keep it closed like this i don't like keeping it closed like this then the rosin gets everywhere it's more messy right that's why i make these folds [Music] my boy came straight back to the car what is up you couldn't resist it my tummy hurts i gotta go doo-doo but i'm too embarrassed to go at work on the public toilet i go home i need to [ __ ] on my own toilet i have a medical condition you don't want me to sit on your toilet it might spread the doctor said i can't share toilets with people it's a medical condition i'm not allowed to talk about it [Music] all right 180 one shot at one eight with a small bag we got 33 left on the battery so now i'm gonna set up the tripod and get you guys plugged in and in a good spot sorry my terps are running in that last dab that [ __ ] really [ __ ] sent me to the moon for a minute [Music] i can't even [ __ ] can't in front can't even front i straight blasted me to the moon and back [Music] now i'm just trying to get a cool spot for you guys [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] good all right good fresh gloves um all right [Music] so [Music] [Music] um so i've got to figure out where i can get you that you're not going to be in the way because [Music] what i'm doing is more important than what you're seeing so i'm not going to be dead but you know this is what it is players all right first press test press 180 fahrenheit wedding crashers full spectrum hashtags and this is the smaller of the presses first can be a test see how it responds after temperature [Music] so [Music] i'm not even using any pressure i'm just letting that the hydraulics go down and towing basically right now [Music] so [Music] oh oh [Music] um uh h [Music] [Music] um [Music] [Music] [Music] is [Music] um [Music] is foreign [Music] this is at a 180 right now oh it's just get all the terps out baby is [Music] happy mess is [ __ ] beautiful let's go [Music] [Music] um okay so let's keep it at 180 i feel like even a 1800 six all right let's see how it flows again at 180. whoa is that a bottle of tomatillo so you can stop carrying around your bottle and head to am pm instead right now buy any hot dog and get a second for a buck only at 8 00 pm too much good stuff buy one at regular price get a second of equal or lesser value for one dollar selection may vary by site while supplies last fire i got it pretty damn dry too all right well i feel like that's all we're gonna get out of those we might be able to push a tiny bit more yield out at the higher temps but uh that's why i raised it two degrees to try and keep the flow a little bit higher um beard hairspray did i put something in there uh there's nothing where do you see beard hair is that bro what are you talking about [Music] [Music] show me [Music] [Music] hmm so [Music] so sorry guys i'm bumping you around i gotta get the bag [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] who's your daddy [Music] wow [Music] um uh [Music] quality over yield keep it as low pressure as you can slam in my throat from allergies keep it as low pressure as you can and uh get as most like the most out of it that you can i get 95 of it like at the lowest pressure you possibly can and then ramp it up towards the end and get everything else out like i'm just barely hitting one ton right now [Music] [Music] uh [ __ ] this flow made my balls drop i've never seen anything squirt like this before oh squeak now [Music] well at least on his like sound stream or sound files why you got to play spanish as just because his name's hotto what the [ __ ] what's up roots just barely hitting two tons now is division anger is near the higher pressures [Music] [Music] i cannot breathe okay now we're three and a half almost four tons low pressure low temperature low and slow remember you guys talk about this low and slow or hot and fast no do do zone she passing the doo doo zone you get dookie every strain has its own doodoo zone but a good starting zone is typically between like 180 185 you start hitting that doo-doo zone and then you come out of it around 195 200 usually increasing pressure up to 5. people want to know what psi that is i'm sure five tons on this press right well one one ton is 2000 psi this bag is a two and a half inch by four inch bag it's probably only three inches though um it was actually it's about four inches i can see right here so it's four by two and a half all right so here's that ten so if i'm at five that's ten thousand divided by ten so i'm at a thousand psi going up six times we're gonna cruise it on up to seven eight watch the flow see if it increases at all if not then we'll pull it bacon vape is giving you guys the [ __ ] honey terps straight from the flowers and nipples secreting the nectar straight to the bee that's me i process it for you turn it into the honey here you go [Music] going up to 10 tons 2 000 psi just give me the tips just give me the tips and i'll start the show i could take another dab of three more eleven thousand at 11 tons now 12. i think it's safe to say we've gotten everything out of there let's call it delicioso now if the yield is not what i'm expecting off of this [ __ ] we're going up in temperature i don't give a [ __ ] [ __ ] how good this looks but we gotta test it i think because and we'll see what the bag starts with the back i feel a lot of weight on the parchment which is not a bad thing i don't care as long as i got out of the bag it's all about how this bag feels right nope it's all it's all gone there's nothing that is full extraction mode right there let's go [Music] [Music] well 182 is all right [Music] and i feel like i want more you must know expect 20 yield or less what you're talking about [Music] [Music] one remember you have to evaluate each and every strain they're going to react differently right now whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa i feel like 182 is good but i feel like i'm gonna give it two more degrees go up to 184 okay just because i want it to hold a little bit more flow [Music] for flour it's about freshness you guys you guys flour flour flour you guys wanna talk about flour rosin i'll teach you guys some flour rosin who wants show of hands class class who wants some flower rosin tech while we watch the flows [Music] so nice stoney hell yeah okay okay calm down calm down no no spamming no spamming let's sit in the [ __ ] hallway kid you're on timeout um all right here's the thing you guys the trick with flower rosin is this i'm going to tell you and this is i always have a lot of unpopular opinions but i always have flame product so take it for what it's worth if you have to process flour the trick is my quick dry method okay making sure that it is fully bone crispy no fresh green fresh hay smell whatsoever okay pack it into bags as soon as it's done don't put it in turkey bags and burp it and blah blah blah blah i mean dry it on the branch until it is bone dry almost too dry you're not smoking it okay and despite what a lot of hashers like to perpetuate without actually having tested themselves okay humidity when you're pressing quality material does not [ __ ] help okay it does jack diddley ball sack squat for you i will tell any hasher i don't care how popular he is or how good his product looks i'll tell him to his face that's [ __ ] okay what matters is how fresh the buds are okay if you get it properly dried and you pack it into bags really fresh i mean like that night the next night right and you press it either really low and slow or kind of on the hotter end to 10 to 20 and fast okay and i guarantee you your yield is gonna be [ __ ] amazing humidity has jack diddly ball sack to do with it because i press my nugs as dry as possible i purposely avoid getting them too humid okay so it's about how fresh the butt is how well it was grown and then you process it at the proper temperature so that it doesn't sit there on the plates for too long and you will end up a really high quality product i kid you not i've tested it for myself all the different types of boveda packs curing it blah blah blah none of that matters what matters is that you press it you press it as soon as [ __ ] possible off the plants as soon as it's properly dried you know that's the key that's the key i've had hash rosin or i mean flower rosin look better than some people with hash rosin because of that that's all you gotta do [ __ ] humidity packs [ __ ] all the [ __ ] press it fresh it only matters if you if you're storing it and you need to keep the humidity proper cool you're not storing it you're pressing it within 48 hours minimum i mean maximum i press mine within like the first 24 hours if i'm gonna be pressing flour but i mean what do i know what do i know we're not even at a ton yet this shit's on fresh frozen this is not fresh frozen either this is dry this is sbnb quick dry method this is what i talk about collaboration with your farmers i taught him the tech so that he could bring me high quality material that was prepared the correct way and voila we have a winning combination that's how you collaborate with your farmer to make each other better man people don't understand flower rosin can be really really really clean and good and almost as good as hash rosin the only difference is you know the flower is going to give you a more in-depth complete entourage effect and the hash rosin's going to be a little bit lacking in that department but it's going to be a more pure taste a more pure concentration of flavor on just the purity side of things no not even a three week dry holy mole i'll do a video on my quick dry tech i know a lot of people want to know about it but i'll make a video i think i'm on top chat am i trolling i'm on top chat [Music] [Music] so thank you [Music] [Music] low and slow and high and fast don't always have the same yield it just depends on how good you are and if you can maneuver the material well enough if you find the appropriate temperatures for the low and slow then yeah you can really get a good yield out of it you know and really extract everything out of it but just by by nature and science you're going to get a slightly higher yield using a higher temperature because there's only so much that you can make up for by applying additional pressure the rest of it has to come from heat those are the only two factors at play here well if time heat um and pressure right so you have to find the the proper zone for the low and slow the proper zone for the hot and fast so that you maintain yield air quality on equal planes up to six and it's like what have you done increase the pressure up to about 10 tons here start getting everything else out of [Music] that [Music] earth wind and fire get her get her get her get her get down 12. 12 and a half calling it five four three two you know nasty mcnasty september to fill out 30th is don't forget to respond and make sure to count all kids living with you most of the year even if they aren't family members when babies and children are counted the programs that support them and their families get more of the federal fund you may need for the next 10 years is that the full extraction there's definitely nothing left in there [Music] uh i don't know full extractions i don't know yeah winston yes sir doing everything i can to extract the most out of her and uh see if i can't help him get a good indication of you know its potential there's no better way to find out the potential of a strain in my opinion than washing it and pressing it um in my opinion that gives you the ultimate ultimate experience of how good it can be really what's the yield what's the terps what's the [ __ ] you know what's it look like is it mostly terps is it is it a high thc content as well is it a good ratio i mean you can really understand a lot of that just by looking at it come off the plates by looking at it and feeling it as it comes out of the freeze dryer i mean there's just so much information there if you know what to look for as a hasher you know yeah that flower was [ __ ] on the money no doubt [Music] [Music] [Music] so oh no you lost a leg hold on get back on there that's fine we gotta give you there give me the sugar give me that [ __ ] baby looking [ __ ] fine as hell in there come here go find us over here give me some sugar baby very good from the time dude look at that [ __ ] flow [Music] so so i'm going to slightly disengage this press that's fine that's just the handle i'm going to go up and move my ram over just a touch because it's slightly off center there we go and then we'll keep the press going not advisable to do if you're not an experienced presser is [ __ ] restarting your press mid press don't do that a lot can go wrong but if you see something's wrong and you have the ability to fix it fix it don't settle for less that would have resulted in a less than optimal yield the bag may have potentially blown out something that needed to be corrected and corrected back on back on track man it comes to flow again yes look at that flow though back to our regularly tuned program go go hashing waterfalls ah no high pressure doesn't cause blowouts improper packing of the bag and increasing pressure too fast causes blowouts i press my flower up to about 16 to 17 tons on this press and my hash up to about 12 and i stop around 12 usually um laughs hey morty you're back okay i'll pull up the girls one monkey down and monkey number two what's up we're gonna be asleep uh nope she's not asleep but what and her cameras move but she's not standing up she's laying down so i'll give her a minute increasing pressure up seven times um angie it's time to take a nap lay down please oh good girl thank you increasing pressure up to 12 tons there's some good stuff in there still this one went up to 13 tons on this one give the good old countdown one two we're counting up because i'm high three four five we're done yes very sexy oh my god oh oh oh oh gosh goodness damn bone make a good team keep this up this is beautiful but what that yield do beautiful extraction full extraction is a good one the terp fiends will be happy your terps will get you high a little sneak peek got a little sneaky peeky oh yeah check some work [ __ ] real quick i usually don't have any meetings on mondays but i got to just double check that we're good angelica lay down it's time to take a nap please darn kids um ugh drippity drip drip drip we're literally at one ton right now just barely at one time don't believe me look so so we're up to three tons now i got really [ __ ] spaced for a second um [Music] [Music] oh [Music] let's go up to five times i think we got just about everything at that low uh pressure we're gonna get five times now give me my terps my need mass [Music] don't eat straight rosin i've talked about it before it's not good it's a it's a really concentrated essential oils if you get really good terpene content in there and it can burn you pretty good you can get chemical burn i put decarb rosin in my uh you know mouth and i tried a little straight glob off the press underneath the tongue doesn't feel good going up to uh seven eight oh i'm gooey mortgage

daddy products is that 184 uh [Music] the key to being a successful hasher is knowing what to look for when you're pressing and washing and knowing how to take those those signs into consideration and change certain aspects of what you might be doing at that time pressure temperature how long you're washing how rough you're washing how long you dry it for etc etcetera etcetera there's so many things that come into a play even before you pull it down off the plant so tuning in to the daily dabs we do this daily not pressing every day but we're depressing washing doing some grow room [ __ ] dabbing and talking industry tech all right 10 tons now um 12 times [Music] and we're good [Music] [Music] i'm just getting [ __ ] highs again i'm just getting [ __ ] high again [Music] [Music] please not at all [Music] is i am a soldier [Music] [Music] light work handbook um way way [Music] today [Music] [Music] right back [Music] is [Music] 10.5 here [Music] this is that 25 and 160 pressed together um there's 7.8 there [Music] seven [Music] two seven point five cool this is mine is [Music] this is for me let's dab that and then we'll collect the rest [Music] [Music] um [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] me [Music] [Music] 125 and 160 mix thank you [Music] come on mystic send me these songs so i don't have to play him on soundcloud anymore man [ __ ] cheers people really think [ __ ] cool [ __ ] so much cash and they gotta swerve everybody is got swerved everybody said it and they gotta live it there's a no commitment i know how to get it and [ __ ] is it [ __ ] i'm with it when it goes let's go let's get his oh go give you a little bit of beat to ride out too i got him come over here [Music] 2020 future set set [ __ ] so all right [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] um [Music] [Music] [ __ ] you see these [Music] [Music] must [Music] [Music] um [Music] folks [Music] and charming we heard you shouldn't talk about going to the bathroom in public so we decided to sing about it really going to make me pay for soundcloud premium aren't you bad but i will because that's how much i believe in your music dog i'm going to sign up for youtuber [ __ ] soundcloud premium just so we could listen to your music with no ads from now on on this channel just you're the only soundcloud artist i'm listening to and i'm going to do a preview because your music is [ __ ] banging [Music] uh y'all want some magic toilet water y'all don't want no magic y'all not ready for the magic toilet too yeah [Music] you know all right let's listen to some magic toilet water [Music] okay it's coming back that was just the animation that i saw [Applause] [Music] foreign [Applause] uh [Music] this [Music] [Music] uh [Music] hold on check this out shattered [Music] [Music] um hmm [Music] [Music] celery [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] you get a yacht jump foreign to my business [Music] [Applause] wow [Music] looks like you lost another one [Music] uh a message [Music] my don't say more [Music] is [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] hey i am um [Music] oh [Music] foreign is [Music] is [Music] [Music] so [Music] all righty one more time so you call that heart [Music] [Music] hmm that's how you do that and then go back through you give it the old finger banger ring fresh gloves squeeze fresh gloves if your glove starts sticking it's time to swap gloves but you can pull that finger really tight and then hold it there and i gotta get the rest of it off real easy damn cool we use the dab tool for the rest of it ready might as well hit it while it's ready it's nice and warm [ __ ] it let's get it [Music] so [Music] [Music] so now i'm going to swap up to use this end it's longer i can get further down so [Music] don't use no [ __ ] drills you guys jesus i've seen people using drills with the dab tool attachment stop knock that [ __ ] off put some [ __ ] elbow grease put some pride into your work and stop risking putting metal shavings into your rosin just please stop it i don't know who in here needs to hear that but stop it it's really worth it well i'm not gonna get it perfect right now i used a day or two at least push that down [Music] [Music] okay now we're going to take the rest no give me my glove back ah give me my glue back [Music] apparently that finger is too warm got most of it down now here's the trick we'll pop it nice and tight i'm going to turn my plates down to where's that 84 i'm just going to put it on 84 right now i don't feel like adjusting the singles but normally i'd go to like 80 but uh 84 is fine and then uh what we do then is once i see the plates um drop below like 150 i'll go ahead and put this whole jar on top of the plates and it'll allow everything in here to come down to the bottom and combine together so i hope that helped some of you guys show you my process you know what i'm saying rosin on my arm i know it was just a tiny little speck of that thca flaky [ __ ] i grabbed it excuse me no no no real like jar tech really it's just enough to um get it to settle down you know that's why i lower the temp and i wait to put it on the plates and then uh what else fire right here fire fire fire set this aside dab time yep this is a special dab it's a fresh dab with a full speck [Music] don't forget to give your damascus the weekly wipe down with uh with vegetable oil otherwise it will not hold its shine it will start to lose its uh shine luster finish oh [ __ ] balls [Music] quench it [Music] yo i'm gonna start keeping my damascus in a quench filled with [ __ ] iso fresh iso better holy [ __ ] now for the tradition around here for those of you that are new it is time in the stream uh the only way we can in the stream is to clean the spoon what's cleaning the spoon you know when you're done mixing up cookie dough your kid probably not nowadays i don't know if you still do it as an adult but you take the spoon what's left of it or the bowl and you scrape it up then you eat it right i don't know if anybody else ever did that but we're going to clean the spoon holy [ __ ] [ __ ] dab a row that's gonna be a big one i have cleaned the spoon would you agree that the spoon has been cleaned the spoon has been cleaned oh i'm not ready i'm not ready that is a one to two gram dab i guarantee it can we weigh this for confirmation yes we can i would really like to know [Music] i honestly feel like this will be a waste if i take a whole gram dab of this okay let's see what we got now okay tear that little piece of parchment [Music] out [Music] one point one i'm not going to be a jackass and waste this high high quality rosin i don't need a full [ __ ] granddad right now but i will take a half of that there is point six on here now so all of this going straight into the bang here not going to waste super high quality material like this i mean come on look at this so this one's just for the youtube because i'm gonna die i feel like i'm gonna need to sit down but you guys are on the chair so never mind [ __ ] it i'm gonna try and bring you guys a little closer and almost [ __ ] up the only big spicy chicken nope why isn't everything about going on a big dab they want to play a [ __ ] advertisement no no no has just the right amount of spice it's not hot magma in your mouth spicy but it gives you a little kick in the pants not a bad kick in the pants a perfectly spicy savory tasting kick in the pants from am pm get two big spicy chicken sandwiches for just four bucks am pm too much good stuff two for four dollars or one at regular price for 249 at participating locations for a limited time or while supplies last [Music] you haven't even used the shovel here um cheers everybody thanks for hanging out i hope you enjoyed the stream keep out you guys me [Music] oh [Music] how many yeah instant purse the windows in it [Music] sweet turkey cakey [Music] take your breath away [Music] makes your nose runny [Music] makes your nose runny [Music] who wants to guess who wants to get [Music] wow wow look [Music] reclaim baby [Music] uh [Music] what [Music] [Applause] wow i got damaged [Music] [Music] never really mentioned myself these jars 180 grams if we take one or two grams [Music] that's 76 yield right now [Music] did 116 grams roughly that's it cheers hopefully that helps there's the tech there's the tech and wait for this y'all don't even know", "NP5px4BB3BM": "what's up you guys let's go ahead and show you guys how to make some dry ice hash I thought countless requests to see how this process isn't done and realistically it's one of the most simplified extraction processes you can come across and cost next to nothing let me show you the process to the parts a requirement for this process sorry about that real simple you need some kind of screen a bubble bag you can use pantyhose cheesecloth anything to pretty much separate the more bulky plant material from the final resins that we're looking for so kind of bucket I'm just using what's supposed to be like a utility can use a five-gallon bucket or whatever it is anything give me some dry ice you need dry ice to make dry ice ash we can go to Windows final if you can find pellets use pellets but if you need to you can get the block to smash it up here I need some herb we're just gonna start with something real simple here I like two ounces of mixer from Tar Heel cannabis all the real fine shake and the really keep covered stuff you can see how much Keef is there in the base that's all gonna come back in our product so well we've got to have some kind of bowl on the side to you this is a put your bubble bags or your screening device or anything in here so it's not on the ground we'll see dirt so let's get to business here we're gonna start with a nice seventy-three micron this is the golden layer on the typical bubble bags and this is gonna be your finest glands and it's gonna be all the fight the fact trichrome heads as well as the more like turf ridden that a parts of the plant you see it's gonna be the most flavorful and the most abundant in the resin so I'm going with that for my first process here go sample dump the lead in I know that was a complicated part so go ahead and do that got the weed air in the base listen it go as far as you really don't want any piece it's you know bigger than a baseball baseball or bigger it's just you want to kind of avoid getting too much powder so if you can find any other method using a mallet rubber mallet or something to get finger breaks I do recommend clutter I'm kind of just chilling in a friend garage and we're just you know kind of free ball in the air now we're just gonna put this right up on top of that weed every last bit of it all right good glance nice quad machine this is exactly what's going on when you see fog machines it shows you guys just then releasing this co2 that's a compiled together makes this really cool effect now next step we're gonna tie this up real nice and take this bowl coincidentally perfect size to work as a cover we're gonna cover this up I do recommend before time taking your your product whether it's fresh or it's already dried out product and freezing it for at least 24 hours what this does is that helps make the trichrome heads more brittle where they separate and you get a higher yields in return you have to do less agitation to get that return so we're going to let this hit 10 15 minutes smoke a nice fat bowl and it will come back to show you the sifting process mmm-hmm pretty simple dude got the Biagio out got some more of that gargoyle melon berry oh the prime limited Garbo melon berry you guys we got some nice [ __ ] wheat point for you here this [ __ ] is off the hook you just wait till you get to explore through the freakin countless caves wonder there's just trichomes and diamonds everywhere man it's it's like when you perfect the ability to use an eagle at ten times gems in but then not having to perfect that weird kind of concentration with your with your Isaac you don't have to do that now we got it for you mishit it was never tested because it happened it's not enough of an abundance yet to have been tested but I saw the surrounding strains that were tested at thirty-one percent THC which was one of the Tahoe San Fernando Valley crosses and this looked like that one frickin diamond in the rough we're just going to cross that off everything so dang convinced that go holy [ __ ] what is what is this and you kind of move the planet it's like oh my it smells like frickin crunch berries like what is this stream man just like chronic crunch berries and then I see the name and just like gargoyle melon berry you serious I ready I'm [ __ ] nice and rip that [ __ ] is killer is completely complex anyways this sat a little bit of extra time but no harm no foul all I did was to make sure every last bit of it was nice and close so I insist on if you're using the bags I like to wrap my hand up so it's not sitting there dragging a nice powderized key all right and then I go to the base to try to use gloves this [ __ ] is cold you will freeze your hands and it will hurt so kind of mix it up gently don't get too abrasive with it and when you're sipping it's gonna be real gentle see the movements get married just like if I was milking of so people have to get that reference how do you milk the cat and what I'm really aiming for is making sure I get optimal amounts from this layer of filtration but I'm not overdoing it to the extent that I start getting a lower grade quality patch so I try to do like 1520 seconds and I'll kind of shake it around and then I will take that out and then I do that process you know a few different times that way I'm ensuring serious every time it's gonna make sure that I'm only getting the fat trichrome heads that's super important you guys all right we'll call good and please do not sit there and you know handle the bag like that like trying to shake it out because that will actually expand the micron filter that little screen that we're relying on for the most optimal results of quality you're gonna expand them and it's going to get more plant debris through no bueno all right this is for probably like three more runs and I put that in the bowl and show you it's like we don't have much material so let me go ahead and scrape this together and from the looks of the amount we are kind of really fan tool with it but it's more important to to get those financed resin glands all right on doing is taking that down to the bottom see if we can get a good lighting here you can kind of see the collection of that nice real light color it's like so light color that it's almost hard to see it and that's that's kind of why we'd want to only do little intervals where we make sure we keep discoloration and don't go a little bit further and get it to where it's kind of getting a green color we want that stuff to be blond all right let's go ahead and toss this on the place so you can get a an understanding of what this actually looks like if we could only do some smellivision you guys show you the Terps on this it's it's nice and powder but what's funny is it's it sticks together very well and it's it's kind of deceiving some people have compared to like moon sand where I think that's the the sand that you would you know see it's kind of sticking to the battery spatula yeah it's kind of separated up so you can see how fine it is no debris up in there nice and light use ooh so this is pretty much what you're gonna do I mean you could use more material can get better returns but oh I'd rather instead of just getting one giant pile you know all the way out to here nice pile from it with the potential of some green I'd rather have a bunch of small miles of it perfectly colored when I see the difference the change in the color mint I can actually back cope with you so I'm gonna go ahead and do this process and I'll come back with you guys to kind of show you what I mean 100 K so I went ahead and did four different runs with the really nice quality one ninety or the one I need the seventy-three micron and that went ahead and did the same amount for different processes of about fifteen twenty second sifts with the hundred and ninety microns so let's go ahead and give you a gander you can see this is one I just did with you guys and each one is like became more of like a light tannish color you know not so much green so we didn't get any green that's good all this is a really good material and this is the one ninety and I went ahead and just put it together it's still really good material you know so it there dude I I'm seeing a little hair in there and I don't like when that happens we have dogs you guys be really meticulous about the location of where you make your ash cuz I can make a difference glass and the other kind of utensils that you're gonna use kind of draw through static electricity and I've got John those real fine hairs and then they become a part of your product and you have to freaking sift it out again anyways yeah this is what I got right here I went ahead and kicked it up to the next level and it's a 220 micron and what this is for is like a real vigorous shift and it's gonna have a lot of plant material very low present content but I'm gonna use it for capsules what I'll do is I'll take a finer quality hash that lower quality i'll decarboxylate which I'll explain more about that later the fine quality hash activate the trichomes in the way that we want and then also have the dietary benefits that come with the young carter decarboxylated form of plant material especially the higher plant material will have a lot of real good benefits for your dietary tracts and everything involved with it so check it out I'm gonna go ahead and get [ __ ] really going on this [ __ ] again even with the 220 I'm gonna wrap that [ __ ] up but this I'm gonna get a little bit harder and you can already hear it starting to become one solid sitting there too long I'm gonna just do this until almost all the planet Eire is gone for this last sip and those are perfect for the dietary supplement capsules so yes you guys this is awesome I'm glad you guys join me hopefully you know how to make a real basic form of hash and keep on following me because I'm just gonna do every method that I can of all the unique forms of extraction methods as well as some new up-to-date ones so yes have a good one it's up welcome to the head of the day I'm Danni cush just got done making some amazing dry ice hash the [ __ ] is just [ __ ] blonde delicious you can see it up in the bowl is just fantastic it's a 73 micron percolate filtered out process of just using the dry ice it's tears but no entered introductions of any solvents we don't introduce any kind of water so it's tough as pure and got so much terpenes I wish I could is you know show you the the smell because it's beyond the look but we got the Bozzio this girl needs a cleaning really badly but she hits like a mother let's go ahead and take a rib like slowly sleeping in there not even a little bit of a cup that stuff is so smooth oh man smooth as could be quality checked this shit's got an A+ I got a pack like four more of those because that [ __ ] was freakin delicious oh man we did a great job thanks for joining on the hit of the day kind of like testing out the product before I put it out you guys have a [ __ ] great one I'm Danny Kirsch Zeus oh yeah", "gPSigLUng7I": "is we

[Music] it was funny it was funny because uh i stopped clicking i see [ __ ] i'm done i don't have my dinner baby uh i said no moment one moment no panic i empty put in the cup start the heat up on the you know empty okay okay we good because i can't listen shake of this [ __ ] metal inside this was a little oh [ __ ] hey what's up zero fox how are you oh good brother you have problem with your stomach i hate that wait that um oh and you often uh i'm off work okay see you later brother do i use da vinci yes i use da vinci i've done really heavy testing on this too and next week hundred percent we have reviewed bad boys have you all day but 100 um [Music] and the first one be this one be the big one i'm really um [Music] what did you understand yeah i know make video and did you know how to make the most of your wheat and keep addition yeah um oh yeah with grinder i done i done this i done this video however what do we have we have edibles um i almost done today only i don't wake up my wife very early but tomorrow we have a video yes for edibles i use this grinder i don't use the same grinder with what i use for normal wheat for normal weed don't do that for the other balls find some cheap [Music] some nice cheap in the grinder plastic one and that is enough yes that in the monday uh after monday i should receive about ounce of grand of a purple haze and because of that i have enough in the [ __ ] to make zero as well that this be happened uh hopefully that designs must stay for me for hormones yeah it's i bought cheaper it cost me about 190 instead 200 240 that 50 pounds less kind of i can afford spend that on the one go that i must prefer to do that spread this for four weeks and survive you know um that we go yeah uh this is already nice grind you see this one is in there you have plenty of light and the little dark dark one this is not because it's overthink to death it's as well what kind of wheat you smoke and it's in the dark when the purple leaves and that or it's very light and later uh your um your stuff you see we have different colors uh that would be some despite be very light some a little darkness it's not meaning in the band it's meaning because of color of your flower sometimes can be darker now this is about one gram of maybe almost one gram i put more anyway one thing if you use vape wheat don't take this easily and oh [ __ ] whatever okay because it's vape wheat no this is activate [ __ ] and if you overdone this [ __ ] i promise you you have in the [ __ ] couple hours and the heart could go that this is no joke that's taken the slowly dropping the drop [ __ ] you know and then maybe in the half gram to you you're good maybe one gram the paint off as well what you smoke how strong is your wheat how look exactly your vape product what i'll be explaining this in the tomorrow on the my breakfast video with you um that yeah 100 times we do that um i'm pushing vape hardly on this channel because i think it's uh no i always throw away no bro the vape weed if you don't vape wheat to death to go black okay it's nice to have a color it still have [ __ ] a lot of things inside okay that is and now it depends okay if it's quite dark i'm lighter than better if you see still some people like vape you know very low temp and they stay alone green stuffs as well that what you do this you do if you use normal you use half gram of your product to do something you'll be use one gram that is one to two if it's not really and it's much darker you must use maybe one two three or one two four that for one gram of wheat you'll be used two grams or three grams or maybe four grams if it's very very you know hard only i don't recommend that you should use it really nicely and the golden toast um the wheat now and this time you do one one to two that it's in the one gram of wheat two grams of that and trust me you can make tea from this you can make uh you can make fire crackers you can make edibles because you can infuse with butter i infuse with coconut oil this [ __ ] it's killer only instead i infuse 10 grams i infuse 20 or 30 grams of product to give the same potency would be normal that this is huge advantage what vaping exactly give you on the wrong way around maybe one time per week and the vape have session the weekend i think you know that it's no be not impact for you you don't be see quick impact however if you you've made if you want to smoke about 100 dollars worth wheat weekly example and calculation is very simple half gram of wheat would you be raw joint it's about 0.1 of a i'm serious it's [ __ ] crazy give it the same effect what half ground give you 1.8 if you know what you do now you already see different that instead to smoke for example i don't know 100 grams per week it's crazy you smoke richly less people today i've done five dinnerwaves would give me a quadrant of half gram of flour half gram of flour this is kind okay john this joint don't be [ __ ] me up that way like [ __ ] me up this after five times you on every each way three three clicks yeah you can have easy in the free sessions on instead between every session stare your your wheat this is another things what people make mistake with vaporizers i don't give [ __ ] how good your vaporizers is with you don't need still here because what different way however with normal big vaporizers never mind is this one on the halfway sash i like exactly open this and they do a little steady inside and close down and they go again you have more vape more flavor with nice you know mix again everything you nice vape that this is important and i don't care how good your vaporizer is you do that and you straight away your sessions be much better as well you must learn how to vape technique of vaping is completely different and then taking the bunk or taking the pipe or smoke joint it's a completely different story hey debbie ah they're in vegas how are you hello you'll never be if you take this let me open this widely i love this with that floor oh man love it now if you go that way you're the [ __ ] there is ah this don't work people the best way steady and every device works little different on here the steady slowly you empty your lungs you take this every 10 seconds this is way how you do later on don't anyway if you go on the 10th don't go straight away today wait wait another [ __ ] 30 seconds wait don't wait give the time to exactly devise and the condensate all [ __ ] and this time take slowly rip and you discover how and the quality of your weight whatever vapor you use be much better and your experience with vaping be ten times better only people this is highlight that about this we'll be talking the next time on hours and the i think i must do in the ibm the create what i do people i think that is the best um i don't do extra another extra lives on the middle order because we have hours and the kind of half hour one hour my vlog daily vlogs would i be connect maybe from nature you know if it's nice weather i go in the park and i have little chat with you uh that will be do that as well however i think every second week or one time instead to do a harsh friday okay we'll be doing the vape friday okay and we discuss all hours in the ship what is in the paper related okay new devices and how work how to use and everything with vape related and the stuff i use vape wheat and you know and all another way and i think that'd be in the great and i think you'll be like that as well um it's up to you people it's really up to you yeah three sessions are giggling in the to death yeah man it's it's a really good device you know uh it's maybe not the best on the market however it's good device and we talk about g5 but it's it's here it's behind in the city i love my cookies video yeah you know virus be finished i'll be back to kitchen for now nhl thank you mao for your hard work to help people you're welcome i have this uh this tool what i have this tu da vinci um micro and uh iq2 this is uh this was by the i was in the following subscriber and big brother one love dre that uh one one lord durand sent me to review this stuff um because i i can afford this these two together cost almost 400 people uh that this one be costly about 230 240 pounds uh however ganja nana you must remember something and i began to mention this as well this one is about 130. uh now and it's really almost the same it's almost really the same and the micro and the big one is different it's in the smaller lower battery what i'm not really happy with battery life uh honey it's how is i say this isn't the work with your dog um oh yeah uh this big shout out for uh for my brother you know i never can afford this stuff that was sent to me and i have big

independent and uh reviewer i don't i refuse every each connection with companies and because i do that i can leave you for thing for company if you want sent me i can review that it's no problem however it's no deal it's no coupons it's no links it's all another [ __ ] i review products and i do this independent with no pressure from company or from someone else only because i don't do that because i think i must be honest with you end of the day this is not about company this is about you my viewers my subscribers people would follow and watch my reviews and i think this very very seriously what i do and you know that people maybe it's not the great rabies what you can see however i take this very very seriously to thinking and the things it's really worth with your money and i try find very often cheap way stuff that ended g5 to exactly give opportunity to people what that and me don't have allowed a lot of money not really can spend for that you know i have choice i can buy maybe this or buy back of wheat what i really need to do because if i don't smoke my body go crazy it's my medicine um it's it's not that you know it's it's he's [ __ ] [ __ ] up i must really have to be applied for kanaka uh i have at least three [ __ ] sickness and they were well well they can stay away the [ __ ] goal yeah one day brother now it's of course uh mr job how are you what's my favorite food um i love i don't know i'm cheap guy i like burgers i like good burgers and good steaks i like vegetarian as well honey i really like good steak but i really like good burgers and i like make good burgers i'm master with risotto by the way i am really a good risotto i'm mastering this [ __ ] and i'm good with loss however i think uh yeah nice love the uh the budget is good time yeah you know and um you know it's that i try to do my [ __ ] and the best how i can to and to show you stuff that because of the one love dre and the module and many other people and the mr norman i can exactly in dubai and show you you know i can show you and uh shuttered from goods and paypass from goods and that people this [ __ ] you have it because of your donation on this channel what is every time in there i don't spend this for myself i spend this for this channel uh to make [ __ ] for you to make reviews for you you know uh he simply is that and thank you click show all playlists [Laughter] you know and and he's done and because of you and because of the people wanting to help me and do this i can ever i can review for your stuff and and as well this is what i say i never you buying the illegal [ __ ] i never live by normal wheat or whatever uh from this everything what i buy it's in the hundred percent legal from the donations that whatever vape and that all what it's illegal i never we buy illegal understand uh it's it's kind of in there yeah i think under my wheat i can buy myself you know um it's kind of uh i oh you like african food i like moroccan food or chickpeas and sweet potato tagines and the fukusos i'm [ __ ] master and you don't need to believe me i can send you under my uh if you my in the moroccan headshot nearby for the moment we tell you hey maoti cook and the [ __ ] american food like my mother and this is his words i can laugh and say bro this [ __ ] tastes like my [ __ ] say how the [ __ ] polish person can cook so well moroccan cuisine i'm good with kali as well i don't know why i have quite good balance with spices i know how to deal with [ __ ] uh what is weird because i'm polish that i shouldn't have completely nothing to do with this honey i think i have good teachers uh good headshots with um and i like watch how people cook [ __ ] and improve is every time i another hatch of love from you say [ __ ] hell i look at you is that a madness only you know what it's everything done and everything perfect and only must be your way i don't say i [ __ ] i improve here and say yeah it's true exactly i say hey you know i think because i learned how to work myself and that is anyway oh nice i never tried really in the african african african you know middle africa and the food mall in the arab arabic world do we have nice ball of critical and yeah the cannabis would have a lot of [ __ ] a lot of in the cbd oh uh extensive by the way um by the way uh it's um what i do and this helped me because i'm flowing with sleep sometimes and i have problems with migraines and for me the sleep of migraine is the best way that what i do and maybe this will help you as well um you know i mix my shutter with cbd the best way is you mix with isolate okay what is known it stays less and that's it it's pure cbd that you taken the full spectrum roads and wax whatever you have and the shovel [ __ ] for one gram one to one and shovel all [ __ ] cbd and the [ __ ] together and mix together and take dab of that because i know you take uh i don't know you take dubs or not and dub this and put me down straight away to sleep i don't know what he is sitting with sativas if you put cbd on [ __ ] exactly put you down because high thc and high cbd together create something what not only make you high or strong make you [ __ ] sleepy and you go straight away and uh sleep yeah i'm serious brother i have mixed this i take this dab and it's madness that um if you don't do this way what i recommend for you having the knives and the cbd drops smoke your [ __ ] wheat that you smoke because i know you smoke and later take couple drops before you sleep because you go sleep in the cbd and this exactly should put you down only find cbd which is create to calm you down on the night time many companies would sell now cbd products and exactly tell you it's good for relaxation that'd be good for sleep or you said the more to do something you know cbd products exactly can work very similar that and weed instead of high you have mobilization or you have relaxation okay you're not high that is what is advantage of cbd products people by the way for all haters of cbd yeah here we go make you so happy yeah and it's not yeah of course this was cbd do uh i've done testing on myself that i know because i have the same people problem don't get me wrong at least i used to listen cbd and i said well i like my [ __ ] full spectrum not a little [ __ ] you know um and then one day i say you know [ __ ] it i must check this what the [ __ ] is going on with this [ __ ] and i don't smoke normally weed i can't myself break for good week to totally smoke in there you know normal staff come back home and smoke him and they do and the cbd [ __ ] see [ __ ] this calm me down and you know after i think of the three days using um three four days i start to recognize i say okay this stuff can me i'm more than the cool and that okay you know and step by step i start to understand because problem is if you smoke weed cannabis and to swap yourself for cbd [ __ ] yeah you feel nothing because you forgot and that this calmness what you have with high coming high high cover up come that and you go on the nice and calm and relax you know it's covered up this that we forgot about that and they and later you don't recognize this and after saying [ __ ] he's really making me come it's quite interesting and i really like [ __ ] however i'm not fan of flower you know that i'm not fan of pen flowers what's up honey oh you go crazy without yeah get depressed if you don't smoke i i think that the most important is if you don't smoke do something do something good i know the most of us and whatever we do is related with smoking anyway because we smoke with whatever we do however do something start painting drawing sewing stitching niching whatever do something and that help you and yes i know however sometimes it's how is that he's good as well to have this you know say hey okay i don't have it [ __ ] it you know let's do it something what's up lily how are you how you doing hello hello much love to you i don't use wheat for fun i use for medical reasons and for sacrament you go church and you eat and the you know body of jesus i in the smoke body of jesus smoke that [ __ ] bro you know and because i smoke stuff i spiritually i connect with john you know with nature what is what is funny people i watch in the recently and the amazing interview an amazing one and the guy what is in there is uh make work scientists what works on the mushrooms and fungus you know when they we film founders we all related things i'm the fungus and fungus talked to another fungus watch me it's [ __ ] crazy i talked today with my wife with a little walk and i talked about this exactly and uh fungus created this world under us and on top of us what we walk let's give one beacon the message network surrounded whole enter the world is everywhere it's one to ten for every each plant if you can't okay it's crazy if you think about this i have conscious but i know it's difficult to understand um i haven't the [ __ ] problem to wrap it up this [ __ ] about however what is interesting if you eat fungus created exactly i always got it's [ __ ] mushroom look it's the same without his brain uh we know in about six uh six hundred thousand years ago i was playing or whatever and there was bank under something and i think that i was developing brainwashed within the two two million years and the developed rapidly uh eats because of mushroom because of people [ __ ] eat mushroom magic you know if you have experience with magic magnum you know that and ubc and the structures and geometry things and with different colors and completely different shapes and amazing things okay now every time i have problem to how in the people discover mathematics how in the people in the discover the shape and create [ __ ] now i know this is magic mushrooms what created the new rose and your brain and the two and the neutrons and that making the new and the connections and all [ __ ] and that exactly different love you as the better person it's amazing study people um amazing study and guy was [ __ ] crazy having the mushroom huh really well in the [ __ ] heart for a mushroom not to look in the [ __ ] mushroom on the head you know no i was crazy normally you know that forest style man that you know you hunter and the forest and the germany uh it's done in the from it's pesticide uh it's in the leaf on the polish people we call this hubba i don't remember in the english word for this mushroom it's in the grow on the tree and you see that on the one side big heart every time and from that exactly you can make leather and from this you can make clothes it's [ __ ] it's quite can easy to flame however you can make it uh it's crazy that people here yeah yeah yeah no exactly magic mushrooms and help you with many and if you have if you have uh mental problems you have uh you have the phobias and then you're scared by the things and that exactly in the mushroom therapy can help you what mushrooms do it's reset your brain you know when the people what can talk if it's scary go it's that and the you have in the king speech i i don't know what for this and you can say [ __ ] okay you start distressing that you can look at people's eyes you look down and you have people with problem to express now these people can sing these people can do another thing can talk with another person now often exactly magic mushroom can help this person of course this must be done within the uh yeah yeah uh this can be in there uh of course this should not should be done in the yourself this should it should done with and you know a psychologist and and to know about mushrooms and that and they do in the proper way you don't [ __ ] up yourself you want to cure yourself and what has happened some type of mushrooms exactly can reset your [ __ ] and you can start speaking normal way immediately or at least much better what's up hey michelle how are you my love it's crazy it's crazy what mushrooms exactly can do for us mushrooms people want undertaker taken the one-time mushrooms per life it's in the less possibility to be making the violent crime be in the stolen things make arson and other things because mushroom open your mind mushrooms the showy we all connect we all the same we very connect and they give you and the more empathy because i think that the mushrooms show you how death look as well that give you empathy and understanding to what life is mean and i think if you used to understand what life is mean you'll be respecting other people's life that um i don't know i don't want [ __ ] with this i know some people say it's good and that i didn't for me i'm cool within the mushrooms and that [ __ ] uh people by the way be careful with lsd in the uk don't [ __ ] buy [ __ ] it's no real lsd this is something what work like lsd and he's coming from from [ __ ] china going to spain and spain going here and yeah you have parts and all [ __ ] this is no real lsd don't if you won't have the tree go in the [ __ ] collect mushrooms or you know someone having their knowledge with mushrooms of course don't kill your [ __ ] self uh i'm serious he it's no [ __ ] be careful doesn't go whatever whatever work for you you know i know because it's no look people that long and the wheat and the psychoactive supplements that and the mushrooms don't be in the legalized and i don't understand why uk used to have mushroom and you can use mushrooms normal until 2004 you can in the normal go in the shop and buy [ __ ] mexican mushrooms mushroom whatever [ __ ] mushroom you want okay um no problem whatsoever and the blair say oh no people can show them inc okay what really [ __ ] up because it's how it is now make now market what in there you have in the later summers and that this make you [ __ ] crazy and now we have the fake lsd what the [ __ ] and we have fake cannabis what is spray normal cannabis is spraying with faith in the cannabinoids not happy with that and i think we shouldn't be and it's funny because it's very quiet and the media wise i think someone should and they do and they blow the [ __ ] out if i'm honest because we and we go this and it's not and yeah you know thank you for information or whatever no [ __ ] that it's no thank you for information this must be spread in the world and this should be in the real push to exactly use as the weapon to legalize cannabis do you understand this this is how is the biggest opportunity what we have do you understand that stick in the uk it's coming at the fake the synthetic wheat what is the real weed low grade spray with [ __ ] fake cannabinoids people sell you as this [ __ ] as the real weed think about how big you must you yeah you must you must remember this isn't the cause this is not about us as well hey this be big problem for nature for the healthcare and the people being they go in the [ __ ] deep [ __ ] when you find space for these people what you do you [ __ ] legalize no i'm serious this because annoyed me this i i don't like people harm himself and they don't know about you know uh that is nice that people are i'm serious oh like all that oh sexy every time kill you this is what i like with this bite you can make you can make up this [ __ ] this will work well yep that's people i really beg you spread this information tell the people to be careful the best way is if you buy your wheat and you think it's funky put under your tongue touch little your tongue if you start under your tongue start bubbling bustling and the start sometimes happens start little bubbling and they give you flavor it's it's special don't don't need me in this spray within the [ __ ] and um if you be on display with fake tea see very often we give you um very dazzling funky flavor on the yotan you'll be you'll be thinking tinkling yeah that is space [ __ ] and you shouldn't straight away you should split this and the face of the [ __ ] dealer will sell you the [ __ ] okay straight away in his face and slap him now if you taste you put under your wheat in your mouth you touch your tongue you should taste nothing if you taste sweet it's meaning can be sugar if you taste and something stay on your tongue and it's very that funny krabi this besant or talk a couple days ago didn't i call but then they think i'll be in the getting out getting in the banner to maximizing uh i think oh nice yeah i must try one day this is the the coils hey hey how are you uh shot caller i see you see you hello hello hello high five to you brother that people uh really understand this information it's i i think it's uh it's important um you know or you take your back hit couple times and the track down on your back if you see in the little and the brownie and the [ __ ] [ __ ] or you see in the sandy yeah this is santa brick inside that remember about that it's not very often happened now it's more than the be the sizzling [ __ ] taste on your town but this is special you you don't want this smoke hey you can [ __ ] smoke what you want however i don't be touched the [ __ ] i'd be going the straight way to the guy would send me this take my money beat him up and go and call police i'm serious i'd be snitch on [ __ ] i'd be literally snitch on him you know why because sell you [ __ ] what claim is cannabis and not and it's harm you and addict you to [ __ ] and that is no [ __ ] bueno [ __ ] you it simply is that i'm gone what's happening oh psychotic episode on the fake wit yeah shocking stuff yeah i know this is my point people why you can breathe what's up another different yeah um i never be snitched on no one however this [ __ ] you i beat you up and i snitch on you that double [ __ ] yeah mold yeah how you check okay if you take your wheat right you have your wheat take your wheat whatever okay and you can of course look at around you can smell mostly spray [ __ ] smell a little weird that and later what you do you touch for one moment your tongue wheat really shouldn't give you flavor if your turn start buzzing that and my now it's meaning it's afraid not by don't pass me and if you start in the buzzing funny it's almost nothing that you know you'll be putting the lemon or something um that is meaning his budget and you shouldn't no don't [ __ ] smoke the [ __ ] that touch it and if you feel nothing it's no flavor we don't give you flavor on taste because don't rock with water and that is way to do it if i get more than 5g off in the key from one ounce or from the purple haze they will be in the serious problem now just

don't know to what's on some hash and it's funny because if you saw someone say me and oh i watch your video how you making the hash and that that you know it's only one gram of something because mostly we make that for reviews and i don't make more really um i don't answer this question because i don't want um i think i say that i think that this and someone won't be vaccinated or not is he saying the private is his publisher he simply because i understand and some people is very pro some people it's very negative and i don't want clear situations and the people be bitching around one way or another you know it's simply that that for me yeah you know uh this isn't no i don't want to talk about this if i must be honest i i really don't want to talk about this hey mr victor how are you oh do you have cheese for oh yeah i don't remember the last time i have it uh mr blue how are you mr seven what's up how are you doing and mr sido i'm good i'm good yeah that was exactly coco ah coco go snacking something [ __ ] up no i don't i don't answer this i'm i don't answer people what i don't know and uh sticky with weird explanations um i'm sorry it's it's that's in there you know i don't you know you never know and every time i say i'm not dealer i don't i never deal with cannabis i never sell [ __ ] no one this is what i show you it's and for my personal use this is what i make and that that hand hash so i make a lozen it's sticky for my personal use and that is my rules because i i cannot check this i make it the solo amount you know one gram maybe from something uh somewhere other than that however i never be give someone this not because he's illegal he's not about that i know it's safe however this is not a lab check and i don't i never retake on my conscience and for me a responsibility and someone be used something would i make and they make him sick or not good that [ __ ] no i i can i teach people how to do how to do syrup how to do cannaba how to make hash you know what tools you should use what vaporizers and there is good or not good how you should vaporize why this is good and then another thing and then you and the flowers to you know and exist and maybe one day you see and you decide the bike whatever what you do what you decide to do is for you that i'm here and sometimes people undertaken the very wrong leaders and i'm not dealer i'm sorry yeah be nice if you isn't that we live in the uk it's illegal place and i have dispensary and i can sit there and have live stream and talk with you and whatever and say yeah man i have that i have this i have that in the world i think youtube don't be like that we must be go on the twitter or or something like this on facebook yeah man pop up you know it simply is that oh you're my subscribers you have discount it's not i'm at the independent reviewer that this work opposite way you sent me [ __ ] and i reviewed this for you yeah it's educational information maybe yeah and if you you you bc and description very often what i do i say i don't selling and i don't promote use any of production on using drugs i don't promote to make rosin i only say it's possible to do you get it people it's only that no i don't want it i don't need this sometimes under like expressing the because look many often that i was guys in the know-how is and they know this uh only some new one don't uh flower is in the purple hey his brother this genie hand leaks you know by the way who don't know yeah i know that germany market is completely [ __ ] up yeah yeah of course thc yeah i know that i don't do uh i i don't do and the uh hem flowers i don't like him flowers i'm not no i'm it's not that i don't like i'm not big fan of this tendency and yeah he's [ __ ] up um or this tendency would go and the very high potency of cbd flowers because this is destroy your [ __ ] [ __ ] and it's very often as well and they're sprayed within the isolate that why i won't smoke that no i want in there if i want hemp flour i don't want to have higher cbd and five protein so i can tell you enough why because at least being the [ __ ] the good [ __ ] taste that's what i say that if you you never uh you never smoke hash in your life don't buy onstage most of time what is good or not only because i start in the 31 years ago and the smoking [ __ ] and the harsh okay this was 32 years ago that's my [ __ ] my experience with with wheat was harsh what i've got okay you know it's quite easy if you you must light up [ __ ] and you take a little path and you'll be nostalgic if you a person will smoke hard you'll be no this is harsh or not you've been on the way if you take path you know how harsh stays and everything what it's it is the same with the the hemp it stays a little different that you know they were different as well it's not that you can cheat me with hands whatever below can say this is normal [ __ ] it's not happening i can't recognize [ __ ] if you're not from look from taste 100 why because i spent a lot of time with her i love hash i make hash that i know how [ __ ] should look now with wheat as well if you're not quite sure you're weak you do understand and say okay maybe a little buzzing i'm not quite sure maybe i'm paranoid okay put in the pipe and take part now if your path be at the funky being the very end the kick your troll and they're very in the [ __ ] you know be it you almost throw very coffee [ __ ] it's spray don't take this [ __ ] that is no good weed if it's not spray its meaning is not good flush out as well not no good as well because what is happening you smoke all in the [ __ ] hemi colors what someone don't wash off and proper way and they produce cannabis in the first place that is [ __ ] anyway that people be conscious it's couple ways to do it for me advice is have good plaque goof connection have nowhere plant is from finding the local growers don't buy from lebanon [ __ ] big bugs off in the [ __ ] hemp or of the low quality and the haze let's play with [ __ ] you know i'm quite happy we on the log down because it's nothing coming really in the from outside now it's much difficult i know my wife played with coco you know that this is to protect us that we have [ __ ] what is here i don't be buying this you know [ __ ] with all this smell beautiful and oh it's crazy because make uh jamaican zombie people nothing you think you go home you're thinking that you have not talked [ __ ] and you get paranoia bro and you go ape shield and you dumb some people trying to explain oh you know because it's the mind of the [ __ ] that is [ __ ] you sell this [ __ ] and you don't tell people what is inside you say oh it's strong [ __ ] come on if you don't know you never smoke passion you won't cry no recommend go in the places and you can legal by her and this time do it no another way i'm serious i'm oh stop it what [Music] come here come on hello everyone [ __ ] glory you can grow legally [ __ ] and we're not allowed to smoke [ __ ] this is horrible [ __ ] people don't use this baby how undervalued the popular and the guy with cannabis industry as well and they slap the name under some shitty chinese product and they make money many many many many many many [ __ ] many many money that is the [ __ ] up because i think in the look do they at least do proper [ __ ] headphones i'm not really fun i must prefer boss however you know hates comments or scammers it's all look on the on instagram every day and we follow me and a good four or five and i block [ __ ] uh i'm not interesting and you know what it's funny problem is with this i have photographic memory okay could you stop because of the it's going in the naughty and the b and go crazy here you're playing with her okay um and you know what because i have photographic memory i remember pictures and i seen the ten different names with the same picture of the same plants yeah i know it's it's funny you know and they it's so legit bro and they're so good hey bro i find my pictures in the [ __ ] there i reported this [ __ ] this time i find my on the [ __ ] picture and there was was used as the [ __ ] face of the guys what the [ __ ] i'm serious that this is the biggest [ __ ] up [Music] yeah i know everywhere unfortunately no lives yeah i know that this is the [ __ ] up in it sticky now you think you know how many

easily funny why are you nothing okay apparently you should be sick i think your your wife stares in the ground at and very well i'm more than happy oh now you're tired oh it's okay this this is tiger no yuka is not on the table i [ __ ] i don't touch her now hey hey jake jake what's up it's all good chilling i don't want one day and i think two days ago in the morning i get out i walk to and the room and sit away in the stump inside the [ __ ] head so up yeah welcome to cartwork i have a good night i have a good time we have good time here like always music and you can find something here you can you don't find this [ __ ] anywhere else i can promise you though people are we going well another and a half hour or 35 minutes and we have three hours and we'll be done not that i say and this fridays and hours uh live streams it's quite longer than normal one what we have in the middle of week that for everyone what we really want to catch up with mao you better do notifications uh because i go into different times this friday is only really set for eight o'clock three hours straight on special for you i think next week because ibm the hundred percent we have video about uh about uh davinci that big da vinci is coming vaporizer hundred percent uh this bee and i'm ready i'm almost ready for this review um and i have opinion about about this product but i'm quite happy about that now um friday what i want to do we have think we'll be skipping the hush friday and we do hours and the day friday tonight you know what i mean that's vape night and uh and we have a little talk about vaporizers and um as well in the why really in the bay is better in the than smoking weed and not about you know health benefits because it's not only about that it's really uh isn't about your pocket benefits every time if you uh you liken the smoke quite a lot of ganja and you won't cut down on smoke a lot of ganja and you don't lose you know the same quality of your high i think in the vaping it's beautiful option for you because you'll be smoking 75 less vaping oh yes and i think it's an interesting subject and i highly recommend uh i shouldn't say that on youtube only if i can't recommend for people would never uh i don't recommend davinci this is not [ __ ] for you so i can tell you now with no disrespect for no one this is not for you for people what liking the transit from smoking to vaping i think the best option be under this because give you more than the vapor and the more vape with easiest way to do and to give you more vapor what mostly this would put us off from stuff he said that don't give you vapor and don't give you because some don't and some because we do wrong way and i think this device is perfect to learn how to then a vape can be in there as well and therefore you know uh for me this is device and they're for pro guys for passionate for everyone you can do many things with this and that is beauty and we talk about this many times um only in the four people within the first time and that they and want to try vape i think this is things what after three days using with your click and different way heat uh all heat mass coming on in between you know this part not top not here not here here this one is important however i mean make video about this um now for this shirt you need three days and you're good you really know how this work and you really know and you like or not now after a while you can say [ __ ] i wanted to more experience i want to take more medicine um what they can do and yeah this time you can upgrade yourself maybe to davinci not in this one maybe for something else maybe for parks whatever you know for volcano it's all about under your pocket maybe under something that but it's very nice beautifully sinky having the aromatherapy inside container as well what is beautiful for use as well and to put your wheat and you have more flavor it's coming that's many beautiful things in this device however to really use this and their full full full potential of this product of this vaporizer i use this what two weeks now the second week what i use and i still you know i still go with i'm not quite i'm not yet you know take full potential i know and i don't know [ __ ] about this yet i know that if i use them the good half yeah i'd be no more and i'll be in the you know fly with this and then do this mod that mode and they will do this and that way because you learned what with this one it's really different it's more advanced vaping it's more to go really into to take that all [ __ ] what you want from cannabis because you must remember people moment and i like smoke i smoke with you now it's not meaning i you know i don't be vape uh now moment that you light up you do this before you exactly inhale shed half is already gone you been already half [ __ ] good [ __ ] oh there you go and he still is going because you bend this [ __ ] constantly and you heat up and it's going you don't constantly [ __ ] keep and smoke the same is with bunks because he's in the quick ban that the heat very intensive heat the same with harsh whatever if you put heat now with vaping what is happening you start from low because slowly heat up that start vaporizing all this vaporize what is its condense don't go anywhere don't go in the air it's keep inside chamber that you take all the flavor all the tabs of the cbd that and the some devices that in this davinci big one exactly have mold what gives you in the from low for 80 minutes it's set for eight minutes now giving the it started going from very low very low temp give you all new flavor no vapor whatsoever going higher higher and higher go to 420 to completely undervape everything what you have that this way you'll be vape all [ __ ] every each cbd cbd uh cvc cbg [ __ ] th cthca and they all [ __ ] okay and they behave enough time to heat up and to take all this and you take all goodness that on that wise it's big advantage of the vape compared to smoking it simply is that it harm soil he eats science people only not everyone like it not everyone can transit and it's not for everyone and i get it and you know some people like some don't and i have this problem i can turn this and for me i think in the g5 give me interest the smoke this small vapor give me interest to vaping back to vaping and dinner vape or dinner this gives me completely pleasure and today i spent all day exactly first in the use have little search with da vinci and the later i have all day in the dynavape because it's much easier for me to use um and i can use less weed and yeah i was little as [ __ ] i smoked no joints no sleep i was today all this is my second and the split with you uh i don't i've been on the dinner paper and they moved my ass big time um that yeah you know that i get it it's a little different high you wait little on your blog if you're over down vaping you go [ __ ] sleep i can tell you that because you take all [ __ ] goodness it's worth little different way uh and i really enjoyed to do and that's what i think it's in that it's happened with sticky with dynav you know yeah i remember time so i can afford in the full joint uh no i mix with yogurt or you can yeah you can make tea with yogurt is the quickest way you can make the uh fire crackers you can make edibles you can make everything don't be in your vape what i miss here because i know this one shot in the [ __ ] goal frieza miser let me refresh myself here yeah after then they have getting the nice and the weight sleep yeah after making whatever i don't do everything i do sometimes it's not something what i must do every day you know and i don't be vape and uh by the way you know the da vinci is not good for for walks i'm sorry like most of uh like most of vaporizers what work food do i have i'm sorry this [ __ ] you see problem is that i think about this problem is with design you need really to this work you need two chambers not use the same chamber to heat up these two things you need two different chambers and the same device simultaneously and you need two airflows separate one for every heat chamber and i think that is problem because this device beam was quite big if would that be happened now this is only solution this time this should be work because you can put more power this time in the for one chamber you can vape spontaneously both it's exactly exists that vapor only it's in the table vapor or desk vapor whatever you want you don't carry this this beautiful wooden one would have in the darker inside board and separately you can duck you can do spontaneously in the bowl or you can do separately white and it's beautiful because you have the two different and the um the earth and the channels would go what is very important and this is way to do people um and if you and some vaporizers company watch me that is direction what you should go if you really want make this [ __ ] be in the for both things work well and perfectly and people be happy with dabbing not low temp [ __ ] okay the vape pen work [ __ ] stronger than this i'm serious now it's only one solution two airflows that you have in the one to go to two separate chambers and two heaters only this should be bigger this this should be that so i can tell you now only this is only one option it's no another option to do it because you need space as well for two batteries this don't be work on one so i can promise you that this we go off [ __ ] after one session uh that that product must be in the quite good and how i know that this be work because don't forget people are coming from [ __ ] vape okay i'm vaping normal [ __ ] that i know how the [ __ ] and work and it's no big difference between this and this i know how much battery take power and how much heaters take power and all you know it's the resistance and that how much come on you have coil around and surrounded this ship you know hey no no no no um that the people it's how it is that and i think uh we need to go in the china design baby yeah that is about that yeah uh joint i smoke joint and luffka you know this glass pipe for smokey what in the america people see us no crack no crack no it's not crack bro we use this for wheat um not that way that lufka was lufka or [ __ ] uh peppers because in the poland pipe what you can buy was only metal [ __ ] [ __ ] a wooden one would i hate with passion metal one it's only and uh is for my heart this one long conception is that's it or would they want to claim uh with clay in the bowl my pipe can be clay or glass no wood and no metals i don't like it it's stationary yeah yeah the most popular [ __ ] device del lufka what used to people use for oh thank you lady thank you very much take care and much love to you and the big respect every time people what i go about this is so [ __ ] annoying i go back i put my water you know take shower later put water and they relax japanese style people you know first you take shower you wash your ass and later you put hot water in your mouth until you lay down and you relax yourself you don't go the empty to water and you wash your ass until later you take get out you still think now what i see little white the [ __ ] pope open sometimes with the full walk and go up in the check what's happened you know i'd be sitting look at me i don't say and they as well in the end of the toilet because toilet hat toilet is in the hours toilet you run the toilet you sit on toilet and what cats decide to do say oh [ __ ] you know why not i do [ __ ] with you and trust me you'll do race who finish first because you don't always smell the [ __ ] this time you see and that is in the [ __ ] vile it's so funny and we sit on you and look at the eyes oh my god why now [Laughter] so far because your face direction and you look a cut cut look at you and you know cut your feelings [ __ ] with the making the face of the the moustache it's going it's so [ __ ] fun i love her i know this is disgusting what i say now and trust me people it's crazy it's [ __ ] crazy that i love them that have great day my love really rose and thank you very much and thank you all of you people for your support uh uh whatever you know you you with me you putting the fun up uh or or you watch me you know when the people will subscribe me and that and then you put in the comments that i read everything uh because i know and that is what i do have sense to do that longer the one person watch me they appreciate is what i do i think they have the sense for me to do it you know and if i can help to sometimes to choose good device and for you or show you how to do two things to make your life easier you know to explain you why the vape community uh we're laughing for in the film and the smoking communities i talk about hair vape humidity because we know how much more [ __ ] we can do with our sweet i only say it you know well i don't like bones it's capabilities behind that um one with the most important reason it's in the taste i must be change water i must be changed i must be changed water for every each ball of what i do and you know that taking one ball smoking the ball with your wrong and smell later on your water and you taste it and for me it's not i don't like bones it's inconvenient for me it's because i must be changed i must be moved every 10 minutes my ass to fill up [ __ ] bonk to change water and i don't like that this one is the biggest no-no for me uh you don't have problem with in the pipe uh with this and that if i be used i'd be using the glass pipe hundred percent you know that i have my gravel small in the spoon pipe and another one little bigger one you know it's it's simply it simply is that you see with with doubts little different your water is flavored you don't want to change your water you know because that'll be flavored and your doubts and later you take another dab and then you start be more flavored and exactly give you flavor water after dabs give you flavor it's completely different um and i think that is my the biggest argument with with bulbs and another argue is and i have cart i have bonks people don't send me wrong it's [ __ ] you see glass here i know it's two dub legs and it's one exactly it's one bubbler which isn't it's glass it's for flour there you go but you haven't the little little [ __ ] that you have and i must be clean um i might i must buy the alcohol but yes honey i'm not fun i'm not really like to use it's messy it's [ __ ] a lot of to clean i don't like in the use yellow glass and as well i have cut and cut it's no bonk friendly you know that this oh dog dog is very often not bonk friendly you know tail go big dog [ __ ] me tail our boy and the water from bunk on your carpet [ __ ] change carpet it's disgusting um that no no that that that is my uh for i'm not really fan of bunks however i'm okay with pipes you know that people i'm okay with vibes it's no problem for me whatsoever [Music] i think i must roll a new one packing your old days where i never need to hide my shirt i i just under my shirt in pocket because in the poland you can't have it you can smoke you only can buy or grow that used towards law you see i'm quite old now what do you think doing now leaving my cat smoke now yeah i know that this changed the 2000 after 2000 the law was changed this was crazy time i'm serious we're used to cutting in the jars full of wheat open on the street uh i never forgot to used to sometimes in the to pub with my homies where we can go it's coming in the little hippie guy and smoke with everyone people i have in the park inside pub in poland 90s and this is a real story we sit with my friends i take off my bunk i put a bunk on the table i used to use box as well this time we smoke this [ __ ] we drink beer department is coming take off glasses put up a bunk white table and cook bonk down and to walk off no question asked i'm [ __ ] serious could you imagine that scenty that used to waste poland i smoke in the pub [ __ ] week i used to roll [ __ ] joints on content [Music] open and light up [ __ ] that what we talking about you know maltese and the his [ __ ] jeep yeah here we go ganja yeah this is my point this what we used to do you can only dream about people and that is true and that is exactly true statement what we do 90s you can only dream we have more freedom speech we have more freedom to do whatever [ __ ] we want look people exercising was [ __ ] legal come on 80s 90s was [ __ ] crazy only you know i don't remember very 80s because i'm [ __ ] from 1974 i bought that you know i was yeah okay on the you know the 90 i was about 14. that in the from 90s i start you know and then the first time i smoked wheat i was 14 that this wasn't the 99 i know you can't give me the first dude foreign it will change never we come back to that and we have this is this forgot it this is what we have in the 90s and 80s 90s you'll never be here now it never can happen you know that you can you can play for who you want you know this never happened you never look people no government on this earth give you freedom what already take from you or you freely give because scare your ass off and say i don't know if we don't do that it is bad people can come i say oh my god do everything what you need you can do everything about me this is our fault as well because we we believe all [ __ ] what we listen regardless it's true or not that long you don't check for your [ __ ] self you'll never be known you know that people i don't tell you this [ __ ] you know that you hear that you must know this media newspapers it's in the negativity and uh [Music] portrait calories it's more interesting putting news openly news and [ __ ] someone beat up someone because of the smoked strong canvas and instead to saying that someone exactly help someone because of small candidates you see this is for it's not that they lie you only don't say your whole story and i think that is always the biggest problem uh we still live and uh if people it's still in the uk i meet many people in my life educate people would finish medicine okay medic universities and they don't know [ __ ] about cannabis tell you cbt it's bad for you tell you and they all you know cbd and the letter connected to this cannabis you know and you're done and you listen this and you look at this person and you say are you nurse and you work exactly for nhs and you work with then uh drug count and uh department or not commanding helping our community and you don't know [ __ ] about you get it people and that opened my eyes and this opened my eyes and uh still and the people many people don't know [ __ ] about me and ours job is to talk about this not do stupid things but then you cannot with joints and mcdonald's and they're sure i'm so freaky i can take the piss i can smoke this [ __ ] everywhere okay um it's more to educate people and say hey i don't do this for fun because it's not for fun if you think cannabis is for fun that it's not here it's not your place it's too important plant to be degraded to the same category with alcohol and on my watch on this channel this never [ __ ] happens you know that it's too important plant oh yeah that people these three hours go so quick we have another we have another three

week or one time per month we'll be doing the vape one uh i won't do this way because i wanted the more people to really in the involved with the vaping of dry helps i think it's more healthy for you it's more effective it's more in the safe and the your money i stick and now you know everyone losing jobs and it's very difficult to our lives i think in the savings at least for something what we

you know i promise three hours is three hours that i must wait another uh we can go another maybe ten minutes i think it's about 15 minutes earlier yeah if i done this morning i i'd say i don't i

the freezer I need to get a bigger freezer and all the materials well so later tonight after I get the kids down spend some time with the wife I'm gonna come back out here and knock out that bubble

the 160 press was man very little in there so that's what that looks like when I end up putting it in the jar and then a lot of people would ask me how did you get that [ __ ] rossington to stick to the bottom of the jar look so neat [Music] here's I take the glove and you're just going to push it down around the edges towards the center you're doing a cold room that's good rosin a clean glove

guys real quick [Music] [Music] turn down the lights already this whole side is just [ __ ] Mileena should be up here these ones dried back a little bit too much almost too much but not too two months still prosti of [ __ ] 12 cars black out there my Spade going over there [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so that's the current status in the Guardian you know just like oh my flesh for usually you're about seven days it's that but you know [Music] I had issues this run just like Ross Leafs his issues because he's in cocoa they're harder to detect early and so he faced the consequences of the buffering that cal-mag provides in coma cocoa I wasn't in at nursery iam so I was able to turn my issues around a little bit faster but you know basically what I'm saying is you know I had issues this run and the crop is still coming out pretty good so next run you know those issues will be corrected I'll make a video covering the issues that I ran into this grow and how I plan to correct them and I'll throw it up on the patreon hopefully you guys can learn from some of my mistakes you know I talked about on the show doing your own research and shape one of the things I researched if I should have used top-down broward rivers and when I talked to mango tech Abadi he told me to use two gallons per hours to avoid clog and that's what each use is but then I ended up getting water channeling that is too fast on the float and I cost a lot of issues I never really fed high enough of an ECE to have the easy build up nor did I ever push the plants that hard to cause them to have any lockouts it was all because my irrigation was wrong from the get-go with the water swim [Music] are you taking off right now that's one of the changes I'm implementing is not only am I going to get rid of the 2 gallon per hour but I'm going to go all the way down to like a point 3 gallon per hour dripper that could eat drawstring and stuff up here so yeah that'll fix a lot of issues right off to that that I believe uh Charles and pastor [Music] that Daffy got me hired balls rolling in on me now [Music] oh my bad I look here looking up and showers my phone [Music] there's no broad my issues going on in here all it is is either a they were different cuts or they were microclimates right he talked about the water channeling so you know phosphorus deficiency can learn to purpling stems and the plants that express themselves differently also has purple stems where I was the ones that didn't have the red bugs didn't have purple stems so I think it was more of a microclimate issue water channeling issue causing different uptake different nutrients and it just got exacerbated due to the lockout because of the water channeling so next one I'm doing is with wedding cake and I should be getting those clones in about two weeks so I have about two weeks to prep get the plants chopped harvested and everything I'll flip them right in the room that they're in right now I'm basically going to push the tables to one side of the room and then I'll go in and use a light rail for this up against the wall and I'll cut down on the one plant out of time and hang it on a trellis hanging from the ceiling and then I'll just hang all the plants from one light all right [Music] when my moustache hairs on the know it wouldn't happen I got trim my mustache geez so yeah basically just go one light at a time right down hole lights worth of plants hang them go to the next one cut those down hang out on a different trailer that's there the next one so I'll have three trellis nets hanging on the side of the room I'll have to retry this netting on that side of the room so after I cut down the whole left side of the room and those plants are hanging up there on that left side I'm going to disassemble the tables and walk them out of the room and then I can push that whole other table completely over to the middle of the room hang up all those buttons on the back side of the room or wherever in the room right and then basically I'll be good to go I'll get everything hung I'll turn off the shaker fan I'll just keep one of them on probably maybe turn it down to low or something and I'll just have to DEET you and AC going in there I'll be able to scrub down the you the four by twelve that's in there now scrub it down and get it reset and start making my adjustments to the room while I wait on my new 4 by 12 American Girl products they're probably they told me it was going to be issued early June like June 8th or 6 but they might be able to get it in sooner so I mean worst case scenario the room will be down for about three weeks while I wait on the new table but I'll just match all the plants on one table while I'm doing that perfect and then when I get my new table in I'll be able to go ahead and transition the plants over throw up my trellis mats and pretty much switch so you know that's the plan and like I said I'll document all the changes to the room it said of everything that I'd be like want to document the changes and yeah my keeper fee no cuts from honest genetics should be here in the next two to three weeks and solved a whole room full of wedding cake in there veg and flour that while I have a child my keeper he knows from our genetics and my new keeper you know caked up cherries wedding cake crossed with cherry something f3 I'm going to do the three-tiered setup but I'm waiting on him to send me the updated invoice for the new poles and as soon as I get those I'll be able to set it up and I'll have pretty much what I was thinking of doing them what happened to rekey poofy nose and I could basically put all of them on their own tier if I wanted and then have clones next to it or I could just put all the moms on one and then since I'm doing two tables at a time I'll just pick you know I'll have two tiers for clothes you know cherry cookies have three thank you thank you thank you I never remember like my keeper he knows from honest I don't remember what I was are either blue hurricane 27 crossed with white sunrise for the blue lion keeper and then scarlet sure is chocolate frosting crossed with something I think [Music] I trust my man on his genetics he tells me yo this is a [ __ ] you should run for a hash let's fire fire fire legs all right now you got it [Music] like I remembered it enough to purchase it and you know that's all that matters now that's all that matters now I need to show up in the garden [Music] so stoked I have I'll have the blue Hawaiian which is gonna have exotic super crazy unique blue Terps it's gonna be highly sativa dominant as far as the high goes and then the truck not the truck cherry but the cakes of cherries that's gonna be my cherry Fino right there so I'll have a blue of a cherry and then I have the gassy out of scarlet shirt so it's gonna be dope [Music] this is real the kind of light that I use for clowns are right behind either the raging raging kales and I actually got sponsored by science LED yeah so I will be getting now raging candle LEDs probably twice a year during two biggest ways that I do and it couldn't be [ __ ] dope it can really know and then every other month or so I'll be giving away a bunch of science LED swag hats ashtrays shirts things like that all be put on there grower spotlight on their homepage pretty shortly here I have some pictures that I have to take for them and type up some some information and what else asked me to leave to help them do research spectrum tuning and hash production so I'll be doing that so and then also the big thing I'll be an authorized reseller for their lights on my webpage as soon as it's up in a few days so as soon as the page is up I'm going to try and get them on there and I'll be able to resell a life through my page so that way you know they don't do they don't do coupon codes like people in the industry you got to use to coupon codes because of for flex and all that but what that does is it makes it so that you can't sell that product in brick-and-mortar stores anymore and in the hydro industry almost need brick-and-mortar stores still surprisingly to you know expand and survive because still a big commercial facilities go through these hydro stores and you know direct to these manufacturers a lot so they don't do coupon codes they're like let's say they offer a 10% discount code here in California right and somebody purchases a light from you know from me and using my promo code but they're in Oregon or something and or somewhere else where they maybe don't charge sales tax and now not only are they getting the 10% off but they're also getting like seven or eight maybe taking even up to 10% off of that because of no sales tax right whereas if they were to purchase it in the store you know the store would be able to make a profit but in order to compete with that price that they would get you know from using the coupon code the brick-and-mortar store would basically have to not turn a profit so it doesn't work out for them to be able to give people who coupon codes stacked as representatives of the brand so instead I'll be able to be a reseller and then just a very very small portion of the profit that they would make from that light will go towards me instead so I'll be an authorized reseller and then basically helping do research and you know passing that information you guys like I have been this whole time so anyways this is what we're working with they bought this is delicious delicious it's called cookie dough and it's amazing [Music] I don't suspect this is gonna last long you won't need a code to let them know who sent you because you're gonna go through my website to purchase they're working on other

ahead and get this uploaded to YouTube right you know [Music] I'm kind of done editing these I'm just gonna start uploading the RAW files and if people don't like it they can kiss my ass I don't have time to edit them together anymore that's why I put the PowerPoint how I did you know if I do the PowerPoint I don't have to worry about putting an intro and all that into the video it's just boom okay boss [Music] alright crap dude my science for plant nutrition are a cool description I'll edit that later now don't care playlist crafted science done no it's not made for kids don't have to

we could do that that is really cool we can watch the video together yeah three minutes five all right it's 321 I'm gonna go in at 3:45 and help the wife for the day because that's the way it is [Music] I find on finishing of the loose jars oh that's the one section of illustrator [Music] this is it makes a great Cosby and Kush cake [Music] I don't know what I did mother two minutes [Music] okay a little poison for 30 minutes okay no accident since a wait okay I'll be in by say like 3:45 okay okay [Music] 59 seconds left [Music] very good dogs very good slowly giving them a little bit more freedom and hoping that they don't [ __ ] pee anywhere [Music] green jeans with Superdome [Music] Greenjeans was sooo Oberto 11 seconds 8 seconds that's called your video will premiere what's uploading and processing finished as well as the hundred percent uploaded is 95 percent process I have no idea how this is going to look for you guys I don't know how this works I've never done this before it is [ __ ] top-down so we're gonna check it out oh my god dollars people my DM right now [Music] all right you guys let me know what happens on your end when this is done hopefully I mean it doesn't take forever right now it's an remember you two processes videos one definition at a time so the low definition stuff is going to process and then like for whatever and then 720 and 1080 [Music] my phone right now it's just doing the load F [ __ ] the standard definition version we'll see whatever the [ __ ] back [Music] I'm really curious to see what this does though man that was such a good [ __ ] good [ __ ] episode and then episode 5 I'm glad we took a break because we were really [ __ ] burned out both of us and we needed a skip a week we came back and we didn't even have a PowerPoint or anything but it was still an amazing discussion Garrett jumped online from science at levy and he just [ __ ] to talk about what we wanted to talk about which was great just you know [Music] we just talked about troubleshooting it was [ __ ] awesome you know he get his perspective on things like walking into like a huge commercial facility and how you would troubleshoot their [ __ ] to figure out what's going on why certain part of the crop might not be doing its good versus another part things like that so it was really cool to get his perspective because you know as far as lost leaf goes he's a commercial facility but he's a one-man army and it's a small commercial facility it's the size of a house basically a one-story house and so and that's that's no diss whatsoever [ __ ] it's amazing what he's doing I wish I could be at his level but in the realm of commercial grows it's relatively small so you know his perspective is one and then Maya the home grower is another and then Gary brings a whole different perspective being that he's kind of more on the large large scale commercial and so it was really cool you know and go with it so unfortunately during this whole Cove 8:19 thing all of the HD recordings for webinars are being limited and only being allowed standard definition so this is not going to be best of qualities for the uploads that are going on right now from the webinars and there's nothing that we can do about that so you know [Music] check it on the patreon real quick make sure you guys got your post real quick [Music] are you

YouTube a minimum and Matt doesn't post on lost leaf as a poster or anything like that out of respect for my patreon supporters he knows he waits again he's a week two to three weeks even suppose I mean it's not that I don't want the information out there for everybody but I wanted to I want to give some [ __ ] love to the people on patreon and economic access all that and they can pick my brain

[ __ ] oh yeah [Music] oh [ __ ] [Music] in the filter [Music] oh Jesus son 525 that is a very very high [ __ ] gasps Jesus [Music] [Music] so the reclaim catcher works by basically a when you draw on the dab it gets stuck down here because all that reclaimed can't travel back up pretty much so what you end up with really is just tiny tiny pieces of the vapor that condensed back to rosin in here versus a shit-ton of replaying and if you have a really good deep-dish banger and you do low temp doubts your your reclaim actually can look really nice how well that looks but [Music] seeing us a

smoking [ __ ] flour out of [ __ ] dab bombs and damn rigs and [ __ ] like like uh I understand you guys got a vaping oh man I should [ __ ] socks I wonder if you warm this up or crumble like like a normal hash does I mean you just touch it with a lighter it's kind of crumbles right cuz right now it's like Anusol it for him I try ever never I go to dab it right now I just want to get this piece in there's a nice piece there's one get this piece in there and go to town you see what happens okay it's in there guys yeah it's right there you guys can see that piece of hash in there guys you can also see the Afghan rainbow but in there it's actually purple and green so it worked out pretty good alright here we go ash Cheers guerrilla girl hash pressed fresh pressed guerrilla girl hashed hashtag guerrilla girl has ah Cheers even as the hash tastes I remember num nums it did I my boat with a charcoal right there y'all see that that was kind of where you left my bowtie cold air bring it up pretty quick too oh well that was fast all right [ __ ] it it's a civic dab it right mm I guess go in cold and then we will uh push it away just first I only took a little piece off we're gonna wait there's no job this [ __ ] right on my nice fresh clean scale well see right there when I smoked it's still 0.5 so I'm happy I mean look at this piece here that thick that piece is guys that's that [ __ ] hash right there sorry my stain s thumbs yeah there's stain from work no matter how much I wash them they don't really ever come clean that's that [ __ ] hash right there boy yes that working man's hands look like well [ __ ] is she dead blisters and calluses and all kinds of [ __ ] all right so look this piece on my scale here isn't even uh laying in anything is my shits not like a [ __ ] cracker coke scale it lays it by the grams so that piece right there just that piece right there is 0.5 so oh I look at it that right there right that right there is extra that's how I look at it so I'm gonna [ __ ] to add it and see what happens all right okay let's see let's see what happened so I'd do a little piece of that and I'll put a piece of that and they're cold okay and then and then I do hot a hot one like always like always yeah must chair I need to get like cinema chip sometimes it sounds like a straight [ __ ] fart I'm not farting people trust me a butt fart out of pie laughs I'm like oh I'll hear that one but yeah that's not me far as my piss my next week yes chair okay okay glad that's a [ __ ] away huh - time all right nothing's in it drop this [ __ ] up in there it's a nice piece bingo see now nice piece in there yeah I could see it I'm really excited you know what I'm actually gonna put it in this ball here and just heat the bottom up cuz that's the bottom bottom banger no scene I should let them like to run crazy ice perhaps when you fill it up and I guess don't wait to appropriate time I mean I did [ __ ] wait so I'm just make sure my car caps car get check check yeah and I'm curious something has like this idea I mean I started she smoked so I know I just it kind of I just kind of basically tastes like I didn't burn some [ __ ] leaves beyond it and there's a little taste I don't know what what it's not registering you smoke it's a very fine vapor I can see it you guys might not be able to see it but I can [ __ ] see it the very fine vapor added things starting to get a little char cold as you guys can see that so now I just went right down into my third thing say it real hard so listen learn right listen burn on the good old hash well nice to learn let's go in hot real quick and see what happens I'm just gonna top that whole [ __ ] piece in it's pretty much very [ __ ] hot so this time we'll kind of crumble that up a little bit and spread it out see what happens hey okay guys just like the mad scientist [ __ ] here final wish the worst gonna have and if you dare try to dab it right fresh one thing I know I can do is that I can probably try to press this again and get some hash rosin oh yeah it needs to be heated up some just like I thought just gonna simply my cat watch it crumble look guys just crumble it just crumbles yes that is [ __ ] hash baby alright so note to self can dab it but smoke it just smoke it the old old-fashioned way yeah yeah I just smoked it the old-fashioned way out of your bowl or or we heat it up a little bit and sprinkled it in a joint or something that's more likely how I'm gonna be smoking it I just sprinkle it in and like it's J or in a bow yeah so I mean with that said I mean I definitely I definitely feeling it it's definitely creeping up on me nice a nice body buzz [ __ ] like almost like a almost like a dope filling yeah like a heroin feeling kind of like just like a warm sensation kind just like just bent over to do my body the pain just kind of like the pain just went oh what pain what back pain yeah I mean like move my [ __ ] I can like really I can feel my back pain because it's always there but like normal I can I can uh I can I can do that could stand it I mean I can live you know so yeah that's my advice that's my uh my take on this hash here things you gotta figure out how to [ __ ] get it out but that uh sucking it in my thing like I did down there I see it floating there huh I see so yeah there it is it's definitely good for pain it's it's it's definitely good good to I guess wake up smell the [ __ ] roses so that's good oh yeah it's a when it's a clean pressed hash is a win another thing what I try like I was saying I won't try this I'll take a good piece of this and I will use my thing okay and I would try to press some of this and make some hash rosin and dab it that way that could be another video I'll make this videotape that huh huh all right that said I'm still a fake but I need to go to bed so uh like my [ __ ] subscribe like all that good stuff if not [ __ ] off stay medicated people's peace", "WdQ3sJ0DW9o": "[Music]

i smoke about and [ __ ] around joints and plants and all [ __ ] okay that it's and you learn couple of things um and it's really to to to to really enjoy your joint you know um it's way too small it's not only how you roll this is completely different story you know this is that you have two journey one is with rolling what is important how you all depend on how your wheat look and the one journey it's how you smoke and very often i i listen to the blames and uh oh you know my wheat was so stick and the chocolate and the bland and the gold the black key and all [ __ ] and that might be oh no no bro this is not supposed to do when the wheatie is uh sticky it's a fast you wrong way roll the [ __ ] and second you don't quite smoke this [ __ ] if you wrong way you can exactly smoke a joint only how long way is we'll be talking about this i think wednesday thursday next week or talk i'll be make video about that uh you know i need my videos i can't do any live streams um that yeah

cigars uh it's nothing i be doing this every day or you know i do this couple times per year and for me it's in the very special occasion not fun of roach clips no no me too yeah i never understand people as well i know under what you're talking clips you know i don't have this problem because i use um paper roast um some people don't like it some people say hey you use paper roast you can taste paper uh hey i have solution for you use glass you don't taste glass you can't tell me you taste glass and exactly by the way your joint be taste a little better uh only about this we'll be talking later on on the first day video um i'm exactly quite big fan on the glass uh on glass tips for your uh for your drawings uh is it dependent on the ass only in the way how you can smoke and it is quite good i don't know i'm uk i'm from uk bro yeah don't use i don't use filter you know this is not really yeah we call these filters it's mostly launches uh well glass papers your meaning and it's not glass it's cellulose what the transparent one i exactly done the review of of one of that this will spread all cyclones you can buy normal you can buy normal um normal paper what is i think can in the back or whatever in the pack um and by the way this is sugar it's sugar papers it's not glass peppers it's sugar peppers and what is happened it's in the melt um i have a problem with this i i know and they look cool however it's it's [ __ ] me you and you smoke melting toffee [ __ ] inhale sugar no hot sugar no bueno uh that yeah for some times to do maybe it's fun if you have colorful you know your wheat uh and they put uh misting uh pg bakes yeah here you go this is what i mean this is what they call hash pipe this is exactly what you should use for smokier hash okay mostly people if you be smokers what the [ __ ] i have some pipes here um whatever you'll be used spoon pipes and uh yes i know and they remind you of something i'm very bad i i'm really i must measure the lesson i know i'm i'm bad with that i'm sorry um this is way this is how you should uh no screenpipe that is [ __ ] here we go this is a metal one um it's metal because it's short you need your hash be cool okay that you take the flavor and this is sepsi pipe this is madokan pipe this is madokan pipe for harsh and for keef you can smoke even harsh with this um it's this one have quite a deep ball which is quite cool um this one is a smaller ball however you can take your lips unbelievable uh those uh rosewood uh clay and uh your bowl it simply is that it's uh and i have caught on a wrap around because these balls like fly off um that uh this is way how you do and people uh american people use this in the hundreds of hundreds hundreds if you're not thousand years uh this is way how you do [ __ ] um i think that uh and we talked about this last time i i think in the oldest um the oldest device what humans know uh and i think it's about 5 000 years old and we know about we have traces about this tool to smoke it's in the chilean what chilean bee and how i explain you for people who don't know what chilean is it's literally stick what is in clay and inside you have clay stone in longer than better and i explained you this before as well and then you drop in the stone in and chill you smoke and special way as well and it's a couple of things what you should do with chilean yeah shiva um what you should do to to really appreciate and smoke proper way and chilean that this is not only pack the wheat and smoke and people really with chilean you you should really do good research to find never buy a chili ohms what it's a stone or wood no clay chilium must be done from clay and must be big long stone inside clay one as well that's it longer than better because it's all about how cool down your stuff okay um and of course your chilean is more than the tools to smoke uh to do uh to smoke your wheat if you be smoke harsh if you put under your wheat on you or if you don't use that you take leaves of tobacco nice organic one you chopped you mix together with hash and you put inside chili it's that is traditional way what indian people smoke in the thousands of thousand years people by the way if he's someone you're wondering uh that people say that now we jump for this little robot moroccan version of a pipe what you should use exactly to smoke your hash or whatever this bcpd hash the hc whatever this is way yeah boy what's up this is way how you do chilean shave stream yes i don't have my chili what i have i smash unfortunately i have accident and it's not anymore my chilling um and a really good i must be asked my good friend uh sewage vapor because i know and the [ __ ] with clay to make me nice chilean and this time uh that this time i can in the doing the sesh with sepsi uh within the chilean because i do a little research to buy under some chilean um i all what i see was good only not not good enough and um and that is important that people we do this the

shortage what the [ __ ] why are you thinking you separate your core is on the sides and you have plus and minus and all that [ __ ] you know um that if i can't have ceramic chamber for this [ __ ] what unfortunately don't do it because you see this one it's still hot um this one is no you don't untwist you remove your slide yeah ceramic that i say if you this behold ceramic and i can buy ceramic donut for this [ __ ] what it's there you should travel one moment it's still hot i can keep in my hand yes i can keep get out you see this is how i have connect that if i can't find donut would have that connection not 510 i'm good this time i don't need the pop-up in the doughnut what is ceramic close down nice and there must be nice damn damage and the pop-up down and this is the [ __ ] and the heat up and drop down and this be so cool device it's [ __ ] heavy uh it's whole metal this exactly this what you see it's no plastic it's [ __ ] metal unbelievable that is it's you can kill someone if you say i'm serious it's very heavy duty um if you wear tracksuit you'll be having the on your knees uh this in your pocket that it's very heavy only it's good [ __ ] that uh on you you must know how smoke from this anyway it's called dab box dab box only that can connect together that doubles you know you use the b no no no you use b together one d and all this world together that doubles i know it's it's easy you know yeah here you go that you're welcome yeah i know um what i like to do and i try how this work um i smoke now i use my dinner dinner vape and i put in the isolate as well i do it for sandwich that i take my dinner vape i put in the wheat um i put into some part of i isolate and i put another part of wheat that i'm quite sure and then nothing be leak inside cup you know you don't want that it's last thing's what you want you don't want [ __ ] that if you look into [ __ ] that you can clean this go here in fact that if you put some concentrates or harsh and that i recommend you don't keep flap this [ __ ] and you heat up keep on the 45 degree you want if you something must swim swim down not not this direction no that that is important and yeah i love this [ __ ] this is the more i i use this and anyway someone in there i have comment and someone complained on the the 5g one or g5 or whatever it's called um on the my vaporizer i exactly today's special take this with me on the go to check how it works and that uh someone complained that the oaky plastic taste and that what hey many people buy and he's happy with this um device that i don't know what's going on uh my advice for guy was hey go in the check go send back and hey taking you or say you want money back and the job done i think in the company it's quite in the legit and help of it and don't make fast you know fuss about this this is cheap [ __ ] and that i say this is cheap stuff that of course and the uh quality control and all [ __ ] be not so big if you don't at all okay that we know and disabled people if you vape and i'm vapor of normal e-juice okay you know and all this [ __ ] stuff what we have mostly what we buy it's [ __ ] produced in china okay it's no meaning it's bad it's meaning is not really in the quality control i know you received the city quality control and the little card you know someone dropped the [ __ ] in because a real one should have date and the name who check this [ __ ] because this person have responsibility for this product for all time of warranty because that is that worldwide warranty anyway and quality control that is it's happened that we know and the [ __ ] don't have it that however it's something for something that for your vape would you be used you'll be paying them maybe 50 not 500 that is different that you know um that is how is what i can say the more you pay the better product is most of time uh i don't smoke from regular pipes i smoke onihar from pipe because i think that is only one real correct way to smoke with no disrespect for no one what don't like to use fight like spleeves or whatever and as well um i'm [ __ ] stumped you must know what pipe you use for what and i never understand why people try smoke use granddad pipe to smoke wheat it's completely different way you smoke wheat until you smoke tobacco a sticky pipe tobacco um that you really destroy the pipe and you don't have a really good flavor of your weed that um this is a [ __ ] up um that you know follow my wheat you'll be use bonks you've used chili the chili room you'll be used and uh uh chalice you don't smoke i know some food uh you'll be use uh if you use chalice you know or spoon pipes shell logs and all that [ __ ] now if you come to hush i'm sorry this is way how you do and all you know audition um it's not really another option um why because you need very small ball because this is concentrate uh and you don't you don't put [ __ ] five grams because we kill you um that you smoke very small uh quantity you take the monkey uh you you'll be smoking the very low quant a quantity of hash and you need very long pipe to cool down your smoke so you can take all flavors and really enjoy you you know what you do and what you're smoking um it's all about in it about this journey um you know that uh people hey that for me you see for me everything how i do and that have reason behind okay i today someone put comment on my video and the someone put you must be [ __ ] if you put tobacco to your spleef when this person with along with statement could you someone tell me what is wrong with this statement it's completely already discredited this person stay away with whatsoever conversation yeah smoke how you want yeah only you know yeah spliffs tobacco yeah exactly you know people yeah look i don't care what people use okay and i don't judge you i only under what i say and what i teach people it's to use a lot don't use the wrong tools for for good stuff it simply is that because you never be look is the same with alcohol okay you can drink and drink and you can smoke and smoke you can drink and they really don't care and they don't use proper glass whatever and you never you never be really enjoying the taste and flavor and whatever is the same with smoking it's the same what i say and make proper joints or spleef it's quite hard to do it everyone can roll or almost everyone can do however all good we talk about something else now this is only half journey okay that is now you must learn how you should smoke this joint to don't spoil you know it simply is that to take maximum pleasure and flavor and have this nice road only that's what i say this we will be talking about this i promise you uh we will talk about this and you know thursday or good way we'll be having the you know smoking joint the art of smoking joint as simple is that that if someone is interesting and hey this is my approach how i think should be i don't claim i have right for everything and oh my god you don't you can don't agree with me i'm cool with that only this is how i see [ __ ] yeah if to make hash joint i wish to make hash join because it's possible to make exactly pure hashtag uh it's exactly possible only i need a lot of hash to do it at least good one gram or two gram and go two grams yeah it's experience because that is a look it's helpless do i smoke to escape what a reality well this reality we only presume we will we live here you only you you think you live here you're not quite sure you can prove that or you assume i should say you only assume brother that yeah i assume and that we live under this now the reality and i don't need to escape this is not escaping okay if you okay i have question if you back home you put in there you know listed essence and you start meditating are you escaping or you cool down yourself and you start connect with nature you see for me this i'm as the rasta for me this is sacrament it's bridge it's connection between me and jah you know open my faith eye for [ __ ] slow down my time till i have time to think about things but you don't have it because you rush everywhere everything must be quick no it's time for everything and it's time as well for thinking and that is important people that for me this is not something i do for fun yeah i have you know their pleasure with some and b stone i don't deny it i have little different uh aspiration i treat this that i say i treat this as the hey it's part of us we have cannabinoids inside our body you know what work beautifully with this cannabinoids with coming from plant hey we more connected with these plants and with with something else that is amazing was difficult to start living in uk no no uh yep heavy lettuce i love this david letter i love this [ __ ] yep listen carlos you know and if i um mention what you talk [ __ ] here to mr jimango your ass be whoop and there big time and you become and they apologize no i i know this guy that you know you can [ __ ] okay i tell you that mr carlos you can [ __ ] there if you and the g allowed you and i believe so g don't allow you and you have already in the couple slaps in the ass okay that here it's much quicker that you can chill with us if you don't like smoke that is good for me okay oh my god bro i smoking this [ __ ] in the 30 in the [ __ ] one years you don't know [ __ ] about what side effects um i tell you what is side effects are you hungry very often you're hungry you're sleepy sometimes depending on what you smoke yeah that and everything in your life but you know for everything you pay you pay for your stick you pay for for your alcohol yeah you pay for your ticket whatever you do everything have price so we already established this everything have braggs brother that i don't know why you surprised and these have prices on you know carrot have price exactly that why we don't and look if you don't like cannabis it's cool with me okay look yeah you can draw you can drop the city inside you know an earth and they be grow however you must look at after this that this is price as well you take it you know it's your work um now people you know look you don't need to like i'm not here to tell you to you must smoke or don't smoke and that i really don't give [ __ ] uh what people do because it's not me to judge people i never be judge people because i'm not drinking alcohol if you do this with you know we do not weigh and we start her problem and i used to drink a lot of alcohol and i don't because i know and if i be drink and smoke i will have problem you know no good [ __ ] um and i think it's very private and uh choice i'm very personal if someone won't do i don't see reason why don't why because you're free person and you have right to do what you want to do and no one have right to tell you and you're not allowed to do that's wrong and you don't make harm to another person you simply said understand that i never bashing people or don't smoke do i believe i'd be judged by the by the creator you know um cannabis it's in the mention in the a couple times in the bible it's in the tree of life by the way um that i don't know what you talk about and judge me for what for holy help for sacrament to connect me with ja you take the place now bro you don't you never listen in the song peter tosh legalized what do you think who this gentleman was this gentleman belonged to nabingis who is nabingis who is rastas it's straight away christians what us study the bible i rest my case next one please uh do you believe it's possible to be addicted to it yes and not and no physical way that you don't behave withdrawn that you behave from halloween or from coffee if you are you over you drink too much uh 100 you don't have it this way uh however you can have problem if you and do we talk about this and before um if you it's free the free uh category of people okay um people will train the hardly and work on their earth and people what it's you know very hippy and everything is our man it's okay tomorrow it's tomorrow and don't give [ __ ] and you have something what is between what most of us is um what you have time to fund and the you as well and that you look at after and you look at after your life and you're quite sure and you provide for your family um or [ __ ] for yourself whatever um now and of course in the last group what they really know what want and they go in the direction and i think the most um the most vulnerable group from this in the free groups it's in the the the middle the last one the hippie style one okay um only because it's no really and they don't have uh it's not really um don't leave too long time perspective you know what can happen don't really take responsibility it's everything more it's now it's fun and i don't give [ __ ] and i meet many people in that life and mostly of these people we haven't developed a problem with get out why because everything would you do and connect you with this how is the easiest way to stop smoke weed start doing other things distract your brain do another things do things what you don't do because he was too stoned to do it okay you stone you don't cycling [ __ ] go cycling you do something uh and after three four days you don't be remember and you don't be do again it's if you don't want to do it simply is that that it's more really who you are not because cannabis is bad and they can you yes some people can some point mentally be addicted for some stage however you never be sell tv to buy in the [ __ ] one gram often the wheat you'll never be in the suck and the dick to be in the buy in the [ __ ] wheat you be do this for crack so i can promise you that not for this yet that um it's how it is alcohol a it's uh yeah okay we must we we must separate it's two things with alcohol situation it's a little a little complicated because you can be alcoholic what is meaning it's no meaning to be drink every day it's meaning and you you can don't drink two months and later you still drink for a couple weeks that and again you don't and this what is problem however biggest problem and i don't wish my the worst enemy because this is people you thinking to vedro from heroin is bad go on the youtube and check how look at the [ __ ] people with dependency of alcohol okay what is meaning if you don't drink you die you drink you die whatever you do you're in the [ __ ] die and if you start doing bro you have hallucinate you see in the [ __ ] nightmares this is [ __ ] up it's it's nightmare that um just what can happen that you you must as well and this you must know and you must separate these two things that the paint of what we talk about we talk about alcoholism as the what can't coming to alcohol dependency and from this [ __ ] is no escape you stop you die you don't because your body don't work anymore with no alcohol it's [ __ ] up and hey it's always that depend of about what we talk about if you like small crack that's it you know if you like do that [ __ ] good for you bro no thank you and why don't legalize cocaine on halloween um okay i don't understand don't exactly cocaine is a different situation you see traditional and people would live and in the colombia and its farmers and live on the high attitudes and mountains are exactly used in the bowls of leaf and the cocaine to underput in the mouth and the true why do that two exactly can make work to exactly can survive or link and or live on the high attitudes of the mountains why must do this if you learn and go graphic geographic you will learn and the aim higher on the attitude and the mountains you are them lower you have oxygen now you must remember and the columbia and many other countries and the cocaine and the growth okay it's quite hot conference that you have in the quiet and the huge and the humidity that is more difficult for you to breathe what cooking do and the cocaine leaves do exactly in the making the your blood and the going in the more oxygen inside what is happened you can normal work and you can do normal things however these people do this in the thousand years and the dna is little change and it's not addictive for these people so much that we can talk about you know all day long with opium opium is you know it's poppies it's really you know i'm not big fan of opium i know when the people use opium problem this is documentary [ __ ] you up because you go to sleep and then you haven't dreams and you not really want to go back and and [ __ ] only opium was used in the thousand years as then the medical to medical reasons to ask the anesthetic you know that hey this isn't that some people use [ __ ] for wrong reasons it's not meaning something is bad okay that you must understand this as well hey you don't need to look at sofa mr um whatever if you go and you check and uh what portugal do decriminalize everything it's no crime to small crack bro that you can change country and go on the smoke there that is it's not that quietly that only yeah the completely uh and what's happened first was spike and the people start panicking oh my god look at no no no because people don't understand it was spike because many people was hidden because also scared to if you go outside instead to ask help be prosecute okay that now can easily exactly in the goal and help himself to be clean that i think it's quite done do good good job to do decriminalization of all [ __ ] for use at least because you look people person will smoke crack punish himself already why you must punish him more well you point you put him in the jail guys there smoke smash spice what the [ __ ] this is not how this system should work you know chase guy would sell not for the buy only this is difficult it's easier to you know shove a lot someone in corner you know it's hey it's always people that this what's happened and exactly now portugal having the one with the lowest and the numbers people would have addiction of high or a class drugs how about that why are you thinking amsterdam and uh and a lot of them exactly do coffee shops and say it's not really law this is uh it's packed between there and the city and the people and police why done this well to people having the easy access to smoke we eat and that have good fun no no this was done to separate hard drugs from wheat that what is happened look people mostly of people and that we say and i believe so and carlos martinez said born believe this as well and cannabis in the bridge to hard drugs what is [ __ ] and it's true and way it's true choice with dealer would sell you [ __ ] because mostly of dealers would sell you and the wheat unfortunately sell you another things and you know this work that and promotion that why you don't try this rock hey it's for free i get it this is what is bridge is connection how you can destroy this bridge if you you the decriminalization and if you do legalization of cannabis because it's not a point for the gentleman deal anymore with this [ __ ] it simply is that or at least you have lower percentage i know this really don't really work well in america because 80 percent of canada is what it's in the produce in california it's [ __ ] black market and it's illegal only this is because of your greedy government take almost 75 000 of money what you can make and you can only deal with cash this is [ __ ] crazy um that it's i think here when the law and america law it's more [ __ ] up by the taxation of the [ __ ] and how we regulate uh instead you know the still it's trust me if you can make decent life from the [ __ ] people we do this people be going the legal way straight away and no one be [ __ ] around and that is true it's nothing more supposed to say hey bad fault hey hey what's up bro that is cool you're not so far from me waste london brother but anyway uh hell still look nice that people is always you know uh [Music] you see you wish that happened exactly marijuana what it happened your sexual and experience is much better you can do the shock much longer and you have a much better experience why because change your reception about 50 times this receptors touch receptors you see before you don't need believe me this is not me this is science you don't believe me check for yourself i don't you see carlos that is different i think between us i can put myself behind this statement because i know he's correct and legit and i know i have free for that why because i'm educated i'm not opinated and that is different between us you opinated i'm educated that first educate yourself because i know whatever i say you never believe me you try bite me on the bible and you you crack your teeth because i'm rasta i read bible what do you want me you can argue with me what do you think and the creator tell me bro you have lighter with you this is what we tell me and let's judge mr carlos bro if you saw in the christian you know you shouldn't judge someone else it's not nice it's no christian style don't judge another you don't remember you should give you another side to be slow hey oh oh my god you see you don't know carlos you see you don't know how science work in it that is another problem anyway why waste your time on you and you know if you try make me angry or something you know this don't work here you know that yeah it's um hey i'm stoned i can be angry this is not happened yeah this time i don't smoke i'm hungry over in the company yeah i was angry exactly to the example i must admit i was angry today that's true only resolve right back home i have a little chill this window as well annoyed me that you know it's accident it is not that you know someone throws stone or something it's happened and it's good yeah i behaved no i don't no i don't keep my do i believe after life um it's quite weird concept if i must be honest with you um the afterlife and what is funny at this com i know under now this concept don't exist don't exist with christianity however it used to exist with christianity this was abolish i don't remember on which sabor uh was abolish this mr martinez should know it's in the bible study person that should know this well um which chapter which which year this happened i don't remember i literally don't remember when um it was abolish and uh because what's happened and this was uh this was funny that when church is very shady um this was done not because this was done because of greatness you see church starts sell you can buy you can buy you can you can buy heaven to pay your sins okay that priest and they walk around and they say oh you know your sins and that if you won't go [ __ ] heaven and that here you go you must pay [ __ ] for that before people believe you die and you reborn again and you're born again okay and if you but you might it's beliefs wars and this is funny because my grandmother used to used to be old school catholic and don't take this wrong not that you think old-school ones thinking you know more deep and situation and really now you believe [ __ ] anyway um and this was really really cell [ __ ] okay that really and the and the christianity uh idea of the reincarnation exists and why exist because we know and the jesus and the travel to india and the study buddhism and the things this is the spartan that you don't have story and bible between the two until his 30s and they come again to teach and and do all [ __ ] however how we know when we because you can find and the parts of the and the indian manuscripts and dimensions you know jesus was a real giza okay for me was human um anyway with good talk you know how is uh it's it's it's it's it's quite in them amazing i know and they're constantly about the same and the coke and coke and coke and pumpkin bro you don't know [ __ ] i told you huh you know what he make you problem with your dick ecstasy by the way that carlos don't do ecstasy you won't have in the heart don't do ecstasy and that anyway that that you have in the little that story that all this is in the [ __ ] cell ship and anyway what we talk about um yeah you see i tell you something this is what you know humans smoke cannabis 10 000 years and no one die i rest my case die maybe from stupid causes you know because we don't do something stupid however don't die because of cannabis you can overdose impossible so by the way and how you have this yeah anyway how you have these statistics million doctors what the [ __ ] find me one find me 10. that i smoke weed to dance to see devil you know to try and uh take me for long road mr carlos why people why every time we need to we have every time someone will try and one guy trying to put us on easter one in there we come in the islam believers another one try and approve us and the devil and the bee and the eaters and the rosters and you know and our skin be ripped off from ours and the flesh and the put back and the rip off again and all that [ __ ] um depending on which book you believe um you know about hell you know i don't know why we can't um have positive chat with no problems whatsoever and talk about everything else and don't try to convince another people and this is what you do you you wrong or you should do different way end of the day my life my choice everyone have free will in it mr carlos how how is your how is your um how is your on this one subject are you have free will or you comment with this as well and if you and got to know everything what's happened and there would be happened and that you really don't have free will everything is right done already and every each and the choice what you do already be done uh that you really don't have a free will so now if we believe that way and we don't have free will and then we people what is already ours and ours past future uh past present and future already done and already lie down and the stars because someone created us and they know everything okay that if you know that how you can change yourself if you your stories are really lie down and you don't have your free will if you don't have your free will you can't change yourself only free will give you possibility to do different way however if we don't have free will and i do what i do and if you we christians and we will leave deeply and god and the god create us and put us under this earth to do this [ __ ] and already know what's happened you don't think i do good and exactly is never mind what i do because everything what i do is already done it's already known i can only change path of my life and they become a different person only if i have free will if you my past present and future is not right down someone else and someone don't know this all on the one go oh boy how about that you won't discuss this with me or you already escaped from here you know by the way i don't believe how i think hell is here where we live because of our free will and our choices what do you do no that isn't the christian beliefs only problem is this is on the state of mind my yours whatever and some people can do it some people don't because you can prove what this part of this you see with normal life because i know in that your life and i love this you liking the to to to put uh and people um i i love and every time the people connect with god and all that stuff i love it i only wait for that to people and to start talking about god and about cannabis and how i finish and hell and that and whatever okay and if if if you be nasty i you can i can deny it and say hey amateurs i believe in the deal with evolution and why i must believe something and if i do something incorrect or some i think i do incorrect because it's the pain on what which point of view you look at and the situation and subject for something for me what we good exactly and for all society be good can be bad for you example if i kill you because you're bad person and you do bad things this be good for society because you never again we do bad things however be bad for you you get it okay that is construction your morality you know you have choices and not every choice and to be good however now what you talk about you talk about and that you connect with god and with god it's don't exist exactly that morality apparently with christians it's something good or it's bad killing apparently is bad what is it really contradiction because if you read bible and i read bible you know and the god and they say hey we mustn't you know do bad things it's funny it's it's all always that hey bro forgot it you can forgot it you don't win this battle whatever way you'll be trying to go with me uh first with s and dimension in there and the bible and exactly and the church use you know and they're walking with the smelly little [ __ ] around what do you think is inside what do you think this do what kill the smell no exactly this is psychoactive evil this is a smoky in the staff what you going the um what in the priest and they're going with some in the ceremonies uh it's under to calm you down why you think and the churches is underdone and he's very dark within the huge windows what he's into with color the full peaceful and the mosaics and all [ __ ] and the sun and the gold and the inside and the making the you know rainbows and you say [ __ ] why you think he's done that plus bro you had another world everything have reason to be so how can denied you how do you think a more just talk within the [ __ ] the banning tree or bush on some mushrooms don't be silly come on bro all ours history all our things connection with god's connection with ours and their conscience with everything it connects with psychedelics you like it or not own it understand it it's no meaning and you must do this because i think not everyone should do i think that i say this isn't very privately shared and very personal however i never will judge someone for that to won't discover himself from inside uh refresh yes can change can change your life it can destroy if you stupid and you do wrong way or can't change your life for better uh it's simply that it's you never never never be happened and you you take psychedelics and you'll be the same that has never happened and that it's you know this isn't uh it is what you think and that i think it's not for fun and you find that the fire pyramid is nice black people it's always you know um it's quite um and that i say if someone don't like smoke and that don't do it only don't judge people what do because you don't have right you don't have right to do it i don't judge you from your life whatever you do why you try to judge me you see that i don't like in the word stoner and that [ __ ] you don't call person what you did i don't call my wife what like alcohol oh you alcoholic you my alcoholic you know it's it is my point and if you are are you stoner no i'm not stoner i mean the person what like uh sometimes smoke weed that you like sometimes drink beer it's not meaningful alcoholic in it it's not mean you have tendency to alcohol you see no yeah you know and all this and uh if you smoke pot you'll be stupid and there you'll be this and that um tell this and they all and the musicians and the art people actors directors you know with movies authors of books tell all these people would give us cultural and completely different look for this world and it's stupid yes i know big time uh those people it's simple is that everyone [ __ ] smoke only we talked to you and the oh you know you'll be masturbating 10 times per day and you'll be sit home do nothing don't go work sell everything and whatever into your life being the most and the miserable ever um no with the most invented [ __ ] ever hey give [ __ ] stoner piece of wheat the guy find a way to smoke this [ __ ] trust me how you call this no laziness keep carlos away this is good [ __ ] look if you have a problem with direction don't blame this uh don't look uh you know don't blame weed blame yourself and anyway who the gift [ __ ] i don't i really don't care about his opinion why because he's opinated and we know that it's only waste of time don't know what to talk about talk [ __ ] i haven't the opi opinions what is come on my cat know better exactly no if you think about holy things no eat my flowers but anyway people we must finish because we go very long and my wife i i promise her i do have hours and i'm sitting there all my night and my life anyway people hey guys and the apex and they

going to be reviewing this moroccan melt that's right it is purple dream which I believe is purple punch mix we even need rings one of my favorite I love it so I'm really excited to do this shop and honestly I've never had a melt before of an hand pack and what I hear is the melt is like a better quality I actually think that so I'll really Cruces people just like what it takes place when it smokes like consistency the way it looks we're gonna be reviewing all of that today so hang on it's like graduating and grab your guys grab whatever and get spoken of in this is the Moroccan melt [Music] okay it's smaller than blue drink oh nice it is pretty ashtray okay yeah that's cool the Middle East and the health of the world for evolution where it's a are I'm sorry I thought it was a backwards off it's actually a part store look at that smile it's delicious we got it now they don't mention what kind of micron is hashes but it looks pretty top-quality maybe it's so 45 or 75 who knows I really couldn't tell you just by looking at it oh it's awesome I love hash by the way that's one of my favorite things to smoke now when I was watching videos of melts I wasn't exactly sure what amount was but it looks like it's just regular hash so looks like it's not going to be anything that new or anything different but let's give it a shot let's get a nice little fat dab of it and see if we can get this going maybe gets get a little bit more there we go [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I was good [Music] now into the dam my initial reaction is possible if you have a man subdued I imagine a today that sparks but I always create a see a smaller do joined and the first upon trouble is take any type of clicking this like any kind of grand acres or chocobo and through any kind of these those terpene that it's definitely a lot more busy than you expect baby happy with them it's good good I mean I still went to ten I'm probably too good at seven concerning the how strong it is and it tastes if I was giving about a cake too many locations it's good for thirty bucks you really can't go wrong with this privatized and I really look forward to just having a nice pad for the cinnamon and hitting it two days I'm doing something she's probably my favorite thing about hash is just follow my advice and do a lot of this you get out of a single bowl of that it's pretty good yeah so in the come down you know it's not where you're sleeping I actually feel a little bit more little bit more creative to go out there and do something else which is strange because I always like to get more sleep you and more out and still decent more I can't release until got it baby I dig it I'm gonna probably sign off before your to star after the other pilot myself up another ball good time so anyway the girl over there I watched my video go ahead start up to doing just to smoking on a bond take it down hit it up and I'll catch you on the next video peace", "KYmF_k-KP7k": "all right what is going on everybody so we're back with the quest of learning how to use nuts masher i've got to use this thing a couple of times definitely got a couple of grams of rosin out of it and uh i like it so far i wouldn't say i haven't mastered by any means i've got a lot to learn and whatever else but in the quest to make the best dab in the world uh basically i've been following what other people have been paving the way with on youtube and what we got here is a bubble magic machine we are going to i'm going to make bubble hatch for the first time ever if you have never made double hash like me follow along please and we'll go on this journey together i'm going to wash this thing out once just make sure it gets you know everything is out of it particularly wherever else and then we're gonna fill up ice and water in our five gallon filter bag and we are going to make some ice hash for the first time cool guys here's a little dumpster and all right let's wash it out first and then let's fill it up all right so i got this baby washed out let me go ahead and start i'm not sure [Music] there it is bubble magic bag so this is a large bag five gallons and i'm gonna pretty much put like an entire bag of trim in here i think to start um so this is a one gallon bag of trim some pretty nice stuff i just basically want to make sure there's not any large stems i've been keeping it in the freezer [Music] [Music] i grew a lot of outdoor this year which was cool but at the same time my garden patch where i needed to have it just being state laws and whatever was kind of tucked back and it was near a bunch of bunnies that my guys raised and just so much hair came over it was just like i was like man it's really bumming me out to kind of smoke it or pick the hair out and uh doesn't make me feel like it's the finest quality although it's a runts melonade strain and a forbidden run strain from tiki mad men genetics and also cush mints got a blueberry headband back there and uh really it's a good smoke so i thought man i want to get into maybe washing and uh i've never done this before much like most of the other things that i do in my life i've found that i was like oh i'm just going to get into this little thing it might be like a new hobby and then i've end up spent thousands of dollars into it and i haven't even started on the hobby yet but you know this is a large bag and i think i'll have no problem doing another [Music] bag of material so i'm going to get one uh if you were watching the channel this sweet 70 something year old neighbor lady gave me this massive outdoor plant just basically gave it to me she thought it might be hemp and i told her it looks like marijuana to me of course i still have not smoked in him it could have been him but probably not i'm still honestly baffled that she had it in her yard and then she gave it to me this plant was still kind of uh wet even when i threw it in to the freezer but that's it oh trichomes are already falling off that like crazy oh if you get this bag it has a little zipper piece it wants you to zip this down probably fold that back and then velcro it [Music] and then so i think the tip is to not overfill this with water but it could be water in a nice bowl bow i'm going to let that sit for at least a couple minutes there before i start it let it get really cold in the meantime what i'm going to do is what i watched frenchy cannoli do is cut the bottom off of one 5 gallon bucket so you can set it into the next 5 gallon bucket and i'm going to set my bags up all right this has been sitting for about 10 minutes water's a little green it's submerged i'm going to hit this baby up now in that six minutes i cut the bottom off of one barrel and i got holes in the other one so [Music] [Applause] build it up too much i need to get a bucket quickly oh boy it's gotta be clean oh [Music] oh no damn damn just gonna hold it up there [ __ ] i would say this is a fail for the first one when it's done i'm gonna pour that [ __ ] back in there and i'm gonna drain it into my bags i'm glad you guys at least caught that [Music] all right so this has definitely been an experience my first wall shouldn't work out that great i had a lot of [ __ ] going on it was filling up too much man anyways this is how i'm looking i've got it kind of separated out into grades here and uh this is going to be my last wash for tonight i only got putting two gallon baggies in here and when i was done doing my first wash i was just looking at the material in the bag and i thought you know what i don't think this is quite broken up enough like i think i've got to go ahead and do this more so i threw it all in and then it jammed up my washer machine and i had to like empty it out refill it back up it's been a mess anyways i've been letting these ones drain out let's see what they look like real quick all right so this is my 120 bag this is about as low as i've been keeping her as high as i've been keeping [Music] it [Music] this is all 120. [Music] and i've actually just been hanging them back up on my little peg hanger to dry i found that because i'm impatient that's the best for me my 90 bag here oh yeah so on the second run here like i said i didn't think all of it got out of my bag out of the 220 bag that i put it all in the first time so on the second run with the two gallons i ended up dumping the leftover weed from the 220 bag and uh two more gallons of just uh that trim for that quite a lady gave me and i didn't do it in a bag at all so now it's just free spitting in there all right guys this looks decent i'll take it all right so [Music] this is what i have ended up with i'm excited about it i'm not super thrilled about it i think i maybe have a little bit learned to learn about it i think maybe i need to get my water really really cold first um which is doable but you know i've definitely got some return here and i just got to learn how to work it a little bit i'm going to dump this this last time and then [Applause] kind of give show you what i'm getting out of that all right everybody so here's a couple of quick tips that i learned on my first time ever doing some ice hash this is a process it takes a lot one you're dealing with water so this would be really best in an area where you have like a a sink or even a bathtub something that can catch all this water you know not like around all the [ __ ] that you thought was all gonna be nice and tidy and then your boss is coming in the morning and you have a [ __ ] lake of marijuana water that's just freaking so that's good i don't know what i'm gonna do there but here is what we got working with doesn't look terrible all right everybody so this is what i came out with and i don't think i had the greatest return i don't know if i was doing something wrong um i'm going to try to do maybe a little less material next time and i'm also going to do some things differently i'm going to prepare a little bit more and hey but you know what everything has a learning curve and definitely this has a learning curve i even watched quite a few videos about this before i ever even started but hey you know the first time uh it definitely has a little bit of a you know some tips and tricks that you learn whatever else but this stuff right here is just a nice mic blonde tan color that's probably what i'm most proud of right there and now i think that all came out of my first run which i had in the back like i had the bag in the washer machine and all this more green looking material came from the runs where i did without a bag in the washing machine i just threw all the material in and started agitating it so what i'm going to do right now is try to transfer this stuff into a a new sheet of parchment paper um so i got this all i first put it on the 25 micron press screens and i got them taken out taking off the press screens and then i put it onto a new piece of parchment paper inside of this cardboard box and now i'm gonna transfer it oh actually so and then i put that this cardboard box and this parchment paper in the freezer for the night because by the time i was done with this escapade it was almost nine something at night it took me a lot longer than i thought i was going to do just i triple washed everything and this gray this is like my i would say this is my 45 25 75 grade here i tried to keep those lower microns all together and then basically my 120 and my 90 i kept together and i don't think i really kept anything over the 120. i do still have a my 220 bag out there hanging that i left all the material in a little beard hair there can't have it and i'm basically just trying to break these up and expose more surface area we don't want any little pockets of water hiding in our hash because um from the research that i did do you know if you don't have a a freeze drying machine which i looked into it and i'm glad i didn't buy one there are thousands of dollars and this process although it was fun i've you know i've been wanting to do this for years i the first time i saw this done was like on a youtube video probably 10 years ago and it was still when people were you know like jorge cervantes was still wearing his funny little masks and disguises because you know people were still getting arrested and crazy raids so i've thought about doing this for a really long time and i just really haven't won i've never had as much material as i currently have this is my first year growing an outdoor garden and i just wanted to get into some new hobbies i guess [Music] but after this experience i'm definitely confident that i'm gonna try a dry ice run next instead of going back-to-back to bubble the bubble all right so this is what i'm working with after i got it off that last wax paper like i said i'm just trying to break this up evenly if i can yeah the thing is about this bubble hash it just takes a lot of effort a lot of effort to get it ready dry it and you know i guess you can lose it pretty quickly too so if you don't do any of this it's probably gonna mold out on you and then you just wasted all your effort all your weed [Music] months worth of work complain about that worked hard this year don't want to freaking lose any of it there's a tiny bit still on the bottom of these bags actually i let them hang and drip the rest of the way last night [Applause] it's beautiful right there that's really fun trying to be so careful right now careful it's really not usually my strong suit although it's tough though this is fun there's something like methodical and therapeutic about it to me i mean uh it's definitely cool oh [Music] baby that is cool right there so i think just learning a couple of like steps and preparing is crucial for this like you have to have a space set up to do this [ __ ] and also just going through it once kind of gives you an idea of what you need so that was a 90 and a 73 micron that i just added", "xwQpm_HuxWc": "hey guys I grim 428 young just chill with the lightsaber tube feel like smoking some hash the down step broke on it not the density at the dance tab broke down it [ __ ] so it kind of takes it [ __ ] did so I know I'm going to just pull it through got some hash though so i'm gonna have to break that [ __ ] up throw it in here as well that's some nice sour diesel oh that's [ __ ] some shake for my friend he gave it to me for yourselves like all right now you so you try the shoe grow themselves so mad as well burning it a past couple of hours [ __ ] I made a few videos but for some reason it's not working it's not uploading so I'm making this new one already starting back gonna put music on or whatever because every time I do doesn't [ __ ] what doesn't work for some reason here's the hash some blond hash ready yeah she sounds beastly all right let's throw some keep on this cone I scraped around the corners to get a Keith back for the last video but since it didn't load already my angle i can't see if you guys can see the glare on the screen okay see how they keep on top of the half-and-half a nugget oh yeah let's play it burn the [ __ ] yeah she was dead so what else can I do for you guys yeah you know just gonna leave this one with that [ __ ] smoked a huge as Keef and fat ass [ __ ] hash back before this video recording it but then the goddamn computer froze like legitimately just everything for us to do anything can turn down the volume lights nothing so I had to [ __ ] take out the battery so it's a laptop so you know right well yes pset", "Y-i-hPBTzDQ": "what's up everyone this is coming at you saying oh my and of course you're watching multi world people today maoti it's coming at you with another cbd review this time we have beautiful cbd hush from plant of life this isn't the company from um from barcelona um i have [Music] i have already and uh two products from this company what was uh quite questionable uh this was around uh jelly uh cbd jellies uh for smoke for yeah that was problem um you can check um under my cbd reviews uh i it still exists these videos that i really given the another goal to really check how and go with really in the solids because in the uh that we will have people gorilla glow and cbd solid would be in the cbd hush uh one gram um now yeah what i can say more uh we changed the view i show you in the close-up hollow of you know packages i'm not really happy with this package it's not really in the eco-friendly unit so much plus it's so much plastic anyway uh people say that with the change of his view uh i show you in the close-ups we put ours in there fill up our sepsi pipe um and yeah we we see you know how they what's happened have you got say that it's time to change our view that here you go people go literally glue what really and they put you in the nice heavy on the couch if you just be in the normal cannabis that this one should nicely relax you exactly that it's not something what uh be lift you up and energize you it's more something put in the you know more on the uh relaxation side that you are ten percent of cbd um let me open this package i say too much plastic so difficult to open this stuff [Music] anyway a little info but i will talk about this quite cool and i was harsh okay people and the package would go in um that you having the little information and i really like this that you have in the all cannabinoids everything what you should know about your plant and i think that it's cool you know show you everything in the cbd cbg cbn thc cbc cbda thca you know cbd that it's a lot and of course you have lap what check within the certification uh date that yeah you know um quite interesting i like that i don't really like this plastic package however information hundred percent the people that look ours a little uh pollen oh smell nice smell a little pungy hashy and pangy that no lily and the bat looking cbd hush people um very crumbly like always um i don't think so this is babbling that i don't check that way um however people we taking the little pipe our sepsi and we try and you know i'll let you know what i think about this little bad boy good or not what's gonna let's people beautiful pepsi oh sexy pie here you go yeah look nice smell nice um let me change the view light up the city pipe and then we check and how work and what i think about plant of life all right change the view okay people it's time to light up and check how they work with this bad boy cheese smell nice hushy and little tangy is it's don't taste bad have this little hempy hashy flavor i don't be uh i really recognize this as the gorilla glue gorilla glue you know with this little tangy flavor it's a little mess however smells nice exactly smell nice only has the harsh very pleasant smoke that people this is what every time i say it's not i'm hated for cbd flowers it's it's only you know i know and things look beautiful whatever however it's every time the lack of flavor within the hush at least you have this hashi flavor um i see a little like on the um on on side this and the you know gorilla glue pan only hey i get it this isn't the ham stuff on the overall people a nice pleasant smell pleasant smoke nice white ash that this is as well and quite cool pleasant stuff like people yeah nice templates end of cbd and the nice and they put in the little um relaxation yeah i think overall um good job uh plant of life uh compared to the jellies for smoke for i don't know what i must do with these jellies uh i still have problems with this i think about however that i say i given the chance with this as i must say this isn't the big big big step favorite it's no bad product i liken the how everything is explained nicely what you have inside that is no wondering about um yeah little a little too much plastic on your head you're not gonna have um if you be on the little flavor wise a little better a little bit i think that'd be in the spot photon that being the good and the you know from if i someone asked me how i be scored this from zero to ten um good seven good seven for hemp burdock um yeah no problem whatsoever now people say that thank you very much hopefully you enjoyed this and um a little video our next video being the goodies the goods and a nice beautiful shutter that don't miss out and of course it's cbd as well hundred percent illegal in this country where i live what is uk thank you very much and see you next time stay safe and positive", "Hlnp6GT7BZA": "yes yes people here we go hope you're well people we've got a double uh sort of whammy sort of uh review going today we've got the life cam going as well so yes yes some behind the scenes footage people but as you've been waiting you know i'm saying it is obviously 420 somewhere you know what i'm saying people so smoke up roll up choke up with me out there people smile smile come on let's [ __ ] be happy people we've got air in our lungs we're alive jumping there's not there's a lot of people out there doing a lot worse than us at the minute so gonna just smile and carry on we're over a week in now let's go so stream review we have got some amnesia pollo it's very very soft it's very very crumbly this is from jimmy green's cbd okay and it is a wacken it's a whack here 35 cannabidiol yeah so really really strong as you can see she's put that down there so you can see on the camera look at it it looks like a piece of poop i know it's not i've not just shipped myself it is actually amnesia pollen it just looks of that consistency so yeah very nice it is a very um suspect look to oh just don't drop it on the floor right now let's get that into a ball it [ __ ] crumbles everywhere literally that has just crumbled everywhere very very soft well let's have a look and so jimmy green's uh cbd um i've heard a bit about that a few people have recommended um it being quite a good company so the feedback i've had from people on this company has been positive until now i've not heard anything negative about this company so i was quite intrigued and eager um to obviously try it the pollens are always very very soft with cbd they crumble like it's almost it looks like mud now it's got a consistency to it but yeah 39 i would think this has got some pretty good effects to it so cheers people roll up with us let's have it [Music] um [Music] [Music] really really nice and sweet very very very sweet um it doesn't taste at all like thc hash i know a lot of people who smoke these and they think it is going to be really quite genuine quite close to the real thing it's not because it's cbd the oils everything in it is going to be completely different but it's very very very smooth smoke very very smooth but with like undertones of again that sort of um almost like soap bar that you get with a lot of these hashes you get that kind of like soapy sort of flavor to it yeah but quite um quite masked by um this real nice sweetness which i guess is coming from the amnesia so that is nice just clean it up peeps keep it clean but yeah i've heard a lot of jimmy about jimmy greens a few people have mentioned that they've had a few products from him uh or them or whoever they are the company and they've been really really impressed so yeah i'm sort of stoked to be able to be trying um this particular product really i did try some of the pollens from hemp hash which i really really really enjoyed to see if i get a different flavor from this particular profile just crumbles everywhere should have got a tray really for this it shows you how different a lot of the hashes are to one another but again this is pollen so it's just going to be sort of trichomes pressed isn't it is it going to be sort of like compressed i don't know i don't know that much about the process to it but it's very crumbly people it's very crumbly right now didn't have any cbd yesterday again i need to start taking it daily let's have it no he did have some yesterday i did have it's thc i didn't have yesterday oh yeah let's have it cheers people [Music] subtle hashing but with a sweetness to it because it's just like a sweetness in my mouth it's very very pleasant [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] it's a good end it's a nice ash [Music] very nice very nice very subtle very smooth and very pleasant it's not going to knock your face you know your face off or anything like that as far as flavor you're not gonna taste it and go oh that's the most fruitiest bouquet i've ever had in my life yeah and like that it's very very subtle with these cashews you know the different sort of flavors you get in them but i thought i was getting a little bit of a coffee a bit of a bit of a coffee note from it i don't know i need to try it again to see if i get that back again but there was something else coming out in it but it's like um i'm smoking a bit of the bubble at the minute the bubble hashish and um the difference is freaking huge in the flavor of thc hash compared to cbd hash and again it's the oils and stuff that are in it you know they are different [Music] but that is nice that is something i could just smoke all night long and it's just so smooth on your palate as well really really really pleasant smoke to have so and i think that's half the thing with smoking is you've got to be out you've got to be able to enjoy it if you're not enjoying the flavor and the actual it's smoking experience itself you're not going to enjoy what comes next are you so it all comes past parcels like when you go to a restaurant and somebody presents some food to you and the plate looks banging they've done everything you know the salad looks nice it's just like a la carte sort of thing you eat with your eyes yeah and that's the same with weeds and hashish as well yeah so if the look if the first part of the process is good i either look a bit then it's going to go from there isn't it really to be fat that is nice that is nice it's got some nice effects to it as well like i said i did have cbd yesterday it's um i haven't had cbd today but i do feel it i do feel the effects why do i weasel [Music] comment comment quite to be down a bit today i mean to me i think like i'm talking less but i'm probably not god's loads of bits in there so far and then let's just crumbles lovely in your fingers though it'd be lovely to put in a joint [Music] try and save a little bit of everything and make a nice big joint at some point with yeah a nice big king louie or something [Applause] just have a bit of everything in there i have a bit of a bit of this in it i have a bit of the ice lit in there i'm a bit of a shatter in there and then a little bit of flour in it as well so yeah i'll try and take a little bit of everything so i can i could do that because i think that'll be a good video hmm so far nice experience i like it it's the sort of thing like so you could smoke you could sit and smoke that's no problem and just like have a real nice sort of smoking experience with that nice and chilled lovely right now john from the jolly joker amsterdam yes yes to cvd flowers uk showcase reviews thank you finish my brother one love to you much love much respect thank you for keeping me chilled in these times much love oh itchy nose get up and follow me out [Music] sweet it's got like that like that real subtle so far flavor to it and also almost like a sweet lovely sweet like you've just had a soft drink with with sugar in it that's the only way to describe it you know when you have a soft drink and you get that aftertaste that you have the sugar i'm getting that with this weed with this with this with this just you know you know what you're [ __ ] smoking cbd oh dude lots and lots of oil on it really clear the the sort of the resin that's actually left on on the glass and i'm comparing that to like buds that i normally smoke that is really clear so clean clean for hash i say the bubble hash goes like black it does [Music] where he's clean well i'm going to grab a little bit of my bubble just to compare it to and blow my [ __ ] noses my nose is [ __ ] itching and burning like a bastard due to the pollen [Music] [Music] okay [Music] that's better oh my nose was itching like think so again we've got the bubble which i've microplaned a little bit and i've chopped it with a [ __ ] knife just don't be technical so that's that there people all right really really nice as you can see that's what i made earlier so i just want to have a little bit of a like say i want to have a little bit of a compare now so just put that there i'm gonna have one more of the um the jimmy green's amnesia pollen and then i'm gonna grate it and then i'm gonna switch just to see what different flavor profiles i get between the two hashes now i've actually got them because not very often do you get both ashes together i always normally always have one or the other never have two together so and i've got to say for all intensive purposes apart from the color it does actually look very very similar except the the amnesia pollen is dark it's a very very dark like a muddy muddy color like a muddy brown color whereas the the bubble was more of a sort of a a sand color but you know when sand is wet it's that color so again let me see if i can put it on there so you can just say just put that there yeah i'll just don't go see that then look so the darker one is the amnesia okay oh yeah do you see it so this one here that's the army so it for all intensive purposes it does actually look very very similar to bubble hash okay but obviously it isn't yeah it does it's the same sort of consistency just different color different color all together and when you actually crumble it with your fingers it's more crumbly so i like it i like it i like these pollens what did i have the crystal pollen press was one that sticks in mine from um [Music] that was very very good again if you've not seen the review on the crystal pollen press do go and watch it because it was one of my first um one of my first cbd reviews that and i just remember having that i was like whoa that is so good started me off all right then so we're back to the amnesia apollo [Music] fourth let's go big four so smoke up roll up choke up with me yes yes smile and the whole world will smile with you it just tastes like a very good cbd hash [Music] honestly smoke this all day long lovely [Music] honestly really impressed with that mate well [Music] strong effects because the butterfly feeling in my stomach has gone and that's how i know it's strong because that anxiety is lifted from me so i would say the effects are there um you can certainly feel [Music] that it's not a weak one it's got a bit of strength to it so again lovely at this time when everything's kicking off in the world we're all stuck indoors boards it's really really really good to keep carmack there really good to keep calm peeps so for me that's a really good strain that's a really good bit of medicine that is i would certainly say you know i mean looks of it it looks crumbly as [ __ ] and it looks like mud but no they i mean all um all hashes kind of like look like sort of there's nothing to look at are they let's be honest it elevate that with hashes they all pretty much look sort of very similar just apart from color very very crumbly so i mean the looks probably about an eight out of ten but i elevate the looks of hashing she's it the effects definitely are up there because i'm starting to lose my words down and start i have to think about what i'm actually saying it's making me work a little bit harder because i've relaxed now so so the effects are really really good really really good and the taste like i said taste there's better taste there's stronger hash tasting it's very very subtle taste to it yeah very very subtle you're getting a very very light soap bar but with a sweetness over the top of it as well but don't be expecting a whole bouquet of light you don't mean you're not going to get it it isn't a very very sort of very very strong in flavor it's very very strong effect so really really really nice really really really nice i love hashes like this i absolutely [ __ ] love them beautiful beautiful i think when people take cbd hashes a lot of the time they expect them to taste like i said like like thc hashes and they just don't they just don't they're not they're not the same i can't reiterate to people enough it's always going to be different but what you're looking for is a smooth pleasant enjoyable smoke a nice smoking experience nice effects to it do you know what i mean nine out of ten mate nine out of ten for the amnesia apollo yes yes cbd flowers uk showcasing reviews cheers for that one brother he's behind the scenes with the rest of them do you wonder why i keep looking for two cameras because i've actually got well i've actually got three cameras going a little bit so there you go behind the scenes camera and the real one people right so now we're gonna switch i've graded that nine out of ten love it really good definitely recommend it um i like the company i've heard about the company a lot so really really privileged to be able to try that so well impressed we'll save that for a bit of a special joint at the end people okay let's get a little bit of this bubble that i made then let's just see how the flavors um compare and then i can tell you straight away now [Music] lovely effects on that though [Music] what up people you know you roll it's time for a thc time for a minute though let's have it bubble bubble toil and travel here we go here we go with the flow [Music] so [Music] it hits completely different gotta say cbd is a lot smoother it's a lot smoother than uh than the thc sister i've gotta be honest with you the thc gets you right there it almost like it builds pressure up here and then i go whereas i find with the cbds especially that one there that amnesia it was a lot smoother [Music] really really smooth like can you hear my voice it's like like closing my my lungs like can you hear it that didn't do that that amnesia was so much smoother i've got to say really smooth that makes just and i'm glad i've done this now because it makes you realize how smooth the actual pollen is wow i've got to say as a mixture i feel [ __ ] fubar now i've not had a huge amount like i said of this bubble i smoked a little bit earlier i did the review this morning i've tried to be careful with it because it's all i've got but why thc sweats people thc sweats [Music] try to brace myself for another one should we have another one i think we should have another one if you have a vote [ __ ] all right it's like a [ __ ] mule forgot what i was doing there for a minute i mean thc you're gonna get a lot a lot more of a stronger flavor because the oils like say there's more oil isn't there in thc it's more it is a weekly isn't it it's oily it's greasy [Music] why [Music] impressed impressed impressed people right should we have this then yeah i just like just want to say i hope everyone's enjoying the reviews i will try and get as much content out as i can at the minute i know it's just it's hard for everyone it's good for me to get the content out because it keeps me busy and hopefully it helps people like that to have something to watch and pass the day so join me but just all it's all laughs with me don't take me too seriously people like that i'm just like just to have a laugh and just to like say hopefully make it smile a little bit and make the day go a bit quicker but hey just look at the positives we've already done a chunk of this already christmas is around the corner it's coming yeah the christmas music is coming on trust me yeah got things to look forward to yeah this glass is half full people yes yes let's have it cheers to all of you anyway but yeah i hope you're all doing well i hope all your family's doing well i just keep smiling we will be out in this very shortly let's light up [Music] do it's a choker they say the amnesia you could smoke all day this you couldn't let's be i done that's why people are switching to cbd these days because you can smoke so much thc can't you and you get to a point where like it's enough now if you've sat there and you're gay man or you're chilling or you're chatting and you just want to sit there and have a nice smoking stuff but just be able to be able to continue and have a nice smoke which i mean without getting too [ __ ] or not being too out of control i do see why people sort of uh love the cbd i do literally it's funny i walked that town earlier to get a little bit of stretch exercise get loads of bread stuff for that the cbd shop in town was open it was open right so obviously it's the sexuals in the central store but there were cubes there were cues outside it like [ __ ] pre-marnie mate he was a [ __ ] i was like oh my god joey people are switching on and but the people in the queue what are you trying to say jess remember what you're trying to say they can't sorry peeps what i was trying to say is the people in the queues they were different man they were all different there was no young kids in the queue there was all like older people and stuff like you know i mean it's like a lady with glasses on there's this chapping like like like [ __ ] like nice supernatural at me and then there was this other other old lady with another young girl and it was like it was like not you'd expect it to be like maybe 18 19 12 i know young kids and stuff like queueing up for it wasn't it's just like everyone was going out to get their medicine just find it amazing find it amazing and it's more and more sort of normal now isn't it and more and more people switched onto it like i said the people who weren't really into um thc but they they were curious about that they were curious about it they're the ones who've gone on to cbd now because it's legal because then you're a law abiding there there you people who don't want to break the law you know they want to keep things nice and you can understand there are people like that you just don't want to break the law they don't want to take anything illegal and they don't want to take any risks so obviously cbd i guess is filled that gap for that type of people which is why there's so much variation in the type of people who are buying it really it just shows you everybody's buying it there's no exceptions now there's no exceptions everybody's trying it everybody's talking about it it will be the future let me tell you but no i feel good on that i feel good on that good mixture between the two like i said about a good dose of cbd now i'll probably have a little bit more before i go to bed to be fair but that as a dosage is really really good for me so i mean four good sized bongs i'm feeling [ __ ] sweet two thongs of the bubble i don't need anymore i'm [ __ ] medicated baby i'm medicated but guys keep your notification bells on all right thank you for watching i really really appreciate all your support and it really really means a lot and sometimes i get wrapped up in my own little world so much i forgot to just you know take a step back and actually turn around to people and just say thank you jeremy actually thank you for supporting me thank you for supporting the channel you know i really appreciate all of you i know i go on like a little [ __ ] sometimes but i don't mean to i don't mean to i'm just human i just like to show a human [ __ ] sight to me i'd just like to show that i'm a real person not a fake person and that's it hopefully i get that and the people who are with me there's you know they see that side of me which i'm saying but yeah it's peace to one love to each and every single one of you take care of yourselves and take care of your family as well yeah don't forget to like and subscribe all that jazz and i'll see you guys really really soon yeah cheers for watching guys one love", "7STpBrz0QfA": "[Music] well this job [Music] what's going on guys favorite deadhead here today we make hash and if some people don't know what you need for hash to make it in bubble bags you need your bubble bags they consist of eight bags usually you have a work bag that's usually the highest micron which is 220 and then it goes down from 191 60 120 90 45 and 25 and that's my bag then these are cheap bags these are grow your own h PS grow lights store calm so they work I've made hatch with these things for a while now it probably needs new beds but in the meantime excuse me so the work beds here it's not filled yet and what I do is I pre chill some more the best I can I have ice you need ice and you need some kind of wooden spoon or whatever else you think works but that's what we're doing today I'll try to like maybe film this see what we could do all right if not I'll see you in a minute all

face water water just need a little more water I remember that the ice melts so want to lead yourself bring this charlie and you kind of just spear this for about 15 minutes give it a nice stir I may add some more ice want to get down to the bottom really wear gloves not because of anything just so I look at my hands on their seat gonna hit some more ice that's a consistency were morning there's next general idea I have to spin this up for a while 15 minutes plus alright so we'll check back with you guys in a bit please all right guys we're back it's about 15 minutes I did my stirring okay so what you're gonna want to do is you want to go to get it hot out for your work bag or if you have another bucket you could use a bucket but we need this bucket and I'll show you why in a second so it's stirred you see the bubbles you know there's more the ice melted a lot so I think it was nice it almost gets like a serial moisture sitting on the milk too long pent consistency with the buds and you could almost see there's no trichomes on there and that's what we want okay any clean as you go that's that's important just because it's annoying to clean all right so why don't we just come back I'll remove the work bag and we'll start harvesting some hash and I'll show you how to do that piece all right guys we're back I did put on gloves just this part I want to you could see I took the work bag out so you can see that golden luscious water of trichome head filled edge now what you're gonna need is your hash map which comes with the bubble bags that needed to 1/2 tspoon everyone who's anyone has a hash spoon or in my case semi soup spoon you're gonna need a beer and some paper towels some paper towels and we're cleaning the bowl with some 75 percent or 71 percent isopropyl so what we're gonna do is set this up and I'll show you from there one second guys please alright so we took the ng bucket [Applause] alright so this bag here is the 190 all right we're probably not going to get too much of goodness out of here but this is what you do all right the feel there's nothing in there [Music] [Applause] not so that all right so you take this and you put it in here go and then we move the camera detective whoa and then what we want to do okay so you guys can see what I do I'm gonna pause them alright so now you can see see we have a little bit in here there's some some material in there because my work bag has a tiny hole in it but that's why we have the 190 bed so with cold water all right so with cold war and if you don't have one of these use a regular that's spray bottle and you want to wash your hands in handy by pushing in the center and all the material and to get the water out this is a lot of green material so just doing a little spooky spooky yeah very much [Music] so I put it on your little pad over here so that would be it hold on hold on you must chill yeah what's up paper towel always does that or something else is wrong it's moving on its own that's so weird all right so why don't I get the next bag out and we'll start again all right guys so this is now pulling the 1/16 bag okay and you got some nice blonde hash here with a little sediment from the bag itself but you can see that's nice oh [ __ ] you you'll forgive my language tonight I'm a mess so that's that let's harvest NESC yeah all right so [Music] nice that's nice that's nice hash dude alright so we're going to do a little more watching see a lot more all right so to anyone who doesn't know this nuts okay guys we are back now this is the 120 bag it doesn't even look like it yielded as much as the 160 but it looks a little cleaner a lot better thing is um I wanted to mention it seems like a lot of people who make bubble hair this is dry system right there they seem to get a lot more than I do alright so I don't know if it's my bags I don't know if it's my [ __ ] or anything else I don't know if I'm not stirring it long enough but I just don't seem to get as much as they should that's kind of annoying but either way it works we're almost on here we're getting to the cool bags that I call fool that's a [ __ ] production I'm sorry guys I'm just uncoordinated I guess so let's move this along we're going to the 90 bag hopefully the 90 comes out awesome it feels awesome it feels awesome but what happens is as the microns go down in size then water can't escape as fast so you feel like you have like a pound and then all of a sudden when it's all arranged like donk donk but this one looks good yeah this one looks all right boots Rock they mix a little bit of hash stick them right in there they'll miss the music oh yeah we doesn't been hit let's take out an impurity real quick as I said my both legs aren't the best all right so yeah a nice day yeah site good batch nice batch of hash let's get that on a [ __ ] spoon the 90 bag came through get on there look at that chunky monkey - that's nice [Music] got more on there [Applause] [Music] yeah so we gotta wash it down right [Music] nice we'll leave that alright guys this is a nice pull this is the 73 micron bag and came out great I'm gonna harvest this make sure you guys see find it this is one of the best pulls I've ever had I mean look at that that's some [ __ ] up hash man there's a lot more whoo-hoo this is great you know I should do this on camera more often oh my god [Music] Wow this is [ __ ] great look at this - man hell yeah dudes yo we're almost done we're getting towards this is the 73 so right now we keep it a mental note or a visual note on the hash the 1973 killed it killed it so forth so we're gonna see if the 45 does the city justice I mean you guys want to stand for this I could always fast-forward the [ __ ] but I mean might as well and they takes a while to drain the water on these like the 45 and the 25 like I said but oh yeah I think I got a good one yeah we got to do a second law but I won't show you all that I figured I haven't really produced a ham studio in a while that was completed [Music] yeah I think this one's gonna be nice too I don't want to jinx myself for nothing but I see hash oh yeah if it's gonna be a little bit of half it's gonna be quality [ __ ] looks pretty cool let's check it out not as much as the 73 and we now we're getting war in this thing so it's still soaking up some hash [Laughter] so this is pretty good this looks good yeah as I said not as much as the 73 but the 45 looks like but uh nice right all right let's pause you alright guys so I had to just stop and feed my dogs real quick the battery's running out wanna talk to you guys in a minute please hey guys if I could show you quick this is the second pull the second washing I got Rick Lee he's fish man as you go up like that's the 190 that's the 160 120 and then the 90 and then the 73 did great and then the 45 and 25 and you can see nice and this is the first one all right so we did the hash the wife came home she went upstairs to watch housewives so I'm left alone with some hash and you guys so we're gonna go down to the garden and check everything out I'm actually smoking a bowl so mmm there we are let's go to the garden alright we are back we're looking at flower you can see the place is stuffed with buds we're gonna look at the BT y ou G crossed with Spartan cush it's on day 50 it's just about in flush what I'm doing is I added on the last feeding a overdrive from advanced nutrients a sweetener which is I use my Humboldt honey and and I used my microbe which is photosynthesis plus so bt y OG crossed with spartan kush from ph nerd [Music] nice frost on this female [Music] okay and you know down here nice for us coverage they're finishing out you can see the pistols are kind of withdrawing going back in but this piano here this looks like the Reeve edge fee know that I'm gonna have to do comes out the frost hissed big chunky nugs all the way down nice and frosty like her a lot and I can't remember what phenol number it is look in a second I'm sorry about that I hit the cage and it's leave it or not this fee know that I like the most is in the one of the smaller pots that I have so she is female number 11 and this Fino right here nice and frosty but this double it was more like that stunt e1 and AD and she's so right but big number 11s where it's at number eleven nice frosty nerds very so moving right along we'll go over here to a ninja fruit number two I have just healthy as hell frosting up like she always does she's on day 35 ish and she's great okay and back there oh I almost have it dinner let me get over there that's my swashbuckler frosted out nice just on the same day as the ninja for number two over there so day thirty something healthy frosty nugs so swashbuckler now come this way alright so in the middle the big girl here the one that's just taking up most of the space and leaning it over that's a ninja fruit number two also but he's on day 40 ish and she's huge huge and she's Fox Talon on some of the some of the buds that's probably because she has Fox held on me in the past it could be close to the light is so strong to be the heat just the temp does get up to like 85 sometimes not recently but so you can see she's a beauty really Frost's it out as always so nice let's move over we'll stay away from their commission but but here is another big girl which is my Sauer bruja number seven keeper not as big buds as the mint for number two but frosty which you can't really see and she smells like tangerine I mean you can see the frost you see I see a hair but she has bugs everywhere they look good is Riley we came to join us what's up girl but she's dead yelling he out a little bit hold on right from over here don't get in trouble she's yelling out a little bit the sour bruja number seven at days mid-40s and I definitely gave her a lot of newts they got five gallons between both of them and enter from number two and the sour bruja so she think I'm at exactly where I want to be we had asked Frost beautiful alright guys so that's kind of flower in a nutshell we're gonna go check out a couple of things and get the hell out of here ninja fruit number two ninja og smells like black licorice and grape and other things that people told me sometimes when you grow you can't smell too well alright let's go please alright guys so I guess it was about a week and change that you guys up file upload the video that you watched and I had the clones in of alien rip malibu pie of swashbuckler well this is where we're at when we got thick thick roots everywhere and we're gonna transplant these tomorrow probably after work so you've saved our genetics once again all right guys let's go check out that we'll probably make this a little quick and the reason why is it's kind of a jungle in here no pun intended with jungle the guy genetics but what we have in here for the next round as everyone knows we have a sour bruja number five discontinued on mod N but I need to grow her out one more time Malibu high right there budging out nicely you could see shoots just coming up real nice over there is the alien rift down there is nice and then we have the swashbuckler in the corner so obviously he just saw the corner so we have the swashbuckler and the Cologne or the alien rift Malachi we're not cloning that and everything else that's like really grown out like this and this and this one piece is jungle - God genetics it's a ninja fruit cross with dragon's breath you got a bunch of them over here we got nine of them in here all different phyno & their sex and out good the ones that are still in one gallon Ponce I they're not sexing so I don't know maybe they're male but the female sext pretty much but let's move on because I have a lot going on in here here we have three Sauer bruja number seven that you just saw in flower and they're all topped and we have two I mean three ninja fruit number two's that you just saw in flower and they're all tops ninja fruit has these big-ass families like look they're gummy and just each families cover and everything sometimes you just got to remove them you know like that just to get them some light so those are those another ninja ninja fruit cross with dragon's breath and over here are the new genetics which is two beyond dreams from north genetics to velvet cookies from a bruja from jungle of the gods genetics and then we have a which might call it true love two of them but this little one is still surviving so now but not grown teach ruler some drinks proof so those are the next round ball magnetics everything looks good in here that's a jungle but I'm psyched look at the size of this fan leaf on the ninja fruit cross with dragon's breath I mean seriously unbelievable just huge I almost want to pull it off just to give it some light I'll do this one daily that all right so uh guess we've seen it at all it's not much at left so guys have a great weekend I hope you enjoyed the garden update as always this is your favorite deadhead check me out on Instagram I'm there and under 420 deadhead man 420 and we'll talk to you next week be some love later", "iF5Pgpcd2Hw": "oh boy you might want to skip the corned beef this year and celebrate st. Patrick's Day with an Irish Italian potpie Lauren Falcone is here the blonde Italian thank you always all fun to see you and I always buy your stuff I think I get it Myles market when I get it some items - right okay what are you doing you're taking the Irish out of the game I'm doing an easy Irish Italian pot pie with a shredded potato bottom okay the first thing you do is buy a jar of this yes buy some crime in Italy it's at Heinen's Target Koopas miles market Kriegers quite a plug you get but first pre-heat your oven to 400 yeah okay then while that's the store and buy this first though get some sauce it has toasted pine nuts mild banana peppers bell peppers a little romano cheese celtic sea salt fresh parsley no in there oh I knew that spotless and always always fresh stuff and I love it yeah I use all just natural things natural foods okay so get that warming pour the whole jar in a small saucepan put about 3/4 cup of frozen cut green beans you're gonna stir that and while that's warming you're gonna add about 1/4 cup of heavy cream all good stuff so right really really it's great about this is you can have this this in your pantry you can have the other thing in the freezer when you buy cream nowadays it lasts forever like this lasts all the way to April 23rd or something now so it's not like you have to plan by two days or something so just you know stir occasionally let it warm it'll thicken okay great what do we do with this done you will take just frozen shredded hash browns this is the quickest way little potatoes potato this is the Irish part yes this is part of the IRA what makes it okay more Irish if you want to you know par boil potatoes and slice them thin up to you but I'm all about you know quick and easy this is another easy thing you had in the refrigerator freezer and put about an inch Shambala for you layer on the bottom then you're gonna put your Italian sausage you can also use crumbled vegan sausage rotisserie chicken and you can make it vegetarian how do you get the casing off the sausage well I'll tell you a quick little trick you take the frozen sausage you put it in the microwave on defrost for three minutes not cooked but defrost then you can just easily slide it right out of the case comes right on slide right out and then you have these little sleeve buying crumbled right look at that you know works if you run it under cold water sometimes some of you look over to your house to ruin your microwave you don't have one next thing you do you know and I'll show you what this looks like this is an I have one already beautiful this is what it looks like you bake it for 20 minutes so the hashbrowns got a little toasty we got the sausages just cooked then you take the sauce which is a whole jar and about half a cup of beans yep great and I've got a quarter cup heavy cream and I'll show you what it smells great does it it is it's so good what do you come up with the ideas now this this one's called something different this is so it's something crime right crime in Italy is the name of the sauce and that is my grandmother that was her favorite curse phrase growing up instead of saying you know gee damn it it was crime and Italy so she knows that I'm gonna infuse Italian sauce with Irish I thought that's what she would say crime in Italy that's how it got its name yeah that's a very cute story how many different sauces you have known I'd have 12 on the market mm-hmm yeah 12 you were very busy you know blonde Italian then put a little bit of salt pepper if you like then all you do is take a sheet of puff pastry no would you let it thaw for 40 minutes before you use it lay it on the top trim off the edges this looks like something even I could do it's so simple it really is all the stuff goes in the freezer too you can have all this stuff in your freezer and pull out for an emergency yes which is a great way to solve an emergency problem it is then just put a couple Pat's of butter on the top see what's great about that is I would have melted the butter first but you don't have to because the ovens gonna do right how many degrees in the oven 400 yeah that's great so you keeping it you know the it starts you bake that 400 20 minutes you put this back in the oven at 400 420 another 20 minutes I'll get the one that's done what do you think okay and I'll bring this one over we let it cool down a little bit that's why I can touch it I'm not like you I recommend letting it cool for about 10 minutes about 20 minutes or so check it out here let's take a chance what do you say slice it as you would a pie it's always hard to get the first one out right but this is gonna happen easy I'll take I'll take the challenge look at that huh see you so over here like I left a little bit out so you know just go back in there and pick it up right yeah but right there like this you have it just like yet what do you think about me put a little tomato sauce on it - you could do that if you weren't sure there's a little tomato sauce it'd be great yeah what do you come up with these ideas this I just I don't know I just came to me I thought well my daughter gave me the idea my daughter Mia for the puff pastry from the potpie it's a great it is a really great idea really tastes crime in Italy this is a good but the potato I don't know it just came to me you're great why you got a lot of great stuff Aitken 12 different brands and don't you have an event coming up this week or something I do I'm going to be well I'm gonna be at Heinen's rode on Saturday it's my new bullying this sauce uh-huh 11 to 3 so you know how's it going to sample you're gonna put it on something or you put it on probably a French baguette yeah so what time is that it Heinen's on Green Road that's 11 to 3 11 to 3 s in University Heights so it's easy to find a bun to tell you get the meter and then have a picture with her an autograph and maybe one day I have yeah Sunday what Sunday I'm going to be at the Middleburg Heights Community Center on Bagley Road from 1 to 4 success takes working does not bent there so yeah yeah that's a good event it's very busy Middleburg Heitz Werber tights on Bagley it's the community center you got it the blonde Italian see her then so you're there crime in Italy she's a good one yes", "p5tjzjGP5p4": "moving in with another video of warm you smoke and we're gonna be doing the pinkies including more I can melt review yeah it looks super fire I'll have some of their other notes which is essentially hat and its bidding it's been great there's actually another video of me reviewing forget those those are Endicott kind of hash but it was really good it's not a memory alright anyways as you can tell I got my trusty long squirtle right here pack I'm ready to go I was my little Sherlock I don't think I knew this one I guess we did cholera Shirley [Music] and I packed it up full of this Ares Jack Herer bug it is really good bug really good sativa I'm usually an indica kind of guy but got to switch it up everyone so 21 percent THC right here and this I believe 50% fifty nine point two two percent total canopy noise the THC is 99.7 for THC is thirty seven point six five and CVD is zero percent [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Applause] mmm I smiled it is definitely a Girl Scout cookies it's delicious get a nice earthy smell a nice dark color to it so I thought further ado let's go ahead and pack a little bit up of this hash onto this bowl because that sound out look amazing or what I'm gonna have to do some close-ups of this and really show you guys how awesome this looks on the inside oh my god you could smell 10 times stronger as you crack it open it's like I don't know if you could see all the little tiny sparkly crystals in there but they're there and they're visible easily usually all I do it I usually put my ash into a patty and put it on the very top the best that I can check that out you guys want to see a quick note nice lighter yeah [Music] doesn't melt as much as you would think actually kind of lights up way faster and it's way more dry than a last hash I had but that's good [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] yeah [Music] [Music] I was good that's nice [ __ ] good [Music] only nice indica sativa mix and I gotta admit that's awesome it's so good man how do you know if I want to smoke these videos out this hash this hash is unbelievable it's most real good too it's not like that white town that hash where you keep sliding it melting down melting it down I actually just box right up and you get get a good clean here right away you never want to touch hash when he got hash in a bowl even though it's perfectly good nature too packed out of all so keeping that in mind with this bad boy one more time or go hit the ball yes [Music] [Music] that's a good hat [Music] fun's over in the market and you see this Moroccan don't get it I got this brand for about 50 bucks and for the money man you're just not gonna find a better hat honestly I've seen hash go for love but definitely not this quality this is like premium a1 put you on your ass type of hash one-hit quitter one-hit quitter", "2T2rA3jzC0Q": "[Music] what's up world juvenile styles coming at you whether cannabis review so today I got Moroccan hash check it out it's a very nice type of hash it's very sticky and up sticky and like moist we can't you can pull it right apart it's not like normal hash it's just a high rock that breaks off in chunks no this stuff is nice and like Charlie and has a very nice strong crystal II like kind of minty pine type now I'm telling you it has a very strong very clean taste to it just wheat crystal [Music] I'd recommend to anybody that's a very good taste that's a good account like I say every time it's pretty well grab except for the piece I took off this smell so you know what you're gonna be getting when you buy it it's hard yeah it sounds like it's not like the old biker hash it's just a hard piece that comes off if you're liking this I think maybe you should check it out my next couple videos I'm gonna be doing purple candy and rocks so if you're liking this you can keep an eye out for them coming up in a little bit I just did a ice princess a shatter so you can check that out too if you've got any recommendations on what I should do to make a little entertaining well I'm doing my reviews and stuff maybe let me know in the comment section as for rocking hash can turn it in all around I love Milwaukee so thanks for stopping by spending some time over here at juvenile Styles man I appreciate it thanks for the view [Music]", "wDnsYmDCbRo": "[Applause] welcome back to another edition of Canada Canada so yeah we're here now we really need a bubble bag they I've done my this is the 8th baguette big shout out to city Northwest garden supply thank you guys they got you know you guys rock down there and they shout out to g-man thank you and of course refined nutrients as always with sponsors probably bring us stuff like this so we can actually continue to go on now this is going to be the Jason Wilcox rookie demonstration because literally we're back on my channel I think 2000 2008 2007 2008 when we first started in a three bag extraction kit bubble bags and they turned out ok it was the only time we were experimenting with it so watch couple videos on YouTube have an idea of what I'm doing so we're just gonna kind of go through it and there wasn't one a lot of me go ahead tell them good but hopefully some of the questions come out of it and and again it's what we come down and people talk about instructions one thing we're going to be basing the exterior court is their stuff like this gonna last my my camera lady to zoom in on on this you can actually see it here it's like the honey you kind of cherry oil I will just go out like this now this is what they call it using a solvent you know and then purging it so even though it's just done with isopropyl II it's still not you know it's the medical grade product as we would with a bubble extraction water sharks like we be doing so it's one of the things I just kind of wanted to show at the same time there are things out there there's there's no playing with it this is something used to refill my torch but people use it for five times filter butane and there's other ones that go right up like 34 times I think it's more marketing but anyway the cleaner the better some keep in mind if you're going to be messing around this is what I like is that going into court they're looking at what's safe extractions so I say make it home butter making water extraction making dry sip that's 100 percent safe and I think that's what we need to educate and make sure that we allow people to know that those who understand what I'm saying magic eight I'm not stuttering its medicating in educating you just combined by a good friend of mine and I'm proud to share that with you so yeah so we just solve it that's what we have to do it so in this case we're now I'm going to go to to kind of how how about the workers with the bubble bags and another counter so I have an idea what you normally need one of these they're mark from John isn't laughing at me and believe are yes okay so yeah I know it's not going to be the 25 that's for sure so it must be the blue one is going to be the door Craig as they call it I guess which would be the main cut by they got to 20 yeah I'm sure they're all in sequential order to 2190 so basically if we're going to go with the largest size first and just kind of go ahead and put that in there your standard black gone by the bucket easy to medium-sized and by no means am I gonna try and pretend we're doing this process and I'm going 100 times ultimately what you're doing is you're pleased with ice already in the freezer right now my cannabis is frozen dry clones which are on there we're trying to knock off we're trying to get Minnie to Grange their heads but what's important is to understand that each talks like a mushroom you're gonna collect a lot of stuff that's gonna be like your buffer for your hash not quite as strong then you're gonna have your straight heads which is something like oh man it's done such a great job over the years educating line and how to get full melt and no those guys are survivors and that's on the circle maybe one year they are like in the water I'll just ask my camera lady to grab me my medicine a freezer and then of course our water has always took that putana freezer made sure that was gold and brought down as low as possible and yeah again it's a rookie demonstration so once you're done from here I'm not going to draw you through all the slow parts that's gonna ask my camera lady to zoom in on the two different things we are using you see on this one here the the trichomes are just frozen literally to the bag and you can see on the material so I mean this is just really good extraction material it's not a lot that's fine a small run through and and with this one here we got more length on popcorn but on a smaller kind of a smalls off the bottom that you would normally get rid of Jimmy it's just to see what we can do so it's gonna be a combination of the two strains and see how it works out so yeah that's kind of that's kind of where we're at also frozen on top of the ice [Music] so boys so probably that good but again I'm not sure what the bubble is that was there you see my camera lady can look at that you can just see the trikes just loaded so we're hoping this will be a good return on this for sure [Music] [Music] cold and they can talk a little bit about what and why it's so nice to get a little bit more ice [Music] [Music] electricity then we've got our cold water and of course it's distilled water is important here is reverse osmosis apparently that's important if you're in it not sure how much water so that's so again there's from my understanding anyway basically what's going on right now is with the trichomes freezing up in there and it's getting really cold you want them frozen what happens is with friction these little mushroom instead basically you're seeing people show you the look 30 times microscope you look at that then try come to music tell them it's harvested or are you looking at it imagine to be the year and then they're frozen and through the friction you're actually smashed from the heads off and you're smashing the stalks up you know and ultimately that's what's filtering down through the different microns this is the first value the calculators everything through but as goes down through these different sizes sub what we stocked it gets caught up some will be you know some will be heads and of course that's we gonna hear finer melts and everything I can't give the full science behind it that sort of thing someone that's more marks Department but really that's what we're doing is we're allowing at the freeze right now I'm gonna go ahead and go away so apparently did by need I was Joyce Siobhan's and he one of the oldest measures that I had with a crow Bible so I just can go ahead and no worried I seen one video where they just push it up and house maybe the viewers can give you some hints online for next time and say maybe it's better not to but for this time around we're going to go ahead and exist so I [Music] okay so there should be see here lots of bubbles which is something was told to watch for that was about ten minutes I guess we allowed it to go ahead and go through it some spinning cycle and now basically everything that would have been frozen there's still tons of ice cubes a product book too many ice cubes but what's happening now is is we're just going to allow it just you know a few kicks to decide I'm not is allow the heads and the stocks that have broken off to actually falling down through the first main cap screen which is not a big deal from there will then transfer it into that bucket and put the bags in the place here I'll show you all the other at that routine I'm not here to teach other how to mingle clash more to be the foolish Jason Wilcox makes first video so yeah anyway I let this rest now there let it settle down a little bit lots of ice cubes still in there and then once we get the water transfer we'll come back to where we run it through and start sure we what we actually captured a sergeant see you or I was kind of sprucing up with philosophy again in the first catch bag this has one slice new stuff so I'm actually going to put in the sink and probably burn through you mean so on that note we'll see once we get the other guys for the nearest buncha loader talk a little bit about that and see what we get on the return but there's water in there as well as we see an expert all right so here we are back now we know mark that was a lot of time then nobody I forgot it that's a lot of work but just those bags in there probably shoot than that in advance the only was all the way down east you see you got your purple down to the bottom 25 and then of course you'll wait another important one at 45 then your 120 and of course we start off with the 190 so I'm not going to take everybody through the whole you know trial process but there's a holy cow sweat from that some people call their mash [Music] we'll see you guys back when I can actually start to I let's just sit for a while let's gonna actually go down and once again I was those heads that we're talking about will fall down to the appropriate micron size and solder sauce and the other the other black bodies etc will be washed right now which is why the water hash of course one of the purest and I'll say this ways to use Gannicus both at of all events so because human the next part because I'm horrible but let me just actually there can you zoom in on that that's what we're getting out of the 73 micron bag from fresh veggies and down there to find it or Pacific Northwest garden supply this dammit all these guys tips on how to clean them faster awesome guys you can see the change in color it's amazing this one to me the lighter [Music] all right so you can see we go back with the rest of them and then we're gonna show you all the different micron sizes and we don't bore you too much once you know there's a 45 micron white bag 45 my ground just blonde blonde blonde and here you can see the 20 line that we got the 20 micron or 25 micron valued now which is the last one once again about a 1/2 gram or so but I don't know which ones which or which one's going to smoke which way but that was the first attempt at uh using the 8 bag set and we'll show you a little more in a minute here but yeah there's the purple bag before I some additional stuff so that being said on the on the 160 micron you can see that quite a bit it's texture it's funny how the texture changes from each one but this one here we got more out but of course that's the first screen or the second one at 1:20 is this one here and we notice to be good I believe that's one where it started going yeah a little more beige and then the texture started to change at the 90 micron work so here we started seeing a lot of texture change that you can see with the spoon it's just a different texture and then even more so when we get down to like the 45 which is uh yeah my my camera lady's got these all messed up because 45 and 25 this is 25 that must be 45 that must be 90 it's this texture here this texture here you just see it's it's like a play-doh almost and you started like I'm trying to bring it apart and I can't really break it apart it's kind of like yeah so yeah there's just different textures there it's gonna be interesting when these I'm going to put them on to a towel underneath it so it helps to to dry it out with a little family let it go for the night and yeah that's it so for me that was you know how it's making 101 big morning and welcome back all right it's been the night time now of course you want to let the stuff sit out and cure as I understand it again this has been a rookie experiment and really I'm happy with the results and yourself and more interested in the texture so my last one can't believe you come in here you see here like at the 160 micron it's kind of like a dusty almost break apart in your fingers still stick together though and that's at the 160s that's a very big size now we get down to say the 120 here still got that golden pink and this here can press a little better stick to the finger a completely different texture then as we go along you can see these here though these get really hard and it all can be pressed I mean if I take these two pieces here and I just want to press them together it's just incredibly sticky and if I handle it for too long it melts into my fingers and again that's only at the UH that's only at the 112 120 or 90 um then down here at like the 75 not a lot there where you can just see it's nice it's kind like a little cake that stuff as well can easily be melted and pressed together just something that looks like that ain't going to work so very interesting stuff and then what's interesting is it changes color when you get down into like the the nineteen to 4525 so 90 45 25 some reason the 45 picked up the most but in the 90 here we can see that this here is just concentrated and it's sticky and it's hard as a rock right now but it can be pressed together you can see how sticky it is and this stuff like truly bubbles and truly melts and then testing it all morning so I don't quite medicated and then of course you get down here to your last two bags which are your big ones this one we collected a lot in the 45 this stuff's just completely melts in strong's help and again you standard stickiest so but I see now why they have all the different vials and i truly after testing these i can see why you know quite frankly there's a lot of clubs out there written people off you know there's there's a first wash at 160 microns first bag anyway and you can get a lot of stuff out like this but the quality of the cannabis is just low likely because there's a lot more stock in there than there is heads but when you get down to this lower so fear it's just phenomenal and and just seeing the different texture as you break through each tip of my concise is important so on that no one is going to show you the dry and there's some more wet stuff that needs to dry you can see the difference once it dries out it becomes like a powdery whole thing in clay our unmolding that you can you can mold together if you wish but all said that's it you got one two three four five six seven bags they're much so having a bag great oh a number eight deep blue bag carry bag so yeah there's your seven bags of extraction and your seven different colors and that is rookie making bubble hash 101 this is Jason Wilcox and we'll see you next video hydroponic shop in BC

going hi maria marie says hi to everyone as well piper says she keeps refreshing not to miss the beginning oh isn't that we were we're a little late because we were like talking about something after we're finished jamie's like that should have been live i know it's like there's a battle between keeping the consistency of our opener and the stuff that we have going on just before we push go live and sometimes you just don't want to interrupt it so thanks for bearing with us and thanks for joining us for the live chat we always brag on you guys when we talk about how we're on a podcast that we have the best live chat in town so thank you for being a part of that um and we're gonna find out what's up with everybody you could type in the chat your what's up for this week and i want to know what's up with you this week rhonda um well this week i don't even know where the week has gone i um okay i think everybody knows i take medicine for atd and this has been a medication vacation week so i have pretty much done nothing but sort shells all week long um but it's been a lot of fun i uh totally enjoyed myself um my mom my writing partner is um diligently working on some revisions and so that's all on track so it's just um talking to some new friends and old friends and uh yeah it's been a good week i wouldn't exactly use the word alt right i was like where am i in that list that was a carefully curated key word you know the girl scouts we used to call them silver and gold friends oh like we would be the gold friends and then the new friends would be the silver ones oh i could sing the whole song i'm not going to though you're tempting me tina what is up with you tina what's your what's up for this week or should we wait are you last i can't remember no i'm not last all right um well last week we were talking about fans and super fans and so i thought my what's up went really well with our topic from last night and i remember now yeah i got some fan mail and after i read this fan mail i was like okay i'm done wait i don't need to do another thing i'm done mic drop you mean as far as writing you don't need to write another word i have i have hit the pinnacle and there's nowhere to go but down from here well you've got to know what is in this awesome room i'm just going to read you this email and i'm not going to say their names because i did not um ask permission to do that so it says hello christina thank you for following a dream and listening to god and friends to finish writing lost in the land of the midnight sun i can't begin to tell you how much of an impact this book made on me and how many portions of text i highlighted it was like this book was written for me in a way that it reminded me of scripture in the unique story telling that made me truly think about the passage as it might apply to me today you have a wonderful ability that shouldn't be hidden under a basket let it shine oh yes this is a copy of my book bub review this book fiction will make you cry fill you with love and make you realize in god to put your trust this is a wonderful book this is a book i will read again allowing god to speak through it to my very soul sincerely and then her name what a wonderful reading that is really great that's congratulations tina and not only did they person reach out to you personally but they did a review which as authors we all know like thank you thank you thank you for reviews so right right and um like that's why i do it like that was like the whole reason for starting to write this book way back in the day to begin with and to have it have the impact that i wanted it to and i've had other similar reviews but this lady just really articulated it wonderfully so that's right i have a comment about that so jen is very good about saying and god gives you your story he's going to get it out when it's time or whatever so tina could you imagine if you had written the story with your knowledge base from 10 years ago and just put it out there would you have ever gone back to it now with all the knowledge you have about writing you know i don't know i don't know the answer to that yeah so i think the story would have been wasted if you had finished it way back then probably that's a very good point about everything in its time is that what you're saying rhonda yeah yeah i love that and you're getting lots of uh congrats in the comments here tina um i'm also gonna hit the what's up marie's got a good what's up she's uh working on her historical fiction she's been on a couple of guest blogs and an interview for a video podcast video away books wow maria's everywhere lately she's in everywhere and stepping outside her comfort zone i know she's amazing yeah good for her jen good point piper says her book went live yay and we do have people asking the chat the title of your book piper so go ahead and put that so people can find it but um no links it won't work um just decide to write a new short story for a reader magnet or giveaway good idea she's using a character from book two what a great little piece of manure that you could then spread around all right jason says he wrote 5500 words this week whoa he also created a slideshow and uh wrote out the backstory for fun for some of his characters about 600 words for that great job jason michelle says a 72 day writing streak i mean she's sad that it's broken but still girl that's like that's better than you once that's great she's still working on a short but she's got a house guess house guests will cramp your style won't they rhonda yeah spending time with a house guest is more important than writing oh and you're over there they'll cramp your style like a totally different personality right there awesome all right well we got to find out what's up with uh you jen but first i'll just say mine real quick so it's not so much me talking right in a row i had an anniversary this past weekend which i told you all about but the thing i want to talk about is if you ever get a chance to see the sun come up on the um atlantic ocean you should go and do that because okay i'll admit in my ditzy confused early morning condition i was like am i on the side of the country where the sun goes up in the morning or goes down at night for like two seconds and i had to do all of my little rhyming game tricks to remember which it is and and then i saw the sun ball of fire and i'm like i was right hooray here it comes and i was so happy it looked like a big golden egg yolk just being plucked right up out of the water and the sea birds were crying out it almost seemed like they were saying god god god and it was just so spiritual and wonderful my husband and some random guys on the beach both took my picture because i must have just looked so worshipful about it so it's hilarious though because my husband way of telling the story is so i woke up and my wife's not there and her shoes aren't there so i'm like maybe she's in the bathroom nope so i go out on the balcony and there she is exchanging phone numbers with two guys on the beach because they have in my picture you know what i mean so he likes to tease me as our anniversary weekend and i was talking to guys on the beach but anyway if you want to see that picture that's my facebook profile photo so that's that what's up with you jen okay so my what's up is like a continuation of last week's what's up like part two not even kidding if you guys recall last week i shared that somebody had asked my husband how much how my books were selling basically how much money i was oh yeah right it happened again no way a different person do you just have a look on your face that says uh dare me to cut you or what i don't they can't be my face because they don't ask me but they asked my non-convocational husband and so the poor guy like so the first person asked like he was caught off guard and we talked about it he's like this is how i'm going to if he asks a gamble blah but the second person was a different person not only a different person but like he was shocked that this person asked and this person is someone who like loves and respects and this person went further and asked more specifics and asked they said specifically you know i mean is she is she going to be able to make enough to support the lifestyle you guys are used to what wow i i was just like he he he was in the other room on the phone with me with the person and so i wasn't even sitting near him so i didn't know what was going on and we told him about later he's like i didn't even know what to say jen i didn't even know he said i just kind of said to him well i said you should have said to him why don't you ask her because they won't you know because they know me well you know i mean i don't think that they will um but so the first person that asked i was just kind of like whatever rolled my eyes but the second person i'm going to confront them i'm going to in a loving way go to them as a sister in christ and ask them why they feel it's okay to question someone else's finances why it's okay because i'm a creative that you think it's okay to ask those kind of questions and then ask him if he would be okay showing me his finances and because i really feel like it's a lesson that i think the first person isn't going to learn a lesson but i think this person doesn't understand how rude they were and i think that so but my mind is blown the more i think about the angrier i get because i'm just like who like who has the right to do that and so i without using names i had a conversation with my girls their hair stylist who's a friend of mine and she's like same thing happens to her she said her husband she works full-time as a hair stylist and her husband um it works in um he's in like not kind of similar to my husband does but more on like the um the repair side anyway she got a new vehicle and people were literally saying don't you feel bad driving a new vehicle when your husband works so hard and things like that she's like i make more than my husband i'm like who cares if you make more than your husband it's none of their business and she's like people question when they go on vacation like can you really afford this like you know you don't want to get the debt and she's like we are debt-free like i save up for i said who cares i don't care if you did everything on credit card who what is it anyone else's business so it's just one of these things it's blowing my mind but people won't ask the husband they assume the husbands are like pulling the weight like i don't like i need people to help me understand this before i talk to anyone else because i am like mind blown and really mad and and what really gets me when you were saying that all i was like are they just assuming he's gonna like retire and let you support the whole family like that'd be great why isn't that in your lifestyle what the problem is i believe in general it's a general and sweeping um statement okay there's a couple of things at play here jennifer you and i have talked before about expectations for single income families anyway and people feel like they have the right to say when the primary breadwinner is injured or whatever what will happen to you sometimes authentically worried and sometimes under the guise of concern and sometimes the disguise is the money for nothing uh chicks for free dire straits feeling that just because we are creatives we have some kind of easy life where we far out a painting and big cash rolls in our way like what we do isn't really work and we therefore probably aren't being compensated to the level that an executive or an engineer would be because people are jealous that we would have a career that paid our bills even though we're creative so a lot of times it's coming from a place of envy right okay i've got two things to say about this um first of all thank you jamie for inspiring me for my new superhero the one who farts out paintings and other artworks coming soon second of all um in my lifetime it has seemed it seems to me that people who overstep bounds like that those are things that they don't have control of in their own life so they're trying to get some sort of either judgment or control over somebody else's life oh so yeah i wouldn't say that about the second person but that is really good insight i really do think that is mostly what happens um jason said i had a person that really questioned me spending money to improve my writing since i am not published so that really feeds into what i want to say at the end here is that um this person my husband i don't remember exactly what he said but he basically answered in that you know she's got a business plan um you know because it's never anybody that understands the industry people in the industry people that are studying how to publish books and studying the writing industry they don't ask because they they get it right and they also know that it's rude um but people that are outside of it they just assume that like writing is this way because when my husband answered him he goes oh well yeah i guess she's just waiting for that one big break where she sells a million of one of her books no i don't want that ever to happen like that's not sustainable like if you knew the industry you would understand what mid-listers are and how many people make a living that you don't even know their names but their fans do that's where that's what i'm looking at and they just don't understand that that's like the actors that make a lifetime being in the chorus on broadway and they're an actor for life and people make the name right and people want to say just because they haven't heard their name that they're nothing it's not true it's just not true it's just not true piper says wow my rbf must just scare people off mine too because no one asked me never once never once um and the thing too that the other thing that is crazy about this is that maybe it's the way i'm raised too maybe this isn't so shocking to other people my parents my family who love me the people that really though like would be concerned about me be concerned about are my children to be taken care of the people that really truly love and concern me and my family and and the outcome of this have never once asked right never would ask like so how do you think that you know it's probably the way i was raised the fact that this is really rude but i just had to share that again so i know that other people out there are going to experience this and i and i agree with with barb 100 percent she said it was an opportunity to pray for them let god confront them well i agree i'm praying about though because i feel like that that as a sister in christ that if someone has done something what if they were going to do that to someone else i would feel horrible and i'm the kind of person that can lovingly confront this and we can have an educated discussion about it so yeah piper says they're proper in new england they don't talk about finances which yeah i mean that's always kind of how i was raised too like it's just really none of your business honestly oh my gosh this is so good maria says this last thing we're gonna say we're gonna move on but i've also i've noticed a correlation the people that ask how much money you're making or how your sales are doing are generally the people that will never be interested in buying yeah non-readers 100 and they don't understand that yeah like try being supportive rather than judgmental like you could just hear us a little bit more british accents yes we would die for you today can we just get maria on the mic so she can do it right cause i want to hear the real thing real quick or that little girl who read that excerpt from her book she had a sweet voice too yeah we just need a sound bite of maria saying that we can play whenever we feel like it in the podcast i just i just want to go off topic for two seconds and tell maria that for the first time in my life i looked up what a bean feast was and i had no clue i want a beast i want a bean feast from baruch assault why did you look it up like because it's british colloquialism it's not like beans like i always thought like i was like why in the world would you want a bean feast are they jelly beans but no it's like a party that like say an employer or somebody like that would throw for people [Music] would they serve beans is that why i have no idea i didn't look that deeply into it um all right well we're going to use that as a little bit of a segway somehow to get new metadata um actually you are probably thinking well what is metadata maybe if you're like me um who uh rhonda why don't you just take a swing at that definition for us what is metadata okay metadata is the overarching word that encapsulates everything you do to get people to find your whatever item your blog post whatever it is you're trying to get attention to so that includes keywords that includes um category questions categories yeah just anything like that that you would put um traditionally keywords in well the first thing i want to say about that is you say data and i say data or whatever because first of all we pronounce it differently um and i've noticed so thank you for that wonderful definition and pronunciation now here we are talking about why is it important to authors which rhonda gave us a pretty good clue there um the search engines are going to be looking for you right right who wants to speak on that like what okay so we're talking about it because we're going to be talking about amazon but all the retailers kind of work the same way am i right yep let me broaden my definition just a little bit okay so anybody who's been working on the internet which i think all of us have been since the early 2000s new keywords were king you have to do keywords and they've got to be slightly different from each other and you've got to just add a thousand keywords to every post that google might possibly use well in the last 20 years google's gotten really good and they are looking more for user intent so if i type in um um how do i get people to look at my stuff online then they would say google would know oh well this person is looking for information on metadata so it's actually correcting your search phrase to make it more efficient isn't it yes it's getting smaller okay so let me just that's what i do for a living by the way yes before i'm the person over there trying to figure out the user intent right thank you i appreciate that very much yes just to clarify the point at which metadata is important to you is when you are posting something to the internet when you are ready to hit publish on the item right like we don't need to worry about metadata when we're plotting our novel correct no no this has to do with marketing this has to do with publishing yes and putting things actually out there on the internet yes though i would say that you that maybe when you title your book you need to be concerned with this because tina didn't you find you found a definition from um was it ingram spark specifically which is a place that we can publish our books through um that helped me to understand a little bit more so okay yeah they said that the metadata includes title subtitle price publication date isbn and other relevant information that readers use to find your book okay all right so if someone's looking for your book online it's the kind of thing they would use as a clue that they would then put into the search engine of their choice and so jen is saying your title would be important because if you're writing like i don't know a a frankenstein retelling and someone searches the word frankenstein well you want frankenstein to be in your metadata so that your book will come up as a result and so we're talking about how to improve metadata and the importance of it today okay so what are some mistakes that people make with metadata well going back to the original keyword and from just using the old keyword data that people use for so long um whether so black hat seo technology is um tricking google and google is getting very good at realizing when people are being tricked so just um don't do the old seo tricks anymore um so what then do you advise i mean so here like instead of saying a don't do the old thing if we've never even done anything what would you advise as a start look at your keywords what categories have you chosen that's our first thing on the bullet list here yes um go ahead jen it looks like you're anxious no i i finally figured out where someone highlighted it for me and we went back and she actually says i didn't know where we were in the outline sorry i was really trying struggling trying to help out with what we were doing so so what so sorry yes that's okay so the difference between categories and keywords this is where i struggled when i first started trying to figure out metadata and right now i'm in the process of actually doing all of this with my books um a calling for phoebe and tina has just finished doing this this last fall when she put her book out so we had a discussion about this behind the scenes too so categories versus keywords so when you're browsing tina you you explain this way better do you mind explaining it or no i don't mean to put you in a spot but oh that's fine a category um when you go into amazon or whatever book seller you choose to go to um i'm familiar with amazon so you would brow if you were gonna browse for books you will probably use a category to browse and so you um over on the left side on the page whenever you're looking for books on amazon they have like a list and those are categories and subcategories so you might be looking for a kindle book so kindle is actually a category on amazon and then under kindle you might be looking for a romance so you would go from to the subcategory of romance and then perhaps you want a christian historical romance that's another subcategory so you would keep going down and those are all categories so it's almost how your book is filed right that's category on amazon a keyword is something you would put in the search bar i'm looking for a millionaire meets you know farm girl and you can put that in there and if the right keywords have been put in by the author their book will show up so a person who writes let's say romance and say you're writing um uh romance uh like a second chance romance with a baby this was an example i saw like recently um there won't be a category that second chance romance with a baby but people might search for that so this is something else so okay that was a really great explanation thank you tina not a problem all right so what's next should we talk about categories first yeah okay so when you're doing it amazon lets you choose two and what i found with me is the two they let me choose are very basic and they really don't help me a whole lot but tina you you found out how many can we do total you can have 15 total categories um and there's a procedure for doing it you can't just go in and like click a bunch of buttons you have to send them an email and you have to list out each category you want them to add to your book and it has to have that whole thread remember where i said you would go to kindle and then you would go to romance and then you would go to historical and then you would go to fiction so and there's like a little forward arrow in between and if you look on um amazon you'll see exactly what i'm talking about there's a thread you have to have the whole thread for each category you want them to add to your book and then you email that to them and they will add it i think so a data string in case you guys get confused when they request the data string that might be what they mean is all those categories lined up okay so the way that i find categories to be put in is i just go find authors that i know write similarly to me and then i look at i scroll down and i see what categories they are like like um listed in right if you scroll down far enough you can see you know she is 2750 in and then it gives you the category and you can click on that and um then you can go look at other authors in that same category so when you find like the whole string copy and paste it into a word document and then find the best 15 that you think fit your book that's one way of doing it another way of doing it and you're going to hear us mention this we are not um affiliates as of right now but both he and i have subscribed to publisher rocket and we think it i think personally i'll let tina say it is fabulous it does all the work for you and it helps you find your categories but being listed in a category other than just the generic one that you get to choose at the beginning will make a huge difference and tina can speak on that um a little bit here right this is what that helped you didn't it well i didn't i haven't actually added those 15 categories yet i'm still in the general ones that i picked um it's just that the difference between the category i'm in and the category you're in is the number of books i'm competing against yeah so you since you write romance you're competing against way more titles than i am and so because and so when you probably that's one thing that publisher rocket will tell you um how many books you need to sell to make it to number one in that category in one day okay so a whole lot to unpack there's a lot of information going on so what we're saying is what basically make sure we've got some good quality keywords which means no we're not keywords yet we're still in categories i misspoke so if we're talking about categories that's what i meant so we are talking about getting the categories correct what other advice do we have about metadata okay uh just real quick so what i think what is important about this tina could have just listed herself under christian fiction because people think oh i want a broader audience i don't want to be pigeonholed down but then she's against a whole bunch of people and no one might ever find her book yeah the proper category will help you find your audience christian fantasy also being a smaller category also helped my book get seen more because people who are want to read christian fantasy that's what they're typing in ah that's what they're looking for great yeah so then they're typing in that brings us to keywords right so you want to make sure you're in the right category because that's how amazon wants to file you away in their filing system and people when they're when they are browsing through categories that's how they're going to find you right right also happens with becoming a number one and we probably need to unpack that on another episode but when people are searching that's where keywords come into play right yeah because that's what they are in the google box those are the keywords that's what you're telling google go look at the keywords on all of the data on the internet to find me what i'm looking for and on the amazon in the amazon i think in barnes noble when someone goes to search those are keywords as well in amazon like again we're talking about amazon a lot but it really works the same in all of the book sellers but amazon lets you choose seven keywords but rondo explain this exactly what a keyword is is it just like one word or like what can a keyword be a keyword is if you want to go camping this weekend and you want a tent you would type in pop tents or um two room tents or whatever that is the keyword that you're typing in and the longer the keyword is that you type in a keyword isn't just one word it's a it can be a one word or a phrase the longer it is the more specific google can get with your search results um okay so because it's going to search for the whole keyword which is a lot more specific so the results would be fewer is this what you're saying yes because it's such a specific search phrase that the number of results would be less and your then piece of information would rank higher yes okay got it well it's making it very understandable for folks still one way you can find key words is so for me i went in and i started typing christian romance or i just put in christian and i saw what came up next and then i tried christian romance and then there would be they would say maybe christian row must be the first one but then there'll be like four or five other ones down below it go ahead ryan you're talking about the menu that pops up with suggestions yes in google and i'm specifically talking about amazon in amazon when you type in you're looking for something so i tried to guess what people were looking for that would be looking for a book like mine and i would type things and then i would all those things coming up that's all a keyword all those phrases yep okay talking about where to find a keyword your personal experience is the first place you should always go especially not if you're looking to buy something but if you're looking to advertise your thing always use your personal experience for this um okay so you have a book about sleeping beauty if i want if i was a customer looking for a book on sleeping beauty what would i type in i would type in love story with a rose or you know a girl who passes out you know whatever um so that's where you would need to start because that would be actually uh might give you things that google wouldn't automatically pop up with so they might not even be phrases that have anything to do with the word book or novel it might be the content of your book that is giving you the keywords that you would want to put in that's something i would not have considered and how many keywords can you put in depends on what kind of media you're putting out there right like it's going to vary from your so are we talk maybe this is why my head is so swimmy about it because if we were talking about books specifically there would be metadata specific to your book but we're talking about it in general which makes it seem so overwhelming to me right yeah well we're talking about it for authors so probably mostly we're worried about books so like amazon allows seven um i know other retailers allow more when you go to if you publish your ebooks through drafted digital you get a lot more than seven on your website you i think you can put in as many as you want yeah on your blogs when you're doing your blog you know when i was choosing my seven keywords i started like broad and i drilled down as i went and so since i consider my book more dystopian than i do fantasy i actually use that as a key word because that's something that i search for when i'm looking for books i'm looking for christian dystopian and i drilled down all the way to malamute um so yep yeah and another thing too is you don't have to only stick with that you can type in um a good beach book or beach read or something to read on the beach or whatever yeah because because it's you got to think about the person looking for a book what are they going to come in and search for and like sometimes we don't really know like so when i first did my my first two books i did like i explained it i went up to the search bar on amazon and i kind of typed in a few words and i saw everything else that was populated i would click on them and i would see the books that were listed there and say yep that's me and that's how i picked my keywords since then now i'm on my third book and i did spend the money it's a one-time purchase for the the software publisher rocket and i've learned so much and i've gone back and i have fixed my keywords for my first two because that's the thing about categories and keywords you don't have to keep them forever so keep an eye on trends keep an eye on like say for instance all of a sudden you see like say you wrote a romance a long time ago and then all of a sudden you realize oh billionaire romances are popular right now and you realize well my character was a billionaire but you didn't market it that way you didn't keyword it that way you didn't care you can go back and change those things so i went back and changed and um kind of scrolling into our next thing is that remember the beginning tina gave us the definition and part of metadata they included title you can do a subtitle and non-fiction is great about this if you're writing non-fiction your metadata should title your book like if people are really searching for how to write a book you should have that somewhere in your title because that's much more important than the metadata if you can put a keyword into your title great so i went and looked at even traditional published authors people that i've been compared to and i looked in some other books have a subtitle that include christian historical romance or include clean christian fiction and so i went and i'm publishing this book with a subtitle and i'm gonna see if it makes a difference because if people are searching for historical christian romance and it's in my title it's i have more of a chance of getting in that search for them to see that so i'm gonna give a try and we'll see and most of the post-apocalyptic books that i um read on ms from amazon have a post-apocalyptic and then they might even drill it down further emp story in their title title it's a subtitle yep yeah so i would suggest trying that that might help with book sales too but we'll see like we're all as an experiment together but like metadata is one of those things that when you're first publishing a book at least i did i just kind of like oh this is another step i have to do it's on the first or second page and i gotta get to the second page where i can hit publish and i just threw things in there and now the farther i get into my journey as a writer i'm realizing how important this stuff is but the good thing is is that you can go back and fix it you can go back and change it and as a self-published author you have that right if you're a hybrid author you probably don't have access to it and um i don't know like if you could i would if it were me if i was hybrid i would reach out to my publisher and i would ask what are my categories and what are my keywords and then i would if you find better ones then i would write them and say would you please switch it to these i mean you're in a partnership with them i don't see why they wouldn't so that would be my suggestion if you're a hybrid all right can i ask a question and maybe it's um a separate topic altogether because we're getting into the subtitles but it seems to me i'm always afraid to use a subtitle situation because then it seems like every time i got to put in what is the title your book i got to include the whole thing including the subtitle do you know what i mean like i don't want to have to go write you know um a beauty and the beast retelling with an emp twist every time i'm entering the name of my book into everywhere and it seems to me like putting a subtitle was kind of locking you in like that's the title of your book am i mistaken about that it's the title of your book as far as the book sellers are concerned so let's say for example i were to put an e-book onto barnes noble and an e-book onto amazon and i one of them was called a calling for phoebe and the other one was a calling for phoebe with the subtitle they may not like it may not match up as far as computers goes but when i share the title of my book it is a calling for phoebe the subtitle is just kind of like the icing on the cake or it's the the piece of parsley that they put on top of my steak at the restaurant to make it look pretty i don't eat the parsley the parsley i eat the steak which is a calling for phoebe does that help it does help because i think the parsley is ugly and i was hoping to be able to leave it off most of the time because when i see that right to me it screams self-published and i don't like it but if it sells books for people i guess you have to do it i don't know it just looks so gross to me i'm so glad you said that because that's how i felt too about putting a clean romance or a christian wrong historical i felt like oh that's so self-publishing so i went back and looked and i looked at i'll tell you i looked at karen kingsbury because people command compared me to her i looked at um francine rivers because people have compared me to her i looked at a few other authors and they're traditionally published they've been published for years and their their publishing houses are starting to do it so yeah expecting to want it so i'm thinking it started as a self-published author thing but it works and people are buying the books and so now the traditional publishers are like oh we don't want to lose those sales so they're doing it so as long as i can again blend in so because i don't think there's anything wrong with being self-published but there's still that whole group of people out there that don't understand our industry and think that they're right so i just want to be able to have one less barrier for someone buying my book that's a wonderful way to put it one less barrier i love that way of putting it yeah all right so yeah jason james was saying thanks for the question about the parsley and everybody is loving the parsley metaphor that's wonderful but yes i agree it is worth the conversation of adding a subtitle totally for sure all right did we cover everything on this outline kind of looked like it yeah i just want to say one thing yeah and hopefully we will be able to another podcast episode about metadata in the future about metadata for blogging because it's not exactly the same thing because that metadata would be only for google or whatever search engine you're working for so well i can't take my metadata that i get from amazon i can't use it over on google yes yes you can but it would be used slightly differently and um but yeah you can use letters let us know in the comments everyone because we are always looking for new topic ideas i'm interested if you guys are interested in us doing uh a metadata just on blogging let us know because that's definitely something we can do rhonda would be our resident expert in that if we do that episode i'm gonna have to do some research and see how much i can say because since i work for them yeah i know yeah it's quite a confidentiality agreement i might need to just be quiet during that no yeah you can be i'm winking at you tina okay yeah i think that the point is to be mindful of your categories and tags and keywords if you are an author who keeps a blog or who does do a website like i do you do want to pay attention to your metadata over there as well that is an important part of um metadata as an author so just be grateful of it and we may want to have an episode on hashtags i know that's going to make jamie's skin crawl but that again is a form of metadata would you agree rhonda like it's something that helps people find your posts in health it is but i'm totally distracted by the daggers flying out of jamie's eyes right now and you know hashtags are something i just don't get so i could probably again let us know yeah let us know in the comments what you guys think if you want us to talk about hashtags or if you think yeah no we got it we don't need a whole episode on that we're willing to talk about it so you guys let us know well melody is advocating for metadata i'm blogging for author so that might be something we explore in future um and piper says yes she doesn't get hashtags either so maybe we can hash out hashtags together sometime yeah we can get to the bottom of them and why we like them or don't or what the good thing about doing these kind of topics it helps us too it helps us really stop and look at something that we really probably should look at right otherwise we're like ah and then we just keep moving out with other things so getting a lot of agreement on the hashtag episode and i'm i got my name on that list because i don't i just want never know what you use can we stop talking about it because i want our lunch now hashbrowns with the falcon ketchup would be so amazing have you made it with something other than potatoes i like them but don't understand radishes have you had reddish hash browns i have you did not have them good enough then all right you gotta make them for me when you come back to michigan i'm there sure yes all right all right all right you gotta invite me i won't eat them but i'll be there [Laughter] all right so yeah melody is happy she's not the only one struggling to understand this stuff but we're here for you we're here to inform encourage and support you on your journey to publication and so please keep spitting out topic ideas to us because sometimes we all look at each other like what are we going to talk about now and it would be nice if we could um fulfill a request that you all have um so now we're talking about launch in the comments i can't look over there anymore um so we've covered the topic correct is it time to move on to the feeding of the facts our backs get to eat that's fair all right so jen i always love for you to go first so i'm a little glad today yes what was it why are you glad tell me okay so be every time every single time when we sit down a sprint and i'm like i don't want to do this i end up with like a new story idea i swear i need to like i need to keep track of it because it's crazy like everything and i i know i don't know the good the good ideas will stop if you quit whining it's part of the tradition now again it doesn't mean that when i read this you guys are going to be like oh great i can't you know no the characters are inside of me now i have it and i know where this is going so it's really all about me we better be impressed now i mean you set us up to really love it like what are we gonna say oh that stinks you know this is an award-winning spring right now i haven't i haven't heard anything that jen's written that stunk so i'm not worried oh that's why i love you tina all right so today's sprint prompt was a title or topic you did not have to use it in it but i did and it is called our topic today was the spring fling and here's what i wrote i'm not interested in being oh hold on a second i gotta make this bigger mold i'm not interested in being any players spring fling renee looked at chloe doubtfully not even nolan turner's especially not nolan turner's chloe said returning to her laptop seriously renee he is seriously renee wake this womanizer why would any woman with even an ounce of self-respect give that man the time of day well i don't know i think any man can be changed by the right woman said every woman who has ever been attracted to the wrong man chloe thought excuse me come on khloe have you ever looked at him of course she had she wasn't dead nolan turner was mlb's hottest bachelor everyone knew that the problem was so did he everywhere the man went women flocked to him and he ate it up and as the team's ahead of social media it was chloe's job to document or spin in a different direction his and his teammates every moves if renee had had to witness half of what chloe had to deal with she wouldn't be mooning or more correctly trying to get chloe to moon over the likes of nolan turner with a team full of eligible bachelors nolan would be the bottom of her list you would too would make beautiful babies renee gush drawing chloe back from the instagram graphics she was designing she sighed and shut her laptop lid down renee are you are seriously delusional not only is nolan turner the last man i would ever want to date he wouldn't look twice at me there's a team full of guys to drool over why do you keep trying to push me towards the likes of him renee shrugged because ever since you sat down here in the stands he hasn't stopped staring at you in disbelief chloe glanced at the field where the team was warming up it didn't take her long to locate nolan she knew exactly where he stood she always knew exactly where he was and again in disbelief she found that renee wasn't lying nolan though playing catch with a teammate was looking straight at her i would say three two one but i i went a minute over yeah she's like i need another minute i need another minute now we know why because she had to set us up for the da very excellently done now we must read chapter two well probably there's so many problems on this you guys know it's a sprint but like i don't think that a professional player you would call it playing catch like i don't think that they say that they're not warming up probably yeah yeah yeah anyway that was really oh good so but i'm not a huge base i know baseball i used to play softball but i'm not a huge fan so maybe a fan it would have so i have a question you had talked about writing a baseball player story before like do you already know these like is this that story is this some other random thing this is this is part of the series i'm going to do at least three books of baseball and at least three books of football because i am a fan of both so it definitely has the same feel it definitely goes right along mm-hmm yeah michelle and piper both really appreciated it great tension and that is true and i do like it oh very nice piper said i do like it because marnie i think was one of the girls and she was very much trip over herself kind of a girl and this girl does not feel like that so you can tell that these are characters that have their own um reality which is going to make them fun to read changing a man perfect plan haha that's awesome it never works out right but we'll see great that's terrific jake i'm sure he's a people just don't understand him misunderstood yes oh swoony what do you say rhonda you got uh some words to read us about um what was this prompt again spring spring yeah i have some words okay this is the epitome of a sprint when you have no idea you don't feel like writing in the morning and you're forcing yourself so i didn't feel like stopping when i was done but i did not feel like starting when i started now okay i'm not saying it's good i'm just saying that's what happened to me right she's busy working at least jenny thought hearing the thump of something landing in a trash can nettie made it sound like mrs palmer wouldn't be able to part with anything so jenny was braced with plenty of reasons she should maybe neddy was being too harsh on this old friend of hers jenny knocked but when the old woman didn't seem to hear that she pulled open the wood screen door and stuck her head inside and not a second too soon jenny gasped at the site in front of her and struggled to hold back the shrill noises that wanted to escape her throat she wasn't entirely successful the siren-like squeal that did escape caused mrs palmer to spin around much faster than her 83 year old body was capable of and the world war one era hoosier butter churn she'd been holding couldn't overcome the centrifugal force of her action it shattered against the old brick fireplace mrs palmer and jenny as far as i got no not the butter turn i know it's supposed to be positive only but you couldn't you couldn't have heard a person rhonda you have to hurt an antique i know i was hurting myself it was like killing a baby but i did that [Laughter] also i was working on making the longest sentences i possibly could also oh i like it and i love the character names i don't know why they just seem to speak to me i like that centrifugal force made in appearance science yes isn't that around faster than her 83 year old body should have been able to die that was great so great thank you yeah and way to tell us how old she is without it feeling info dumpy i mean thank you great do you know what i'm saying yeah all right really good rhonda okay i'm gonna read my next i'm not super impressed with this piece but whatever it is i've already read it you had i watched i watched your sprint we got done so early today i watched your live sprint are you lying no that's tired so you went back and watched you yeah that's really weird that feels strange to me such great detail rhonda gigi says just real quick while we're doing that and then jason our our um chat is always behind so i just want i want you to be able to see that well yeah and i thought she was going down too but no the churn the churn had to go had to bite it much worse it's worse than the old lady yeah the old lady probably get up and survive she's gonna die eventually but the churn forever oh man hey do you know how long how much that's been through all right goodness goodness me well i wonder do i even have it open here oops okay yeah i do all right spring fling she threw it out the window mark passed a palm over his mouth and took a sip of coffee desperate to hide the smile that refused to stay off his lips i don't know how she done it little thing like that only weighs about 117 soaking wet lonnie's perplexed expression did little to calm the hilarity raging inside mark what'd you do to get her all so fired up worked up ma slid the cast iron onto the table and smacked at mark's greedy hand not until we said the blessing every head around the table bowed but mark kept one eye open a slit as he watched lonnie's sneak up to retrieve the grubby ball cap perched there oops and took ma in ringing her apron with fury she called down the heavenly blessing on the digestive powers of the stomach fixings to digest another batch of her practically inedible biscuits he wondered how he'd ever thought it a good idea to leave this place behind boy that was a mess anyway it's a sprint the best reason he'd never before thought of followed the hardy amen that coursed up from the table at the end of ma's prayer but not before mark snatched up the center biscuit and split it on his plate huffing on stinging fingers before reaching for the k row syrup the woman round here is crazy lonnie said shaking his head that drooped apparently heavy with masculine wisdom and experience with the feminine way that little one who put my mattress to the road while she's just the tip of the iceberg well you don't know any better than to get yourself into trouble now ma said watching mark take a second biscuit and another piece of sausage with that wide-eyed satisfied expression she always wore while watching her boys eat mark hears a good boy he knows better than to mess around with them troubled girls knows better my foot the screen door slammed against the wall as kitty barnes pushed through it he can't keep a woman around is all his problem is good morning to you miss kitty barnes my sad through thin lips do help yourself to a cup of coffee may i interest you in a biscuit now you know a good ol swig of the bean water's enough for me in the mornings kitty grinned and winked at mark she'd been pushing in helping herself to a cup of mark's ma's coffee from the time they'd both been old enough to steal sips of it unnoticed from the woman's very cup you need to get you a woman like kitty lonnie said with a hearty guffaw that sent biscuit bits flying kitty and ma joined in on the joke but ma quirked a brow in the direction of the attractive blonde how had the years been treating her since he left town he wondered oh my gosh i don't know where to start likes talking such great characters so like i'm so there i want to know more about every single person you wrote about today but i really want to point out the head i can't i could not write it fast enough the head drooped heavy with obviously wisdom about women like funny and picturesque at the same time like so good appreciate it the conversation was so regional and so well done i'm obviously you've been around this group of people before yes they live in my head yeah yeah i'm glad you're down the same house i heard that h sound and i was like no don't yeah right the um mother giving him the center biscuit you know he's got a special place in her heart and spreading the k-bro syrup all over it amen sister that's awesome i just love that caricature thanks i appreciate it and i do want to say anybody who has not watched jamie's live sprints all you have to do is get a little alert on your phone and they'll pop up and they're really inspiring to watch because you know she's a great writer but you actually see her like deleting what she's supposed to be doing and like changing words and that you know it's just really fun to watch well i appreciate that little shout out there yeah i go live but the problem is you guys can't plan on it like rhonda said you got to get an alert because it's very random thanks appreciate that oh piper says he loved the inedible bit she loved the inedible biscuits that's great mark eats them ha ha jamie great characters they felt so real oh thanks i love i love feedback time

row of perfect white teeth margaery thought she might vomit she supposed he probably went from mani petty's also then he turned and the sparkle in his blue eyes caused a reaction in her middle that

hundreds of window treatments for businesses just like yours i do not need your help well of all the ungrateful marjorie didn't hear the rest of her sentence because she flung the crow crocuses at the

As they read these particular poems, we'll also display the broadsides. Welcome, everyone and,\nErika, we'll begin with you. - Thank you, Jane, and thank you, Kevin. I'm so excited to be here\nreading with Kiki and Brian and to be reading for\nVirginia Festival of the Book I'm gonna read some poems from my book \"Holy Moly Carry Me.\" This is a book about raising one white son and one black son in the 21st\ncentury Appalachian South. I live in Blacksburg, Virginia, and I wrote this poem right\nbefore the 2016 election. \"Jackhammering Limestone\" You ask about the leaves and I tell you it's been so dry here. The leaves are just\ngiving up, turning brown, falling off the trees,\nwhich all look dead. This might be a metaphor for the election or might be a metaphor for nothing. It's hard to say. Each morning, I wake up to\nmachines across the street jackhammering limestone,\nshearing away more rock face, and turning it to rubble\nstrewn across red clay soil so dry it heaves and cracks. It's been seven weeks of drilling and blasting,\ndrilling and blasting. And that's not a metaphor\nfor anything either except maybe my midlife crisis, which I'm having surely as\nthere's whiskey next to me and I'm up all night wondering\nif I can be hairless again in some risque places. Most days I refuse to believe we're doomed despite growing evidence to the contrary. I mean, it's like the\n1970s down there, trust me. Most days, I listen to NPR on my car radio and talk to one son or\nthe other in the back seat and ask them questions\nthey sometimes answer as we drive home past the pile of rubble and the leafless trees which vaguely resemble\nthe girl I saw on campus wearing an entire shaggy outfit made from flesh-colored\nplastic grocery bags campaigning on an environmental platform for student council president. Her amazing bag suit was\nrustling in the breeze, and it looked like she might take flight, just soar over campus with the drones delivering\nburritos this week as a test stunt. Because our motto here\nis invent the future, which I think about a lot, not as your future in the sense of what I\nwanted to be when I grew up, which I figured out by\nprocess of elimination was not a banker or a computer programmer. And I never saw myself as a mother either, but here I am. More like I would invent a future where my black son will\nnot get shot by police for playing in a park or driving or walking from his broken down car. I would invent a future where\nthere is always enough chalk to leave notes for the next class. We are starting a revolution somehow, instructions to follow. What no one told me about programming\ncomputers for Merrill Lynch to keep their front end trading\nsystems running past Y2K was that I was simply\na dominatrix of code. The disaster that would take\nour building down came later and had nothing to do with language. My cashier at Kroger has an\nepigraph on her name badge under Paula that says I\nwill make things right. I hope that girl wins her election. I hope that someday someone else will enter my hairless palace and find it marvelous. The photos of broken\nglass, the piles of rubble. The future is throttling towards us, and it's loud and reckless. My next poem is actually\na basketball poem, and it is about the time\nthe Cleveland Cavaliers won the 2016 NBA championships. It begins at an artist colony, and I think the only thing\nyou need to know here is that the Pulitzer, the older Pulitzer prize\nwinning poet Stephen Dunn has a cameo in my poem. Too strong is what the announcer dubs Steph Curry's flub shot that bounces diagonally\noff the back board. This is game seven of the NBA finals and Cleveland goes on to defeat\nthe Golden State Warriors, but we don't know this yet because we're still watching the game jammed into an alcove where it's live streaming\nfrom someone's laptop onto a wall at an artist colony, since a surprising number of writers and composers and painters\nare basketball fans. So when the sportscaster reels\nout descriptions of plays, Nate, the jazz critic, says, \"Someone should write a\npoem called Too Strong.\" And Steven Dunn isn't interested, though he's sitting behind\nme, also rooting for the Cavs, saying things like, \"My goodness,\" and, \"He's the best closer for his size.\" \"You have to give context in\nyour poem,\" mansplains Nate, who points out that too strong\nis a hyper masculine way of saying Curry basically\njust fucked up the shot. It's important to note here that Cleveland hasn't won a championship in any sport since 1964. That's a 52 year curse,\nin case you're anti-math. I am well-versed in the\nsadness of Cleveland, skies hanging like lead most of the year, husks of buildings, smoke stacks pumping\nraw flame over downtown. My husband grew up in\nthe sadness of Cleveland, and we return there every\nChristmas to more unemployment, more foreclosure, more\npoverty, more shitty weather. When LeBron left Northeast Ohio, my husband actually burned his\nreplica Jersey in the yard, wouldn't mention his name for three long years\nof anger and mourning. He uses Cleveland sports teams to teach our sons about\nfailure and perseverance with a heavy emphasis on the failure. But here's LeBron onscreen lugging his city's championship\ndreams like a bag of rocks. Forget Tamir Rice, age 12, gunned down by police for being black, for playing with a toy gun in a park, left to bleed out on a sidewalk. Forget that Cleveland is\nthe poorest city in America other than Detroit. LeBron stuffed this game\nwith thunderous dunks, fade away jumpers, and block shots, towing his teammates along\nin his ferocious wake. And when LeBron goes down in\nthe final minute of the game, writhes on the court in pain\nafter landing on his wrist, we all want him to get up. Even the artists rooting for Golden State. Get up, LeBron. Nothing comes easy to Cleveland. The next morning's paper\nsports a photo of LeBron embracing power forward Kevin Love next to headlines about\nVenezuelan food riots, triple-digit temperatures in the West, vigils for victims of\nthe Orlando massacre, and the Colorado woman who\nfought off a mountain lion attacking her five-year-old son, literally reached into the animal's mouth and wrested his head from its jaws. Too strong. In the belly of fear and rust and shame, there is no such thing. To pry open something\nwith your bare hands, look into the gaping maw of\nthe beast that eats your sons, the lion, the bullets, the streets, racist cops, heroin, despair,\nwhatever is most predatory, and say, \"Enough. We will triumph, motherfuckers.\" At the game's end, LeBron and the Cavs coach,\nTyronn Lue, sobbed without shame. \"I've always been tough\nand never cried,\" Lue said. And LeBron at the post-game mic, wearing a cut-down net\nlike a necklace says, \"I came back to bring a\nchampionship to our city, to a place we've never been. We've got to get back to Cleveland. We're going home.\" I'm gonna read a new poem that's one of the poems\nI wrote this summer during the pandemic. And I think the only\nthing you need to know is that Helene Cixous, who's a French writer and philosopher, makes a cameo in here, and this takes place on the beach. \"Assembled Audience\" This morning on the beach\nthere's a small nurse shark, whiskered and flipped on the sand, and right past its shined white underbelly a man, dissipated, pony-tailed, leathery, filming his younger blonde\ngirlfriend with his phone. She's wearing a tiny print bikini, the kind that's nearly a thong, cheeky, and is literally shaking her ass. When she stops, he says, \"Did we get it?\" And she must've nodded no because he says, \"Aw, fuck. Let's do it again. I know what I gotta do.\" Helene Cixous said, \"To be human, we need to experience\nthe end of the world.\" And do you agree with her right now in this particular moment? There's a tropical storm\nthrottling towards us, and everyone is out on the sand before the cone of\nuncertainty sidles its way up the Eastern seaboard. Even a bridal party in\nblush-colored gowns. Even a family reunion in matched T-shirts. So many things remain uncertain. I keep thinking of what my friend Emily, who changed herself to a bulldozer to protest the Mountain\nValley Pipeline, told me. Pipeline fighters, never\nask, \"How are you?\" They simply say, \"It's good to see you.\" It's good to see you, random\nstrangers on the beach. I've been in my house for months. You under your striped umbrellas. You smoking weed in the surf. You fishing from the shore. You, head down, searching\nfor washed up shark teeth in the shell hash, your radios and coolers and sun hats. I know what I gotta do. Buy bottled water, safeguard the soul's passage, check the flashlight batteries, map a topography of\ndisplacement and exile, remain untouched, the hollow space of the body, the nothing of my mouth covered by a mask. Cixous also said, \"My body\nknows unheard of songs, laments, to use a gesture to\ncommunicate something.\" The same crowd never gathers twice. A dead fish can symbolize\nan uneasiness in your body, someone who is unresponsive, a portent of bad things to come. It can mean you're next on the hit list, an occupation of loss. And my final poem is one that\nI'm really excited is included in the \"Voiceovers\" broadside project. And the title of this poem comes from Native American visual artist Sky Hopinka. \"I'll Remember You as You Were, Not as What You'll Become\" If you are fearful, America,\nI can tell you I am too. I worry about my body, the way lately it marches\nitself over curbs and barriers, lingers in the streets\nas a form of resistance. The streets belong to no one and everyone and are a guide for motion, but we are so numerous\nthere is no pavement left on which to release our bodies, like a river spilling over a dam, so instead, my body thrums\nnext to yours in place. When we stop traffic or hold\nhands to form a human chain we become a neon open sign singing into the night miles from home, when the only home left is memory, your body my body, our scars, the dark punctuated with\nthe dying light of stars. Thank you. - Thank you, Erika. Very powerful reading. Next up, we'll have Kiki. - Hi, everyone, thank you so much to the Virginia Festival of the Book. Thank you Kevin and Jane\nfor all of those intros. It's an honor to be\nhere and to share poems. I am going to start by reading the poem that is part of the\n\"Voiceover\" broadside series. This poem is called\n\"Essay in Architecture\" and it comes from my book, \"White Blood: A Lyric of Virginia.\" The title, \"Essay in Architecture\", comes from Thomas Jefferson's own writings in which he described\nhis home at Monticello as his essay in architecture. The human face, it's pine doors painted like mahogany. Human face with horses under each veranda. Perfect parquet tetragons\nof the human face. Human face still legible in old French. Sealed closet of the\nhuman face lit by oculus. Design face, tinker face, factory face. Twine and bare wood\ncomprising a pulley system for the human face. Woodworked face with\nsun beams settling in. Revolving buffet\nsupporting the human face. Entire pewter plate collection in face. Human face as soup taurine,\nas paint chip, as spit jack. Smoke rings textured like the human face. Human face cured, human face pickled, human face brushed with olive\noil, anchovies and Parmesan. Green floor of the Dome Room\njust above the human face. Floating view of the\nface, it's quarter farms. Rough cabins dotting the\nsloped face, partly visible. Human face built to\nresemble a great clock. Great pendulum drawing faces in the air. The next poem is called \"Terrorem\" and it's also about\nthinking about Monticello. Every night, I go back\nto Mr. Jefferson's place searching still his\nkitchens, behind staircases, in a patch of shade somewhere, beside his joinery, and within his small ice house till I get down that pit lined with straw where Jefferson once stacked frozen slabs of river water until summer. Then visitors would come to him to ask about a peculiar green star or help him open up his maps. They'd kneel together on\nthe floor among his books, lavish hunks of ice melting\nlike the preserved tears of some antique mammal who must have wept to leave Albemarle, just as I wept when I landed\nin Milan for the first time. Stone city where Mr. Jefferson began to learn the science of ice houses, how you dig into the\ndark flank of the land, how you seal the cavity. Leave open just one small hatch through which I might\nlift through gratings Mr. Jefferson's cold dressed victuals, his expensive butter and salads, the sealed jars sweating\nclear gems of condensation. White blood appearing from warm air as if air could break and slough revealing the curved\narc of our shared Milan. There I wore silver rings on each thumb. I studied and spoke in fine houses of ice. I knew a kind of crying which sealed me to such realms for good. Old magic weep. Old throb in throat. How much of my fondness\nfor any place is water stilled and bound to darkness? The next section that I'll read from is from the county right next\ndoor to Albemarle County. Albemarle County is\nwhere Charlottesville is. That's where Monticello is. It's where I'm broadcasting from. But we're gonna move next\ndoor to Louisa County, another County in Central Virginia where my ancestors were part of the free and enslaved communities. \"In Louisa\" You wake up because you\nhear someone singing, \"Little lamb, little lamb,\" as if the singer were calling\nfrom across a great distance. You know, as you've always known, that you're the little lamb in this song, just as you know that no matter how far you may wander from the loop\nof sand where you were born, the singer of this particular song will always sing little lamb\nmeaning you quite distinctly. As you slowly climb from the covers, you try to tell the song\nto stop that noise please. But what comes out is, \"Play it again,\" which you hadn't meant to say at all. Soon, the song starts up once more, spinning the long journey of itself. It speaks of coiling into\nthickets of sharp weeds, of slanting across hills. The sun even describes you in\nsome time before remembrance. You wore a suit of woven water and learned to speak\nin rippling syllables. You or someone like you. \"Message from the Free\nSmiths of Louisa County\" You want to know who owned us and where, but when you type, your\nsearches return no results. Bondage was grown folks'\nbusiness, then old folks. We saw no reason to hum old master's name to our grandchildren or point out his overgrown gates. But you want to know who owned\nus and where we got free. You keep typing our names\ninto oblongs of digital white. You plant a Unicode tree and a climb up into grown folks' business. You know old folks don't\nwant you rummaging here, so you pile sweet jam\nin your prettiest dish. You light candles and pray, \"Tell me who owned you and\nwhere I might find your graves.\" Little child, we're at rest\nin the acres we purchased. Those days of bondage\nwere old folks' business. The grown folks buried us deep. Only a few of our names survive. We left you this, sudden\nglints in the grass. The rest is grown folks' business, we say, yet you keep asking who owned us. \"Louisa County Patrol\nClaims, 1770 to 1863\" I pry open the files, still packed with liquor\nand strange brine. Midnight seeps from the cracks,\nslow pulp of arithmetic. Four or five or six at a time, the white men draw along\nthe Gordonsville Road on foot or on horseback, clustered close, each man counting up his hours, the knife of each man's tongue at the hinge of his own mouth. For 93 years and every\ntime I slip away to read, those white men line the roadway, secreting themselves in the night air, feeding and breathing\nin their private column. Why belly up to their pay stubs, scraping my teeth on the\nchipped flat of each page? This dim drink only\nblights me, but I do it. Two more poems. This one is also from\nthe Louisa County section of \"White Blood\" and it's based on a letter that I found preserved\nin the National Archive. \"Mrs. A.T. Goodwin's Letter\nto the Provost Marshall, 1866\" You asked why I raised\nmy hand to that boy, why I gave him some raps over the head. You ask why I took my small riding whip to his shoulders, his head. Why, you ask, when he would\nnot cut logs at the woodpile. You ask why I took him by the hand and gave him some raps when not one stick did\nhe cut from 12 to four. I told his mother, my milker washer, I told her in plain\nwords he must do better. I told her all this\nwithout any improvement. She was insolent, which\nis why my son struck her. He only struck her when\nshe ran from her cabin to pluck up the boy while\nI was giving him some raps over the head and shoulders\nwith just my small writing whip. Understand, sir, this boy had not cut more than two scant handfuls\nof wood for my cookstove, but all the family were engaged to me, his mother, the boy to bring my horses\nto water, to cut wood. Only yesterday he said, \"I\nshall not cut a stick of wood. I shall not touch it.\" So these are the Negroes we have raised. Never abused a single one. Always had the kindest feelings so long as their conduct were tolerable, so long as I did not have\nto stand by my woodpile smelling the woodpile, the smell of the SAP\nintolerable from 12 to four, the heave and snap of the\nclear sap inside the logs never holding still so that I had rather stand in the house, my hands sifting flour across a board, so that, in truth, I had\nmuch rather be still, holding nothing but my riding whip, dark and folded up small. The last poem is a poem that I wrote the fall before I left Kentucky where I was living before I\ncame here to Charlottesville, and it was a poem I wrote\nfor the city of Louisville after an incident of racially motivated\nviolence in the city. A white supremacist opened fire inside a Kroger grocery store, and two elder African Americans were killed in that incident. \"Psalm\" Dear Lord, Dear High Remembrancer, Dear Providential Love, have mercy. Have mercy, thou surveyor of wild flowers, assessor of royal and\nexquisite bee realms. Have mercy, ledger who\ntracks us in the night, who measures without\nspeaking our dark trespasses. For nothing here survives, not the gold-legged deer browsing the bleached office park at dawn nor the minute finch on her\nbranch of long division. But thou, thou, thou absorb it all. Oh, gazer, be kind in\nthy absorbing calculus. Won't be long before thy\nreckoning curve arrives at the junction of our error. How, beneath thy mineral\neye, we walk abroad, forgetting thee, cartographer of sparrows. - Thank you, Kiki. Well, one drawback of Zoom in a reading is you can't hear the, \"Mm,\" that so often is part of us\nwhen we're reading together, so thank you, Kiki and\nErika, for those moments. And more ahead. Brian. - Thank you, Kevin, and it's such an honor to\nbe here with Kiki and Erika. And I just wanna thank you and Jane and everyone at Virginia\nFestival for the Book for making a gathering possible during this time when\nwe can't really gather. I mean, some of us\nunfortunately have gathered and will continue to in Texas, apparently. But since most of us are being sensible, I appreciate this gathering. I am gonna read four poems, and the first three are from a book that came out in 2013\ncalled \"Companion grasses\", and these three poems are\npart of a sonnet sequence called \"Transcendental Grammar Crown\". I'm actually gonna read them backwards, so sort of against the crown form. And a lot of my work is really interested in our human capacity for\nreflexive thought and abstraction and how those things result\nin a kind of idealism that fails us when it meets material and social reality. And in all sorts of ways, it fails. But also a real pleasure in the material, despite the way our thinking often fails when it hits material reality. These three poems are written\nin proximity to a field that I really loved. This is called \"Otherwise,\nGrasses Parable\" To have been built bent to bear witness. To have been thin-stemmed, spined like a mind. To have said, \"It's true. We saw the grasses turned snake, flesh.\" Fall crept cribs of cryptic ribs. We wished it was a dream, but the fields went weird and left. Was it a dream? At forest's edge, we watched\ndark arch over the fields, how trees begin to lean at that\nhour over their own shadows and the voice called the\ngrasses back by name. Timothy, bent, orchard, hair, poverty, sweet vernal, come. Fail better. Solstice brings the field to its knees. Yarrow, flax, vetch. Heavy estival air, a gall of pollen. And aren't you novice again in lit Euclidean gilt? Shadows to true, each natural fact toward\nmore radical matter. A robe of rhetoric. Auric eulalia. To angled praise, fodder the color of how\nyou felt as a child. Pure Bible late, ocher, smoke, and ivory, vellum pages, cut stems, sweet, taller now than grass. You can't but muster nothing. Longing a rope you'd use\nto haul it all otherwise. And then this is the poem that's the broadside, \"Of Feeling\". Sonnet. No monument, no moment, no human passion. Just spiders fiber cantilevered thing hedged best guess a net to register the\ntransparency identity becomes. It's minimal matter, fragile. And then what? Plaint and wait as if your whole life a pattern of spectacular\naptitude for disappointment, your intelligence a broken wing a bird feigns to distract\nthe hunt from kill. It's useless to reduce gesture further. Dear form, are you reason? Are you even feeling? Fail better. And then this last poem is\nan attempt to fail better. As opposed to feel better. So it is called \"Olivine,\nQuartz, Granite, Carnelian\" and it takes place in Johnson, Vermont in the hills above that town. On foot under thunder\nheading in from the west, I wasn't thinking rain but now I am thinking rain on Plot Road while I watch\nFoote Brook do its thaw thing. Ropy cold clear water pulls itself downhill fast, its spatter lathering granite banks with foam. Uphill, up the road, a field mown gold. Its curve is cut by horizon, a veil of rain drawn across it slowly so it darkens in increments. I left the house without\nponcho or umbrella. I'm cold. The good news is the way Archimedes wanted a place to stand to lift the world and Descartes sought one\nthought as certain as the point a lever turns into a fulcrum, this dirt road is a fine place to get totally soaked in the poem. The bad news is el nino. It's a bummer to go all cogito here after the hottest winter in the hottest year so far on record, all the thaw finished by\nthe first week of March. Yet I can feel the color\nthe poem gathers inside me, brown silver interior\nof a dried milkweed pod, everything outside it on a spectrum of wet and getting wetter as\nthe front moves overhead. A little mist sizzles high in the canopy, its sound in the middle distance of the sonic landscape between\nFoote Brook and thunder, a distance rusty blackbirds also fill from the oak they have flocked to, so raucously dominating its crown. When the rain hits, they fall silent. Then there's nothing in the hush but thunder and water on water and water hitting wood. Above, the sky a kind of crushed lilac. Around me, Clay Hill an issue\nof trickles gathering gravity, gathering mass heading\nsouth downhill to the river. Little streams even in my\nmud, in the mud under my feet. I want to say I feel the\npull on all my vertebrae, occiput to sacrum, the water in my bones\nlonging to join the thaw. And thought alluvial too, the way valleys fill slowly with gravel sent down by the surrounding mountains. Olivine, quartz, granite, carnelian, each stone an idea washed\nthen carried by rain. Down Foote Brook's leaf-slick steep bank I slide the way walk and\nwatch begin in rhyme, then fail the way those same activities fit inside each other until they don't. I slip, hit rock, my body\nstops, the walk stalls, and I sit, my mind rising toward\nquiet as the brook goes by, south by southwest. I watch, let the current take over. Over its rocky bed the water runs clear, leaves the distortions made\nby its torsion flickering the way musculature moves its skin, all flexure and shadow. \"Do not move,\" the X-ray tech told me, so I stood and did what I'm doing now. I watched living turn to image, a bruised sort of bluish fluid on a white screen the\nrheumatologist lit up. \"You might have years of mobility left if you're careful,\" he said. I could've looked like\nthat for hours at my spine, the molecules locked\nin degrading matrices, where the joints meet up, spurs curve small bone hooks honed to catch on\nflesh the X-rays see through, causing the doc to write in his report, soft tissues unremarkable. It's weird to be always incurring off-screen injuries I have to live with. The process makes a space in my thought like I make a space on\nthe brook's hard bank, anthropogenic non-point\nsource pollutant, my urine, a potent effluent of medicines I need and pesticides I don't, a pharmacopeia of harm\nfor riverine species. I close my eyes. Rain on leaf-litter sounds\nlike storm wind high above and the brook thrown\ndownhill by its own force, the world coalescing briefly in an unending rhyme with itself, consonant and comforting. I know it's cogito that makes\nit seem my ears make it so. I open my eyes. I get up and go east, back up Plot Road, muddy now with runoff. Off-road landscape ranges from field to forest to dwelling and back, the visual rhythm of\nsettlement and regrowth, clear-cutting and aftermath, my eye always drawn to eco-tone, richly liminal and ugly\nwhere forest meets field grown over stumps. I love what yields green there then dries in thickets, bull thistle, milkweed,\nseed heads in hundreds that luster against the\ndenser screen of trees. I love how birds the size of\nsparrows hunt in the scrub, break cover to duck between thin trunks, the black-capped chickadee loosing its slow two-note\nsing-song sing-song only after it lands a branch. Some things must be\nlistened into appearances. The thistles, for instance,\nrustle, sigh into sight, vatic static in wave patterns that predict wind that hits my face. The rain insinuates\nitself slowly into puddles of an abalone silver, iridescent as a rock pigeon's neck, and the poem starts\nfirst as a color I hear, its stiff, dry stalks\nshaking gray and brown. It's almost pornographic, detail the world offers, texture whose totality is far beyond capture, adequate capture and excites me anyway, as endless as the\nfilaments of beard lichen the same soft bright green of olivine. So I watch, I walk on. I fill my pockets full of milkweed pods, a few still stuffed with floss. I watch as if I could\nforget the harm that happens where the world's flesh meets my flesh. I walk as if I could undo\nthe human self I've become and remain through undoing done to others. Between walking and watching, the whole world slips, goes missing, my mind empty as the chambers of a gun whose bullets have hit\nthe intended targets, residual heat and soft black powder all that cogito leaves behind. I never meant to fire. It's not my voice that\ncries out, \"Bullseye!\" But I find my mouth moves, too, without thinking as\neach species goes down. And then I do nothing but think, for instance, of a cave\nin upstate New York. There a fungus introduced from Europe infected bats whose skin\nspread through touch a syndrome inducing the\ninability to hibernate. Awake, sick bats use up\nwinter fat stores and starve, thinned wings torn, riddled with lesions. As hibernacula emptied in the east, spores moved mortality\ncross- country to 33 states in the mere decade since the fungus first jumped the Atlantic on some spelunker's boots, perhaps, or on infected gear. Extinction follows us\nwhether we mean it to or not. We are the point the lever\nturns into a fulcrum. By wounding the world\nwe lift ourselves up. So I walk the way enthusiasm means I'm possessed by some god. I don't know how to know what I know except to put it on foot, gesture as outwardly useless as boots in a downpour\non a scale this total. Just before Plot Road meets Clay Hill, an abandoned barn leans over a stream that cuts under its right back corner, its skewed floor strewn\nstill with tools and hay. A few license plates hang\non its aged gray facade. I like the look of it the way I like the sound\nof the passing cars harped on Clay Hill by frost heaves that rattle their chassis. Laughable enchantment, the\nsort of ruin that seems livable until it isn't. Thank you. - And thank you, Brian. Great reading. And now I think, I hope we\nwill have a great discussion. So I'll invite everyone\nto kind of come back, re-video and we'll gather\nhere, take a breath. I was struck in these poems at how time bends and morphs and how you each orient us to time. Erika, in the game that\nyou were describing an event that already happened, but you're moving in and out\nthrough a larger context. And then, Kiki, obviously the context of Virginia's history with inequality and violence on race permeates the poems. And, Brian, cogito you're calling it, and I'm hearing in that this thinking mind, this\nself that abstracts, as you started with in those poems that you read from \"Companion Grasses\". So I'm just curious to\nhear a little bit more from each of you, if you wouldn't mind\nexploring that aspect of time, trans-historical or how it moves and speeds up and slows down for you and what kind of\nresponsibilities maybe you feel as a as a director of that flow of time. Yeah, any part of that you want to grab. Kiki, should we, will you start? - Yeah, I think I can grab onto that. Very astute observation, Kevin. And I think that my relationship to time in the poems that I read for today goes all the way back to how I think that lyric\npoetry operates in general, which is I believe that the lyric poem is, it preserves the movement\nof the mind of the poet across the subject matter. So the poems that I find\nmost interesting to read and the poems that I aspire to write are not poems that already\nknow what they think or already know what they're going to say about the subject matter, but rather poems that\nuse the space of the poem to think through a problem. And in that way, we may approach poetry\nwith the same urgency that we may approach\nphilosophy or divinity or any other area of humanistic inquiry. Poetry is a place to think about problems, and in so doing time passes and the poem then, the completed poem, is the artifact or the trace of the time that the poet spent thinking\nthrough those complexities. So when you are talking about history there's historical time\nwhich has already passed, but that time becomes more\nkinetic in the space of the poem because my thought about\nthat problem takes time, exists in real time. And so the poem is a place\nwhere you may time travel. And then the reader reading\nthe poem gets to travel along with the poet as well. - Can I add two things to Kiki's thoughts? Because that was so beautifully said. I work in narrative more often than lyric. And I think one of the really\nfascinating things to me that kind of blew my mind\nin writing \"Too Strong\" was my partner would sit and watch the recording of the\nCavs game after they had won and still be so nervous because he had been so traumatized as a Cleveland sports\nfan that they would lose, even though he had already seen that particular narrative happen that I think narrative can kind of create that same space in some way. And I use the term trauma\nloosely here for that experience, but I think it's that old saying\nby I think Einstein of repeating the same action and\nexpecting a different outcome. One thing narratives can do, particularly if they're\njammed up against each other in new ways is create a new outcome,\nis create a new story. And while it doesn't\nnecessarily move time forward, it gives us new meanings for\npast, present, and future in, I think, a similar way to lyric. Or can. I think the really other\ninteresting thing to me is that we're always experiencing\npast, present, and future in some ways simultaneously. Our brains are always moving and living in those moments\nin really simultaneous ways. When I walk down a street in New York City that I walked down as a child, even if different stores\nare on both sides of me, I'm experiencing the street in the moment, I'm experiencing the sense\nmemories from when I was a kid, and I'm also often thinking\nabout what's gonna happen next. And so I think those aren't\nthings that are separate to me, and poetry allows me to\nexperience that clash or that melange of past,\npresent, and future all at once. - And I wanted to, I love\nboth of those answers, and I wanted to add something which is when I started working\non \"Companion Grasses\" and really thinking about a\nhistory of environmental writing and what it might mean to\nkind of join that history or be in dialogue with that history, I read a really wonderful\nbook by the writer Rebecca Solnit called \"Savage Dreams\", which is this history, it's\nmultiple histories of the West. In part, nuclear testing in Nevada and then also water in Northern\nCalifornia and Yosemite. But one of the things that, this idea that it's pretty simple but I think it was really helpful to me was that we never look at\nlandscape with fresh eyes. We're always, because landscape\nis already a cultural idea, it's already sort of a kind of palimpsest of quotations and inheritances in that we cannot look\nat anything, actually. But the natural world and other bodies, they're always this kind of\nmelange of received ideas. And so one of the things that is important to me in my own writing, thinking about the past\ninhabiting the present, is bringing forward some of the ways in which some of those thinkers or some of those ideas\nthat shape our perception and experience of the present tense because those also determine\nhow the future as we know now from the environmental crisis, the global environmental crisis, we know that that actually\nwill shape our future. We know that also in\nterms of racial justice, in terms of gender justice. These ideas from the past\nactually have determined both our own healthcare, our\nown safety in the present, the way public spaces are experienced, and will continue to do so\nunless we examine those ideas and change the way that material, they shape our material realities. And so I do see that work\nof kind of bringing forward and examining our inherited ideas and making ourselves responsible for them and how they get deployed\nboth in our own work but also in social space. And a crucial thing that, an otherwise sort of\nrarefied habit of quotation that we inherit from modernism, let's say, it can actually be utilized\ndifferently now, I think, in ways that are much\nmore critically reflective and justice-oriented, for lack of a better word. So I think of that as, I think sometimes of\nquotation as this portal both into the past and into the future. Yeah.\n- That's great. And maybe even building\non that in a sense, across the books, as I\nwas reading these poems, presences that really are\nasking for a poem to be written, either quite literally or that is the feeling that a presence that the\npoet's encountering is feeling and experiencing and it is pushing. So could each of you speak\nto that a little bit? Have you been, have you felt those times, and maybe how does it\nfeel when you were called, you were asked to write? - Kiki, do you want to begin again? - Yeah, Kevin, so I think if I\nthink I understand you right, it's about subject matter, like what do we feel called to write about and when do we feel called\nto write about those things. With regard to my latest\nbook, which is all about, well, it begins with my own\nconnections to Virginia. I had never really written\nin a formalized way about the time I spent at the University of\nVirginia as an undergraduate. It was an intense time and a\nwonderful time of learning. It was also a time that\nwas full of change for me. My parents separated and then divorced during the time that I\nwas an undergraduate, and my grandfather took his own life during the time that I\nwas an undergraduate. So in writing about my\nexperience of Virginia, all these other things came up that had been a part of\nmy experience for 20 years but that I had never told\nanyone, really, in words or expressed through my poetry. And when I think about\nthe book and how it grew, I think that it's a book\nthat I could only write now after having lived those 20 years and having gone back into time to recollect what it was\nlike to be a student here. In doing that, I also needed to engage with ancestral connections to Virginia that I always knew about but that, as a young person,\nI didn't explore fully and didn't have a\ncatalyst to explore fully until my grandmother\nwho was from Virginia, until she passed away in 2015. At that point, I realized that if I wanted to know more about my grandmother than what she had told me herself that I would have to research it and I would have to find out\nwhat the connections were and the depth of those connections. So those paths of inquiry\nentwined themselves and began to feel like a calling, began to feel like work\nthat I needed to do that needed to be\ncombined into one project. And I don't think I would\nhave been ready before now to have engaged those questions. So I think that things\nmay always be inside you that could be potential subjects for poems but there are some poems that you need to be in the\nright place in your life to begin writing them. - I would definitely agree with Kiki a hundred percent on all of this. I started \"Holy Moly Carry Me\" the day of the Newtown school shootings, and I arrived at Virginia tech in 2007, the fall after the mass shooting here. And one of the things I never\nthought I'd be writing about before I got here was gun\nculture and gun violence, and a lot of the book\ndeals with that element of living here in Appalachia. And I think it took a moment where the age of the children who are\nbeing gunned down in Newtown were the same age as my children. And that was something that felt like it forced me\nto enter that conversation in a really palpable way. And there were all these other\nreally dire things going on that are still going on, the immigration debate,\nthe election protests, unarmed black people getting\ngunned down by police. And all of those things had\npersonal connections to me, but I wasn't able to really process a lot of it before the moment where Newtown kind of spurred\nme into starting to write it. So I think sometimes they're\ncatalytic events, too, that push you to the moment of I'm gonna to write about this. I think one of the things I was hoping while I was writing this book was that it would become\nobsolete before it was published. And that just didn't happen. The Orlando shootings happened right as I was finishing it up, and there had been a lull. And gun violence is something obviously that keeps happening. When you write about\nsystemic issues like racism, like violence, like environmental crisis, they're issues that\nunfortunately keep happening. And how we choose to address\nthem as artists, I think, we all, the three of us work through them really differently but all through, to some extent, our personal connections,\nexperience, and observations. - I loved that. I love the way the three\nof us are working that way and in these kind of parallel tracks. 'Cause I think all three of us maybe also begin on some level\nwith a somatic knowledge that eventually needs\nto, at whatever point, either through research or through a kind of chance\nconjunction of historical events gets catalyzed and into\npoetry and into music and into narrative. And I think for me, writing \"Doomstead Days\" started when I still lived in California and there was an oil spill, a tanker. The Cosco Busan grazed the Bay Bridge and then leaked I forget how\nmany thousands of gallons, 47 or something thousand gallons, 58,000 gallons of fuel into the bay. And I had actually never lived, even though I grew up in\nthe Exxon Valdez spill. Y'all remember it. It was a thing in the childhood, and we all remember Dawn\ndish soap saved the day. I had that as intellectual knowledge but I had never been near an oil spill and I had never seen\noiled water in person. And I had also never visited\na Marine animal rescue center and actually watched the\nbirds get scrubbed down with Dawn dish soap and\nlittle tiny toothbrushes. And it was actually watching a cormorant, an oiled cormorant kind of thrash in the hands of one of the\npeople who were trying to help it that was the trigger for the book. That was the moment where all of the intellectual knowledge I had about environmental catastrophe and crisis and all of the reading I\nhad done in the history, in the various environmental histories and natural history and\nenvironmental writing, it all sort of coalesced into, finally, a crystal of experience and a somatic bodily knowing that made me actually, it hooked my body into my conscience and the two fused and I was\nlike, okay, now I hear the call. This is, and I know this in\na way that I am pulled into and that I will never\nnot be beholden to again. And so for me, the rest of the book, that is in the first poem in the book and the rest of the book, even though I moved from\nCalifornia to Philly, I read Philly through that lens of being beholden to this\nlarger network of creatures and how we're sort of all kind of deeply enmeshed in the oil\nindustry in various ways. So for me, not unlike for y'all, there's always some, there's always an experiential moment that calls my knowing into a more forceful relation to the poem and that demands to be spoken. And I think of it as conscience, too. I mean, it's also music\nand it's also feeling, it's all those things, but there's a core of\nconscience now for me that's part of that calling. - It's amazing this far\ninto this incredible reading and set of questions conscience\ndidn't come up earlier 'cause that's a great tie here. You have all been wonderful. I thank you for taking\nus into these places, sometimes difficult, certainly complex, and being so thoughtful\nstewards with that attention. I think that the festival\nhas granted us a wish for this excellent work, and that is knowing we have been so relatively restricted in our movements, you're going to get to\nwish you were anywhere. If you could travel after this reading, boom in your minds, you were there, where might it be? Just a quick maybe what and\nwhere and why. Rapid fire. Let's reverse it. How\nabout you first, Brian? - I would be on Hawk Mountain\nin Central Pennsylvania during the fall raptor migration, watching, being part of the raptor count, watching all of the\ndifferent species of raptors make their way southwest\ndown the Appalachians. It's just one of the most beautiful, kind of incredible experiences. And then also it's very social. You're there with all the\nscientists doing the counts, and it's kind of like a\ntailgate party but for birds. - How about you, Kiki? - I would be home in my mother's house. That's what I wish for. It's been more than a\nyear since I've seen her, and she's gotten her first vaccinations and so I have high hopes\nthat my wish will come true, that we'll all be vaccinated soon, and that I'll be able to go and enjoy being with family again. - And I haven't been\nalone for about a year 'cause I've been in my house\nwith my children and my family, so I would love to take\nmyself to New York City and check myself into a\nhotel for a night by myself and go to the Whitney and the revamp MoMA and hang out with the art and then have dinner with my parents who I also haven't seen in over a year. So, yeah, I would love to\ndo all those things someday. - That would be great. And it is my wish that they\nall come true before too long. Thank you all again. Thank you, Erika, Kiki, Brian. I'd also like to thank\nthe two amazing artists, Mike Powers and Liz Faris, who had a role in the amazing broadsides we saw and the folks at the\nVirginia Center for the Book, the artists who helped making it. Thanks to everyone who's watching, and please consider. These are great company while\nwe are relatively restricted. These books, consider buying them from your local independent bookseller or using the link to UVA\nBookstore provided on VABook.org. You can also check out other\nevents for the all-virtual 2021 Virginia Festival of\nthe Book at VABook.org. Thanks again, everybody.

2019 so it's it's really lovely to be able to bring a writer back who's been in our studios and has been working on their work um to come back in this role as a visiting writer thank you so much for being here and now i'm going to turn it over to crystal to hear her beautiful words and invite her to read for us thanks crystal thank you um thank you sarah um i'm going to read a story that appeared in um story literary journal um and i think i was actually working on this story when i was at vermont studio center um as a matter of fact i was telling my students the other day this is a story that i've been working on for a number of years and i dug around in my computer and was able to find evidence of this story from 2006. so it's been in the world uh in the making for a very long time i think the only other thing that i will say about it is that often i give myself a writing exercise when i'm writing and so my writing exercise was um a braid of sorts so i wanted to write about cats i wanted to write about racial justice and i wanted to write about um homesickness so it is called endangered species case four seven four zero one for tony k bombara all black women got this thrombin thing inside us but don't nobody notice which is understandable if you know the history of the world but that throng just sits in our bellies and then one day it comes on so strong that we can't stop it even if we want to and that's when your statue of liberty might get climbed your abusive husband might get shot that's when she might quit that stupid-ass job with her manager who says she can't wear dreadlocks that's when she'd be in the corner curled up crying her eyes out over somebody black she don't even know they got killed somewhere again because that somebody feels like a sister or auntie or cousin you might see her on the front lines of a protest when she ain't never done no like that before loud and regal and effective and then when you see her out there yelling and screaming until her voice is horse looking like a goddamn goddess that's when you'll pay attention but you won't even know why but what you don't realize is this this thrum been with us always these are the thoughts that came over me while i was cooking breakfast that morning in my new kitchen which i'm sure wasn't the first time a black woman had discovered the deep insides of herself but it was the first time for me big v was moving up in the world but it never been my plan to live that far away from my people before his promotion we'd been perfectly settled into the second marriage thing as though there was there had never been a first marriage for either of us but since we packed up and moved and big v was uh acting a fool something had climbed into my stomach and was just there humming big v was his own version of his best self that morning sprawled out across the new couch reading the newspaper with one of his work boots planted in the cushion and the other one on the floor i wanted to say vincent pickens get your feet off the goddamn couch but i could feel something deep under my skin around my belly shaking and jittering so i was trying to pay more attention to me to that feeling instead of him two months in that new house and there was my man with his uniform press his name freshly embossed in blue letters on his white shirt pocket his face cleanly shaven and his face shaped up by his own two hands his mouth just to going his boots all up on the furniture all arrogant if you didn't look closely you couldn't see the tiny letters letters underneath his name that said supervisor enrolling cursive but you could feel supervisor every time he moved he even smelled like supervisor with all that cologne on [Music] i sliced potatoes into the skillet for hash studied my hands which had started shaking i wanted to talk to my mama more than i wanted anything else at that moment but i kept on cooking out the window was six stray cats preening and stretching in the backyard a gray one was perched on the patio chair fat and round looking proud of itself the cats came to the backyard nearly every day to make themselves known they'd been there since we moved in big v didn't pay them no attention but i did crazy big v said that morning these he was huff puffing up into somebody's politician right in front of me you would have thought he was running for president not leading a production team at the factory talking about these are the end of times as we know it i can tell you that these are crazy this man at work nathaniel remember me telling you about nathaniel he peered up from the herald and looked at me sideways like he was waiting for me to answer bae he said i wiped my hands down the front of my t-shirt stirred the potatoes in with the steak and diced onions into it he went on and responded with the occasional huh and i know that's right baby but i was really listening to was the pulse in my own neck thumping i looked out the window again and the cats were gone by the time baby girl moped down the stairs i had turned the biscuits same biscuit recipe i've been using all these years but it was the new stove i guess baby girl threw her backpack into the chair and flopped down at the kitchen table when we moved back home she asked and rolled her beautiful eyes at big v who had stopped his proselytizing just long enough to flip on the tv big v wasn't her real daddy but he'd been in her life for the four years we'd been married they got along but were more like tolerating church members in real family or at least that's how it was then he looked at her i threw the biscuits in the trash can my heart clicked and ticked in my chest and it seemed like the thrumming thing that was winding and winding like a goldfish fishbowl little v began to cry from his room upstairs and i dropped the skillet of hash in the floor shattering the corner of the new tile which had been white and gleaming like something off tv just minutes before damn big v said and looked at me all silly but he didn't say nothing else we ate cold cereal for breakfast which i regret now and i also regret that me and him didn't even kiss goodbye later that morning little v played on the carpet in the living room while i slung cardboard boxes into a corner of the garage and scattered my prized possessions around me in a circle on the kitchen floor a picture of mama sarah and a stack of yellowed recipe cards that belonged to mama a box of unopened white linen that somebody brought us as a wedding present and a whole lot of stuff that had come to mean something to me i was just standing there looking at all my heirlooms when i saw through the living room window a woman traipsing up our sidewalk looking like an after school special with that blonde hair curled around her chin green sweater with bright red apples and yellow and green one two threes plaid culottes and white stockings the doorbell rang just as i was wondering if she had the right address are you the lady of the house the woman said i am i said and held the storm door open just a little can we count on you the woman said and shoved a clipboard through the crack in the door a man across the street was sweeping his sidewalk a woman was ushering a girl into a waiting car an old woman was sitting on a porch in a rocking chair holding a dog they were all watching they were all white i held the box of linen across my chest like it was a shield the woman looked past me to the other unopened boxes scattered across the floor she rubbed her nose cleared her throat and asked if she should come back when things were in order i didn't say nothing but the throne was shifting moving around my belly button in a circle now like a ferris wheel we've got to have some way to control them she said and got to clicking that ink pen against her clipper the petition would i place my fist on one hip which should have been some kind of warning to her because that's how i meant it little v was crawling across the carpet and i could hear him getting closer and closer to where i was standing my word the woman squealed when she saw him like she'd seen one of the kittens from out back she was still stretching her neck to see inside our house i could see my new neighbors stopping whatever they were doing mid-sentence mid-cut mid-walk to stare i took the petition thanked the woman and shut my door ain't that some i said to little b i handed him a teething cracker and rubbed my palm across his head in both cheeks my sweet sweet boy i placed the box of linens on the couch and read the paper the woman gave me what kind of people write a petition to kill cats i said this out loud but i thought i just said it to myself cats i said because i just couldn't believe it little v stopped his playing and looked up at me like he knew what i was talking about people crazier than hell little v i said i took some aspirin out the back window i watched the stray cats come back out of the woods and stretch themselves in the sun little v stayed content as long as i was in sight he was playing with a toy car slobbering if them cats had been house cats they would have been something else magnificent the black one lounging on the arms of a couch a man rubbing its head or a girl cradling the yellow one like a doll while she played and watched the cartoons but they were furl at least that's what the woman had called them but i didn't see too much wild about them i'd petted one of them when i threw scraps out there i kept watching and a few younger ones made uh followed the the big ones out and the kitchens began the kittens began to stretch and yawn beyond the yard was a grove of trees i was surprised that the trees looked like they had always been there naturally and not like trees planted just to make a subdivision look comfortable even from the window i could spot oaks and sycamores during the day when it was just me and little v that was my favorite thing to do i loved looking at the trees little v lifted his head somewhere a line from billie holiday twisted its way through my head like the rest of us my history with trees is complicated but i'm a black woman who loves me some trees you're not gonna make take everything from me and i will tell anybody that you ain't taking my love for trees away the sky was brilliant that's my mama's favorite word i could see the words straight ahead the wood straight ahead to the right and the left a long row of big white houses which looked just like the one i was standing in disturbed the land i was sure that where our house stood a farmer attended a field once or maybe it was part of an untended land left wild at least it seemed that way to me and even more years back a row of brothers and sisters work in a row of corn or tobacco or young wyandotte woman picking berries now i know some people don't think like this but this is the for real the kind of stuff i think about no matter how you think most black women are i'm trying to tell you something about me after that i went out into the garage for more boxes and a quick smoke that's when i saw a mouse a different kind of woman would have screamed bloody murder but i didn't its tail was long curled upwards like a thin ribbon maybe that's how they grow up here i was just looking at it when i saw a sparkle in the tiny eye of my first friend from the midwest what's up i said how do buddy i knew if i could have gotten close i could have crushed him with one stomp from my shoe i've seen daddy kill copperheads like that on the farm back home the amazing power of one focused black man womp then suddenly with the heel of a work boot the crooked world was safe again but that mouse just like them cats just like me wasn't bothering nobody so i left him alone i called mama and she said yes i sure do remember uh-huh sure do when i asked her if she remembered daddy stomping them copperheads like that we both held the phone and just listened to each other's breath you like it any better mama asked me i don't know don't see many black people up here i said they killed us out in that part of the country oh mama i said this is the 21st century i thought about the history of the south and i thought about the north too and the things i saw on the news every day and all them black women with a throwing in their bellies i wanted to explain to her how maybe they were making a difference but black people were still dying every day so i couldn't be sure so i didn't say nothing about it me and mama don't talk about stuff like that but i knew at any moment that the answer set right in my own gut i wondered if mama could hear that epiphany or whatever it was through the phone or if she ever listened to her own insides but i didn't come out and ask her i wanted to tell her about the white woman and the mouse and the cats and even about big v acting siddi but i didn't i know what i know mama said i noticed a spider crawling across the ceiling that i'd have to get to later but maybe he needed to be free to he was minding his own damn business ain't that what we all want just to mind our own damn business then mama said so really baby how's everything really what i said was fine but i really wanted to start crying and that was before anything much had even happened how's my grandbabies she said fine that man of yours awesome mama laughed so hard she got chopped she got choked awesome she said you know his ass ain't awesome we all good mama i said and i wasn't lying i ain't no miss cleo how was i supposed to know what was about to come can you read minds do you know the future after we got off the phone i held the phone up to my ear a while longer listening to it buzz across three states missing my mama like crazy it wasn't but a few seconds later that the doorbell rang again here comes this woman with her cat killing petition at my door a second time sometimes i just sit back and try to imagine a whole room of white people sitting around in a meeting talking about killing cats is that what y'all doing when so many black people are on cooling boards all over this country the door was cracked a little and i heard her open it up all the way lady of the house she yelled and i came around the corner holding little v just in time to see her foot about to cross my damn threshold did you hear me say my what the hell right as i rounded the wall from the kitchen i felt dizzy i felt a catch run through my stomach that just about doubled me over i swear before god i'd liken it to labor pains how you just come up in somebody's house lady i said and my voice was slow and low because i knew this wasn't going to turn out right i knew it from that moment right there i could feel my face flushing my ears burning like they were on fire i juggled little v on my hip but he was steady trying to get down and play we need 50 more signatures she said as she stepped backwards onto my porch i don't have time for this i said i done told you once and as i was trying to close my door she stuck her foot right in my front door yes can you believe it have you had time to consider our materials she said i said to her now i ain't gonna tell you not one more damn time little v shifted back in my arms away from her i tried to scoot her foot out with my own foot but that crazy ass woman had her heel wedged in good how long have you lived here she said and had the nerve to raise her pen up above her clipboard like this like she was about to write down whatever i said what that's what i said what just like that little v was crying because he wanted me to put him down but i felt like i needed to keep him in my arms through all of this instinct mother's tuition i guess do you have a copy of a mortgage release that i could see the woman said i opened the door wider to make sure i heard her right i leaned my face toward hers and i'm not lying when i tell you that i wanted the tip of my nose to touch the tip of hers to make sure i heard her right what did you say i said do i have what she repeated herself then got a little scared look on her face before she stepped back and removed her foot i slammed the door closed but before i could lock it the woman grabbed the doorknob and turned it with little v in my arms i was losing this game of tug of war by now my my head felt like there were marbles rolling around in my skull that was the worst headache i've ever had in my life and let me get be clear my throat was there constantly i knew how it was going to end up then and there was nothing i could have done to stop it she yanked the door open wider and stepped one foot back in then came this whooshing feeling just beneath my heart now i'm telling you it was never my intentions to lay hands on that woman but when she wouldn't remove her foot from my door i pushed her out as hard as i could yes i did that i sure did i pushed her out of my door she tumbled to the sidewalk her pen went one way and her clipboard one another her skirt was bunched up around her waist all the stuff in her purse flew across the grass and her stocking was torn and it did look like her knee was bleeding but she wasn't dead and you know i know she ain't dead now i ain't killed nobody right you sat down and talked to her right she's still living some of the neighbors had stopped in their yards at their mailboxes in their driveways to watch i could see the tall woman wearing a sun hat and glasses peering at me from across the street she shook her head and adjusted her water hose before coming back to watering her flower bed the mailman started up our sidewalk and then kept on going to the next house when he saw us out there i threw up my hand at him and he didn't speak i closed my door and locked it ain't that what people do all over the world close their doors lock it and think they're safe from the couch i peeped through the blinds and a few neighbors came to her aid and helped gather her things she banged on my door and get and yelled we'll see about this and then suddenly it was quiet again then later in the afternoon i was back in the kitchen little v was playing with a toy that my mama bought him that bounced back upright every time he would knock it down the boxes were piled around him pictures turned on their backs when i wanted them to be hung along the wall all these pictures with my people's faces on them generations and generations of my family you got that kind of family you got family like that little v was cute all right most babies are but when i heard him cooing and blowing bubbles i could almost feel my heart rising out of my chest that day he played peek-a-boo with me while i worked in the kitchen his curly head bobbing back and forth from view he had gotten to that age where he didn't want me to pick him up as much i was his mother knew he needed me but i wanted something from him too comfort assurance i wanted him to live is what i wanted thinking about it all made my heart heavy and made me think of the old house and all the people we left behind and those who had passed away too i stopped unpacking again and went to the window i shared the sun coming through the window with them cats with the mouse in the garage with the memories of those who had been there before given a choice i would have stayed at that window watching them cats all day and not ever emptied one more box the stillness the light streaming through the window slowed the strum down to something that felt like comfort or pride i'm not sure how to describe it really it wasn't safety i can't say that i felt safe but i felt like we'd be okay it was a long climb up the hill behind mama and daddy's house when i was a girl but i made it at least once a day built bending back tree saplings as i went nothing in the world at all wrong with being by yourself at the top of that hill i swelled up with happiness from there i could see mama's garden daddy's fields of corn our house i stood with my walking stick hoisted above me like an explorer of the new world but that's what children do i thought my children would have that same kind of life but that's not gonna happen those woods have been bulldozed down now to make a way for strip mall the old farmhouse is gone no corn no garden my mother moved a little closer to town and settled into a smaller house when my father died but she still raises tomatoes on her patio in a pot lord i said to myself and thought i could hear a rumbling in my back somewhere but i wasn't quite sure i stood there shaking the memories out of my head little v still crawling around on that carpet by himself i took some more aspirin for the headache a little while later after that is when the police showed up ma'am we've had a report of a situation here the first officer said and was standing at my front door with his hand on his gun can you imagine somebody at your front door with a gun when you ain't been in no situation with no police your whole damn life a situation i said little vid kicked his legs but i was holding on to him tight may i ask what you're doing here in this house ma'am the other officer said we've gotten a call what my mouth was trying to find words what are your intentions intentions i said and looked at him like i'm looking at you right now i mean i know you think i'm done but i've got three degrees three years of college sure i know what intentions are i just thought it was me who should have been asking about intentions not them when i hesitated the older one said we are going to need you to step out here to the sidewalk why else would i be here i don't understand of course i live here is what i kept trying to tell them well some of the folks around the neighborhood here and that said that they don't think you live here do you have any proof and they saw you assault a woman here not too long ago we're looking for that victim victim there still were no words hell i ain't got no words now to explain this thing i live here i said again can you step out of the house please when i opened the door to try to step outside i saw a mouse hesitate before it skittered across the porch under the couch it was my peripheral vision so maybe i imagined it but i would swear to you that i that i saw that same mouse that was in the garage earlier he appeared out of nowhere like an omen all that fancy house and mice running around there had been room for laughter i sure would have laughed but i stayed quiet i bounced little v on my hip and moved him to the other side and my brain was fogged up from all of this but mostly it was my legs that wouldn't act right or move fast enough now the officer said my baby um i need shoes i said then i just stepped out in my bare feet was there a woman here one of them asked a white woman yes i said blonde talking about killing cats the older officer wrote something down in a little notebook the younger one said can you tell us what happened i started at the beginning but by then my throne was threatening to leave my body i tried to think about all them cats dancing among the sycamores and the sun because that was really on my mind what was really on my mind was that thing in my gut growing in pulsing i talked about history my ancestors and my mama i told them about my wedding about the births of my children i told them about that boy in the park who had been shot because he was holding a toy gun up in cleveland i told them about that famous singer who had raped all them young black girls and nobody had done nothing in chicago i told them about the woman who had died in the jail in texas you know good and well that woman didn't kill herself i said i said what about all them black mothers i told them about the three-year-old menace minnesota girl who watched her mother's boyfriend get shot to death by the police this is why black people don't trust y'all or the police i said when i got to the part about the humming thing that lived inside the wombs of black women the officers looked at each other one looked surprised the other one had a smirk on his face like that boy from covington had when he was talking to that native american elder covington kentucky i said i talked about covington i talked about kentucky i'm from kentucky too did you know that i talked and talked and talked when i stopped to catch my breath the older officer said ma'am we're gonna have to ask you to put the baby down he talked to me like i was a dog and not a woman hand him here the other one said i'll take him i know you think i'm crazy but i'm not i didn't say nothing else but i was wasn't upset about to put little v down i'd hold him till his daddy and his sister came home if i had to i'd hold him until the next time i saw my mama i'd hold him until black people stopped dying in the streets and that's when i heard the throne louder than i'd ever heard it before i could feel it spreading out from my womb through my entire body and then it left my body and floated like a summer storm above our heads above the neighborhood above the entire country and one cop had his hand on his gun and the other one kept saying ma'am i'm gonna need you to put that boy down right now but i didn't i wasn't ever gonna let go of my baby not until all my people were free thank you um i realize that that story is is harder to read out loud um than it is to read on the page but i hope you got the gist of it i i always try to embody her when i read it out loud so um [Music] we do have some time for questions and i'd be happy to answer any questions that you might have so sarah how do we do this do we open open it up thank you thank you shelby yeah thank you for reading that story i yeah the the ending is just i'm i'm still uh sitting with that ending because um yeah this the image of the throne enlarging like coming out from the physical body and then taking them kind of hovering above but then moving over the entire landscape of the u.s um just yeah what an amazing image and um yeah i just want to take a moment there for that to to be in the air um there's a comment a couple of comments natasha uh shelby says wow that was absolutely amazing professor wilkinson oh it's so nice you have some of your students here yes some of my students are here i enjoyed all the details really made me picture it all that story was so engrossing sometimes during a reading i lose the thread but not with this one um and yeah i need some more accolades and is this story posted online yes it is posted online and in a couple of places it's it is um on the story website um so if you go to storylit mag um you can find it there i probably could post it in the chat while we while we chat um i'll find it i'll find it okay and then it's on another it's on another website as well yeah go ahead um if you have a question you can either drop it in the chat or um ask directly to to crystal okay i'm gonna ask directly i'll keep my camera off because i like a hot mess but um i for one thank you for this entire story like reading it and then hearing you read it were two completely different experiences and i appreciate both of them um by the end of it i wanted to know and you definitely don't have to answer this but where was she speaking from was she speaking from like after death or was she speaking from um yeah well she's not she's not dead but i i imagined her to be um in jail um and um having to really go through something and probably about to be to spend some jail time um so she's not dead and that's why it's called case 47401 um it's she's being interviewed and this is the whole time this is her sort of speaking from [Music] being interviewed while she's being interviewed in the jail thank you you're welcome i have a question i'm here in the dark can you hear me okay yeah so um great story i loved it thank you i noticed that your um i really like the way you have the speaker address the reader a lot like i know some people don't think like this i'm trying to tell you something about me um that was before well we i'm trying to find oh right when she says that's what i said you do that throughout the store it's really nice and you have this device of having this throne which is like so impending of you know something's going to happen and it's beautiful anyway even if something doesn't happen in the story and you said you're right you said you wrote the story and you started the story in 2006. so i'm just wondering if you um so here's the question were you did the did the concept of the throne guide the story was that like the driver of the story or because it seems like it or because it doesn't seem like you went back and seeded that because it it all feels very organic um it wasn't the throne wasn't there um in the beginning um it came in some version years ago uh and so then it was sort of a driving force but um and this you know i talk to my students all the time about um psychic or narrative distance so this is a story when i say i walked around it that's what i mean like i walked around it for a long time and i had it um from various angles i told it from third person for a while i focused on the cats much more in another version um so it just took years to find the heart of it because when i had written it before it just felt like the exercise it felt like i was really playing with these cats like i really wanted to get in this this idea um and it just never felt organic until i put it fully into her body and narrated it from there and and i figured out that's both the point of view and um the psychological distance that i needed to tell the story effectively and there's a there is a thrumming a certain churning and that's why it's so hard for me to to read it because i'm not a performative uh person in general but i think that once i start reading it and i sort of step into her body it has such a clip and a rhythm to it that it's difficult for me to sort of keep up with her when i'm reading it oh i think you read it beautifully thank you thank you i need i have a question um that's okay sure go ahead nick and then i there are a couple of questions in the chat that i want to make sure get answered but go ahead uh so first it was very beautiful story and very beautiful reading and i loved it all around um i guess my question is kind of two part uh since you were writing it for so long um was there like a long period of time where you didn't touch it at all or was it a little bit of work you know uh every once in a while and if there was a big gap in time how did your perspective change on it after that um there was a huge gap and um you know i have lots of files like this on my computer um and so especially when i don't really believe in writer's block so especially when i'm having issue with the novel i'm working on or the memoir i'm working on i'll go into these files and start pulling up things so every once in a while i pull it up and i'd go there are those cats again and that lady i don't know what's happening here so um the original story definitely had the cats in it it definitely had her homesickness in it um and i think at one time the major tension was in her marriage which is still there um and it wasn't until uh as they got closer to a final draft that um this sort of um the injustice um issue uh came up because she had she had an issue with living there in the midwest and and there not being very many black people around but this full thread of it didn't come until much later thank you very interesting thank you um crystal um uh shanita is asking if um the thrum uh how would you describe the thrum as as anxiety or something ancestral or both or neither um i think all of those things i mean i think that um something happens i mean i'm sure it happens to everyone we can all feel it especially this year but i think particularly um um by poc women um i think that there is every time um something happens on the news it's not just a news story like it's taken personal and you sort of feel it in your gut and then it sort of piles up and piles up and piles up um so i think it's all of those things i think it's ancestral i think it's anxiety i think it's all all of those things that um that sort of built up in um i can't i should have pulled this book out but um i dedicate this story to tony k bambara because her work has been so um effective for me it's been a um like one of the mainstays that i go back to uh her work and and she has a story that says um blind people have uh i don't think she used strumming but i can't remember the first line which has a story that says blind people have a maybe it is throwing have a throwing jones if you listen was the first line of the story and um and then it hit me it hit me uh that voice hit me and i realized that i was trying to um make a story but i wasn't telling a story that it wasn't on the tongue enough and i write a lot in first person but not this close to someone's voice um so i think that that's that's how it all came to be um [Music] yes so another question thank you um yeah heather barker is wondering about the age of the speaker and how you navigated um the uneducated black woman speaking in a vernacular and maybe speaking to crafting her voice um yeah i see i think i misread and i said that she had three three degrees but she has three years of college so she's she is somewhat educated but not um she doesn't have multiple degrees that was a a slip um but the way that i navigated her her voice i wanted her to still be um to have an awareness to um but mostly the voice is not um you know so it's a country voice it's a an appalachian voice an appalachian black voice so i think that people often um are more connected to their natural voice when they're sort of by themselves and i imagine part of this narration happening in her head and part of it is being uh is at the interview so she's not in a professional um environment so she's not trying to uh she's just being her natural organic self and so um that's one way that i navigated it and i think that she's speaking in her she every any kind of artifice that she might have has been peeled away you know she is raw so i think that's why i heard language is so raw um she's much more raw than i am that's why if you read the story you realize that i skipped over some of her curse words and and things like um it didn't quite feel completely comfortable when i was reading it but i love her um and um i love that even if this is the only moment that she has ever been her her true self stripped away um that she's able to tell her story or that i was able to tell her story um with this piece um [Music] and it's one of the stories that i i feel like i'm most proud of i'm proud of all of my work but i i feel i feel empowered by her being empowered thanks crystal um yeah i really appreciated the first person near narrator i i just thought she was like amazing like really left off like and just hearing you read her um and i also really appreciate you saying that the you like the use of this direct address um is is actually to the interviewer and i don't think i might have i might not have picked up on that um and and also it's slippery right because it could be the reader yeah you and it's also the interviewer and i love that that it could that it works it functions both ways you is is reaching out to the reader but also is is setting up this interview that's happening in in jail um [Music] and and there's a question to you how many drafts that it i mean and you took it when it seems like this story was crafted over several years um but when when you got to that final draft how did you know when you were ready that it was ready to be released out into the world like a feeling it was a feeling i mean i know i had written had wrote uh had written it on it for a long time had revised and revised and improvised and all kinds of things and i think um when i finally wrote this section where the thrumming comes out of her i was trying to see it on the page but all my pages are mixed up but i once i wrote that section where the thrumming comes out of her and goes across the town and across the country um i felt like that was the truest thing i had written about the story and that i was fully telling her her truth um and also extending it out away from her so um that's when i i said okay i'm done and then of course i um looked at it for a long time and then decided to just sort of close my eyes and send and hit send and um what was interesting about the story is that i sent it out to several places and um several journals wanted it um and it just so happened that the story editor um he actually had called me and uh the others had sent emails that came almost immediately after he called me but he had called me and said that they wanted michael nye called me from story and said we i really want this story and i had to call you because i didn't want anyone else to to get it um is it still available and i was kind of like yeah it's crazy man yeah it's still it's available uh sure i'm i'm honored you know i'm glad you're going to publish it and then immediately after that i got emails from other editors saying that they wanted it as well and it was so funny because i wasn't concentrating because i was at a speaking engagement in oh here in kentucky i think in paducah kentucky and my husband was driving me around and we were trying to find the hotel for the event and we couldn't find it and you know we're arguing in the car and then i get this call and i'm like i don't know who this is but i'm going to go ahead and answer it and then all of a sudden you're talking about code switching all of a sudden i was like oh hello um but it's been it's great um [Music] that it was um received and you know he's put a lot of energy behind it um there's some news about the story that i can't really talk about right now but it's been really really well received and it has grown legs of its own thanks for sharing that experience i mean that's kind of every writer's dream is to have something wanted in many different places but um i'm sure it seems nice to get a phone call that personal touch um and i hope it continues i hope it gets continued reaches more readers um i'm gonna yeah the the other place i was gonna say that is published i couldn't think of it at first when we were talking but it's also on a website called fresh ink and fresh ink publishes stories that they their editors have enjoyed and and they get permission from the literary magazines and then um they republished them so um so there was a question about the title of the piece um i think you you answered that it's the the case number for the um the speaker's uh is as you envision her in jail and that the title comes from her case number yeah it's also a zip code um in i shouldn't tell you all my secrets but it's a it's a zip code um so if you type in the zip code you'll probably see where it is but it's in the midwest um and heather parker says i'm so glad she doesn't die my stomach was in knots was there an intentional tension that you built in to keep the reader wondering if she would be killed at several points um well yes i mean i think that uh when i when i go went back to revise it um i was looking at all the the whole story is so tense um and so i had to sort of carefully look at my plot points i don't really write a lot with an overwhelming concern of plot so plot was a revision tool for this story so i did have to go back and sort of track it and to see uh what i was doing and and when um but the entire story is sort of um intense and i went back and looked at the rhythm of it and i keep doing this because when i read it it has a particular rhythm that that makes me sort of do that um in her voice which i sort of imagined her um being so afraid and being in a place that she's unaccustomed to being like she's being treated like a criminal and she's never even had a speeding ticket i mean i don't say that but that's inherent to her to her character so both her fear and her anger are at such a height um that i wanted to create that because she doesn't know if she is gonna die or not yeah i think thanks for asking about um that all right thanks for answering that question um i i did notice that the you you opened up the reading talking about three things that you were trying to braid um and i remember two of them cats and racial justice but i was wondering what the third one was um and that was a question um homesickness homesickness yeah yeah she really wants to go back home to the mountains and she's trying to follow her husband's dream and not really her own um i found that really interesting that you give yourself writing exercises um to to jump start something and i wanted to shift gears and ask you about um the recent publication in the oxford american and i was wondering if you wanted to talk about that piece and maybe anything else you're working on or something you said you mentioned a novel and a memoir and i wondered if you wanted to talk about some of your other projects um before we before we hop off okay well i do have a um i have a new book coming out in august and it's actually a collection of poetry so there's the third genre um and i do write in all the genres i write poetry i write fiction all of my books that have been published up until now have been have been fiction um and i have been really interested in the lyric essay so i've written a lot of braided essays i've had two essays published that where covet is sort of in the center of them um and that's the one in oxford american also has coveted in the center but it's it's about um uh it's it's called covet kitchen and it's about um washing your gross groceries and all the things and um you'll probably recognize some things that you've done in that in that essay so it's about the sort of routine that we got into at the beginning of covet and washing our groceries and um developing a garden which i hadn't had a garden in many years and so it's in the food issue of the oxford american and it's also online um coveted kitchen at oxford american so you can read that if you like um are there any last questions i i really appreciate you talking about working in different forms or different genres and um do you do you feel do you feel that allows you to like i mean i'm just interested because some sometimes i i i envy different different form i'm a poet um and sometimes i like want to do the genre creep um and over into fiction or you know different and i feel like different um different modes for us as writers allows for different things different projects or different things or different voices to come forward um and is that i was wondering if you wanted to talk about that yeah i mean i think one of the things i've learned like i really um each book i write really each piece i write every poem every story every essay teaches me something new about myself and my process so um writing the birds of opulence um because i used depended on the lyrics so much and um i it was the first time i had written and i allowed my my nonfiction self my poet self and my and my fiction self to live in the same house um and to come through um so that book taught me that i didn't have to sort of um bifurcate myself into all of these different um genres that i'm just a writer when i show up and when i show up to the page it might become a story with poetic elements it might become a story that has non-fiction elements or vice versa like it might be a poem with fictional elements or it might be an essay with poetic elements um so i think that's what i've learned and and that that's where i am i believe a writer writes on us a certain plateau and then there's a pinprick and you go in one direction or another it's not hierarchical in any way like the pinprick might be over here over here but you suddenly realize that you're on a different floor and like there's something else going on with your work and then you you write in that mode until that's expended and then there's another print pick over here and suddenly there's light and you move into another phase so i think that's where i am now where all of those kinds of writer live in the same body and in the same [Music] mind and explore the same sort of emotional landscape so um that's been big with these with these last with these new projects that i'm working on um i really really really appreciated your answer to that and um it makes me feel really happy that because it sounds like freedom to me um to be able to a creative freedom to be able to see that evolution in your work and and feel like you have access to to any any any genre or any way of writing um and that yeah it makes me really happy um and yeah which i don't know i yeah are there any last questions um for crystal her craft shock is tomorrow morning at 10 a.m um the sign up is open until 9 00 am and i will send out a private zoom link to attend to that we also will record it and it'll be re-shared on our website and social media so if you can't make it you'll be able to still access the the recording of the craft talk um and i really loved hearing you read crystal as it was i mean yeah it was it was really amazing and i'm very happy to have

you live from las vegas nevada fun capital of the world it's another edition of bitcoin informants bitcoin and beer this is uh i'm mitch coloris i'm here with my trusty sidekick and krypto wingman sailor what's happening and we're here talking about the two things we love the most which is bitcoin and beer yeah two good things well let's say a lot of good bitcoin stuff today but we're going to go in and uh i'm going to take this one all right and then you take that one all right and then we'll switch later so what do you got i got a spot which is german beer it's a little stronger than most five and a half 5.2 but it's good stuff so uh i am going for fix from greece and uh there yeah well you know i'm greek so uh we do a lot of this we do a lot of pointing um i did i try to get this guy i got turkish coffee one time bad news no no they do that in greece they do it a lot all the uh all the old man and the cafe neos they uh they do uh that's that's that's greek for cafe um anyway we got our bitcoin glasses courtesy of btc universe cheers let's see what this is all about oh that's nice good you know i haven't had a beer they call it beeta fix in uh in greece and uh in in greece um uh it's been what probably 30 years since i've been to greece so this is the last time i've had a beat up fix yeah sir crazy so uh and then our show today is brought to you by uh btc universe we got these cool shirts i got the bitcoin energy shirt that was uh uh i guess dedicated to michael saylor you got to keep calm and total bitcoin shirts see the little bitcoin tiara at the top yeah yeah it's cool we got some stuff on display here yep so lots of good stuff going on um lots of good stuff so we got a good show for you today uh going to give you a little bit of the highlights oakland a's are now accepting bitcoin in their luxury suites as payment uh bitcoin is actually worth more than visa and mastercard combined insane uh long-term bit long-term bitcoin hodlers still huddling and uh we're going to take a look at what uh mitch is going to take a look at what if the top 10 companies bought bitcoin with their cash yeah so we got it yeah we got a lot going on well you know there's been a lot of that talk ever since michael saylor uh got on to gone with that topic and then after we do that i wrote an article back in november uh because everybody was like oh you know microstrategy and all this i was like huh i wonder what that would look like the top 10 companies with the most cash actually bought bitcoin so got a whole article you can actually reference the article i'll show you later but uh it's actually pretty interesting uh and then of course we have another edition of sailor on sailor so you gotta love that true story and uh maybe we'll even do a price prediction of the week possibly but uh so that's where we're at um let's get right into it let's get into the market today so the market was actually pretty darn interesting now you know everybody was yeah you know a little bit disappointed yesterday uh you know bitcoin broke 60 61 all 62 000 over the weekend everybody's like oh my god bitcoin going crazy yeah comes to the moon right and uh and that was all good uh but we had a pullback you know and it's funny because i was telling my wife i go you know there's this thing called the cma futures and uh you know so this the cma cme futures you know trade on traditional trading you know time which is you know monday at eight in the morning until friday at you know whatever it is four o'clock and work in the afternoon eastern time and um and so that you know if there's a whatever that price of bitcoin is at the end of that close on friday versus where it is on monday if there's a gap if it goes too high if it goes up then there's a gap and so often times not always but oftentimes the price may come down and fill that gap and then come back up so that's more or less what what we had going in uh to this week but bitcoin's kind of recovered we're at 56 600 roughly ethereum you know it's pulled back a little bit you know by finance coin cardano up to buck 22 um and you'll have a little bit on that on on what's happening there go cardano yeah we love cardano we love polka dot um polka dots you know added another 11 over the last day uh chain link about five percent litecoin let's look at the uh the uh losers let's look at the gainers for the basic attention token so that so of course if you use the brave browser you know you earn bat when you uh use the brave browser it's not a lot but you know you start start accumulating a little bat and uh when i first started using the brave browser i think basic attention token was about 15 cents or something like that now today it's over a buck over a buck you gotta love that 37 almost 40 percent good for the day file coin cardano up 21 you did it again you and cardano cardano hard not to you know one of my little favorites my little unsung hero did you buy it up 16 i'm sorry uh 14 so you gotta love that so uh that's a little bit of look at the uh the gainers what about the losers well you know it depends on what's on there we may or may not talk about it so uh let's see you know for you know v chain down five percent actually nothing too terrible when you look at this chili's which been on that crazy run lately it's up it's only up 99 for the week oh that's all but uh you know down 4.2 percent for the day so not too bad on the markets today so that's a little bit of what's happening at the market so you'll have to excuse us because we've all got the sniffles because the allergies in las vegas right now are terrible so uh yeah a little bit on that yeah we're gonna get to our first story about the oakland athletics uh oakland athletics kind of famous in the last decade or so uh continuing to innovate because uh they adopted sabermetrics cheers again yep uh trying to make i don't say the best of a bad situation but they're trying to innovate in different ways and now they are one of the latest people to add uh bitcoin as a way to pay for their luxury suites yeah it's about 60 grand for a luxury suite i guess for the year that makes does that make sense yeah that's about right yeah it's been a long time what i find interesting about are you a baseball fan are you serious is that real is that a yes yes who do you follow please don't say the dodgers ah no it's uh actually last time i went to dodgers game was probably 2009 and uh somebody got shot in the parking lot oh wow yeah i was making jokes about uh you know hey it was going down it wasn't yeah i wasn't like that uh well that's worse compared to what happened to that giants fan who got the crap beat on that one time yeah and is now paralyzed for the rest of his life um i'm a giants fan fan of paralysis too probably yeah well just so i'm a giants fan and uh you know you think you know giants are always like hey we're very progressive more like technical technology savvy and you know they were the first one of the first if not the first stadium to you know install wi-fi at the stadium years ago i was a giant season ticket holder every game every season since 1995 all the way to 2014 when they won the world series i lived two blocks from the stadium in san francisco that last season they won the world series no way and i and i saw every game that that year and uh yeah we celebrated a world series and guess what i timed the market i sold my season tickets like a half hour later literally smart it was it was actually really smart because we know what they've done every single clark still playing yeah where are you man uh no no but he did have 22 and that was jack clark's number two so he did yeah we have uh guys on that team i have no idea who they are i mean other than mikey stremski and alex dickerson and a few others yeah he's uh he's the grandson god yeah of course yostremski yeah i feel like just side notes are getting off topic but the last game i went to san francisco the ball it's always so gloomy and kind of overcast up there yeah cold you just lose the ball every time and i'm like these guys should get paid extra for playing in this world yeah it's true well anyway we i know we're off subject but you know giants are always like the technology savvy you know guys out in the bay area they kind of take that mantle but you know i got i got to hand it to him there the a's beat him to the punch smart yeah so what's the deal on this so they uh they have uh what are they charging sixty one thousand dollars or one bitcoin for a luxury box i think it's like for six people yeah so that's not too bad no that's great but i think what's smart about them is that they're going to pay in the bitcoin but the bitcoin you know if you give somebody payment cash that money goes nowhere but you pay them the bitcoin and that's an asset that can accumulate yeah so i think you're going to see you know personally i would never pay for a baseball game in bitcoin or anything else for that matter that stuff um but uh you know hey these are uh kind of as the shirts keep coming that's right so apparently the oakland a's are hodlers yeah yeah so they're uh we'll see what happens you know we actually should reach out to them once the season gets underway and see who the knuckleheads were who actually took them up on that one but uh you know we'll see uh i don't know if they'll be able to name names or whatever but all right so what's that what's our next story what are we talking about i don't know uh let's see uh oh actually this is uh oh is this the visa oh no uh cardano no no no no i think we're gonna go visa on the bitcoin oh god yes it's been a long day guys it's been a long day so i guess uh bitcoin is now worth more than both visa and mastercard combined insane that is completely insane uh in fact wasn't it like i don't know like three days ago where it just passed visa like by on its own it seemed like it was yesterday it was i know it was like probably a month or two ago but you know yeah because in our lifetime visa mastercard were relatively new thing as well relatively yeah yeah so bitcoin uh after it's 60 thousand dollars last uh you know over the weekend now it's uh value is more than the market cap of visa mastercard combined that's bananas yeah and you know this is the kind of stuff you know it's like how does that affect you and i well it affects obviously price right on you know on the one hand but then this is all about what ends up in the news what ends up in you know basically mainstream media eventually where you'll see it on your local news or whatever well i think it also speaks to like the you know the adoption yep yep absolutely better than visa and mastercard put together well you can't go in any country in the world not no visa mastercard regardless of language yep bitcoin is just surpassed it yep so that's really great news and i was really you know happy to see that um what else we got uh let's talk a little bit about cardinal cardano is actually going to be launched on it on coinbase pro today if the uh actually it's i think it's thursday so i think they announced that well today they announced it but thursday at 9 00 a.m uh throughout the meet the requirements it's going to go live so i think that'll drive the price up well and you already saw it you know today was the buck 20 something um at the top of the show when we first started so um you know what was it about seemed like it seemed like a week ago probably was about a week ago seems like forever ago but uh cardano would have made that run to almost a buck fifty right it was over a buck forty forty five 45 48 something like that yep so uh but it's sideways-ish which is always good yeah i mean it's sideways and down that's good it's cooled off a little bit but it's stuff like this you know they they call it the coinbase effect but you would have this on finance you would have this on on just about anything um or you would have this on um you know if uh if uh any public company or a fund was gonna you know invest in cardano or any other you know coin for that matter you know you would have that kind of effect so this is again it's all about adoption it's all about goodness and you know for cardano hodlers good good day today you think we're gonna start seeing a lot of uh like remember last week we were talking about the uh the nfts and how uh the christie's auction house actually said hey we're going to auction this thing off you're going to pay an ethereum drove the price up um well you know i mean nfts all run on ethereum so that's that's the standard mode of payment but but we saw a price jump well yeah and you know here's the thing i i was thinking about this today and i was watching an interview i can't remember who it was earlier today this morning when i was having my coffee and uh you know i think that this nft stuff it doesn't get about as hot white hot as it is than it is right now yes and um you know when you kind of look back at the um at the uh you know you looked at the internet.com bubble you know in the late 90s early 2000s you know it feels a lot like that now you know what what comes out of that i think is obviously you're going to have a lot of things just you know kind of crash and burn but then out of the ashes come all the real the real companies as it did in the internet craze and um same thing here you know it's not going to go away it'll just it'll just settle and then all of the good stuff rises to the top somebody actually asked me that today uh they were comparing it to the uh the internet and the dot-com boom and they're like do you think the bulb is going to pop i'm like sure there'll be a correction but i don't know if you know necessarily it's not going to go away because it's an asset it's not a product it's not something that's going to become obsolete yep yep yeah so i don't know i think that you know the the nf think nft thing continues it'll continue to get hot i know i i want to do some goofy stuff to see if you know how much i can run up the price you know just i don't know you know it's just it sounds crazy but you know there's a lot of crazy stuff happening right now but um you know it's fun times interesting time in history yeah totally so um we uh you know a while back back yeah so you know ever since michael saylor um and microstrategy bought a bunch of bitcoin way back when in august or whenever it was last year everybody's like oh my god you know they bought all this bitcoin and of course twitter bought a little bit you know by comparison very little 50 million um and you know a few others and then since then microstrategy has gone back to the well they've raised debt a couple of times tesla's bought in um and then a bunch of institutional guys have come in so you know during this time this is back in november of last year i wrote this article i write a lot on medium.com on bitcoin and this article was called what if the um top 10 public companies with the most cash bought bitcoin yeah you know and you know because they're already sitting there talking about it and um you know i thought well let's go up see what that looks like right so um i went out there and we'll leave links in the description below and by the way if you like this content please like please subscribe please click notifications everyone's doing it don't you want to be cool yeah i mean it's free it takes like less than a second so and it helps the show get better because the more subscribers subscribers we have the more time we can dedicate to this so uh ballsy record yeah oh and well we'll get to remind me about the contest thing uh later to remind everybody about the contest so i decided to write this article um what if the top 10 companies public companies in the us with the most cash bought bitcoin what would that look like so um i've got you know i've got the article up here and this is from 2019 data so this isn't the most current data so don't sit there and you know kind of you know rake me over the coals in the comments like this is not correct this is like old data you know or do or do and uh how about it uh but here you go so here are the top 10 companies as a 2019 with the most data most cash and so you have you know microsoft at the top they have 136 billion dollars worth of uh of cash never berkshire hathaway alphabet which is google of course you know apple so you got the top four at least from 2019 who had over 100 billion dollars in cash crazy and then from there it's you know face all the usual suspects facebook amazon ford oracle cisco so you know this is all the cash they have all all total it's almost a trillion dollars so uh three-quarters of a trillion dollars so what i go into here is what does this look like if um you know they just allocated say 10 of the cash allocation now here's the interesting thing so i wrote this article back in november and i created this spreadsheet i got some screenshots in the article and stuff that i embedded in there i went back to the original spreadsheet just to check it out you know like the market cap and how many coins are out there and all that stuff so that we had a few more coins since listed or created and uh but the bitcoin price has changed a lot a lot so when the day i wrote this article bitcoin guess what bitcoin price was 2019. this is in november 2019. i'm gonna go if i had to venture a guess i'd be around the ten thousand dollar mark uh no pretty close it was uh it was uh what thirteen thousand eight hundred and thirty eight dollars i just switched i just switched my screen to my original spreadsheet here so you guys can check it out wow so you know so at that price at that point in time if microsoft allocated ten percent of their cash to bitcoin a measly thirteen and a half million dollars it would have bought uh you know almost what is that nine hundred uh almost a million yeah right right so i mean it was a lot right so and it would be of the overall uh their bitcoin ownership compared uh you know to the overall supply would have been about five little over five percent what six percent yeah by 5.9 anyway so here's all the numbers now what's interesting huh could you imagine like hey i bought some of this bitcoin with 10 whatever oh yeah by the way it's just uh well well what's interesting is when i went and did this article what i don't think i put in there was what would it look like if the price you know in a year went to 150 000 from that point that that investment would have got them actually almost um well it would actually get them more cash than they had in the bank right now what's after a trillion yeah trillion yeah quadrillion quintillion yeah but um but here's here's the interesting thing so i'm just going to do the quick the quick thing so the price here 13 000 what is it 55 750 or so let's put in the number is the new number five five seven five oh and let's recalc and presto that same five percent or ten percent allocation now only buys one point one seven percent crazy from almost six percent if they did it last november could you imagine being the guy that was like hey let's do this thing i don't know it's only a couple of bucks well yeah and you know from a risk standpoint which is really what it is and we'll talk about because we have sailor on sailor and you know we love michael saylor and so we got this big kids and uh you know he's going to talk about this a little bit that's why i thought we'd bring up this article today because it's really really interesting now you know then the question became okay if they did 10 this is what it is and it represents about 27 of all you know the bitcoin out there for the just the top 10 and so what would it look like if all of these how much how much money what percentage of capital would these companies have to put again back in these old prices now okay to buy all of the remaining outstanding supply that's currently in circulation of bitcoin so to buy literally all of it how much do you think that would be how on a percentage basis i got nothing i got nothing tell me 37 so they they could all the top 10 could at 37 of their cash back in november and bought all the bitcoin out there uh so what do you do uh i own almost a bitcoin well you know big deal what this says is michael saylor is exactly right on all of this stuff right i mean he's absolutely right he's like look you're not doing your shareholders any favors by you know sitting on cash you know and there's so many vehicles out there even if you don't want to use your cash that you have on your balance sheet you can go and get debt for like next to nothing yeah and still make a ton of money yeah so you know i don't i don't understand why i mean i understand the corporate governance you know i was a c uh public company ceo now is that company like i get it right all the disclosures all the stuff you got to go through all that stuff but you know from a fiduciary responsibility and a shareholder value to you know to to keep shareholder value retained and gross shareholder value i don't know why you wouldn't do it if you if you bought even if you raised debt to buy bitcoin at this per particular moment of time if it shoots up by the end of it how everyone's kind of predicting yep pay off the debt and just be in the clear easy easy like in weeks at the way it's going out so anyway i will put links into this article and i've got a few others out there um you know they got a bit of a bit of traction so you know if you like them subscribe to you subscribe to me on on medium or or here on youtube or whatever and you know i'll get more content out there on that but this is something i like doing and this is kind of the stuff that i haven't seen one of the ones we'll talk about in the future i did right before this one actually was why this uh bitcoin halving cycle is different than all the rest this is like you know whatever he's calling the super cycle now well back in early november probably end of october early november i wrote this article before anybody was talking about this on the same thing so maybe we'll go over that on a different show i think it'd be a good topic anyway so uh time for another beer yep let's do it let's let's get this going so i'm gonna have the i'm actually gonna use it tissue also that i forgot was behind us oh that's all right because uh jeez you you had a little allergy action oh my god he's killing me dude he's killing me you can cut his mic though if you want good one got it all right let's see what this spot is all about i don't think i've had a spot and i've had a lot of different kinds of beers it's very uh it's very representative of german beer beer fix is a you know it's a light beer it's a pilsner it's uh you know but i like pilsners you know they're you know i like it crisp and light i'm not big on ipas it's just too bitter for me um but you know i know a lot like you're drinking a bit like a good half of ice and two you know or blonde but um yeah so anyway yeah you made beer out of a broom that's yeah ipa tastes like to me yeah exactly pretty good too not bad i like it it tastes greek that's cool um i won't go there uh sorry you're gonna need a tissue after that we're all coming through the nose uh so spotting just so you know spotting is what i'm having okay all right so uh let's see where are we gonna go from here um so we talked about this stuff let's um talk a little bit about michael saylor um in fact uh i think it's time to go to our our bit right our our weekly uh or our our bitcoin and beer regular it's sailor on sailor yes we're gonna try out a bunch of jingles for that in the future here yeah we promised to make a jingle um you know the best way to like empty a room is to have us start like so yeah right but uh if as we go comment below see which one you like the best and we'll we'll get there actually we're gonna have to give you a new picture too because man i was looking rugged that day uh yeah but you and him were both in the same room at the same time apparently totally can't you see the family resemblance it's like identical if this is this is neither here nor there but if uh michael sailor was ever played by a celebrity guy pierce that's who he looks like hey pierce before yeah it does kind of look like yeah um i had two guys actually i had two guys in the last week really wow do you ever get you know who you look like yes he was with he was with she was with me um but it was uh it was funny one guy was like hey you know what you look like i'm like and i had a mask oh yeah and he goes yeah you look like uh robert redford and i'm like you mean like young good-looking robert redford like in the sting or do you want old shriveled up like a prune robert redford right he still looks good you see that boat movie you did and i was like no not only and i was like thank you you know thank you and then uh the guy just the other day i was out uh we went to uh lazy dog you know brought the dog well you'll meet the dog bitcoin bowie uh bitcoin he um he said uh i looked like uh the guy from uh oh what's the movie um totally it's the one big lebowski uh oh um jeff bridges i know that's exactly what i said in fact i even gave him that stain guy look i'm like what are you talking about dude are you high did you just like rip a big bong hit or something like dude i i you know i don't know jeff bridges you know you know it's like really like stone jeff bridges like in that movie like what are you talking about anyway um so actually uh jeff bridges lloyd bridges jeff bridges oh hope that was awesome that was on the yeah um yeah jeff bridges jeff bridges lloyd bridges is his dad he was an airplane that was the joe airplane but who's uh no is he the big bobowsky guy yeah jeff bridges no or john john what's his name no not john goodman yeah jeff bridges yeah yes jeff bridges everybody's like all right guys get over it let's move on um so uh real quick before we get on to sailor and sailor um hey contest btc universal apparel okay he's giving us all these great they're pretty cool um all you have to do is comment bitcoin in the comments and we're going to send you a free hat i guess or they're going to send you a free uh of your order i guess i don't know or free uh whatever you want right pick something uh it could be a free t-shirt a free hat a free whatever comment bitcoin and then what you'd like and we'll pick the winner yeah and you'll get that message anyway comment bitcoin for your chance to win so there you go all right so sailor on sale sailor and sailor let's see so we got we got this video clip and uh he was interviewed i i don't know he was uh it was on a recent interview and he talks about the public company thing so uh jordan our producer you ready do you have that clip ready you can roll ceos are driven into massively leveraged positions or dilutive acquisitions in order to please wall street and and wall street's not the evil enemy here the problem is the cost of capital is 20 or 15 so you're either going to pursue a strategy of dilutive acquisitions or a strategy of excessive leverage or your third strategy is apple could borrow 25 billion dollars at one percent or three percent interest buy bitcoin that yields 200 interest and it's the what would you say to tim cook you would say tim if you can buy a hundred billion dollar company that's growing a hundred percent a year and is profitable you should do that right what is bitcoin bitcoin is a hundred billion you know you can buy a hundred billion dollars worth of bitcoin or or 10 or 20 or 30 billion worth of bitcoin it's growing 600 percent this year but 200 a year on average so my message to any company whether it's microsoft or amazon or apple or tesla is why don't you take the asset that you can get a lot of you can go borrow 20 billion dollars worth of capital at three percent interest and why don't you go do an accretive acquisition and an accretive acquisition is something growing a hundred or two hundred percent a year by the way what's better for apple to buy disney or for apple to buy bitcoin because if you buy disney you're buying a hundred million moving parts and a lot of complexity and a lot of risk and a lot of competition if you buy bitcoin your treasurer just had to go buy bitcoin there is no competition there is no employee base right there is no the moving parts have all been worked out for a decade they're not changing so it it's a much better balance sheet idea than what's being laid on the table for most cfos or most ceos right now so i'm going to ask this question there's a there's a question here i think you're going to follow me there's great movie jaws there's a scene all right michael's safe are we back are we back and we're back all right mike do you think so michael is a busy guy he's got to run a you know a large multi-million dollar company billion dollar billion dollar company but it seems like all he does is give interviews and defend himself well and you know this guy i mean look this guy didn't say much but right right right next question but i gotta tell you man michael saylor is is playing playing four dimensional chess everyone else playing like checkers man this guy is really really smart i like how he said he's like oh he's made me responsible and he's like well if you you know x y and z and you do this you're here i'm like it'd be the way michael saylor puts it in from my perspective anyway is that he's like you'd be irresponsible if you did not invest in a bitcoin because i mean literally it's true and we just talked about it you know when we're talking about the other article um you know put in your company cash or hey go out and you know get 20 billion dollars worth of debt at you know next to nothing and you're going to do it something else for some other assets some equipment or something not like you're robbing the till and going oh i hope we cover well i can totally relate to what he's saying is from a ceo perspective and you know like you know making shareholders happy right so you know when he talks about you know accretive acquisitions you know these are things that add value you know they don't suck value out of the company um so like he does the the the disney example for you know it's like here's this you know great no problem dizzy great company does all this great stuff they got all these great brands um but guess what there's a lot of like machinations to make the disney you know machine roll and like that's not an easy acquisition right and uh at the end of the day are you gonna really get the the kind of accretive returns well you probably wouldn't you know at least from what bitcoin's doing you know so well i think what's cool is he's he's trying to innovate granted this isn't a conventional strategy to grow your company but the whole point is to grow his company's value is to grow that's what he's doing and this just happens to be something brand new he's innovating and he's going hey guys i'm making money and we're doing this you know we're aggressively pursuing this avenue to add value and what's happening exactly what he said was gonna happen so yep i mean how can you argue so i i love this like hey tim you know hey tim here's what i would do you know why don't you just do it love what you know i mean uh look i gotta hand it to michael saylor like i said this guy is been so good for the space in general and for bitcoin in particular yeah i mean it's just been it's just been he's been phenomenal so that's it for this edition of sailor on yeah well try to tell us what you think if you've got suggestions by all means please we need all the help we can get on that avenue yeah we definitely can't hit the high notes that's for sure well that's about it for today what would we i think we're done right i mean is that that's called last call last call let's call last call for what bitcoin under uh fifty six thousand six thousand let's say let's go all right prediction we will see you on saturday for the next edition of bitcoin informants bitcoin and beer thanks for watching don't forget to subscribe hit notifications all that fun stuff and we'll see you next time thanks for watching cheers you", "vNO2aTOAF88": "so our beloved nick who is muted right now has offered to share some insight on dabbing that he thought might be interesting and helpful that goes in further detail than what i described last time so nick i'm going to give you the floor for five minutes well i'll try to keep it as concise as possible okay yeah tell us what you know um so basically i didn't attend the class last time um and i watched it on youtube and i saw the dab part and i was like okay it's sick everything is true um i just wanted to add though that i saw that there was a a method shown with just a torch and the guy has the method where he puts his hand to check how hot it is and that's cool and all but there is also other things you can do um like an email i don't know if anyone knows about that but since i didn't attend the class i guess i couldn't see the chat so i have one here i can show you guys if that's okay basically you have uh this box here and then you can set the temperature that to the temperature you like i like 515 i just taste it it doesn't burn my throat at all and it's not like a torch that where it just hits you um and then it goes to this coil that wraps around the the banger then you drop your product in there and then you use this which can control the airflow when you let go so you can wash it around so that's another thing that i just wanted to share if no one knows about it also there's a if you do do uh the torch dabs there's um temperature readers that you can get that are specifically made for doing dabs and they're like 250 bucks american which is like 350 bucks for me and uh it essentially does the same thing that a lot of temperature guns do really good ones and those are going to be much cheaper and they'll also have other functions so i kind of don't like the idea of spending money on that just because it's made for the weed world they're just going to charge you more and another thing that i wanted to add was about how uh bho products are made butane hash oil or butane honey oil uh it's done with butane obviously and there's always a fear that there's butane in the product i also heard that butane is even though it's flammable it's not toxic so that is something to consider but there is a new thing that is new uh in the uh production of the bho products and it's something called crc and it means color remediation correction i believe i'll send a link after in the chat but this is something that after a bho product is made if it's really dark and kind of shitty looking they can run it through this crc thing and it'll take away some of the dis like the dirty color i guess and kind of clean it up and it can really make the product look really nice but it can also be used to make shady product look good and there's it involves the use of silica which for me is a a big concern because silica i know i think i'm pretty sure is carcinogenic i work in construction and we i've seen videos of it being in concrete and when you do any jackhammering or whatever you're supposed to wear a mask so when i hear the word silica an alarm goes off so that's just something i want to talk but obviously i see now in the chat someone is already mentioned it so that's just something i wanted to share and i think that's it sweet so nice having people from class submit their own information that goes for any of you if you feel like you know a lot about a particular subject and you want to share on it please feel free to do so and don't let me forget at the end of class today i want to tell you guys about our potential guests i'm going to mute you ryan there are two of you and from there here we go time to get started with drugs go and keep talking about weed i did not turn off all my notifications so this could get super messy today i hope we don't have to do that in the middle okay so last time we had just talked about hemp briefly about how hemp is the cannabis sativa plant but the hemp portion of things is the non-psychoactive edition basically and it's extremely useful for all kinds of applications for making like candles and and rope and whatever um so real quick before i show you a bunch of charts we're gonna go into some like back alley kind of gross cannabis underworld stuff today that we'll touch back on later i want to get a couple of bits of terminology out of the way real quick so that we're all familiar uh so root of administration for weed obviously smoking is going to be the most well-known but you can also vape it you can hopefully not like that you can get an edible form i know this is like just basic [ __ ] you can but for those of you that aren't really familiar with weed you can also get tinctures of weed which is basically extractions it's hyper concentrated cannabinoids cannabinoids whatever you want to call them if someone has like an industry standard preference that they want to tell me like i said last time please go ahead and do so and then there's also like salves transdermal administration which is really useful for people that have like back pain or menstrual cramps or something like that um salves are becoming more and more popular in dispensaries there are also vaginal suppositories some of you might have heard of the girl that drank a bottle of weed lube and was high for three days there's an amazing article about this that i think includes photos of her just like lying in bed with not just a bag of potato chips on her but like potato chips on her and she was like that for days because she was like oh this lube isn't really doing much like i guess i'll just drink it because we're not getting high and she did that that's the consequence what a nightmare yeah um so just quick terminology this is a pipe otherwise known as a piece this is a dab rig or just a rig whatever you want to call it again this is for concentrates that you vaporize basically um this is bong and bong anatomy we'll go into in a second again this is just for like people that have no idea what any of this stuff is we'll get the baseline out of here uh then you can also use a dab pen this is a dr dabber which is a really popular brand for dab pens and like dab rigs and stuff like that like um emails as nick mentioned and then there are volcanoes and volcanoes are kind of like the holy grail of vaping weed it's like you have it's it's like 300 for a good volcano and it involves basically you pop some some flour on top of it it vaporizes it and it expands this bag so that you can like push your mouth against it and it gives you a flow of vaporized weed and then there's a fruit pipe and i just included this in here for any of you who recall the days of fruit pipes and pieces and bongs very fondly yeah i see you um have any of you ever tried making an eggplant bong because i have and that did not go very well out oh if you heard that crack that was my shoulder um quick smoking terminology uh these are not really words that are typically used like no one's gonna be like hey can i take that joint and if they do then like i'm not familiar with that culture but i'm sure it exists somewhere um usually it's like can i take a hit can i draw that like can i hit that as like the most common terminology and then in terms of weed etiquette there's cornering and cornering is a really important thing to know if you're newer to smoking where you don't smoke weed very often if someone hands you a bowl which is like it's the pipe the bowl piece is like the bowl shaped piece at the end that you put the weed into if someone hands you a bowl and they've like got their flour their nug that's been all like chopped up and they sprinkle a little keef on top remember which contains trichomes the keefe is this kinetic sand that contains a bunch of the cannabinoids and they've like prepared this nice bowl for you and they pass it to you and they're still green visible and you just stick your lighter on to it and torch the whole thing you are not going to be invited back to that smoke sesh i tell you that now so cornering is the practice of basically holding the flame just to the edge of the bowl and then inhaling so that you pull the flame down to the corner and you get these nice little burn patches because greens contain the least combusted cannabinoids at the time i'm looking at banana pipes peach was very banana was my favorite peach was challenging because of the pit that that is so funny uh mcdonald's big bat and big mac i don't i literally do not believe you like i i cannot believe i'm saying this out loud but pixar didn't happen how to corner is an art form indeed yes so this concept of greens is basically like you want to get the first hit of a bowl that has like fresh weed in it basically and it's very polite to corner it and pass it to someone puff puff pass again is not a phrase that's really said out loud like ever except ingest although it might be kind of fun to be like one puff one puff and then you pass it the whole idea is that you hit it twice and then you pass it to the next person because hitting it once and passing it it's just not realistic like it's just probably just not going to happen um and then if you have lit the bowl see this looks like someone that did not grind their weed very well um at all and didn't corner it super effectively because it's all lit this is the cherry it's like the flame in the bowl so sometimes if you hit a bowl and you go to pass it to someone else this is the case of the joint too a cherry is just a lit ember where if you suck on it the oxygen will re-light that flame and allow you to keep hitting it so basically again this is for if you don't really smoke weed or you only smoke food a few times just know that you don't have to re-light it if there's a little bit of red you can just hit it again it's cherried um what is this spliff that's a spliff and i gotta keep up with this chat i frequently have to tell people it's not a microphone if they just ramble on while holding the pipe oh my god yeah that's a spliff spliff is tobacco and weed together and this is a big problem on college campuses actually is a lot of people smoke swifts they're realizing that tobacco contains nicotine which is an extremely physiologically dependence forming and addiction-forming substance where if you're ingesting it all the time without thinking about it you could very easily have physical withdrawals and get really irritable and crave spliffs without really knowing why so please be mindful of smoking spliffs if you're not trying to [ __ ] around with nicotine like if you are on the great that's on you 100 that's your choice but if you're not trying to smoke cigarettes on a regular basis then don't start smoking spliffs or don't start smoking slips regularly or instead of something else um this is a join a j it's rolled up weed really deceptively difficult to roll a nice joint and then this is a blunt which is you crack open a cigar dump out the stuff or not you don't have to dump out the tobacco and the cigar and then you roll weed into it yeah but there's a ton of other stuff that you can do there are so many different things that you can make to smoke your weed i remember in high school once i uh my parents were out of town and i hosted build a bong workshop which was when i just collected a bunch of garbage from our recycling and had like different sizes of bottles and liter containers all over the table and whatever and uh like lug nuts and stuff so people could make bowl pieces and before anyone even arrived i was like okay i'm going to try out making a waterfall bong i think it was 16. i was like maybe 15. i was like i'm gonna make a waterfall bomb and i made the waterfall bong which is basically you take a big-ass liter bottle and you um have the bowl piece at top at the top and you poke holes in the sides so the water gets sucked down you can see like spouts of water coming out and it fills the entire thing with smoke and i hit the entire waterfall bomb with like very little tolerance at that time and was so stoned before anyone even showed up at my house that i was just like face down on the floor for the entirety of the party that's my story about why you should be really careful about smoking homemade smoking devices and wheat is legal in california so i can tell this story on the internet without any kind of fear um so let's check out a different kind of bong a gravity bong buy super deluxe [Music] basically you get a big old bottle get some cutty stuff cut off the top cut off the bottom you have two bottles fill the bottom one up please don't use tin foil make a little hole in the top of the thing that's for your bowl piece [Music] don't do that use something else do not smoke out of tin foil this is bad advice [Music] you put your one bottle into the other bottle [Music] this is like level 50. don't try doing this if you don't smoke weed i like every day please and it's all filled up with smoke bam bam and then you push the smoke down into your lungs this person is a champ for taking that huge of a hit that is just obscene so that's a gravity bomb and there are a billion different things that you can use like i said to make creative bongs and smoking devices whatever um this is sacrilege to watch tin foil yikes yeah i know i am aware it's really bad um tin foil i don't i can't tell you exactly why you shouldn't smoke it to be honest i would imagine something to do with metal particles smoking just not a great combination um instead you can use if you have like a metal ballpoint pen or something you can unscrew the tip of that if it's like metal for sure and you can flip it upside down pop it in put some weed in and stick it right there it's a really small bowl um but other alternatives would probably be like if you have like an actual kit of like a tool kit you can get like a lug nut or something and then cover the bottom it's been a while so a quick anatomy of a water bong or a bong you have the bowl piece which is where all the weed goes and then there's a little glass pipe that's called the downstem you fill water up just past the down stem and sometimes there are these things called percolators in the middle of them which are basically just like little filtration chambers that cool the air down and then there's the carb hole which you can cover with your fengi if you it really depends on the style of bong that you have and the smoke chamber so basically you light the bowl you like create pressure by pulling in on the bong until the whole bong is filled up with smoke then you take out the ball piece so there's no resistance when you inhale the whole thing and you clear the bomb or you clear part of the bomb like don't feel pressured to clear the whole bong that's a massive hit don't do it if you're not down generally if you smoke weed stereotypical you get giggly sometimes you get euphoric sometimes sometimes you just get really hungry and you want to go to bed sometimes you start thinking that your friends hate you sometimes you get super anxious and want to jump out of your skin and spend four hours walking around your neighborhood at night sometimes you just immediately pass out on the couch and your friends have to wake you up several times before you can get to bed and sometimes you have a really good drawing and listening to music sometimes you have amazing sex sometimes you just like have a good time doing absolutely nothing and like twiddling your thumbs it's a very variable experience like honestly everyone has a different that's great advice everyone has a different experience with weed and oftentimes it's different every time like it is a very personal substance as a mechanic the nine millimeter socket is the weed socket the deep socket one is the covert one hitter i'll say that again nine millimeter socket is the weed socket the deep socket one is the covert one hitter that thank you for saying socket that's exactly what i was thinking of that was yeah that's that's what i was thinking okay big questions now can weed cause psychosis yes oh the question and the answer is it's definitely possible for all of these things we're in preliminary stages of research somehow still and part of that is because of regulations and part of that honestly is just because there's so much [ __ ] bias in the industry that it's almost impossible to comb through these articles without using like fine-tooth checking of citations checking of contributions checking of like the author backgrounds there's so much stigma still around weed research and it's really biased so it's hard to know honestly there's a lot of research that it basically is like this is conclusive and then a few years later someone looks at it and it's like that was not conclusive at all but people don't know how to read scientific journals so generally if you are predisposed to psychosis smoking thc heavy weed is probably not a good idea for you but it's interesting because cbd has antipsychotic properties whereas smoking weed on the whole generally tends to possibly possibly have a positive correlation with psychosis but there's a catch here which is that as the industry has evolved the amount of thc in weed has skyrocketed like we're talking skyrocketed i don't remember the exact numbers but i think it's something like a joint in the 60s would be the equivalent of like five joints now or something like that that could be completely wrong but the point is that the amount of wheat has been intentional sorry the amount of thc has been intentionally increased so it's really difficult to find low potency weed and generally if you're smoking weed socially it's really difficult to not just like keep hitting the joint until you realize that you're way higher than you wanted to be yeah we'll watch reefer madness tonight or a little segment of it um so the point here is basically that we don't really fully know the correlation between psychosis and smoking weed but if you're predisposed personally or from a family perspective it's probably not a good idea for you to push that envelope too far and if you decide that you want to smoke weed you should be really mindful if you must i would recommend looking for a cbd heavy strain um what does we do for anxiety and or depression and the answer is we don't know but there's a pretty clear-cut correlation between people having anxiety and or depression which are often comorbid they go together and smoking weed however a lot of research tries to spin that as smoking weed causes or worsens these conditions but what often is the case is that people that already have these conditions happen to smoke weed and part of this is for symptom control part of this is just for relaxation and part of this is that people with mental illness generally gravitate towards substance use as a whole in general like people that have mental illnesses are generally considered to be a marginalized population there aren't enough resources available there's a lot of stigma um so this you know it makes sense like marginalized demographics are vulnerable in ways that non-marginalized demographics aren't and different ways for each demographic in particular right um regular consumption yeah so a lot of people smoke weed for the purpose of controlling symptoms of mania for instance or as like a replacement for other treatments for manic disorders or i'm sorry mood disorders or psychotic disorders the fact of the matter is if you have a disorder that has manic or psychotic elements to it then weed might actually make things worse in the long term so you should be super super careful if you're deciding to experiment and really work your way up and be like mindful about that it could be totally fine could change your life it could also have really serious consequences so always titrate always go slow um can you become addicted to weed oh one more thing about this is that weed is very effective at reducing acute symptoms of ptsd there is no proven efficacy for using weed for ptsd long term but acutely in the short term it's shown to be very useful uh can you get addicted to weed the answer is yes you totally can this is something that drives me nuts because people are like oh it's just weed it's not even it's plant medicine i got beef with plant medicine and i'll talk about it later serious beef with decrim nature campaigns to be honest um yeah well i'll talk about the chat in a second so uh you can totally withdraw from using weed that is physical dependence now remember the difference is physical dependence means that your body has habituated to the presence of a substance without the substance your body doesn't function as normal addiction is a behavioral pattern that has roots in all kinds of different [ __ ] but ultimately it's a behavioral pattern that becomes reinforced which can express in neurological ways addiction is super complicated but the point is that you can have cravings for something and you can have repeated reinforcing behavior about something without withdrawing from it and you can withdraw from something without having the mental preoccupation with it then on the other side of the coin i know i've repeated this a bunch it's because everybody forgets there's psychological dependence which is not the same as addiction psychological dependence is when you are using something to remove a symptom basically so for instance with um benzos you might be using a substance to remove anxiety or panic and with the removal of a benzo you might not crave it but your symptoms might return in fuller force that's psychological dependence but it's also like these terms can be used a little interchangeably sometimes in the case of weed you can have addictive behaviors and neurological patterns around weed you know like you can around most things to be honest and yes you can totally get physical withdrawals from weed especially if you've been like a long-term daily user um irritability really bad insomnia insomnia is the major one um feelings of like anger or like anhedonia or dysphoria like you're not just you're just not feeling well that's very common and it's a real thing okay uh real quick i have hypomania i don't think weed would help me at all yes deterra is the only plant medicine i need well charles i wish you all the best on that discovery journey rattlesnakes are natural too weed withdrawals are real yeah they really are they really are sneaky so the question about physical health though is one that honestly i can't answer um it does weed cause brain damage the short answer is no like in in the short term or in moderation there is no empirical evidence showing that weed causes like significant damage to your brain or to your body um however chronic heavy users of weed might show memory deficits it's possible um might show and this has been shown largely to be reversible as far as we know right now but again these studies are super biased and longitudinal studies studies that are like spanning across a lot of evidence often are pulling from biased studies so it's just so hard to know and now that the social and political climate around wheat is changing we're going to get some different answers that are possibly skewed in the other direction that are funded by cannabis magazines and agencies and like research companies that's the kind of stuff you have to look for like the bias of the researcher completely influences the outcome of the research so i don't know is the answer to this one i have combed through probably 40 or 50 articles today alone in preparation for this to make sure that i'm up to date on this stuff since last year and the answer is still not clear um lung disease if you're smoking something combustion hurts ouchy like you're probably not going to be doing any major favors to your tissues of your lungs there is some potential preliminary evidence showing that you might be at higher risk of copd or pulmonary [Music] good um of like asthma exacerbation if you have something going on respiratory wise then it's probably not great for you and during the era of covid it's a double-edged sword because you have cbd which might have immunoprotectant properties but simultaneously if you're smoking weed it probably is not going to do great things for your overall lung health and respiratory health so basically if you're gonna do the weed then i highly recommend looking into alternate methods of consumption like you can vaporize it that's a great alternative to smoking it however it often hits you a lot harder and faster depending on if you're doing concentrates or just like flower vapes so be very careful about that or you can eat edibles now here's a fun little tidbit about edibles edibles produce a different high yes i said it they produce a different high because the actual ratio of chemical molecules in your system is different for edibles and it is for smoking the reason being that the primary active component of weed delta 9 thc delta 9 right and i'm not going to talk about delta 8 i don't know enough about it to talk about it today but i'll pick some stuff up and get back to you guys um delta 9 thc when you smoke it it's it's an oil soluble it's a fat soluble oil soluble um compound so when you smoke it it gets into your bloodstream really really quickly and immediately is like i need an endocannabinoid receptor because your blood is mostly water so that delta 9 thc doesn't really get processed by your liver as much it doesn't make it to your liver as much as when you eat it now what happens in the liver is that delta 9 thc is metabolized to 11 hydroxy thc which is a different compound altogether it's like it's a metabolite it's a very um unique kind of experience and that's part of why you get higher for longer and it's often more intense is because of this slow metabolic processing that produces a more powerful metabolite so there is a different experience of eating edibles and smoking weeds some people prefer one to the other but it is true that you will get higher for longer from edibles and that is the reason smoking daily causes me insomnia is there a way to counter the laziness side effect that happens to some consumers so i remember reading something a year or two ago about this but i have not been able to find the article since then so this is just a jumping off point for you all to research about how there was a study done on dopaminergic effects of thc i believe or maybe it was just cannabis as the plant as a whole with the the mixture of compounds um that said basically that um short-term use can enhance dopaminergic signaling it basically increases functionality in your reward system for the time being but long-term chronic use has the opposite effect has a habituating effect on your reward system which makes stoner laziness real and i like i said i can't find where that study is so take that with a packet of salt take it with a couple of packets of salt until you can actually find the source of that information but that could definitely have something to do with it also um yeah honestly there's not really that much of a way to get around it edibles might actually be better for that in tiny quantities uh yeah you'll have to experiment okay now i just want to share with you guys a scene from a film how many of you seen super troopers i want to know exactly how many of you have seen wait held up your hand if you've seen super troopers before no so few of you so few have returned okay well here we go this is a really bad stoner comedy like it's bad it's low quality this is not a good film in fact i haven't watched it in many years but i bet that if i watched it now i would be like this is trash it actually should probably not be watched but this opening scene i know is good so we're gonna watch this so they've just been in the car and they have a big-ass bag of weed and a big-ass bag of mushrooms and they're getting pulled over on the freeway and they're smoking a joint and they're like oh [ __ ] what do we do so they have this guy in the back seat eat the entire bag of weed and the entire bag of mushrooms in one go and he's like choking in the back seat it just gotten pulled over we haven't been introduced to the main characters in this movie yet so we don't know what's gonna happen is that the same car man to do it look high [Music] [Music] license and registration uh officer i know that license and registration please you know how fast you were going what how fast you were going i was 65. 63. officer isn't isn't the speed limit 65 yeah it is where are you boys headed to canada we're going over the border to canada for some french fries and gravy sure poutine canada almost made it are you okay yeah sure yes sir yes sir no did you say yes sir i think he said yeah sure what'd you say man well i said yeah sure but literally what i said was yeah sure sir so you are okay then yes sir you smell something rabbit fear now hand over that registration yes sir my mother was just about to pull out my nine oh my god [Applause] [Music] [Music] it's real bummer that that doesn't include the part where the kid in the back seat starts tripping and the guy's like are you okay and he was gonna do bars anyway and that's just your brief glimpse obligatory glimpse of the stoner culture um and then there's how high have any of you seen how high hang on [Music] oh my god i want a free stay at marriott hotels god they're so nice to me they offer me this free hotel room like five times a day it's so sweet okay so real quick evolution of the stoner comedy right this is like just obligatory the big lebowski i'm sure many of you are intimately familiar with dazed and confused up in smoke harold kumar pineapple express super troopers of course but this all started with reefer madness which is arguably the original stoner comedy am i right now it actually is kind of watched as a stoner comedy as people are like this is really really whack um hey cap so just a quick history shebang about weed it's been around forever literally thousands of years this tomb was discovered where someone was buried i believe in china with a bowl of weed next to them like this is a revered plant in many many cultures and real quick i want to do like a brief global dive into this with this over 12 000 years ago a revolution began to spread throughout the world humankind began to transition from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle to one of settlement thanks to agriculture the emerging practice of farming indigenous to central asia cannabis is believed to have existed in the region since the pre-neolithic period the chinese people first cultivated cannabis as early as 4000 bce referred to as ma the fibers of the plant stock known as hemp the non-psychoactive form of cannabis were beaten off by hand to create paper and cloth around this time stories of a mythical chinese emperor named shen nung began to surface these portray him as an early proponent of cultivating cannabis for both paper and cloth and is a champion of cannabis for medicinal and recreational purposes as the stories go chad nung was a herbalist whose findings were reportedly documented in the great herb an ancient guide that has since been rewritten and updated and is still in use by practitioners of traditional chinese medicine today the great herbal stated that cannabis is good for the five organs as well as bringing the body into yin-yang balance the text also stated that cannabis was good for your skin stomach hair and energy and that it could help you let go and if consumed long enough could teach people how to talk to the gods and much like how cannabis is wind pollinated its usage wafted westward across the different regions and cultures of the ancient world in india cannabis was mentioned in the vedas the old scriptures of hinduism there cannabis would later be referred to as the food of the gods ground into taste with a mortar and pestle it was given an edible preparation [Music] and allegedly a holy man did eat cannabis ate a single seed daily from india to the middle east and onto africa cannabis continued its spread passed from indian hindu travelers to mystic sufi travelers as european commerce and conquest intersected with the middle east and india cannabis traveled to new continents specifically to the western hemisphere courtesy of the spanish italian portuguese british and french who made it a necessity for their empires back home in europe the rise of hemp increased both the design and quality of ships ropes and sails this enabled boats to sail further over 12 000 years ago colonies the continent became home to new as the new world became home to new colonies the continent became home to new industries enforced by royal demands and growing empire in the 17th century jean talon the representative of king louis xiv in quebec confiscated threat to encourage inhabitants to grow hemp and in the british colonies king james made hemp cultivation mandatory for ship sales to ensure british supremacy on the high seas [Music] cultivation wasn't just for the maritime age it was for the modern medicinal age too that same century louis a bear apothecary to samuel duchamp plain planted the first known cannabis plant in canada in 1606 while the greeks had long thrown cannabis onto hot coals and spas to relax dr william brook o'shaughnessy was the first european to throw cannabis into rigorous medical testing during the 19th century he found it had great value as a sedative and anti-convulsive relieving the pain of rheumatism stopping convulsions and quelling muscle spasms validating indian folk uses of cannabis through a medical lens o'shaughnessy popularized cannabis therapeutic uses and medical papers o'shaughnessy's papers created buzz starting a trend of turning pot into patent medicines the precursor to over-the-counter medicine by the early 20th century 2 000 different cannabis medicines were being produced by close to 300 manufacturers in the west unregulated patent medicines some of which were dangerous were advertised with unsubstantiated and often fraudulent claims about their efficacy this caught the ire of american authorities who implemented the pure food and drug act at the start of the 20th century an action believed to set cannabis on the course to okay so i have a couple of problems with this video the first is that it's a super white-washed version of this history um the second is yeah charles as you said no comment about afghanistan and the middle east which is like this um but the third is that this was i think a really beautiful video which is why i like it so much i think it's a very like nice visual description of how this cultural shift took place but it also totally neglects the fact that south america was growing weed too like the problem with the history of wheat is that if you really wanted to look at where it was globally during this time you'd have to look like everywhere except russia probably but like so many different countries and regions were growing weed and using it for different purposes um yeah in india there's bong i'm not pronouncing it correctly bong b-h-a-n-g um and it's a drink that is weed infused very bitter apparently um cush mountain check so what i really want to look at though is weed in america in the early early 20th century and this is like one of the most despicable acts of historical legislation and one of the most racist pieces of legislation ever enacted and the history behind it is pretty terrible um this guy harry [ __ ] anslinger his name is actually just harry anslinger his middle name is probably something different he was the head of the department of prohibition for alcohol in the tens when the volstead act was in place it was prohibition against alcohol we're going to look at what that looked like in in actuality i don't know if you guys know this but i think around 10 000 americans died because the us government intentionally poisoned alcohol making supplies during prohibition yep this has been going on forever but why did prohibition end because white people wanted their boots back so harry ann slinger was gonna lose his job basically is what it comes down to he the the dea didn't exist yet the fda i think was just in the works at this point in time um and he was quoted as saying there is no more absurd fallacy than the idea that cannabis is dangerous now pay attention to him saying did i leave a quote oh no i didn't pay attention to the word cannabis here this is important he calls it cannabis [ __ ] you harry anslinger now 1910 to 1920 the mexican revolution was happening and there were i think around 800 000 legal immigrants from mexico to the united states illegal immigrants and um mexican immigrants brought the practice of actually smoking weed which had been in the united states without incident at all up until that point in time had been used medicinally was being explored for other practices and purposes you saw there were tons of medications that were based off of it and of course we are in america and the immediate response to this influx of legal mexican immigrants was basically a public health crisis that was manufactured the idea was that people didn't want immigrants coming in the great depression was brewing and what better way to conflate these things by xenophobia and being like well obviously that this like devil's plant is marijuana like this is not cannabis anymore it's marijuana and it was said with like that exaggerated pronunciation specifically to emphasize the otherness of those who smoked it and this is possibly actually um before this even chinese opium dens in the late 1800s same deal xenophobia in northern california and the railroads with chinese immigrants like extraordinary bigotry faced by chinese immigrants and then we'll also look at the cocaine fields where cocaine was intentionally supplied to black laborers and then later demonized because productivity got too high and the same pattern is repeated but this is possibly the most like directly visible in legislature this thing happening there is no mistake here this is no hypothesis this is like point a to point b harry ann slinger made the connection mexican people are dirty they smoke weed let's call it marijuana also i'm gonna lose my job and this was how the transition from prohibition of alcohol to prohibition of marijuana was seamless with the marijuana tax act of 1937. marijuana is the most violence-causing drug in the history of mankind as well as some other tidbits which i will not read out loud so take a second this is the basis for prohibition of weed in this country this right here this was what started all of it now immediately following this 1936 one year before the marijuana tax act was passed reefer madness was released innocently they danced of the new and deadly menace lurking behind closed doors [Music] the burning weed with its roots in hell in this film you will see the ease with which this vicious plant can be grown in your neighbor's yard rolled into harmless looking cigarettes hidden in an innocent huge or watch case if you want a great smoke try one of these you will meet bill who wants to pride in his strong will as he takes the first step toward enslavement but at a terrible price divorce violence murder [Music] suicide and the ultimate end of the marijuana addict [Music] hopeless insanity [Music] see this important film now before it is too late it's like really hard to believe that that's like an actual full feature-length film that was released like dead ass that was released so after that point this became a rallying cry this became a rallying cry of racism and anti-immigrant ideologies was we don't want marijuana in the country up until the 60s there were extremely harsh laws for possessing weed within states and every year they got worse and worse and worse until the 50s rolled around and suddenly your white suburban kids were interested in smoking weed and almost immediately with these white kids at risk of being arrested state laws were loosened up federal laws remained the same but state laws started changing specifically in response to this trend started changing as a means of accommodating very literally now in 1972 richard nixon hired the schaefer commission which was basically this panel of people that he expected to back up his his claim that marijuana was an extremely dangerous drug that should be outlawed immediately but this backfired with uh pretty extraordinary flying colors basically saying we actually don't see any risk here and you should decriminalize it completely and he immediately disbanded the shaffer commission and hushed it up like nothing had happened this is a real thing that did indeed happen the article is linked in this slide if you're curious now right now on the map let's take a look at this is a really useful website if you're curious about weed in your state right now because the laws are changing this was updated this month um disa dot com slash map of marijuana legality by state and it's great because you can see where it's legal versus decriminalized for medical or recreational purposes and there's more information down here and you can look at the original state or the actual state laws so if this is something that might benefit you then check this out it's on the slide and now i want to point out something very very interesting is anyone familiar with this patent already say so in the chat if you are a weed patent no one is familiar with it interesting okay let's look at this this is a patent for cannabinoids as antioxidants and neuroprotectants filed by the united states of america in 2003 the united states government specifically the department of health and human services patented the medical use of cannabinoids in 2003. now that's a bit weird isn't it isn't cannabis schedule 1 indicating that its components have no accepted medical value so how did they get away with this and why did they do this there was obviously knowledge that cannabis and its components 100 and 1320 i think actually cannabinoids contained within it now this actually might be out of date at this point i could not find an update to figure it out but i don't think it is out of date in response to that patent the united specifically that patent the united states government could grant an organization exclusive rights to research the potential outcomes of that patent and i think in 2015 maybe maybe 2017 they granted it to canalife now this one company is now able to perform research on this patent and patenting is a whole sticky subject that we're going to look into later it is really a mess but this opens a lot of questions right about idaho is trying to ban future legalization legislation l-o-l um this opens a lot of questions about whether the united states government can patent potential applications of substances that are like literally derived from strains because this could mean that this sets up a really easy way for the us government to start kind of like striking deals with major organizations that could then exploit their understanding of how to mix strains etc and produce their own unique proprietary blends that can't be used by anyone else this is all speculation there's no indicator right now that the us government is going to collab with monsanto except does anyone know who makes the pesticides that are used to spray coca crops in south america monsanto the u.s government contracts monsanto for their pesticides so in effect this is very literally like a big handshake corporation thing that's happening right now with like the mixture of politics and drugs and income it's all completely interrelated you scratch my back i scratch yours um now because of this is like an interesting side effect of this happening now that we've had an increase in availability of weed in the united states the boom we're seeing that cartels have been switching their focus because even when there is when when there is i don't know what i was going to say something about supply and demand but the point is that there's lots of demand for drugs and now that there's a legal market for weed which was really probably the most lucrative and easiest to grow comparatively um growers are switching to poppy like it just makes sense and this basically shows why incrementalism won't work if you remove the illicit market for one thing that's being produced like the need is being filled by people that are trying to get by basically then they'll switch to something else that needs to be made like you're not going to just like get rid of the illicit market by legalizing certain substances and not others and i can stay after and elaborate on my feelings on this but this is why it is all or nothing baby it is so much easier to say let's decrim all drugs than it is to say let's decrim only heroin and meth and cocaine and pcp because those are the ones that are left over like imagine how many years that would take you can't really do that oh we're gonna run out of time now this is opening a can of worms that we're going to come back to in much greater detail later but the start of talking about incarceration and this is oh there this rabbit hole goes so deep y'all like so deep we start with this concept of private prisons which we'll come back to private prisons have a contract law enforcement officers in the government basically or with with the government specifically saying for the vast majority of them we need to always be 90 to 100 full at all times this is in contract with private prisons in the government which means that if they're not 100 full taxpayers foot the bill paying for whoever would have occupied those cells there is incentive to arrest not to mention prison labor which we'll come back to in a little bit drug possession is by far and away the easiest thing to arrest someone for arresting by the numbers is canon and american law enforcement and culture but then there's also this thing called asset forfeiture which some of you might not be familiar with and asset forfeiture is basically saying you can seize something that you suspect to have been in relation to a crime now obviously most of asset forfeitures are going to be around substances and most of those are going to be around weed because it's it's slim pickens basically you can say oh this car that you were using to transport that's ours now but the the worst part is that you don't even need to be charged or convicted for them to keep your property and yes this is a real thing that happens right now if you are involved or suspected to be involved in something that is drug related or crime related they can literally just take your stuff and auction it and they can keep the profits or it's basically like you auction it or you do like a trade of goods and then the profits are split between the government and the law enforcement office that was responsible for this forfeiture there is perverse incentive there is [ __ ] up incentive for law enforcement to perpetuate this cycle of civil asset forfeiture yes and you know this isn't a direct tie to private prisons and minimum occupancies because the prison industrial complex is a much bigger beast than this that involves so much more than just this but know that asset forfeiture exists and it is benefited by this now as of 2018 four in ten drug arrests forty percent of drug arrests were made for possession sale or manufacture of weeds specifically forty percent now most of our arrests in the country are made for weed or not weed are made for drugs and most of those arrests are made for possession like the vast vast majority of incarceration around drugs is non-violent and for possession we'll look more into this when we do our incarceration unit but like this is low-hanging fruit of the country but then it gets more yeah then it gets more specific right like this isn't just an issue of money grabbing this is an issue of racist policing it has always been a racist policing when people say the system is broken the system is functioning as it was built to function we cannot continue functioning on a constitution that was built by cis-hat white men and hundreds of years ago i say covering up the fact that i forgot for a second what century the constitution was written in um but regardless it's [ __ ] out of date you know what i mean like update that software please it's really really overdue so this was 2001 2010. this is the arrest rate comparison of black americans versus white americans around weed in i think virginia i think this is the state of virginia this is blatant factual racism on paper it shouldn't take this being on paper for it to be understood but it does so here it is broken down by county cook illinois is chicago now again we're going to get way way way further into this later and we're just about to be out of time but yeah this is this is right here like one of the biggest topics that we're going to talk about in this course the rate of use of weed by black americans versus white americans is about the same no joke almost identical in fact the rate of sale of weed is thought to be higher by white americans but this is what we're looking at food for thought for next time we're going to go into much greater detail um i'm going to stick around for oh that's right what i was going to say at the start was about guest speakers a friend of mine is an underground happy hardcore dj in los angeles who is like the king of rave so if any of you are particularly interested in learning about underground rave culture specifically in the realm of like obscure electronic music that migrated from europe and has become like massively intertwined orion you know it's flapjack um then you might be really into this because he's like a character and a half if i pick a date for this i will send out more information but also if you consider yourself to be like an expert in a particular field pertaining to substances or you know someone that is feel free to refer them to me i want to schedule our first roundtable discussion coming up soon which is going to be on decrim nature and incrementalism so um you can also feel free to send me an email if there's something in particular you think we should do a roundtable on like a specific discussion about but i will send out a poll sometime in the next like eight months with more questions that you can fill out basically as soon as i get my [ __ ] together i will send out a poll to ask you guys what you would most like to see uh this could include possibly like a meeting with the founder of dance safe for instance to talk about the different trends in ecstasy since 1998 and prior to that or uh other kind of like similar things that might be a little bit sneaky sneaky eight more months of class um other than that i'm gonna stop recording now and i'll stick around for questions and if not then have a great night", "mT7FYNlaVtE": "[Music] do [Music] do [Music] do [Music] [Music] [Music] hey john it's time oh hey how's it going episode i'll eat sleep code the official telework podcast uh so we've got some fun links to share with everybody today i say fun but you know usually they're they're entertaining i don't know if they're fun they're they're definitely entertaining um sorry go ahead go ahead i was gonna say for the key the keen eyes behind you uh obviously i don't have my green screen today and that's because my office is a total disaster so i have not had a chance to put it up so apologies for the uh the mess uh man it was uh a busy weekend news um i don't know if i covered this one last week but uh it didn't have you last week so i wanted to share this again if we didn't get a chance to talk about it already so this this was um an interesting one did you hear about this one no i didn't actually i just laughed at the title oh my gosh so yeah the title is i know exactly what this is though yeah i know exactly what this is yeah yeah so this um and i can't remember does it yeah it's zooming okay um so if this mom decides that she wants to bump somebody else off the cheerleading squad to make room for her her daughter that did not make first cut so she goes full like uh what's what's that show on uh showtime like i have no idea silicon valley or uh mr robot and decides to um use deep fakes to uh make uh videos and pictures of these girls like smoking and drinking and doing other things they shouldn't be doing hey points for creativeness you know i think yeah minus minus a million points for maliciousness but there you go she got uh points to the tune of uh being arrested so she um i this is one of those things where i think um technology precedes like law and they didn't really have a law so much to show at her so they just kind of went with the old harassment okay they're like this is uh harassment that's it we'll go with harassment so she's currently accused of doing this to these kids terrible man it's terrible but you know like i said like two points for being creative but minus a billion for being malicious yeah i i don't think this will be the last time we see this by the way this is oh no the first no the pandora's box has been opened so yeah so this this is an unfortunate use of a very uh impressive technology that we've we've talked about a few times on the show i think we talked about one where they had um they were like reanimating like old photos and stuff like that it was pretty cool so there are cool and good uses and this is not one of one of them at all so uh yeah it's a hundred thousand a hundred thousand lines of typescript retrospective what's this yeah so um obviously people you know they they're starting to come out with some project other than visual studio code people often you know uh are citing sort of projects that that are being built with typescript etc and this is one of them and uh basically um you know i think that uh there's a lot of there's a lot of interesting data coming out of people's experiences with programming languages and frameworks and you know a hundred thousand lines is nothing to sneeze at so um this is a bit of a retrospective of uh what this um this author went through in regards to working with typescript and some of the good things some of the bad things some of the things that they found worked well so the things that worked well on their team their team was consistent about 11 front-end engineers um three or four engineers directly involved in a migration of a project these guys were um essentially migrating from i believe it was where was it they were using remember here somewhere but um long story short they basically migrated um and then utilized typescript for part of that process and found that they got a lot of errors fixed they were pleasantly surprised with what typescript was able to provide them they used a tool called ts migrate which is um you know i there's there's a number of strategies in terms of you know migration but um you know automated tools i found don't always do the best job but they can be an easy win so to speak so um but yeah uh kind of a discussion around here of uh what this person went through 68 errors fixed yes that's a lot of a lot of bugs to fix yes errors didn't necessarily mean bugs but i love this title though regex's everywhere yeah we actually went through some of this process ourselves um not so much a conversion from javascript but rather we um at octopus we had uh there's a there's a number of flags you can enable and disable on typescript there's ones like null checks for example so because of the fact that that typescript has a lot of strict type checking and a lot of semantic or syntactic analysis of your code there's a great rules engine built into typescript and so one of the rules that we had disabled was strict null checks and we enabled that and eliminated a whole class of bugs now with that comes a lot of checking so you have to make sure that um so there's the potential for values to be null and if the if the compiler does not determine whether or not you're doing adequate enough job of determining whether something is null it will complain and so we had lots and lots of complaints so um you know these things are good but if they if they start off uh that way um you can keep up but obviously when you turn these things on after a while um a lot of these errors start to creep out so um but this is one of the strengths i think of typescript is the fact that it's got this great rules engine um that people seem to really enjoy it um you know um the the nature of npm and types and all that sort of stuff definitely typed and emitting types so that you can use them elsewhere that can be a bit of a you know not not a challenge but a pain uh that being said it's it's actually quite nice to work in i find yeah that title about regex is reminding me something so i pulled it up really quick ah there you go we've we've talked about source generators on the show a little bit yeah yeah and i've never written one so i decided last week to write the uh odd holiest of unholy uh source generators and uh i'm not sure if this thing has legs yet but i had to put like the biggest uh regex i think i've ever written together to make it work all right so um i'm i'm able to uh parse your css and yank the media queries out and source generate uh strong types based on those media queries so you can use them in blazer code i think these tools exist for other languages but blazer is certainly one i have not seen so that's interesting yeah so you it basically scans that css file and then um i put in like a pseudo c sharp attribute language that you can use to to mark it and name it so it will pick that up and and actually name the breakpoint or you can just do the auto generated uh screen sizes that it pulls off the the actual media query itself so uh it's it was quite the experiment but uh it does some pretty cool stuff so far so source generators are neat man they are they they look great at the beginning so uh they they they're a lot of fun to play with in the very beginning but then after a while they become you have to start writing some ungodly code to do some very specific things that people might want and uh jeffrey barnes hears this regex's voodoo if you saw the rejects for the this uh this source generator you you would agree it's like two it's like two lines like across yeah everyone convert everyone can convert a class or a type to begin with like oh string is string int is int and then after a while it's like oh my god this tuple is giving me a headache you know like i can't figure this out how do i convert this so yeah so there there is a uh simple regex that finds the media query itself and then there is a much more complex one that finds this uh phony um uh cs or c-sharp attribute that you can use to name so you can say app breakpoint name equals and it will it will find that pull the name off of it and then also find the next media query in line that you named so it pairs those two things up in the tool so it does that uh also what i didn't know about source generators was i could pull i could bring in um my own parameters so you can like specify the name space that gets applied to the uh source code that it generates yup yup um you can do whatever you want there you can create the properties to be whatever you want and do whatever you want so i thought that was pretty cool so nice it's pretty flexible tooling and uh it's it's opened up some new ideas but i'm not sure if this is one that's gonna stick or not i feel like i've created like frankenstein's monster here okay i'm i'm not sure if uh if removing a css media query should break a compile that is something that that feels very strange to me so i'm waiting to see how community at large responds to this idea all right probably with hostility pitchforks and torches most likely like i said it is very frankensteiny feeling so you know um speaking of frankenstein's monster no this is actually really cool uh the ml.net team ha they have revamped the ml builder tool the model builder tool that's baked into visual studio um i say baked in but i think you still have to opt into it there i think there's a menu item there permanently but you when you click on it it says go ahead and install this package and it'll light up the rest of the tooling um so they revamped this tool and it was already pretty good to begin with but i think it was more of a prototype than a finished product so they're they're kind of tightening it up and making it a lot more useful so uh when you're in your your net in application environment here in visual studio you literally can say add machine learning and you've got a new uh ad machine learning dialogue that comes up in visual studio um and then they've kind of updated the ui for this and it brings you through like a step-by-step wizard so you get your you know you pick your scenario what are you trying to build a model for that kind of determines a set of training algorithms that it will use and then you select environment um i think that's like where are you going to train are you going to do it locally or in azure or do you have like a rig that you want to set up for this uh your data you know you bring in your csv files reported point at a sql all that good stuff then you train it evaluate it consume it it builds generates sample code for you and everything they've added a new config file for all of this so you can kind of share these things and retrain and uh tweak the uh what you've built through the ui yeah so that that's all brand new uh they've added some more options in in the uh part where you select your data um the consumption area has been redesigned as well this was very basic before uh i think it just gave you like one input box or something it kind of auto-generated up on the screen uh so they've added some more stuff for that as well so it's really really cool um to see how far this has come yes i suspect i'm sorry yeah i suspect that this tool will be used maybe once or twice and then you'll probably put it in as part of a workflow afterwards um but as a means to an end great um i i think that um these tools are great but unfortunately i've always found that wizards are kind of like they're always like the first try the first time experience is always really pleasant but then after that you're like just get out of the way get out of the way wizard i wanna i wanna i want you to do what i want you to do but i don't like all the dialog boxes and so that's when the cli takes over i found that that is true for a lot of software development things um ml is a little bit of a different beast oh for sure yep yeah and um i i initially thought that going into uh learning some machine learning stuff and this is like like microsoft has uh different levels of entry for the the machine learning space and they're all very well staged out their lowest like entry level i would say is like cognitive services where it's already done for you you just say i want to recognize faces and all i want to do is you know make an api call i don't want to train something i let you microsoft people do that for me and you can go into cognitive services and get you know face recognition or text uh services those type of things then they've got another platform called azure machine learning that is like another entry level thing where you can drag and drop your models together using like a it looks like vizio or something you know you drag workflows onto a surface it's actually really well done um and it it does a good job teaching you all of the machine learning um uh glossary terms and all those things so it actually it tells you uh a good deal about what each model is and it's got inputs and outputs for each you know block of code and it really simplifies things but teaches you a lot at the same time and it's a really powerful tool too and this kind of sits in the middle ground where you're not writing it from scratch but you know you're getting you know that that initial block of code generated for you and i think this is a real sweet spot right here sure especially with that config file that they added i've i've always had this philosophy which is cli before ui so the fact that they have a cli is great um it looks like this is a little bit of polish on what they had before i went i took the liberty of going to the github repo that hosts this and it looks like the ui they had um is a was a little uh crusty uh but this one certainly looks a lot better yep yeah like i said this this config file i think is yeah i think more of that step that you're looking for john it's uh you know get the ui out of my way and you just get in here with some jason and kind of finish some things out and you know hit go and it's it's building your model for you um the biggest thing the biggest challenge i've always found with with cli the cli route is as the first time experience that's why i think wizards are great for the first time experience but then after that it's cli all the way you know so anyway sorry i'll stop one thing that's uh really cool about this tool and you may be able to activate this from the command line as well but um it will uh iterate through different uh algorithms and then it will evaluate those five to ten algorithms and give you the one that perform the best um and to have a kind of a a wizard whether it's click through or run from the command line that can do that i think is a really powerful tool to have for for ml totally agree especially if you're not a data scientist full-time and oh yeah something you're trying to add value to your product with and you don't have you know a huge time investment to go learn that stuff and uh this gives you kind of that stepping stone that you need to get ahead i know i i know we've been on this for a bit but i'll just say that um i was i'm a big naysayer of ai at the moment um in its present form um ml though is a bit of a different animal and i know that the two get lumped together a lot of times but ml i think is has a lot of merit i think and should not be ignored and i'm not normally one of those people to easily gravitate towards something but i've seen some examples i've seen cases where i'm like you know what that makes a lot of sense and the thing about ml is that it's a it's a means to an end which is it's not the perfect solution by any stretch like computers are basically iterating they're doing what what they're really good at doing which is doing something over and over and over again really quickly so i think that ml has if you've got an engineering mindset which is look it's kind of like the same sort of approach that i do at spacex which is look we're not gonna have the perfect solution let's just launch the let's just launch the thing and see what happens you know like so i think ml is kind of in that swing virtual context it's like let's just iterate over this thing and see what happens and then we'll get better and we'll get better and we'll get better so i my hats off to ml in some respects they've done a really good job that whole community in terms of bring it to the masses yeah so um ml and ai so ai ml is a subset of ai so not all not all ai's ml but all ml is ai that makes sense so it's uh it's if they're they're cousins to other things uh like vision uh computer vision and all that stuff uh but yeah people do kind of just like lump them up into one big category these days yeah yeah yeah this is more data science and um statistics based computing than anything yeah it's it's really amazing stuff so that you can use in your pretty much any kind of application these days yeah all right open telemetry.net yes sir netflix has been busy eh well yeah i mean uh it's not just.net but open open telemetry is this sort of initiative if you go to open telemetry dot io it's basically um you know telemetry has been around forever we've had we've had uh this sort of broad support across the industry for telemetry across multiple languages and what this is basically about doing is um basically trying to provide um crop that support across several languages and frameworks and so the idea is that you should just be able to integrate this drop it in and then the the surface area looks the same by and large for doing all your logging and tracing and collection of metrics etcetera etcetera so uh i think this is a good thing um this is the obviously the dot-net implementation of it um and uh so this is basically the application of it and uh i think this is going to be good going forward for a lot of folks cool yeah this uh this reminds me a bit of the initiative to get uh swagger built in with um yes open api and um that's like just enabled by default now and yeah so now that's that's that work is being called it's now called swashbuckle under asp.net core and swagger is now the old term it's actually it actually refers to yeah like telerik in progress like oh yes yeah yeah so uh when you refer to the spec it's you should refer to it as open api and then uh when you refer to the framework that varies from obviously from language language and then.net.net core it's swashbuckle cool so open telemetry is is for net is this implementation and uh this i think is good i think that if you're wanting to provide an implementation that will have long legs hopefully if this thing continues you never know but uh if you're looking if you're doing logging tracing metric collection etc and you want to do in a consistent manner that will work across frameworks and languages this is the approach to take all right let's see what we've got up next sorry i'm clicking wrong no you're fine no no you you clicking button things in my view i can't get rid of there we go i don't think they're i don't think they care too much it's all good mozilla security yes firefox 87 trims hd prefers steve what is this all about all right so from the headline let's yeah let's start with the beginning which is what is an http referrer and an http referrer is is basically an ht header that gets tacked on to a request that tells you this request uh was visiting this resource prior to hitting you so hey web server uh i was on cnn.com before i came to yourwebsite.com and the thing about referrers is that they provide you with you know for the website owner it gives you valuable data as to where people are coming from so if you're thinking of things such as um you know marketing campaigns etc and referrers are used in that that manner for a variety of things as well the problem with referrers is that they can be very leaky they can actually they can actually do a lot of nasty things in terms of leaking your privacy because they sometimes can contain a lot of user specific data query string variables there's all kinds of things that can get in there and so chrome um interestingly uh recently uh enabled this where they basically were um they were blanking this out basically and so firefox has followed suit in 87 version 87 of firefox and so um in terms of user privacy this is a good thing and there's a lot of things that are going along the lines here as well in terms of policy which they articulate here but the the by the large of it is uh that you know firefox is following suit for compatibility with other browsers and i think this is a good thing we're starting to take back a little bit of our own control in terms of privacy um what's interesting in terms of this is that there seems to be a battle there's a lot of contention going on between various companies for user data um you're seeing this with apple you're seeing this with facebook in terms of either being on for or against et cetera um i think uh you know all this is good that we hash these things out we have the we have the full control over the protocols and such and why we shouldn't prevent doing these things um you know so this is a good thing and it was just an fyi in terms of if people are looking to use a different browser and they care about security and privacy this might be one reason um but again it's something that you know will continue to evolve so uh speaking of security and privacy john did you know did you yes we talked about this earlier did we talk about this yeah a little bit we briefly mentioned it that when you go incognito it's not really incognito but the lawsuit is different yeah so did you know that all those uh shopping sites that you've been yes yes googling yeah we all know what you're talking about we're shopping we're shopping for gifts for our special one and we don't want them to see what we're shopping for so apparently now uh this this was not clear enough apparently so this verge is not clear enough is what the lawsuit is um although i i i'm pretty certain that it's clear enough to me that uh when it says that it won't save this but it will actually transmit websites you visit your employer your school your service provider yeah that it is indeed tracking some of the things oh for sure yeah definitely your isp your isp knows everything about you everything uh unless you're using a vpn um so yeah you're if you're not using a vpn your isp knows everything like everything so um yeah just something to be aware of so i would i would expect some changes to come to that screen because this is what they're trying to uh base their lawsuit on now yeah and that's fair i think i think under understandably google you know they they need to articulate these things because they have to remember that not everyone is technical and this stuff can get a little bit like i feel bad for people who aren't technical because it can get a bit you have to kind of think back to when you didn't know anything about computers and and realize like okay i don't know what any of these terms mean and so i think they i think there's a there it behooves tech companies especially to to basically make these descriptions bearable for layman um because without that people are not they have to look up terms they have to figure out what what the heck is an isp what the heck is a cookie i don't know what a cookie is i heard i i thought that was something you ate you know sort things so yeah yeah so uh do you think it's um it holds enough water for a five billion dollar lawsuit well the reality is most of these lawsuits start off large and then they get paired down to something very very small um they typically end up i don't even have no data to support this other than my anecdotal sort of what i've seen happen before but they start off with like a five trillion dollar lawsuit and it gets paired down to like five million you know so usually like one percent of the lawsuit or you know what typically can also happen is that there are changes made and the suit gets settled and we actually have we we actually end up better for it so i think some of these things are not just done from for reasons that make people may think like the the dollar amount gets mentioned a lot that's the thing that corporations care the most about i think and so that is that is the deterrent towards this bad behavior and i'm not i'm not throwing google under the bus for this behavior this is just what what they deem to be needs to be changed and and i'm assuming that this group when went to google and said listen you guys got to change this and for whatever reason maybe it didn't get changed or such but uh i you know i have to believe people are acting in good faith i think i remember one from years ago that went through where um somebody claimed damages because they're you know you know the thing that you can click on to retrieve your passwords from uh the browser yeah they first started integrating that with the browser yes um you can basically go in and see a list of all the websites that a user has passwords saved for even if you can't get to the passwords you know that that person has been to that location yeah so uh somebody i believe sued at one point because their their wife or significant other got in there and saw they had passwords to you know like escort services or whatever it was perfect great yeah just wonderful i'm being sarcastic by the way when i'm saying that i need to i need to clarify i'm just like look uh you you know you don't i don't know sorry i just i say i'm just like great because i'm like i'm eye rolling as i'm saying that so yeah like uh if you know if you don't want somebody to be mad like don't blame google like no this is yourself yeah it's your fault you always gotta blame somebody else it's i guess yeah um you ever heard that term i got a bridge i could sell you sure uh so nfts have hit the point where yeah we we have a bridge that we're we're going to sell you so john cleese monty python's john cleese uh drew a picture of the brooklyn bridge yeah and uh nft it and then sold it so uh this is some i've been following this nft thing so it's non-fungible token yes um it's you know it's kind of like bitcoin but you're attaching it to uh digital assets virtual yeah and a digital asset virtual good um this one i it's it escapes me how this is supposed to be uh a place to make money like wow so unless you're somebody like john cleese that can get this kind of attention and sell a photo for online for fifty thousand dollars um or the other one was um the big news headline one was the twitter the first tweet from um ceo of twitter was sold for some yeah ungodly amount of money yeah jack jack something out and then and sold it for 2.3 billion i think or a million excuse me yeah so so uh it's something i'm just reading about in amazement because i just can't quite wrap my brain around how this is supposed to be a market well you know people said the same thing about uh cryptocurrency i guess so uh people wanna people wanna invest in tulips you know god bless them there's several marketplaces like that are are available now or you can go put your your animated gif or whatever the heck digital asset there yeah dude there's just absurd things on there and people are selling them and some of them are being bought and it's being flooded right now so i don't know if this stuff is just gonna sit out there in the ether forever or whatever it's gonna do i think i think we have better things to spend our time doing than this in my opinion and i think we have bigger problems to fix with technology than trying to implement something that is just let's see how we can you know turn this into money i think so but that's me with my sort of you know we should all be you know working on things like climate change or you know trying to you know figure out when's the next meteor coming or you know there's a lot of work to be done in those spaces by the way you know we could use your brain power uh developers please do not waste your time on this and i'm not saying that because i'm trying to deter you from making money god bless you if you you know if you make money doing something with technology but i think you know i think would be i think it would help if we worked on some of the world's problems i mean what is your what is your uh collectible animated gift going to be worth when the next meeting gets you out tens and tens of cents all right millions and millions of dodge coins that's right actually that's quite a that's actually dodge coins worth seven cents now so yeah it's it's bouncing a bit yeah yeah however you want to pronounce it i love that uh john cleese is still like trolling at his age sure sure yeah true sense of uh oh he's a true comedian yeah true comedian at heart yeah he's amazing love it yeah i love that he's keeping up with the the times yeah doing new things yeah taking [Music] speaking of a comedian with a modern swing on things oh there you go that has that had no traction no our good friend sam bazoo he's just all around good guy and if you want to learn about maui which is the new microsoft uh multi-platform ui approach to.net then i would suggest following sambasu sam has been all over this maui thing from the beginning um he's been checking out the blazer desktop stuff and blazer mobile bindings and xamarin and seeing how all this is going to fit together in.net 6. so he's writing about this in um on the newsletter blogs yeah yeah the sounds of maui keep up with this as they release new preview bits so i would highly highly suggest uh going to telerik.com and clicking on blogs and following sam's articles okay it's uh it's too much stuff like between the blazer you know whatnots and uh you know aot and all of that stuff that's coming in preview six i don't have time to keep up with all of this too so i rely on sam to to fill in those blanks for me so he's been on stream on our uh code live channel right here if you click follow um you'll see uh sam uh coding on some of this stuff as well so uh he's actually building stuff with with maui and uh learning a lot about it as he goes so just incidentally we're having we're having a lot of success using.net on other platforms as well at octopus so um we use net core three uh multi-platforming uh multi-platform support for shipping rcli which is used quite a quite a in quite a number of locations um so yeah we've got it working quite well we've got it running our bits running on linux which is also in a container so yeah it's all good stuff this this.net thing is here to stay it is it is in uh uh tj giving props to the headline there uh t speaking of uh stuff here to stay uh tj's talking about react on this channel by the way so uh if you're wanting to learn about react uh that'll take you hit that follow button man can't say it enough uh follow the live channel you'll find out all these these new things that are happening um so john it is time for your absolute favorite segment of oh more vr yeah we're we're not quite to vr yet okay not quite the vr yet so this is the uh segment of the show that i like to call hang on wait for it showing behind the curtain oh okay um this was a goofy headline like it's still kind of neat but um computer built with a s with swarms of soldier crabs so i guess they did a study on crabswarms okay and they figured out there was there was a pattern to how these crabs oh i'm getting that flashy thing again yeah um to how these fl uh crabs um swarm together and they they figured out they could make gates out of it yes i know where this is going if you if you have gates therefore you have memory yes therefore you have ones and zeros therefore you can do computers yes so oh i got to figure out what that bug is that's doing this that's okay it's probably one of the ads yeah i think it is the um have hit your computer the computer they're no longer bugs they're called crabs that's great see insects seabugs did you tackle that crab that i showed you in the github issue earlier maybe let me just know what we should call them now it's crabs not bugs let's see where where i got i got crabs in my software sorry that was bad i had to go let's see if i can there this back on screen um meanwhile where are you doing that essentially essentially some more some more links we can discuss yeah i'm trying to get them up all at once so uh i can just okay the view again so ignore the man behind the curtain as uh the rods are being pulled et cetera et cetera ed is clearing out all the crabs from his computer um all the sand yeah so i would imagine that uh i don't know what imperative they would give krabs to go and perform an uh a one or zero through those gates um but uh it would be interesting to see how those things work so yeah i guess they could control the flow of the crabs through okay the system yeah and then there's a lot of randomness in the system a lot of entropy i guess like part of it was like if they if two crabs come together they will clump up and like they will swarm and then they will choose another path and then you can check to see if one path is empty versus the other i don't know it was it was weird it was a very strange thing that they were observing but i thought it was kind of cool all right um and you know anytime i could pay play the uh can it play doom sure i mean it's so awesome [Music] that's like the the best that's the best animation on the internet right now okay okay we'll have to talk about doom sometime though because there there is a new doom out i haven't tried it yet but okay i did see there is a new one um was this spell check thing one of our links john shell check yes oh so yeah yeah that's right so uh this is just a cool little utility it's got a github backed repo um that allows you to check your shell scripts for any possible problems so there's an integrated linter in this and it will go through your shell scripts so you've got various people write shell scripts all the time uh you can just dump it in here and we'll give report uh any problems you might have so this this was a uh this was a good segue from that crab article sure why not the shell check yes i know i know i know i know i'm just bringing attention to myself that joke was you need a laugh track on this show there you go that joke was totally shellfish sure it's all bad yes it is short css yeah so charlie yes no code like just you got it yeah you got it so uh obviously people you might wonder why uh that's a fair question um but uh css is turns out to be a very valid target for folks who care about tying up the cpu so css has historically been known as a good alternative for targeting the gpu uh which seems to be a lot unless you're mining for cryptocurrency seems to be under you or playing games seems to be underutilized on a lot of people's machines so this is a framework for drawing stuff to the screen using this framework and specifically if you're wanting to draw charts uh the nice thing about that is they're also integrated as part of the dom uh so there's no black box when bringing up your dev tools uh you can simply walk up to various elements within the dom and those are propagated through css animations obviously come for long for the ride because it's built into css along with other sort of cd 3d effects etc so this is a framework you can check out uh it's charts css and it's at chartscss.org huh i wonder how this would play with um uh accessibility and stuff probably not well i don't know i think i think these i think when these things happen they say they claim to be accessible i don't know why but i i don't know how they they do but and i'm not saying they don't support i'm just saying i don't know how i don't know how they support it it's all fun and good until your boss says let me click on the chart and sure no i don't know it looks interesting though like csso always uh amazes me what you're capable of doing with it so yeah i mean it it really does all kinds of crazy stuff these days have you seen these uh like works of art done in css people will make like elaborate paintings sure i've also seen people do the same in ms paint no you haven't those two words should never be made used in this okay okay sorry no i remember uh so this is like some old school uh back in the day before the internet yeah i'm dating myself really really hard right now yeah i was just gonna say before the internet uh i i had mortal kombat the original mortal kombat game for pc yeah uh this is a long time ago this is like 90 something right so i took a screen capture of the game and recolored one of the characters printed it out uh colored it in paint by the way uh so pixel by pixel in them is painted coloring one of these mortal kombat characters outfits in a different color printed it out brought it to school and uh claimed that you could unlock this character by playing a perfect game where he never got hit like not harmed at all beat the entire game you know without taking a single point of damage and you would unlock this character and um made a lot of people mad because there was no way to fact check this stuff back back then you know had a lot of classmates trying this out for days at a time i i never did tell them that it was phony unless they're watching now and uh if you're if you're still upset about that then it's been 30 years get over it yeah yeah anyway uh what is uh stack overflow for teams is now free forever yeah for up to 50 users so stack overflow um offers this at this asp this element if you will of being able to do team collaboration um so it's kind of like the same idea with stack overflow in general which is you post questions answer them etc except it has an internal focus so this is good for folks wanting to do sort of like private knowledge sharing uh in a form that is use useful to them and this is hosted by stackoverflow integrates with things like slack and teams gives you metrics around your engagement et cetera et cetera so basically if you're looking for a collaboration platform for your team uh this is one of many options that are out there uh this is not the only option i mean this is like this is a very hot area but now slack uh sorry stack overflow is now using uh this model and making it free for teams of 50 people so does this mean i can uh downvote my teammates yes arbitrary reasons that actually pertain to their question yes you can do minus one uh rtfm that sort of stuff you can do all that stuff if you want uh so i i don't have anything personally against stack overflow but i have had some bad experiences sure yeah where uh i've submitted answers for something that were for like you know version x and like five years later like all of a sudden i seem like my my uh score plummeting on stack over here so i click into this thing and then it's like in version 13 like this is not the correct answer anymore and it's like really like that yeah guys like john skeeter all over this you're gonna downvote by you're gonna downvote like a six-year-old answer yes to uh to settle the score thank you thank you for that anyway now cool tool i'm not trying to pull on it it's uh i'm sure it's for teams uh i totally would not downvote all my teammates on purpose but hey i would never color in pixel by pixel a uh a character from a video game just to troll the uh sixth grade no of course not you never never never never anyway anyway next before before i i validate everyone's impression of me um what what is this uh awesome web assembly tools uh thing so awesome is a bit of a i guess you could call it a meme uh that is it's a trend you see in github which is a basically a like a link blog but it's on a readme for a github and yeah they they branch into a whole variety of ones so there's like awesome c-sharp tools awesome ides awesome debug tools et cetera this is one for webassembly so if you're looking for a collection of links that point you to uh projects tools websites blog posts uh analyzers etc etc that are all focused on webassembly then this is the uh page to go check out very cool i didn't see a big one in here i might have to go yeah you may have to submit a pr yeah so there is one called webassembly.studio which i don't see listed in here yet it wasn't deemed awesome enough at the bottom okay other it's under other this is a really cool one that i use a lot uh for presentations and stuff yeah it's like.net fiddle or fiddler or stack blitz or uh blazer grapple or whatever they're all called but it's for webassembly so you can come in and say give me i think i've shown it on the show actually give me an empty rust project or hello world rust project or c-sharp whatever but it's by the mozilla people so it's not just some random website and uh you can start like a interactive ide in the browser type experience with webassembly it's really neat to be able to do that i think yeah so that one's listed in there as well it looks like there's a couple of them web assembly sh never seen this one but looks like we've got a command line that we can use in the browser yeah it's like a fake show yeah eat stuff so there you go i like this uh this memory dump colorization tool that's pretty cool webassembly code explorer so you can you can read the bits directly like neo just go right in there i don't see i i don't see i don't see the matrix anymore i always use blonde brunette redhead yeah i know do people even know that reference anymore no i think it's because the matrix would came out so yeah i mean it came out so long ago but um if i hear that quote i know it it's i think it's the the whole covet lockdown i think i've gotten like 10 years older in one year like it's just i start saying things now and i'm like oh my god is that still a thing it's probably not um and finally it's our last link uh this is a quick post about um responsive and adaptive uh rendering and react yes so i thought this was kind of neat it shows you how to connect a react hook to the window resize event yep yep very short and concise so it looks good a good article to get you off and running with just using um the react hooks uh methodologies to connect yes resize event um i think this is i don't believe i saw throttling and stuff in here but uh it does show you how to connect and and remove those event listeners um probably want to like loop in some throttling for this as well so you're not just like spamming events like crazy but you can do a lot of cool stuff with the window.resize and also match media with javascript so if you learn a little bit about this you can probably take this and run with it pretty far but like i said nice short and concise about how to do that the samples are really well well stated here i like it cool stuff yes that one that one was make react apps responsive with a custom racked hook awesome very cool all right uh that's it for for us today john all right words my friend no just stay safe and uh hope to you you know i'm i i will say this is that is that as we're getting through i guess all the vaccinations and such i hope to see you folks uh at some conference in the near future i'm pretty optimistic that once we get vaccinated and we start to contain this virus that you know conferences developer conferences may become may become a thing again who knows so uh i say all this because i actually am looking towards the future in 2022 2023 as far as what we intend to do um so i'm optimistic that i will see some of you folks in the future yeah i think um 2022 sounds probable to me uh we i've got a tentative uh vaccination appointment sometime either this week congratulations that's great so it's it's it's a waiting i'm waiting for a phone call at this point uh but they're they're telling me it's a week to two weeks at the most all right looks like um looks like it's coming uh we we do have some folks that uh that we know personally that that have it yeah not the vaccine but i've gotten sick recently so that you know that's the flip side of that coin yes uh so there's positive and negative news being mixed together right now but um i think we're seeing more more positive uh starting than negative so i agree so there's light at the end of tunnels so keep keep your head down keep working keep learning and hopefully we'll all see each other very soon yeah i think by summer we'll have a good idea of where things are going to be at next year i agree all right john thanks again for uh sharing your time with me and yeah thanks to the audience for um listening to us what what we used to like about technology and uh how to how to harness crabs for the greater good and um we will see here all week on code it live uh we've got uh tj vantal and sambasu and some of the other people that i mentioned myself and alyssa nichol uh we've got vr on thursday and react on wednesday and blazer throughout the week and it's it's just a great channel to follow so make sure you click follow and we will see you all week long take care everybody see you", "27FqcdiOaQI": "they come in perfect okay i want to thank everybody for being here this morning first of all and for those of you who don't know me i'm lisa oxenhandler with recruiting for growth and i have a little bit of good news and then i have some gooder news i know that's not a word and then i have some great news um the the good news is that if you have been coming to breakfast with the expert we are going to take a summer hiatus but we're going to be restarting in the fall so if you have any ideas or thoughts about the way that you would like to see it progress in the fall please let me know the gooder news is if you've had even one vaccine and you go to krispy kreme you get a free donut and the best news is that amy is our expert this morning so i will let you take it away and i've given you permission to uh share your screen thank you thank you i love how you call it expert it's like what is a x drip under pr drip under pressure that's that's what in it i'm gonna share a screen with y'all this powerpoint got modified this morning so i'm one who prays and is a person that sits in meditation and i got a message at 705 to change up a question a little bit so i'm like all right all right so i came on a little later than i anticipated sorry lisa let's see if it'll shake there we go valuing diversity how to navigate oh you can read it i'm moving on here's today's agenda we've got um 35 minutes or so is that right lisa all right i have my little clock in front of me you'll notice on today's agenda uh well i attend an african-american church pastor and i met each other at um in the doctoral program probably a decade ago and at umsl at the university of missouri st louis and um a little while ago he said to me amy i want you to share a message and i looked at him me and all my whiteness can you imagine i challenged authority in a black church well you you don't you don't do that and i'm and i know better but i did and i said you know what i said i said pastor no preacher i'm a teacher right and he looked at me knowingly he's got a decade on me so he's my elder right um kim you know how that knowing look that an african-american elder gives you oh yes okay well he gave me that look and he said well amy then teach and i'm like all right yeah all you can say when that happens okay so but what i'm telling you all is i'm not interested in preaching at you as much as i am um teaching and i mean more like not the sage on the stage kind of teaching but the guide on the side that's the kind of teaching i'm interested so if you could like make a note of a question you have or something that resonates with you i'll give you if we have a little extra time at the end i would love to share with you and and kind of talk with you about what's important or what resonates during this time since i'm taking a workshop that's an hour and a half and shrinking it down to 35-40 minutes i'm just gonna have you use your chat box today so if you could warm up your fingers that would be awesome this is this is what i'm not going to preach about but i'm going to teach about i'm going to give you a warm-up question i'll share a little story we're going to define empathy learn three steps for showing empathy i'm going to operationalize it for you for those of you who kind of an engineering mind i'm going to operationalize it for you we're going to discover how to use empathy in a cross-cultural conversation and we're going to wrap up with a one-word summary and then maybe if we have a little time lisa will let us kind of hash things out a little bit so here's your warm-up question and if you could put your no two or three uh word answer in in your chat box i'd appreciate it so we'll give you a moment what's the most important ability for leaders to have when they're working with people who have different backgrounds different stories um and different can mean based on gender generation race religion ability or disability so-called disability differently abled so you think on that for the introverts in the room we'll give you a second rashed says listening angela says curiosity um caitlyn said open-mindedness sherry said agree with rashad lisa said open-mindedness again and annette said curiosity and listening to learn not to inform deep i missed one i apologize i don't know which one i missed oh jane understanding that people are different and relating to each to each person i suppose differently yeah yeah allowing for those differences mary said genuine curiosity sherry said the ability to see a soul of another human being lance's humility yeah huh i love it there's no wrong answer here all y'all are right you all are spot on here's what the research shows which is interesting look at this because the curiosity and the humility and kim says the questions and activities that positively include us all yeah and that's what happens when leaders express empathy and it's the number one skill for being able to work with people who have different backgrounds and cultures and belief systems values lifestyles over all those other skills it's extraordinary how empathy is off the chart but we don't always know how to express it so i'm going to share a little story with you to kind of ground us this is when you kind of sit back and relax a little bit kind of like the librarian right you cross your like what is crisscross applesauce sort of thing sit back and relax um so the story is it was about a week after i did a similar workshop on empathy in a it was a manufacturing site and uh it was a supplier it supplied uh gas stations it was an oil company and one of the gas station managers she came up to me um during the session and it was after the empathy workshop i do a series of five workshops and this is a little glimpse of one of them and after the empathy workshop she came up and she said that she'd been having a hard time communicating with some of the younger people on her staff so i think she was about in her 60s right and and different cultural differences happen across generation just like they do across race and nationality and gender right so she was having a hard time communicating with people younger generation probably millennials or gen z's and she explained that the workshop had helped her see that she'd gotten so caught up in the day-to-day running of her store that's what she called it that she'd forgotten to connect with her employees the afternoon after the session that empathy session she'd overheard her team talking and realized she really didn't know much about them it made her wonder that if it's why some of her employees get so defensive when she corrected them they'd be like didn't want i didn't do with it so i asked her what you do she said well later that day when no one was around one of my particularly difficult employees and i talked like for the first time and she said i really stopped and listened to him now if you'll remember if you were here with me last time i presented i don't know at least it was a month or two ago and okay and i taught you the acronym stop and and i'm not referring that today i promised myself i wouldn't refer to it but stop is slow down take a breath i can send you the slide on this observe your reaction and the feeling the other person and proceed with curiosity and wonder and stop so she told me that she really stopped and listened to him she sat with him and even looked him in the eyes he opened up about his struggles and when he was finished talking she shared a little bit about her past and overcoming challenges and she said for the first time i really understood where he was coming from and i think he understood me so i asked her what happened and she said well since our talk i've seen this change in attitude he's more understanding with his co-workers and he's up for doing what i ask him to do now go figure right for those who are the parents right empathy helped him and her connect empathy fuels connection he also doesn't let the small stuff get to him anymore all around he's like this nicer more productive guy so that manager saw an increase in productivity when she slowed down and took the opportunity to connect with that younger employee she was able to appreciate her employees perspective and change her behavior to show genuine respect she didn't have to agree with him but she could temporarily change her behavior to show genuine respect for him and that's cultural intelligence and action because cultural differences can show up within a family right how many people have politic how many families right now even have political divides right so keeping that story in mind that empathy creates connection in the chat box real quick um tell me your this is this is the teacher in me tell me your definition of empathy so we can work off where you are being able to put yourself in someone else's shoes kim said sherry said compassion yep annette says trying to see another point of view jane says understanding the other side of of a view yeah because a viewpoint is a point is a view from just one point right just your point nathan said oh nathan you're here thanks for coming um putting yourself in another shoes trying to see the world from someone else's perspective lisa said looking at someone else's story from their perspective amen caitlin understanding someone's feelings y'all haven't gotten anything wrong yet keep waiting to do some teaching so here's empathy here's the definition i'm working with and anytime you're talking about cultural differences you kind of got to make sure you're working with the same definition it's perspective taking it's putting judgment aside and staying open i'm not telling you not to judge you can't not judge that's a whole workshop that i do on outsmarting unconscious bias how to outsmart unconscious bias you got bias there's just no getting around it but it's putting judgment aside just long enough to stay open and maybe hear that younger dude's perspective i think that's what she did recognizing the emotion in another and then naming it out loud there's some empathy and i gotta tell you what it's not see the little dude around there it drives disconnection sympathy we're not going to silver line something oh why don't you look at this perspective that's not empathy well well at least she didn't fail out of school that's not empathy trying to make something better it's kind of like saying at least right and offering a solution that drives disconnection okay um feel free to raise your hand if you love to offer solutions when people bring a problem to you this mama does [Laughter] all right so just keep that in mind and somebody said um sherry was it you another word for empathy is compassion didn't you say that sherry yep there we go so i'm just gonna break it down passio means to suffer and come means together so we've got this compassion suffering together [Music] it's being with someone in their suffering so how do you show compassion again this is the teacher in me take a swipe at it how might you show compassion if we're going to operationalize it what is what does compassion look like sound like listen yup lisa says listen and and the question is what does listening sound like rashed says acknowledgement of some sharing jane says ask how you can help caitlyn said sharing someone's feelings always shows up when i tilt my head sherry says nathan says assure someone they're not alone ooh empathy definitely communicates wholeness oneness with someone let me show you what i the research i did is that compassion has three steps check this out i'm moving over my chat box um we're going to notice we're going to feel and we're going to respond so y'all aren't too far off look at this i'm going to break it down right there's the teacher here's step one you're going to notice your reaction and an assumption that comes up notice how your your reaction is how you're feeling right you're going to slow down that stop comes in here we're going to slow down and check that you're safe if you're going to engage with someone i want you to be physically and psychologically safe we're not going to empathize with somebody when we're feeling threatened so there might be situations where you need to get out in this case you're safe you can move to step two feel your feelings and name them to yourself so sometimes when i'm teaching and i feel angst i'll in the inside of me i'll actually be going yeah i don't blame you for being scary that guy's scary right i'll actually feel my feelings and name my and name it i'm worried or i'm scared or i'm glad and then imagine the other person's feelings for those of you who are empaths i'm a little bit of an empath i can actually feel how other people's feelings for some people who live in our heads because our society really encourages us to live above the neck you might have to just imagine how someone feels and i just want to make a note here that it can be hard to focus on another person's feelings if you haven't acknowledged your own which is why i put that as this first step if you haven't said god i'm scared um you're not going to be able to i think it was kim who said put yourself in another person's shoes if you haven't felt your own feelings step three this is the part that you're saying respond by labeling the person's emotion label it with it seems like it sounds like it looks like so if you think back to the gas station manager working with her younger employee or you can think about in terms of your own family who has a different perspective somebody has shared something you might respond with it seems like you're inspired it sounds like you're confused looks like you're angry and if you notice we're using you not i in this in in the application of compassion or empathy we want to keep the focus of the conversation on the other person which was it's not time to say i feel you i get you um i need to know more um this is about you you're so ripped you're so mad tell me more what's going on keep the keep it focused on the other person if it's a time for you to share your feelings that's when you use i we're keeping it on them right now so what's the value of empathy there's nothing more frustrating than when people don't understand you how many times have you spoken with a customer service rep who doesn't know how to actively listen who doesn't know how to use empathy and they're not hearing you and you feel totally invisible there is nothing more frustrating and you need to tell them to come to my workshop because they clearly got something to learn right oh my god you wouldn't believe how many times i'm like i need to get you some training here's about here's the upside it starts real conversations dang now you're going to get more authentic with someone because you've acknowledged them they feel seen they'll keep talking you'll learn their story it communicates solidarity it's one of the things that i love when i'm talking with kim is there's this sense of solidarity it's not her it's not me it's somewhere between us is this lovely i don't know how else to put it mutuality solidarity we're in this together lisa gives that vibe lisa when you're talking with someone you you pause and let them talk and you you embrace the quiet in there is empathy and the solidarity it combats loneliness has anyone noticed that in dominant american culture you could call it white culture majority culture dominant culture loneliness is on the rise when we slow down and take a breath and we're present with someone and wow that must have been tough for you now we're combating loneliness and in your organization now organizationally can you imagine what happens we got extraordinary collaboration that's going to build over time i've got an organization i've been working with for over a year and and it's a riot because they're talking about how people are wanting to join the company for the first time in a decade they had really bad glass door evaluations and now they brought in a new hr manager and the hr manager said to some people that are feeling safer and more collaborative and innovations on the rise and they're like sure i'll put something positive on glassdoor and slowly they're ratcheting up their reputation it's empathy it's so cool so now wait a minute remember i talked about how it talking with people from a different perspective so what does showing compassion oh it should oh how look at me my mistake how does showing compassion help you talk with people who are different i'm so glad you can see my humanity right there can you tell lisa this was the question i changed at seven o'clock this morning i would never guess so cultural intelligence is what i do i am a cultural intelligence strategist i go into organizations and help folks develop cultural intelligence which is why i can be a white lady in this work because i'm not um so often diversity inclusion efforts are teaching about the other whether that's another the culture of another race or another gender a different way of thinking i'm not teaching about the other i'm teaching a skill set one of which is empathy right or compassion plus recognizing someone's context there's compassion plus context plus action is cultural intelligence and if you follow me on linkedin you'll actually see um posted almost every day is a way for you to recognize someone else's story someone else's context because when we feel compassion for someone who's different and we can show it to show respect and appreciate their context because my context is nothing like a lot of americans right the privilege that i walk around with oh my god there's no way that i can even imagine what some people go through but i can show compassion for their context and my heart can break for them more than once a week i'm up in the wee hours in the morning in tears and i have to and and and there are times when i have to dial back on my learning because context can be heartbreaking to learn but it's it's important to at least appreciate so that people feel visible when you're talking with them so just to circle back cultural intelligence is this ability to be in conversation like the gas station manager with her younger person younger employee who had a very different perspective and she showed respect she wasn't changing who she was she was adapting her behavior to show respect annette said love the idea that people need to feel visible yeah annette you're actually spot on when the first conversation that i have with a ceo that wants to create a culture of not just inclusion because if you think about inclusion really means included in what right and if i'm talking to a white male all due respect he's part of the dominant culture and it's like you really want people to assimilate to the dominant culture of the united states or of your corporation or do you want people to feel like they belong in your organization a piece of the puzzle integral and and they're like oh yeah it's more than it's more than inclusion it's belonging that we're working for and how do you create that sense of belonging and that nailed it you nailed it it's making sure that people feel valued heard and engaged that that's the promise of cultural intelligence when you have compassion for different people's context people feel valued heard and engaged so remember that customer service rep the bad one that you've dealt with do they make you feel valued hurt and engaged you don't need free stuff to make sure that that the person you're talking with feels valued and engaged not when you show the when you do those three steps so this is the advertisement real quick i'm i'm starting i want to start a movement and kim knows it right sherry knows it lisa knows it so you can connect with me on linkedin and learn all sorts of different people's stories i am working i've started working recently internationally with a company that's based in in manchester new hampshire uh certain new hampshire oh mansfield england and ahmedabad india and it's so much fun to start capturing stories on this global perspective especially since i'm married to a foreign-born national you'd think i would have done that a whole lot sooner but connect with me i write a monthly blog so every time i screw up with somebody it's like fodder for me learning and i you know i like write a blog about it or somebody asked like a ceo last month asked me a question he got fired he got pushed out of his organization because he was blamed for continuing perpetuating white supremacy in his organization and he emailed me and said we need to have a conversation and i said as long as i can write a blog about it and not name you and he's like okay so you can read my blog i can share it with you kim said wow yeah um join my workshop series starting april 15th i've got uh five workshops that kind of fill up a whole tool bag for you to make sure that you can connect with people in india and the uk and china and brazil and domestic differences of course too so back to work cultural intelligence how does compassion plus context help us connect with colleagues and clients who are different now i'm wondering lisa about time because this is kind of how we wrap up what is the timing because do we have time to kind of open this conversation up or let's take a few minutes i think this is an important subject that people should be able to ask questions okay if you do need to drop off as a result of something going on we certainly understand okay so then what i'm going to do is for the introverts in the room you'll appreciate because i'm a gregarious introvert and i know i need think time right and i know introverts do um hold this question lightly maybe even make a note and we'll come back to this in just a minute um i just want you to have my information if you drop off this is my email if you want me to send you the blog i will and also empoweringpartners.com you can join my workshop series there you can get my blog read a little bit about me i wrote a book called awoken progress um that's available through amazon so that's how you reach me if you want to continue and help me create this movement oops just kidding and amy this is recorded so people will be able to uh see it on youtube if they want to listen again okay all right so um because i want to honor different learning styles if you would prefer to speak up and out you can do that now and we are wrapping up at 8 10 lisa yes okay so at 8 10 what we'll do is um i'll have people do a a one-word summary share how they're feeling but right now let's open it up and if they want to if we want to stay on longer we can we'll open it up for this question so how does compassion plus context help us connect with colleagues clients family members right who have a different perspective or different background think about those three steps would you all mind um making note of that question and i'd like to stop sharing because i'd rather see your faces that that's the classroom teacher in me all right so how does cultural intelligence help us connect with people who are different take a swipe at it um amy i'm i'm just going to share that for me it has to be about my own self-care first because i can i can feel so depleted so quickly when i am pushing up against you know limited world views or you know or just plain hate and and so uh so to be able to detach not necessarily with compassion or detach uh with neutrality i've gotta i've gotta make sure i'm spiritually centered uh before i can extend compassion who else has found that what angela would you mind sharing your experience um well i think to show compassion i i too need to be full and uh centered and neutral [Music] to show cultural intelligence i think is something that i was taught as a child so um not probably very consciously by my parents but i was always brought up with people religions and ethnic groups in different countries i remember as a child as a sign of respect and a gift to a friend of my father's who was from bangladesh i went and spent the weekend with his family only the host spoke english but that was a way of communicating that they were bonded so um i have appreciated quick i appreciate what you said because you have put words or models to something that i was taught just to do so it's very helpful thank you i appreciate that input because similar to you i was raised by a dad who ran multinational companies corporations and so i had a global perspective around me all the time and didn't have words for it until i started this work it's not enough just to show compassion if i don't show compassion within and for someone's context and my heart doesn't break to a certain extent so often universities who are teaching diversity inclusion it's this intellectual thing and so i'm really grateful that i went to the trouble with my now pastor of getting my phd because that gives me street cred in an academic setting that i can work above the you know above the neck but i've discovered i can't stay there i have to engage my body and my heart if i'm going to be in this work and appreciate other people's experiences or nothing like mine when i'm being with them i think that um as i'm listening to you amy and i've listened to you several times but every time i swear i learned something different so today i'm thinking showing compassion to me is easy when dealing with people i think deserve compassion you know what i mean yeah i think i mean if i'm dealing with someone that's from a less fortunate situation than i or that genuinely has been hurt by something whether you know physically traumatized or emotionally traumatized those are easy ways to uh to to use this this uh format uh but what about when you're dealing with what i can only label as ignorance yes you know what i mean when you come across those with these ignorant point of views so and and you know and so if i if i turn that around you know and put that in the eyes of other people you know there's probably a lot of people that just their ignorance of not thinking people even deserve the compassion because if i believe that there's a certain group that doesn't even warrant me having this level of compassion i can only imagine they think the same way about me so there becomes another you know i guess um just understanding that everybody at least deserves that space for a moment i i guess is the challenge as i'm talking this thing through that even if i believe that they are ignorant in their views you know what i mean um you know because that's that's where i struggle when i run against people that i'm like i just i just don't even understand how you can think that way like what how were you raised like you know so that's that's that's my struggle you know me in this climate um and and that's something that i am really really um working for because as i as i go forward with my company i have to learn how to negotiate rooms with ignorant points of views and still be able to reach them like you do so um that's what i'm using this you know because it's easy to have compassion for people who need it you know what i mean you know to me but to have that listening ear um to ignorant views is that's that's that's the challenge which is where um kim you're spot on and why i kind of had to figure out this acronym called stop because if i don't slow down i'll just railroad right past that person and and i really do have to hold space for me and them when i'm hearing remarks that are not informed and are heartbreaking to me and i and i yeah and that's the depletion that i hear when i hear um i don't know um the the the young lady that spoke that she has to have a certain level of reserve because she gets depleted easy i felt her in that moment because when you're up against that kind of um and i don't want to you know we're in the state of compassion so it's it's it's kind of productive for me to to refer to that as ignorance so let me just find another adjective a view that's different than mine there you go not knowing not knowing okay a view that's different completely different than mine um it it is very depleting it is it's very depleting coming up against those types of of uh um constructs and moods and things of that nature and um but i do believe that stop acronym is very important because the other part of that is that you may be the light that turns them around and sometimes yeah sometimes it's through how you respond yeah encourages them to respond to the next person a little differently so i think as i'm talking this thing through i've just kind of answered my own question honestly honestly i think i've just answered my own question that no matter who they are everybody deserves a stop and to not occupy that space because even as i'm talking and i do stop my whole mind is occupied on how i'm going to respond i immediately go into self-preservation mode like okay check your face wait a minute you know what i mean i'm monitoring myself and i'm not listening i i will be the first one to admit i'm not listening at all i'm trying to talk my own emotions down you know so that would when how to listen without getting emotionally involved like that you know what i mean how to have compassion but not be so emotionally spent executing it i'm sorry i gotta that's workshop number five okay on active listening but i do need to tell you that you do need to be emotionally involved not being emotionally involved is minimizing you okay so the very first step is going man that guy's pissing me off and and you acknowledge that in you and you name that in you and just feeling you a lot and slowing it down allows you to hold both you and the other person temporarily but you're right you can't be hungry angry lonely or tired that's you don't go into that space oh my yeah years ago i managed a very diverse workforce and um we had a woman who worked directly for me who was from ghana and she when i interviewed her on the telephone she had been educated in wales and when she came for the interview i was i have to be honest i was surprised because i did not know where she was from and i expected a petite blonde woman in the lobby and she was a six foot the darkest skinned african i've ever met and i hired her and we had but she'd been in the states for a while and she dressed very much like every american that we have out there we also had a lot of indians in our department who occasionally would wear their native clothes and i had one of my managers kept talking to me about alice i don't understand why blah blah and finally i i had to step back and i said linda how do you treat priya she goes well i know that priya's culturally and i said and alice is culturally different i said alice is not an african-american alice is african i said so you need to dial it back and understand she comes from a different place than the african americans in this department so treat each person from where they came from and how they are going to translate and and react to things differently so that is what was so key with that and and this was the woman who had originally hired me into the department i was having to have this conversation and just like when you have five generations of people in the workforce yes she was also the person who came to me and said i can't stand that these kids have earbuds in and i said linda they went to college with earbuds in you take them out they can't concentrate i said now they also know that if i come up to them or i say their name they better be able to hear me i said but so it's understanding and really and correcting the people when you have to showing them that it's more than just what you see because what she saw was in her mind an african-american raised in the states not an african born and raised in ghana and educated in wales and so i it it's really going back and making sure that you stand up for the other people as well and it wasn't my conversation with alice i was having to show the compassion and all of that it was educating the other people yeah i love that you recognize that content for foreign born nationals gonna have a very different perspective than perhaps a minority in this country a context is everything when someone says something ignorant you can actually use the steps of compassion and when i say ignorant i mean not knowing not knowledgeable and and you can say can you tell me more it sounds like it was hard if you use those same steps when somebody uses something not knowing words you can hear their story and then you can gently invite them to think about someone else's context that's beautiful jane well done we need to wrap up it's 8 15. lisa i was gonna say do you have time for one more does everybody have time for one more sure lance you had indicated that you struggle with members of the dominant culture you want to share more about that yeah thank you lisa um and thanks amy i i had this thing years ago very naively where i thought um everyone was kind of of a similar viewpoint and the more i traveled the more i realized wow i naive and so um some of my activities bring me around lots of different people across north america and with social media you know we've gotten into discussions on on race and heritage and things like this and ethnicity and um i bump into folks who think that racism doesn't exist and it's a big thing you know a construct of the media and on and on and on and my blood just starts to boil i you know i i can feel the pressure coming and and so occasionally i've challenged their views well could you imagine growing up um you know in the 60s there was still lynching going on when i was a child this was still part of the culture and the heritage and and that wasn't the media that was reality you know i get pretty angry about them saying well you know but that was a long time ago and like it wasn't that long ago and and if your grandparents and and uncles and aunts are subjected to this it's still very much alive and real and you know we get into these maybe this is you know maybe one of your seminar number seven or eight but i think i'm really challenged with not losing my temper around that kind of headspace because i'm thinking you don't understand what certain cultures are like and you're experience you're transferring yours onto it and saying well it doesn't exist for me so how can it exist for them anymore and i i just i get so mad you know and and then conversely to that i found that i've had other people who say if i don't challenge it then i'm complicit to that i'm like no no i'm angry as hell but i'm exhausted i'm challenging it you know like i'm kind of at that point where i'm like okay if you want to be you know it's come up earlier on the call it's like if you if you want to really hold steadfast to that belief of yours you go ahead i'm just gonna actually relax myself and go play with other people now like you know what i mean because i i just can't and so i don't know i don't know what to do with that i've backed off of a lot of discussions now because it's like there's no fixing this um and you know and i can poke the bear it just makes it worse you know um so lance can i answer your question yeah i hear a question there how do i respond when is this the question how do i respond when somebody is making uh an unknowing or ignorant remark about like there's no such thing as racism well i guess that's exactly because what i'm trying to what i'm trying to get across them yeah i think that's my question is basically put yourself in i'm trying to ask them to be empathetic to put themselves in someone else's shoes beautiful you know walk a mile in their shoes walk several generations in their shoes and then tell me there's no racism because i don't believe it right so how do i yeah one of the kind of key constructs of cultural intelligence is appreciating another person's perspective and adapting your behavior to show respect so when we immediately approach a conversation that i'm going to correct you they're going to shut you down because they don't want to be corrected because in our heads if we live in our heads and that's what happens in academia you know you're getting information and you need to correct that information well it doesn't reach the heart it's not going to do anything if you want to reach someone's heart that's why lisa invited me today and i'm i'm so grateful and why we need to show compassion when we're talking with somebody like kim was talking about with somebody who just doesn't know like lance they just don't know that racism is a thing and it's in it's embedded in in how our country was structured right they just don't see systemically they only see individually so if you're only looking individually i'm going to appreciate that person's context for a moment when somebody makes a remark there's no racism in our in the united states we are the most individualistically oriented country in the world and and i know that from a lot of different cultural training we are not group oriented we are individual and we think we are individually responsible for everything and so we get individual credit right and so if we're thinking about racism it's a systemic problem our country was built based on exploiting human beings native americans bipoc right people of color native americans so you and i both know it that's how the the country was set up but if you're thinking individually and you work very hard not to to be racist then in your mind in your construct in your context there's no racism and and how heartbreaking that they don't see that and yet i have to appreciate that temporarily in order to hear them so when somebody says i remember a ceo said to me i don't understand there's a couple years ago why that football player takes a knee i had to actually put like kim had said you put your couple of people maybe nathan to put yourself in somebody else's shoes i had to suspend my judgment take his perspective temporarily and said i understand you don't want him taking his knee because it feels like disrespect for that our flag and i'm married to a foreign-born national a french guy and the french people still appreciate what we did for their country even though it was 75 years ago so that flag signifies something around the world the freedom and you want people to respect that and he said yeah amy you understand well lance now i have him right i mean if i if i was manipulative damn i had him but my heart broke for him really and i said can i offer you a different perspective can i offer you a little more information well since i had heard him and acknowledged his feelings now he was ready to hear me i had gone through those steps of compassion for him my heart had broken for him so now he goes yeah sure i'll take it and i said i wonder what it's like to live in a society where you're always less than because of the color of your skin or because of your gender or disability i wonder what it's like to not really be able to speak up and out i'm wondering if taking a knee is the quietest way to say i feel like i'm not seen in this society and i said to him i know you're a christian and i know that our hearts are supposed to break for people and i'm just wondering if our hearts could break for that young football player and he said i hadn't thought about it from that perspective and i said well it's not that he's right and you're wrong or you're wrong and he's right vice versa it it's maybe both of y'all are right and he was like oh okay and he was literally ready to get up and leave our coffee i was like oh all right lord i guess i've done my work is does that give you a sense of how you might respond with compassion oh absolutely i think that was that's magic because yeah i like i said i i'm kind of trying to almost i'm so angry at these people want to condemn them you know that's not going to help somebody tries to condemn me i'm just going to walk away okay i got all my stuff you know well the goal in cultural intelligence is always creating a win-win situation but if you want to win and i don't blame you for wanting to win yeah you gotta you gotta make sure they win first and then people will be ready to to hear you i i promise it feels like a magic bullet it's not it's just this is what love looks like and feels like oh that's a gushy word for a business environment i apologize thank you that was good thank you um could i just have a one-word summary from you all that that's the teacher in me how are you feeling just one word call it out better optimistic i'm sorry nathan hopeful intrigued intrigued compassionate that's butt kissing you used my word i didn't mean to well done prepared prepared oh good good wonderful i love how you chose prepared instead of armed because that's a much better word thank you all for coming lisa thank you for this invitation oh my gosh thank you and thanks everybody for being here this truly was fantastic amy i i really appreciate it hope that you will come back in the fall when we reboot maybe for lesson number five or or seven we'll see but thanks everyone for being here this morning thank you lisa thank you amy see everyone soon thank you have a great one thanks amy", "AVSpqfXQJ9k": "what's up world juvenile stars here and today I'm trying Moroccan ash now attacked a bowl of my bong and I have a joint role so we can get the best of both worlds here for you today now I'm gonna try to bomb first that is a very very sweet taste to it it's beautiful but yeah I got that it's a nice little nugget that's a little ice in the ground cuz I don't go to Bowl and it rolled the nice bit in the joint it's got a very nice squishy texture I'm like most ash you have to put on a little pin here down to plus straight up now this is all sticky it's right it just gets more sticky if you light it up very good has a very nice nice smell to it thank you pretty much a smuggling straight crystal melter nice it's very good it's kind of like the shatter doesn't that very different smells now here let's light up the joint not just put ash in here so that's a finer taste and has a very high quality taste whereas it's definitely worth their luck but it's a little bit more because it's a little better but like I said it's worth the extra couple dollars didn't they have just normal standard ash old schoolhouse or biker ash a lot of people call it it it's good but it's definitely worth that for a couple bucks to have a more fine quality ash so if you'd have to decide between the cheaper and the one that worth that cost couple more dollars I'd go for the one that cost couple more dollars if you want that ie quality taste and a higher quality I because I smoke a lot of different types of weed and strains and stuff and I'd always prefer the higher quality you're guaranteed not to get a shady high or headaches or anything like that like the city homegrown kid yet there's my nice and sticky it's a little messy you gotta be careful when you busted it apart stuff but so I decided it's nice worth the smoke now I will be coming up with a few different types a slow try on these reviews but this is probably one of the top tight Moroccan is really good I haven't tried it in a while but it's pretty much as good as the last time like last time

forget there is a discount code in the description on that video so please be sure to add that one when you get to the checkout to save you some money right terms so today we're going to be taking up another look at a strain from home Heche massive shouts out to him has for sending this sample over for me for showcase and review purposes it is called lime jell-o and yeah we're going to be taking a look in checking out interesting one on this one I'm thinking it's gonna be like a lemon sort of haze if it looks and smells as good as I think it does I'm really hoping that the actual flavor is going to come through quite a lot on the lemon strains on the CBD side of it they do look and they smell I've spawned by lemon haze but they don't really come through in the taste so I'm really hoping this one there's actually gonna taste you know really lemony right so we're going to be taking a closer look at the lights and I'll catch you guys in the next part of the video he's a no-go sorry okay so we're back and we're going to be taking a closer look at this strength from him patch called blind selling baby I so got they've got quite a lot of background information on this one so she sativa strain comes from America also known as lemoncello 28r blue cross between the original lemonade and cherry pie this one is another string called lemon ice they're saying citrusy lemony pungent lemon Afghan coming in at 13% on the old seaweed a quite interesting to see oh yeah really paint a living smell coming straight off the background yeah and I'm definitely getting that mmm it's more of a sort of like lemon lemony ice cream that makes sense absolutely amazing but a massive shouts at the hem - for sending me this one and sponsoring this video obviously you guys can see in the showcase box gotta show you this one again massive giant bubble really dense and rich but really got what hard just to crack up they're just getting really nice fresh punch and a little smell on that one we need n spike covenant run very very not green orange brown hands interested to see whether the flavor comes for a long as long as you get a lot lemon strings that smell [Music] just pure lemon guys I saw times minute just pure hazing this to everyone witness is going to be the literary the closest you're going to get you're like yeah actually if you're to give perfection nice and fluffy [Music] nothing like a flavor [Music] first in the show we're tasting getting the wrist wide swing a lot sweeter your wife very very very clean straining [Music] really touch little I really good better th see but this is crazy for receive me the extreme I mean I can show you look lost as I thought taste of the lemon it's not that guys compared to salt ithc strain Lemon Haze which like literally full-on taste the lemon it's a very very faint faint taste it's getting a strong sort of hazy hazy taste to it it has gotten nowhere no him tasted a little yes of the night together yeah a lot of information as a set of the beginner video versus Teva USA import nicknamed lemoncello to be a hybrid cross between the original lemonade and cherry pie as a parent of the limb nice I'm pretty short and hashes of lemon half-game ash that they do the lemon Afghan pollen I think is called either River swamp or that not too long ago I wouldn't be surprised this is always made of someone I did lemon lemon really sweet easy Bonzo editor can't stop looking at your buddy buddy quality exist one fiery orange brown is really sticky we did I miss one guy this is pretty good amazing for a CVT and finally for this one this is kukuri assess to wonder she loves to be in the video some reason for one [Music] this one this definitely get you I think this probably one of the best so hostess you're gonna get this cake packaging and their logo another thing I like about him hashes that they break down the CV being sort of the CBD in general broken down into different categories like OCD I want so this has been the line so notes from em hash massive shouts on live feeling sponsor in this video I'm making this possible if you don't know about em - the link will be in the description like and comment on this video and if you guys get this strain let me know what you guys think these guys Quechua nice [Music]", "Szz9GKjCnQA": "[Music] [Laughter] [Music] take it [Music] check this out [Music] and if you're here welcome well you either came over here from Instagram and you've done your due diligence and fast forward it through those ten minutes of the babbling and boring hash talk if you have no idea what I'm talking about well then I was gonna stitch it onto this video but I feel like hmm we'll leave that one for a GTV and we'll do this one for this I just drop something important okay ladies and gentlemen we made two beautiful strains of hash and these are I'm only messing with the ninety micron pool right now one of the strains extracted into this beautiful or washed into a beautiful it's very very sandy in the jar right now I don't want to get it out of the freezer again okay scratch that strain a look at that wash I'm not even zooming to point two and a half times you don't need to zoom in when it's this quality and yes it's been about five minutes out here in room temperature and then I hurried up and see what if I kept and got it back into its 35 degree environment environment and those chunks that you see see how I look at this one I'll show you see how it's not little tiny granulated pieces of sugar they're starting to clump up into little almost evenly sized little clumps that is the beginning of our hashish greasing down now here's what's interesting about these two strains both incredibly different incredibly different terpene profiles even different on cannabinoid potency and even some kind of annoyed offering and the other is like most of our cannabis and has almost no CBD and very high THC if you're wondering yes this is the strain that's a little lower in THC but has a lot of simi Deanna and the strain the time THC that almost there's no CBD in it at all at room temperature as you can see these folds on the parchment there this was just laying on this parchment paper folded up sitting on this stainless steel table and it the powder or the dry sift I'm sorry not the powder in the dresser the bevel hash in in powdered form like I just showed you in that jar a little bit this little bit that I poured out did this no wait no no pressure no heat just letting it warm up to room temperature did this so then I took the rest of the pile and moved it around a little bit so that I could make I was trying to make his rectangular of a shape as possible folded my parchment over it and put my hand down on it and give it a little bit of just about 10 seconds or so of body temperature and we have a beautiful just a beautiful flag of Ashish oh and again for those of you that for those use it now and the follow me you know I don't like smoking joints well I love smoking joints I just don't like rolling paper so I'd like to take cash quality house but that's melt value to it thin it out and then take that baby up with flour and you know what's up you get that roll along you go in fat-ass hash joints and yes sometimes if it's lower quality hash I don't need to put any flour in the center of it I can just roll it up and make sure I keep a nice big hole in the center if anybody's wondering but I do I put a little bit of flour in it because this is going to be such a high melt value that it wouldn't make a mess and it wouldn't burn right number one number two if you're ever gonna roll or smoke a house joint keep it elevated or inverted for most of the session if you will and then of course the other main thing that I try and tell people or trying to remind people to be wary of is that you do not ask a high-strung don't flick the ashes off don't take it and knock the ashes off or anything like that you just let them fall they're not gonna burn you or anything like that I mean worst case you actually know they won't because when it falls off it's completely dead and it's just a carbon so it's just gonna make a little grace spot on wherever it lands and then you can blow it so interestingly enough straight-a forms an amazing full melt hash that smokes incredibly fully complex and robust and and it's just out of this world but it doesn't dab like this it doesn't dab in water fresh form listen this is very even it's very Chari it leaves a lot of mess on the back just just does work but I do want to dab some so I pressed a little bit into some resin not pressed for 0.4 grams and I got back about a 30 or about a 40% you 1.9 just under 2 grams actually like 1.97 two grams call it 2 minutes 2 grams out of 4.4 strain a strain B which is has become adaptable product just sitting out here on the table breast 4.4 grams of it and I got a 3.2 gram yield [ __ ] is amazing but if you're over here on YouTube you were here to see some melee and by melee I mean let's take a really expensive banger an expensive rig and make a [ __ ] mess what I wanted to share with you guys was dabbing this flag of hash this is just bubble hash I just some of you've seen I've gotten dry sift to this level of purity and it does the same thing at room temperature it's just what some people call precepts I'm greasing down whatever there's an amalgamation that happens if you will a nucleation or an amalgamation that happens and the dry the glandular trichomes heads being that they are pure enough and by pairing up I mean there's a high enough percentage of them in the powder or the hashish when at room temperature I start to act like hash like like the old-school like what we all know of hash when you think of it in your mind the old-school fruit leathery greasy product which is of course greasy and fruit leathery because of its high village allure trichrome headcount and high terpene count when it acts like this we have a stupid high glandular trichomes had count and it's Turkish fashion so win win and win cheers ladies and gentlemen I'll save y'all on some some heat up time and then let's uh let's rip a flag - okay now again only reason I went as hot as I did was just to to get a nice even heating and by that I mean you know as it cools down now again this is just this is bubble hash this is you take your cannabis and you wash water over it and you use a screen to sift the the wet key that comes off of it so don't don't expect this to you know to melt completely clean and and to just disappear into the Banger there's a lot of plant matter left in here I haven't done anything I haven't haven't brought in an in on a press or anything by the way did just take that in fold it over the reason I thought it over of course was so that I can put it right down in the beggar cheers ladies and gentlemen whenever you see this I hope this is the turnaround for your day I hope as from here on out that that's really going well and if not well find something nice to do for somebody and I bet things will turn around for you this is gonna be way too big of a flash for this heat but here we go yes there's all kinds of mess as I mentioned before the dev because this is this is just just some water hash and aside from that no this is not live resin in my experience there's always a little bit more particulate that co extracts with whether it be a BHO extraction or a solvent mist water extraction like you see here whatever it is when you're if you fresh breeze your plant before you know right at harvest there are some complex terpenes that you are not letting develop and that's why personally I'll always take cured resin cured quality resin quality cured it comes in all varieties and colors and flavors you know this is all over a 100 day this was harvested and dried so it's very meticulous of Indra and in particular drying process and then after that then goes into in the bags that go down into buckets or something because into the buckets either way the buckets are then kept in a on a shelving system that determines the date at which they were put in the room and the cannabis then cures in the dark at the at a very specific dial in how humidity in a very specific temperature when it cures for 100 days ladies and gentlemen I gotta tell you sure your love your live resin is loud right you open the jar Wow so stinky mmm or smell that limonene smell that mercy and smell that terrifying there's a there's enough little there's enough neuronal there's a Narada there's enough terpene alene in some of these cured water hashes that makes this [ __ ] this is louder than your [ __ ] mother-in-law and I love live resin I love it and I love live Robin but properly extracted and properly prepared cured resin properly cleaned to cure it resin well always take the cake there isn't even an argument about it is not even there's never like I've never ever ever and I mean I've been doing this since [ __ ] in 2008 professionally so you know I was doing this for a while of doing prohibition like like 15 years anyway yeah 15 a good 10 um no I've never ever ever ever once in my life had a strain that we took in fresh prose half of it you know flash freeze froze half of it immediately after harvest did not let it dry at all or you can start the breakdown of the breaking down of the sugars or beginning its drying it's the beginning of the coup process none of it and we extract it into live resin which is beautiful for the you know the 21 to 25 year old shoppers compared to something like this they went mmm I'll take that stuff and left this sitting there because they don't know about this yet and honestly I don't know how you know this might be a lost thing if you weren't around when this was like the best that we had or some of the best that we had you know good old European asheesh then maybe you won't ever fully appreciate that were a bust full-bodied nature of water ash and it is it's unlike anything else it's just amazing god damn I lost my train of thought there you know I'm so happy that Dad holy [ __ ] holy [ __ ] that's good all right so I think what I was talking about maybe I'll go back and read it and listen to it and then add it on at the end of the video if it wasn't that important not just [ __ ] it you guys can just laugh at me live resin appeared taking the a single but super Lemon Haze it was and we froze half the garden cured the other half very meticulously and there and also getting let it care for very long either because we didn't want to get a very full on you know a full cured color we wanted a something that would at least sit next to the live present because we knew that the library was going to look like [ __ ] unicorn be so anyway in my personal opinion and after I got a number of people try it we were just know what's his name live Breslin King does anybody remember lrk yeah anyway there are people that are like live resin or nothing live resident Oh like nothing in it and they bullied Arab library okay I don't think you have a whole lot of botanical or microbiological knowledge if you're saying to yourself like I only smoke cannabis and I want smoked cannabis concentrate and I only smoke super refined cannabis concentrate not broad spectrum but very refined it's almost even isolated camp going to isolated turkeys and I like in live fresh frozen and extracted no time for the plant to allow to do what nature intended again that's so anyway the super Lemon Haze is extraction the live presentation because it had a better covering prettier but everybody that I could get to sit down for a second and talk and just and try this next to the live resin there are even times if they would say like yeah I mean that's nice but boy that live resin is just boy that flavor you know and it's because during the first 30 days the monitor it means of course we're just pouring off of it it's it's essentially the extract is doing what your what what you wanted your plant to do but you wanted you plan to do it over a three to four month period not over a two to four week period so yeah man there's those flavors are strong as [ __ ] and they'll be like but you know any good so there's game and it's great and I get it's really good but it's just not quite as flavorful as that live resin and I'm like okay that's really I feel and never failed every single time I did this with anybody by the time I would see their the next time and they would come in they would always want to know like really what was up with that hash what the [ __ ] how does it you know like what's the way and then before I mean I changed sold people changed it and all that is is just a little bit of Education a lot of resin is great my present tastes great looks great oh that's done but first off as a processor I can tell you it never tastes this within 30 days of the extraction date library materials quickly whether your refrigerating it or not you're gonna be the only way you're gonna keep it from deteriorating or slow down it's deteriorating its number one major refrigeration and something super super sealed tight not these are nice and sealed but not a child for you that's not enough so anyway I love hash Robin because I love the way it just downs me and I love I'll clean the melts are etc etc etc but to be perfectly honest with you I found cannabis a long long long time ago and through the love of cannabis I found my way into well first off I was studying chemistry at school and then through my love of cannabis I found my way into extractions yeah just just straight up mate this [ __ ] let's check out this mouth I love the clean melts I love all that but there is and not buy clean melts I mean very very clean mouth again I discovered that I love canvas also discovered that I left chemistry around the same time in my life they're only really finding THC and not only it isn't it is elsewhere on the planet though don't comment but finding the THC and inside the glandular trichomes which are literally on the outside of the plant at the end of a stock and that stock is weakened majorly by supercritical temperatures and of course you know laboratory speaking it's very very very cold you know so we don't need to get that cold to weaken them a little bit right enter the freezer and uh the first leg of pantyhose that I stretched over a cup that I filled up full of frozen weed and then turned upside down on a table well unlike this one the table and let's check out some of the first separated tract room that I had ever made on purpose this was well twenty-one years ago having said that through chemistry I was making in I am still making some of the most refined and the cleanest melting cannabis extract that there are that can be you saw how charity and how just cool wet matter that last night was from the flag of pulled out pretty full milk um this rosin however I feel like it's gonna I think we're all know I think we all know the way this is gonna look but having said that I've gone from you know smoking bowls out of a metal pipe along to making some of the most refined extracts with hydrocarbons butane and propane etc and different hydrocarbons for post-processing and then came back to my roots the stuff I used to do in college this making hash and not rosin but making hash and then making hash flags etc and now the refinement into rosin is really really fun it's it's it's amazing being able to achieve a melt value this clean without using a gas is pretty intense I used nothing but water and the gravity and time and then I've used a teeny teeny teeny tiny and I mean at any time I barely like this wasn't really impressed I probably could have done this with two irons in my hand like the house was so greasy I mean you started four point four grams yield at three point two do the math on that the [ __ ] literally as soon as it sat on the warm plate I started yelling and leaking out of the behind some hats just wants to press itself whereas some hash just wants to be hash whoo or five seventy five eighty let's give it about five to ten and then we'll go cheers ladies and gentlemen hope you're having a good evening hope you enjoyed a little bit in the video hope you smoke along with me and as I it's a clean mouth man for those of you that don't know what I'm talking about I'm sure you do and by that I mean you will hear in just a quick second we've all had that BHO that you hold up your [Music] may not be the lightest of yellow but it's orange whatever it's attractive it's attractive as soon as you start dropping it into that bucket it starts to mount up against the glass and that's why I always do that whatever up against the guy that you can see the dad all over the glass right here I always do this thanks in the camera so that you all can see the color that it's turning into as its melting well if you noticed as this stuff melted it got even lighter and even prettier I'm not sure how that's possible but it did Jesus sometimes you just knock it the [ __ ] out of the pocket you didn't even know you didn't mean it you were just batting okay it's about a half an hour content for you and really by cons I mean hash talk and then add averages but you guys get the good stuff the rambles that they're disrupted trains up top I'm good ABS the Instagram TV earth they get the hash stabbing or the hash rambling and then more hash rambling and more house red linen more offering and to be honest with you we'll see how that goes I'm probably gonna get some shitty comments and guaranteed by the way if anybody wonders why I say 27 all the time so that's exactly 10 years younger than me but guarantee my hat IRG TV post which is all about hash hash rosin have some different hashes wash and then of course how they press accordingly having said that I guarantee you excuse me having said that I guarantee you I have some 27 you just beaten me the [ __ ] up because whatever way I chose to work something or whatever either way my methods won't stand you know my methods clearly are inferior to his workers but Instagram is the land of [ __ ] chefs and Chiefs there are no Indians and there are no workers everybody's a [ __ ] actor no chemistry they're good at hash makers taking the organic principle and applying it to making a no usually through trial and error and trial and error and trial and error and trial and error they're making a quality house product um the stuff that people don't post about are their heirs this one which it doesn't go well and those of you that followed me for a while know that that's not the case over here man I learned so much when I make mistakes I think I could have done this wash a little bit better I think I could have been a little heftier in my rinsing and then of course aside from that if it would have been a little heftier on the rinsing I think not only would it have an even more appealable consistency and melt valuable melt value in hash form but it would have pressed better as well this stuff Wow no complaints man every [ __ ] time and that's a 3.2 gram jar there ladies and gentlemen and you know the gap that we did with barely [ __ ] point one point one thought so that's easily a three-room jar how many people and how many of you are paying eighty plus dollars a gram for a very very high quality 90 micron house rosin and say it's live say it's not live doesn't really matter man when you're getting it shipped to you illegally or whatever I'm not saying that that's what you should do but I know that that's what a lot of people are doing when you get it shipped to you and it shows up like this are you going to doubt that it's live it's [ __ ] beautiful who cares people that are operating in the black market are doing maybe not the 400 day cure but they're drying it out so that they're getting a higher yield and then they're just extracting a little quicker I'm maybe a little hefty you're under rinsing and that way they're able to preserve a very nice color and then when it is pressed when it is pressed at the proper temperature you know long night at work but I'd like to take a little break come on I get finished in every once in a while I've recorded so I hope you guys enjoyed this one I did this the other night and I don't know like I really have so I can't really remember what I shared with you but there's something little break after work anyway I hope you all have a great weekend it's Saturday night where I am or Sunday morning I guess rather we'll see what kind of editing this takes and so I guess rather I should say I hope you had a great weekend and I

CVD week yes I know it's Sunday however we start stivity week people yeah and this I have covered it isn't because because I won't start this one with the most important it's under my quite hardcore migrants and that's where I find and maybe a little better solution and the cannabis you know problem is with this with if I use in the you know normal flour or normal dabs and that you know make you stone and I'm not every time can be that that hemp flowers and hemp products CBD parallax don't make you stuff that this is one with and the reasons why I won't try and the people today that you see on the entitled we have amnesia unless a haze a hash him hash here we go a little bad boy from buzzing Buddha coming out to say no more it's 17% of CBD and no THC or 0.2 what it's not a psycho active that we've all that analysts will change ours view I have as well into some normal Moroccan hush that we behave a little than the compare will be to compare how look you know and with smell it's little easier to do that that people say that it's time to what to change hours view as people change all right people not here you go we have nice and down nice amusia haze CBD 17 person this part of two and a half gram no THC that no drug YouTube this is no drug okay the most important from all this package people it's this part it's European hand okay we in the Europe we have a very long tradition to do to do hemp plantation and the use hand this is not nasty Chinese induced your hand this is normal proper fuel organic grow European henna people and as well we have I brought with me as well a little normal harsh Moroccan hash that we can happen to compare this to not give your people a little bad boy nice place it's no hard it's it's really it's kind of not gooey only soft but it's nice nice to use you don't need like a preemie if we wanted the crumble what is good as well you know with smell have Hashi smell only helped me how she smells compared to two Moroccan hush here we go it's no you see mostly off hand hug be a little more dreamy here that's different really smelly one yeah of course this one we have more hashing or lease mail compared to this this one it's more happy happy happy I don't know how I can different express this anyway have nice nice pleasant smell but people see how all this will [Music] yes that lead it's not you know not stacked Oh fluffy no Leland so buddy [Music] it's really no bad people and you can grab this it's not the nice hard place Poland [Music] very nice this look very nice now people of course will be try this bad boy will be used hours my mother compiled special for hush and I tell you how taste and what I think about this that Evo IV filling up this and the time to change the view do we change the view okay well it's time to try this bug but don't you see nice pipe nicely fill up it's really under nice Crandell one it's no very hard you really done it light up IV Bob and cheese I would let me try [Music] very smooth have this have nice mellow hostage and little grassy if you get it [Music] little pamphlet only not so much it's not that and about you and the TRO it's more smooth calm I must say overall it's

great job this is nice stuff look good we done little compare with ours normal Moroccan that it's no really big difference with how look [ __ ] you know it's crazy yeah good [ __ ] and people the most important you know you dopey on health and all this is illegal you listen to YouTube all this [ __ ] is illegal and people yeah you know not hopefully you enjoyed this end a review next I was Revere I think I'd be in them I'd be reviewing the sunflower maybe we have blueberries sherbert or maybe gelato 41 it's up to you people and of course we couple another that this all week be full of CBD products people say that don't forgot to like share subscribe and I'll see you next time", "BOIurqXTdgY": "alright guys we're back with another review this time we picked up a little bit of hash from herbal dispatch CA this is a mail order based medical cannabis delivery system what they do is basically just get this stuff from a dispensary and if you live in the Vancouver area they'll deliver it straight to your door with a driver or if you're outside of that area you can do the online mail order thing so the other day the little bro picked up in the 8th I believe of this bubble hash from herbal dispatch CA and of course I wanted to try it out so I just got a little piece of it awesome for you guys to see just go ahead and take it down and take a look at the bubble hash from herbal dispatch comm so based on looks that's not too shabby it's a little bit dark probably a second run or something along those lines but it's got a really strong sort of Hashi smell to it hard to explain that smell all I can say is that it smells hashey it's nice and dry it doesn't seem to have any type of moisture or mold issues so on looking smell I'm gonna give it pretty good not the best but pretty good so that's where ash is looking like from herbal dispatch CA now I want to try a couple different things with this hash as far as trying to get a review first thing I'm going to do is smoke a bowl right so I'm cutting up just a little bit of herb here to make a little bit of a bit so the hash doesn't get sucked down my down stem if some of this hash crumbled up a little bit nice crumbly crumbs I'll throw that in there mm this is gonna be a Hoshi ball I'm not trying to clear the ball here or anything I just want to get a nice little taste for this hash I actually don't want to burn the whole bowl because that weed on the bottom I just want to taste the hash so we'll try and only roast the top a little bit we will dispatch diet Tom Cheers mm-hmm okay see yeah that's that's reminding me of the same type of hash I used to get back in the day it's got a good strong flavor a hash tends to get a little bit raunchy at times and I find this is not raunchy at all so we're happy with that it's got the typical classic hash flavor that you like all right so now we've done that I'm gonna let it sink in for just a minute here and we're gonna go on to our next thing we're gonna try this hash hmm you know for a supposed loca mid-grade hash it's not so bad I'm already kind of feeling it sink in a little bit the classic hash type of buzz feelin it more in my body it's not it's not in my head at all you know go ahead and get the hair straightener on 200 degrees 200 degrees a piece of parchment paper here and I've taken this little little little piece of hash probably probably weighs about 0.2 0.3 something like that I just want to basically see how it squishes out so I'm on the website the claim that it is a half melt but if you look back in the video of the supercharged joint with dawn haze you'll see he puts it on his nail and it's not half melt not in the slightest there is no melt but we're gonna see how it squishes let's set up the camera for that okay not a whole lot I'm gonna kick it over and I'll keep squeezing again we're not getting a whole lot but turn your temperature up a little bit see if that helps us any listen ain't pressing out for [ __ ] ladies and gents ain't pressing out for [ __ ] so as you can see in our little rosin test here that's why the [ __ ] ain't no half melt yeah you can see there was no melt in it to be had that was all the melt that was in the hash that little bit there now I did this rosin press for two reasons reason number one is I want to see how much return I get from it which I'm disappointed with and the number two reason is to see how she tastes on a DAP so I'm gonna try and collect this up it's uh this rosin is actually very runny my brother warned me about this I thought it might have been something to do with the screens that he uses but no this is very oily rosin see normally as I go scraping over top of the rosin it all collects onto the dabber but you see there's quite a bit left behind there so this is gonna be fun trying to collect all right so I've gone beyond disappointed now I'm actually a little bit upset put in a point to hash and got this tiny little I'm not even I call that a dad I wouldn't give that DAB to a dab virgin if I was taking it easy on them and there's still all this [ __ ] on my paper cuz it's oily as [ __ ] well what can you do right to be honest I really didn't expect much it was 45 dollars for an eighth so like depending on where you live that's pretty much what you pay for an eighth of cannabis so I mean really for the price I wasn't expecting anything as stellar but yeah I don't know I just thought it would oppressed out a little bit more than that you tell me your brother's half melts I expect I'm gonna get half frozen but you know big my part I said earlier that it seemed nice and dry and maybe it's not man because that's really oily Rosa there might be some moisture deep in there that I just can't deal with my fingers but in any case let's try this that's rosin mmm okay I'm really impressed with the flavor on that that is that is just Hoshi as hell man oh that was really nice big-time struggle I had to waste a lot of hash to get it and it was son of a [ __ ] to get it off of the paper but that was a really tasty dab I enjoyed that want that sink in for another minute and then we'll talk about what's going on so verbal dispatch calm is a Vancouver based company and they do door-to-door deliveries of medical cannabis which is way more awesome there it's free if you live in the Vancouver area but if you're not in the Vancouver area that's what the dot-com is about and they can mail it to you it also doubles as a mail order site so for me living in Calgary I was able to go online or my brother was sorry go online and order up he got himself a Graham lho we've got an eighth of hash a couple of different strains of cannabis coming in so that's a really useful thing if you're you know you're a little wary about buying some Street cannabis because look at it this way it is illegal and when something's illegal it brings in a criminal element so it makes it a little hairy for someone to go and try and buy a cannabis for a medication off of gangbangers street drug dealer type of guy if that's the case so herbal dispatch calm you go on they've got a great selection of things they've even got products from Horatio Delbert and the beard brothers so some pretty nice stuff on there as far as their hash goes I'm gonna say it's good I mean for the price it was $45 in eight so three and a half grams for $45 that's a pretty decent price if you ask me and it shipped in about four days so really no time at all it gets to you quite quickly yes far as their hash goes not too bad at all for the price I really enjoyed it it's got a good flavor it's got a really good buzz it's hitting my body nice I woke up this morning with a bit of back pain as usual I shouldn't I say that like it's a surprise but every morning I wake up with back pain and so far this is my first session this morning so far this hash is doing the trick as far medicating my pain away it's it's nice not the best hash but we didn't come in here expecting it to be the best hash I'm gonna go ahead and say like out of five it's it's a two or three but when you were shooting for the price point of a one or two and it comes in at a two or three whatever she gets two thumbs up so go ahead go to her will dispatch comm get yourself some of this you can get yourself some shatters some lho they've got CBD caps they've got edibles just go check out her will dispatch calm", "mzTn-q224W4": "[Music] Security's getting a lot tighter now we've just been pulled over by the army and we're just about to head into drug country

to replace Lebanon's failing silk industry and soon flourished into one of its most valuable exports this reached his peak during the 15-year Civil War where Lebanon was said to be producing 1000 tons of hashish per year the Bekaa Valley is a vast lawless stretch of land 75 miles long that spans nearly the whole length of Lebanon this year an estimated 45,000 venoms of land was dedicated to cannabis cultivation generating multimillion-dollar profits for local drug lords despite most political parties in Lebanon having a long history of shady association with the drug trade the state comprised of a political coalition that includes Hezbollah has outlawed cannabis cultivation and has enforced the policy of eradication since the end of the civil war every year the security forces turn up with bulldozers and try and destroy the crops this naturally pisses off the farmers and meets to running gun battles breaking out between them leaving casualties on both sides we headed to a

I am submitting this menu from a Pawnee institution, J.J.'s Diner, home of the\nworld's best breakfast dish, the Four Horse-meals\nof the Egg-Porkalypse. - Hey, what's up, guys? And welcome back to this, the final episode of \"Binging With Babish\" to come out of the old kitchen. I'm all moved in to the new spot and have already filmed the\nsubject of next week's episode, \"The Meat Tornado,\" but\nfor now we're taking a look at the Four Horse-meals\nof the Egg-Porkalypse, described in Leslie Knope's book as \"An astonishing onslaught of protein,\" that includes a 12-egg scramble, bacon, sausage, ham, hash browns,\nchicken fried steak, and a giant tower of buttermilk pancakes. First thing we can start\nwith is the flapjacks. This is a factory standard\nbuttermilk pancake recipe. If you wanna see how to make it, click the link in the upper\nright hand corner right now. Whisk it to a lumpy smooth consistency, cover with plastic wrap, and\nfridge for up to 24 hours. Plenty of time to address the many other Horse-meals\nof this Egg-Porkalypse. If we consult the book, \"Pawnee: The Greatest Town in America\", you can see that there are two different iterations of hash browns. A mountain of scattered\nand shredded hash browns and five deep fried hash brown patties. So, we're gonna start with the patties by peeling and chopping\nfive medium russets into one-inch chunks, immediately dunking them\ninto a cool water bath so as they do not discolor. This is also gonna help wash\noff some of the excess starch, which is gonna give us crispier potatoes. So, go ahead and drain these and then we're gonna pat 'em dry on a few layers of paper towels. And then we're following\na method for tater tots from master of all things crispy, J. Kenji Lopez-Alt, who calls for the potatoes to be par fried in 350 degree Fahrenheit vegetable oil for three to four minutes until lightly browned and cooked through. Once nicely blonde around the edges, we're gonna fish them out and drain them on a paper towel set in\na rimmed baking sheet. Then we're gonna let them cool completely at room temperature about 20 minutes before processing them\ninto a chunky paste. This fry, fry again process is going to keep the\ninteriors of our hash browns light and flaky rather\nthan gummy and dense. So, once they're nice and cool, go ahead and load them into\nyour favorite food processor and hit it with eight one-second pulses until all of the potatoes\nhave been broken down into little tiny chunks. Do this in batches to ensure that the potatoes are processed evenly, and fish out any extra\nlarge chunks with your hands and your human intelligence. Once everybody's all processed together we can season and form into patties. We're gonna add two teaspoons of sugar, a few twists of freshly\nground black pepper, a hefty pinch, or about one\nteaspoon, of kosher salt, and a tablespoon of potato starch, which is gonna help give our hash browns structure and meaning. Once evenly mixed together, it's time to start\nforming them into patties. Hash browns typically are\nsort of oblong oval pucks designed to be quickly and easily mashed into your mouth hole. Now we're gonna freeze these\nbad boys for about an hour until they are frozen solid. This is both going to make it easier to retrieve and deep fry them, and it's also going to crystallize the potatoes' molecular structure, making them more tender. Back into some 375 degree\nFahrenheit oil they go for about five minutes until\ndeeply golden brown and crisp. Drain them on a wire rack,\nand there you have it, beautiful, crispy,\nairy, flaky hash browns, which we're gonna keep warm in a low oven while we make the million\nother things that we're making. The most excited for which\nI am is chicken fried steak, which starts with one of the cheapest and toughest cuts around, top sirloin, which we're going to gently\ncoax into being tender using a whole bunch of\nlittle tiny sharp knives. This is a meat tenderizer\nused for making cubed steak, a steak filled with\nhundreds, if not thousands, of little tiny incisions, rendering even the most impossibly tough cuts of beef butter knife soft. After many spirited stomps they look very much the same, but look more closely and you will see, they have been bespeckled with lots and lots of little holes. And so, now they're ready for breading. In my dry breading station I have one cup of all purpose flour, a teaspoon each kosher\nsalt and cayenne pepper, tiny whisked until homogenous. Then on the wetter side of things, I have one large egg, one teaspoon of baking powder and a half teaspoon of baking soda, which I'm going to tiny\nwhisk into a slurry before tiny whisking in\none cup of buttermilk. This is gonna give our breading\na nice light, airy texture. Once everybody on both sides is homogenous we're ready to start dippin' our steaks. And since we're obviously not trying to skimp on the cholesterol, we are of course double battering. That means taking a prolonged\ndip in the dry stuff, shaking off any excess, heading over for a swim in the wet stuff, making sure that every crack and cranny is comprehensively coated and heading back over into the dry, creating a bulky, craggly exterior, not unlike that of fried chicken. But fun fact, that is actually not where chicken fried steak gets its name. A known foodie and longtime Francophile, Thomas Jefferson is\nactually credited with... I'm just kidding, it totally got its name from being a steak fried like chicken, which is exactly what\nwe're gonna do with it. Into some 350 degree\nFahrenheit oil it goes, where it shall fry about\nfour to five minutes per side until deeply golden\nbrown and crisp all over. Use extreme caution when flipping because if you crack the shell you're gonna have a bad time. Drain it on a wire rack, keep it warm in a low oven, and rinse and repeat with\nany remaining steaks. And then the very key to the deliciousness of chicken fried steaks lies\nin the bottom of this pot. That's right. Remember all the brown sloppy gold from the KFC episode? All this deep fried gunk is the key to making delicious gravy. So, we're reserving as much as possible in the bottom of the pan, along with about two to three tablespoons worth of leftover fry oil, into which we're gonna dump\nhalf an onion, finely minced. We're gonna saute that onion and all that brown sloppy goodness for two to three minutes\nuntil it's starting to soften and turn translucent around the edges. Add two or three crushed cloves of garlic and continue to saute over a medium heat for about 30 seconds until fragrant. And then we're adding\na quarter cup of flour as our eventual thickener. Mix that in with the vegetables and let it cook for about\ntwo to three minutes until the raw flour smell dissipates. Then we are slowly whisking in about a half a cup of beef stock and the star of the show,\none cup of light cream. Add it slowly at first, whisking constantly to prevent lumps. Add the rest and whisk\nfrequently over medium-high heat until bubbling and thickened. Once it starts to bubble, make sure you lower the heat so as to not scorch the sauce. When it's just about done we're gonna season with kosher salt, freshly ground pepper, and an optional sprinkle\nof cayenne pepper. We wanna reduce and thicken to the point that it can easily coat\nthe back of a spoon. We're also using a spoon so\nwe can give it a little taste. Let's see how this is. Oh my god, that's good. Don't worry if it seems a little thin, it's going to thicken as it cools, but we wanna keep it warm\nuntil we're ready to serve. Last bit of prep we've gotta do is shred our potatoes for our\nscattered fried hash browns. To make these, we are\npeeling and shredding three large russets directly\ninto a bowl of cool water. This, again, is both going\nto remove excess starch, and prevent them from\ndiscoloring too quickly. Set those aside, and just like the very first\nepisode out of this kitchen, we're gonna finish on the flattop. There is no other way that a\nbreakfast of this magnitude could be constructed. Once sizzling hot, we're\ngonna treat the whole surface with a little drizzle of canola oil, just to make sure that\nnobody gets too sticky, and then it's time to commence with the onslaught of protein. I'm starting with what looked to me like a pound of fried bacon fried up extra crisp the way\nthat I imagine Ron likes it. I can just imagine him saying something about how floppy bacon is for frequent criers and bed-wetters. We've also got three large slabs of ham that we're just gonna heat\nup and get a nice crust on. Once everybody's nicely\nbrowned and fried up, it's time to evacuate them onto a plate, which we're gonna keep warm in a low oven as we move on to phase two, the sausage and pancake phase. I've got some regular plain\nJane breakfast sausage here, next to which I'm going to begin to dollop large buttermilk pancakes. These are gonna fry about three\nminutes on their first side until they begin to turn pale\nand blistery around the edges. And let us all take a moment to remember that these are all being\nfried in bacon fat. Once the pancakes are flipped they get another two to three\nminutes on the opposing side before being stacked on\na plate and repeating until we got no pancake batter left. Pancakes finished, it's time to get this off of the spatula here. Come on, dude, let's go. Join your pancakey brethren. And last but not least, we have our scattered hash\nbrowns and 12-egg scramble. The potatoes, we're gonna\nplace in a clean kitchen towel and just squeeze the\nabsolute dickens out of. Make sure that they are super dry to facilitate effective browning. But before they are\nheaded over the cooktop we're gonna lightly season\nthem with some kosher salt and freshly ground black\npepper, just the hits. Mix gently to distribute throughout and load them up onto an oiled flattop. Then after flattening out\nwith a large metal spatula into a potato patty, we're gonna cover them with a bowl while frying on the first side. This is gonna help the potatoes\ncook more evenly throughout. Then, once the sausage has been removed onto the keep-it-warm plate, we're gonna dedicate the\nnew flattop real estate to the 12-egg scramble, which is exactly what it sounds like, 12 eggs, scrambled, but we're doing ours in\nbacon and sausage fat. Just sorta scramble them around them, and once you have some nice\nbig, soft, pillowy, eggy curds, remove them onto a plate\njust in time to realize that you didn't time out\nyour hash brown very well. But just pretend that you're at J.J.'s and you have heat lamps or something. Flip once nicely browned, cooking for four to five minutes per side. Once it's ready to go, flop\nit atop your hash brown pucks and get ready to serve. Everybody else is waiting, so why don't we go join the party? And what a party it is. Thousands of calories and\nhundreds of grams of cholesterol on parade alongside a\nsingle glass of orange juice and a single cup of coffee. I'm about to dig right into this sucker, but first I just wanna say a few words. (sighs) Well, folks, this is it. Oh, I'm not in focus, am I? Hang on a second. (groans) Well, folks, that's it. That is the last meal to\ncome out of the SoHo kitchen. I've lived here for two\nplus some-odd years. I fell in love here, I\nwrote a cookbook here, I lived a whole lot of life here, and it's pretty crazy to say goodbye. Oh, I forgot the sausage gravy. Hang on. We mustn't forget the sausage gravy. Okay, that's better. So yeah, like I was saying, (sighs) I'm feeling a lot\nof things saying goodbye. I'm feeling scared (laughs), but like Ron Swanson says, \"When I eat, it is the\nfood that is scared,\" so I'm gonna try to adopt that outlook. I'm feeling excited because I've got a lot of big new plans for the new space, new shows, new people, new everything. And I'm also feeling pretty sad. This place has been my home for longer than most places\nhave ever been my home. And like Ron Swanson says, again, \"There is no sadness that\nbreakfast food cannot cure,\" so I'm gonna live by those words and I'm gonna dig in to this\nbreakfast food right now. Oh, this needs butter. Boop. (laughs) Oh, hold on, I got something to. My last splash of Lagavulin 16. Last little bit. Oh, I spilled it on the eggs. That's okay. Okay, that's not a little\nbit, that's a lot of bit, but whatever, we're celebrating tonight. Thank you guys so much\nfor sticking with me. I owe everything I have to you. I owe everything, more than\nI ever dreamed I would have, I owe it all to you. And like I said in my book, I'm gonna spend the rest of my life working to earn everything\nthat you've given me. So, here's to you guys. Thank you so much for sticking with me. I'm gonna devour this\nbreakfast food right now. Particularly this chicken fried steak 'cause I've been thinking\nabout this all (beep) day. Mm. Hell yeah, dude.

pliable it's it's fairly solid you can hear it i mean i hope you can hear it i could hear it see you could uh snake it you just snake it out like the end and pass it around to your friends i mean that's how we used to do it yeah parties because i used to get the same stuff from a place look i used to get this stuff from a place called uh what was the name of the place it was a it was a place we could get herbal stuff wasn't hemp though but you could get herbal hash and stuff and they made it out of like proprietary herbs and this stuff we used to get this in a block a one ounce block for like 35 bucks it was like just like a blend of herbs that they just hashed we used to have these really cool gaming parties and smoked this stuff and talking funny voices you know and and just have fun gaming and this reminds me of that um international oddities that was the company maybe i should contact them and see if i could review some of their stuff if you guys have never heard of them they had like this wizard smoke it was like a awesome sage that just rolled nicely um anyway sorry that's not what this video is about but this reminds me of that and i always thought that that stuff was great quality so i didn't think the same about this i think this is gnarly this is good i really um i really like this so far and i haven't even smoked it yet because it reminds me of a time ago thank you guys oh man it's sticky too just like good good hash like good hash it's nice and sticky um i'm gonna put this i guess i have some like ashes in there oh no you know what let's uh let's try not to get any crap in here with this i can't get it up we'll normally have that kind of thing happen that's still good hemp so we'll uh we'll keep it and smoke it later because it's already pre it's already burnt so i don't want that taste let's let's just go with um let's just go with like ah you know what i have some of the white the white just so you guys don't have to ask me not because i'm trying to squeeze away into the video maybe i should just put that in this description i gotta think about what i'm doing before i do it all right so i got this piece here i'm gonna just put it right on top like that like old school now let's see if i can get you to look and see it oh technical difficulties sticky that we can reposition there okay so what's in there you can see it down in there all right here we go alright wow it is like a it's okay it's just like a burst of floral hemp like right in your tongue my green here is a little like it's a little slick maybe salivating because it is good um that's some that's really good like herbal herbal flavor i keep getting this thing about recording video while charging i guess it makes the phone overheat so i'm gonna stop that i'll just take it out i'm starting to call oh wow all right so maybe um here's another hit here that is delicious oh my god guys thank you so much guys for recommending this you guys got you know what you're doing out there this um if you haven't tried this stuff yet i think maybe you might want to i mean this this tastes really good it's uh foods your whole mouth with flavor and then it's a little dry but it's not in a bad way it's not a bad way at all it's reminiscent of like something i've already yeah that i can't remember what that stuff was called i think it was called i think it was called like uh red hair hash i think it was called and blonde which was yellow and red hair which was red i i think i'm going to contact that company guys i'm going to contact the company and i'm going to review their products oh yeah yeah i'm for sure but uh you know what i think i wanna i think i'm gonna oh i think i wanna just try smoking this all by itself like this there we go just like this once it starts to glue redney in oh wow that's probably not big enough but i can get a flavor on it though like the ash went back in mine well i guess if i had a bigger piece i'm gonna look so stupid but this is how i used to do it i'm definitely getting a flavor though i mean i don't know i don't want to do like a whole bunch of it because like i'm going to save it to enjoy it it's still really good though that's really really good i'm going to take what's left and put it in here try one more time wow that is really really flavorful not like a regular review let's um put on some qualities i feel like right in here and then my sides of my face um it it feels a little more potent in the actual lifter strain actually in honesty because the relaxation is really really really really really strong um i mean i'm not inebriated obviously but it is very very relaxing and i like that i mean that's you're supposed to you know feel uplifted and happy i feel uplifted and happy like and relaxed at the same time like it's a it's like a it's definitely um mood appropriate like if you want to feel good because i like to feel relaxed yet up and ready to go i know that sounds dumb but my laid back nature that i really have that because i don't because i don't live very like where i can rest a lot i'm really active i really am so being able to kick back and just kind of get through it like all of it i really like this this is this is really good work um like the flavor like if i was to give the flavor from like a one to ten obviously one being the worst and ten being the best i would definitely give the flavor like an 8.5 because this one here um you know the strain let me just be a little more specific the strain here that this is made out of is a very tasty strain too it's very floral and very um you know it's really good the lifter strain is very popular very tasty very happy very cool very yummy so is this this stuff is like stuff is like really impressive it's impressive i'm impressed so i mean this has been pressed or maybe it's finger i don't know maybe i mean maybe they got it from like cure like i don't know that would be a lot well i don't know i mean let's put that little piece in there with the rest and uh i'm gonna put the cap on here so it doesn't dry out because i would hate to see that happen although i think maybe a little water on your fingers like what we used to with the uh like the uh red hair stuff from international oddities when it would start to get a little stiff we just put a little water on our fingers and kind of you know free but not too much because if you put it back in a jar and it's like wet then", "J2TdaKftDHY": "Manning in Rome smoking weed waited from the earth god put this here for me jee seeti we dreams man medical marijuana only unless his Turtles for naps can watch I'll just know two guys jr. against CT we just said that okay it's not healing corner the other day like I said when I picked up those new flowers

called just hash it's from Connecticut pharmaceutic solutions it's the tortilla which is the train wreck on the train wreck is a pretty pretty obviously pretty popular strain out there that's thumb it's a Mexican and it ties the team across with the Afghan en de caso trick it's team of dominant hybrid like to like two-thirds sativa in like a third indica so it's mostly sativa dominant hybrid um they got that on flower home as well unfortunately i don't have it um so what I got with me is some of the Lexington super skunk flower on hypothetically speaking in our Charles hatch what form is hash is going to be in if I need to put a base on it for flower and use that but what we got for the main product is this yeah it's the Connecticut pharmaceutical solutions to dry a little bit taurine hash and it's got like c 26 and fourteen percent th e so similarly 44-percent THC and it's actually pretty economical this is like 40 bucks for over 1.2 grams of it on the inner corner I don't know if this is gonna take a bubble hash or regular hash I think just please waiting to be keep just keep just Preston hash but I'm become a rig here robber concentrate corner so I weirdo some of the [ __ ] you're medicated quit alright wait nice okay so let's just open it up and see what we got in here a while it's badass chick though huh do that that's [ __ ] bad-ass is [ __ ] actually look at that

down in healing phone right now um I mean what I would say to do with this [ __ ] is is this I personally would just take a piece here probably snap it off it looks kind of malleable spendable Lexi bend it a little bit it's actually soft and pretty pliable I would just kind of look break a little piece off there like that boom and you could probably just put on top your ball for your weed so that's what we'll do is we'll break off a couple these pieces here got one right there don't right there and we'll do like 30 [ __ ] it it's pretty cheap why not three little hash pieces right there that's what I'm going to do my hash do which one with yours but you can see in comparison how much I took off in comparison what you get and look he said they're just three little nice little brookie pieces hash again just all the Keef collect impressed pretty old-school pretty simple and I'm assuming a pretty effective them probably so that's badass so there so we get 40 bucks down feeling right

repugnant dislikes King [ __ ] flower hair Jesus Christ this [ __ ] is just [ __ ] off the chain ridiculous ridiculous we don't want a lot of it come on to overpower not trying to overpower the flower I'm going to borrow the hatch with the flower because separate strands and reviews on the tour Dean we need to break out a couple things to do a couple small balls this shit's [ __ ] just dangerously stanky all right so I'm breaking my weed from a base layer like I said I'm not going to use a lot of weed for the base layer just a little bit just not to basically get that so covered it up and I'm here basically just the hash the hash itself I probably won't even need that second uggs i'm not gonna use a lot of the flower yeah we'll need that second oh please a little bit purple maybe it will we'll see we leave it out just in case alright so do is put a little bit of flour on the bottom just a little just cover up and make sure the whole thing in a fault or anything like that and then I'm just gonna take my chunk here and pull their speech me lose it now if you take my chunk of hash here and let's get place it right on top right on top right there basically here's what you do with it just give you a quick shot see I took it and I just put it right on the on the weed itself cool all right I set this back up show oh Christ oh boy hold on all over the matter Jesus Christ what the [ __ ] Greg what the [ __ ] he doing holy [ __ ] you can't see the bunny Greg what's wrong with you now there we go holy [ __ ] alright I won't do that again but you see where you see where we're going

connecticut mayor of medical marijuana program thank you good [ __ ] back without it hey so they planted it um I reckoned I would not recommend driving this hash I don't think it'll dab it won't

what the heck work or something like that but it's not going to dab so don't don't dab it it's not going to do anything okay i'm almost sure I means it's just bubbling melting like crazy I was [ __ ] totally long and slide to you but I don't think that's going to happen um excuse engage wasn't thing of miles alright let's see what's going on here I mean it nice and hot cuz again this consistent is this hash out on the alternate also i'm just gonna hit it hard the first time and see what happens all right let's do this trainwreck hash connecticut pharmaceutical solutions actually really nice super hachey tasting just like straight old-school hash her to let a little patience who actually really really appreciate this it was just a straight old-school hash it as good as [ __ ] you like

crumble this one up here and break into little pieces and see if that makes a difference so we try that experiment on two I put the first one on when the stuff is easy to play with it breaks right up in your fingers which is nice yeah you can just like break it right up and doesn't crumble a key so definitely thicker consistency than Keef is little moister right now this one I just kind of crumbled on top of the bowl here spread it out a little bit it smells good too alright so let's do this one yeah like I said that that was [ __ ] exactly [ __ ] pretty Medicaid fast okay um flavor-wise I mean I should definitely be mentioned this on mother clean wise I I don't [ __ ] remember so I'll say after I said all right this would be on the flavor try to grow a flavor profile for this one that got me yeah that definitely a medicated good it's real good I'm psyched about that I think I have a funeral is one with it be a little bit hard because they broke it up and spread it out

get you straight to keep it out want you feel better no matter what mood is right trainer cash I'm out guys I'll see you back in the next couple days with [ __ ] fire right", "LkPeqJEWIG8": "okay so we got everything in here mixed up the water the eyes took that's pretty good you can kind of see the consistency on what I was talking about how they caught the fall into look ice is starting to break down a nicely but there's still ice still holding so that means the water temperature is pretty good most drinks that you buy out of the core we're set to uh to be 40 to 43 degrees so we should be able to uh you know hit the water to that point and then actually not how types of ice which I'm still in there to kind of knock the cranks off of the actual polish and that's when you pretty much know you're good to go and you can start stirring and mixing now I mean you can do this for 10 minutes you can do this for 30 minutes it's gonna get to a point to where you can only get so much trichome off of the [ __ ] plant and then you start basically getting really matter and with your trike mix so I mean what I like to do I don't want to really get too much green foliage in there and I mean I'm not people to not using a mixer definitely but you can still get a lot of green : Jews who are filling your your trichomes if you make over mix or mix too vigorously what I like to do is to basically go down to the bottom you mix the bottom up to the top you know shake that's going off they're going to sit sit down or push it back down into the water level and I'll do that I'm gonna do that probably goes for 15-20 minutes you know on and off and then I got a serum to do this consistently because there's really gonna point to them because what gets knocked off is now on the water and will now be drained out of the bag and what's on the foliage will stay on college so I don't have to sit there and you know platini's I just got to make sure that I've moved the [ __ ] around from the bottom to the top so that way what's on the bottom that's falling that's in that layer of water down below it will stay down there and not be stuck between the foliage and ice cubes and all that [ __ ] up top so that's why it's kind of good to kind of take it and mix it up you know shake the spoon off get the top of the ship from the bottom to the top you know that's what you want to do for the next 15 20 minutes as you do this I got three stems in here you really don't want stems you really don't want any families that will give you a grittier greeting or a finished product I talked to a guy that hit me up and or we we had kind of had words on somebody else's page and find out he actually wanted meeting wasn't give me a hand make it snap so I took some visit live sweet you know emailed me a couple pictures of the plants and substantive showed me a video they made back middle back in the day in YouTube so you know I'm taking his advice you know I really didn't realize how much family if I had in this old bag of pass or a bag of trim so I kind of mix that [ __ ] in there with them and I'm seeing it now as its gonna break down they keep stealing this [ __ ] you don't want that kind of stuff you don't want anything that has a major family vine you know our major stem on it because that means the major family if you want just to surely this isn't coded underneath the buds you know right in between the buds you know as it's growing and as you trim it off that's what you want another good thing to do is take your your lower scrag nugs and make sure you know dry it out properly maybe even cure it up and we can use that that's a little bit better great quality of THC that you're gonna get that definitely should be blonde no problem but as far as the fair leaves go I mean you know you're gonna use that if you're going that you want to make sure you use as much cleaned family or trim [ __ ] early but you say you know that's possible don't know families no family so I'm going to stir this up you know like I said in another 15-20 minutes probably have a little bit more ice and water sources you know it warms up pretty quick you know and he's still you know it gets to a point where it's gonna the ice creams are gonna start melting then you have the you know add a little more to it if you have any buds ear buds take those and you know trem break those up as good as possible get them off the stems you want to open up that inner part of the play and get the tracks out of the inside of the bud if you're not into you know really grinding them those much another way to make packs is going to be a your pho but this is a this is definitely by far the best way to make cash in my opinion concentrates are great I think this is probably the cleanest more purest form and make me concentrate you can cook with this stuff a lot better it's not like cooking with you know green and then you know skimming the butter it you know no it's just you can make butter or oil you don't because you basically you take all the THC off the plant and put it into the butter you know without having to do all the cooking on the ship so but yeah about 20 nights of this the people united to this and you should be good to go and I'll start it up pour it into the up the bags and doing that and you know when I'm done okay so I've been mixing for about 15-20 minutes see that water is definitely a suit double off more there he was moving exactly right from the skirts like five minutes trying to get as much as I possibly can off of this [ __ ] I got some more [ __ ] but I'm not really too worried about how much I get out on this the video probably make another one buzz let's see the difference how much you get off off of water leaving sugar Lee versus the actual knowledge this out but all the water straight off any level I'm sure he's been doing it a couple of times inside foliage so four four nine that we don't really have to this you know you want the cleanest best possible hash you know you want to just let the [ __ ] that's in the water do a lot less water this time the next time around so I've maybe add a little more ice to chill it down a little more and you know go from there yeah I mean this is looking pretty much done definitely large definitely you can see when I push it down that's a mech in there so I've seen see something that I had in there just do a couple you got it for free so about ready to mean all that situation that comes to the top so it's you know full answers like that said like I said that swap out by spinach consistency like it's been sitting in hot water boiling or cooking for an hour or so so that's ready to go grab out of the bucket and we'll get started so the first thing you want to do which [ __ ] in the tunnel and let it pull the work bag out [ __ ] that's really heavy let it drain off let's go ahead let this drink Lily off make sure you fill the water out so all the good gold is that wand or whatever you want to call it a hash whatever that's where all your [ __ ] is that so let us air a drink for a little bit I'm gonna tell you that the 25 micron bag is the longest draining bag I have ever used I don't think because I can't even really say that it's even you know I can tell the difference and how much better it is and like say like the 43 micron but I have the bag so I'm going to use it it's just gonna take a while to get it done but it's just an easy process from here it's basically just pouring this bucket that's water into the bucket and you know letting it sit there for a little bit and then you know let it all settle to the bottom of the bags and then you want to start pulling one back out of the time custo make sure it drains out really good and even and you know I have too bad well I'll show you the hatch and I'll show you when I get out of it and you guys can take from one what you want from it and you know maybe utilize it or even if you just want to find a new set of bags basically the main reason why I made this video was to promote these bags I was next Lily was definitely nice enough to be able to so I made a promise to him I said I would definitely promote him so the whole shape another upper foliage you know the words mixed in you started yes pretty much try trade now you see how much water I really I didn't really use that much why I don't know if you guys see that I can look at the Cattleman's but let's just see how much actual water was in there it's quite a bit of quite a bit of trim that I use so I put this up ears in Thrissur then drained out but um see see how dark the water is for me and that's how you know you've got a pretty good amount hash in there so I'm just gonna go ahead and get this book it up and we're gonna just basically take this and pour it these other bags up whatever is you know whatever size to track go ahead you have it'll stop at that particular micron bag so you know don't worry about that there's a
