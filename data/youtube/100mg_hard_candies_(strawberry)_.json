{"Qv9iImm1KEc": "and this is a live video so for those that will be rewatching this is a live recording if you are new to my channel don't forget to hit that subscribe button and then notification bell to let you know that another great video is on and we're gonna get started on how to dip how to properly dip candy strawberries in this video session I will break away and do a Q & A after I have gone through the steps and techniques and methods for this particular video alright so don't forget to give this video thumbs up leave a comment in the comment section let me know how you enjoyed this video and we're gonna go ahead and get started so what I'm going to discuss with you first is what am i what am i using to dip my strawberries first I got some fresh strawberries and I have some paper towel to completely dry my strawberries they must be completely dry and I'm going to use the half recipe 2 cups of sugar 1/2 cup of water and 1/2 cup of light corn syrup I have my bamboo scores which these are 6 inches long and they're like 4 inches 4 inches in width so either you get 6 inches or 8 inches long this is to better help with dipping so you won't have to stick your hand all the way into in the pot dipping these strawberries okay safety first safety first all right and so I'm also going to demonstrate a few things with the i'ma show you the original dipping then I'm going to add color and then I'm going to do some sour candied strawberries all right so I put in a little mixture of some of my Jolly Rancher mix and just mix them together and we're gonna get started so let's go ahead and add our 1/2 cup of water 2 cups of granulated sugar 1/2 cup of light corn syrup all right get that all mixed up in there now I'm not gonna add any color because I am getting I'm going to create the original candy strawberries first all right so you want to cook this same as you do candy recipe for apples you want to cook this to 300 degrees this is a half recipe okay mix that all in there now here's a trick with the candy strawberries all right using a Half Men half recipe this is the thing of understanding recipes if you want to thin out your candy add a little bit more water okay if you want to add 2 more tablespoons of water or 4 table tablespoons of water to thin it out your mixture or you can add 3/4 cup or another 1/2 cup and the all it does is then out the mixture so that it won't be so hard on your candy strawberries all right and then when you add more water then you have to take it up to 310 degrees all right so that is a tip for you all today taking my candy thermometer placing it in the pot making sure the tip does not touch the bottom of the pot or it will give off a first reading and I'm going to put this disclaimer up there as soon as I turn this induction oven on it maybe some static but it will soon go away let's get that on [Music] okay so you want to put this on medium-high heat making your candy apple recipe and no color goes in just get the clearance of this particular candy strawberry okay some people average some people don't but you'll see what I'm talking about once it's time to dip so you want to make sure that your strawberries are completely dry taking you a nice paper towel oh you're here to set it for this soon go away I know that that after I went back to watch the video all right so make sure that you dry your strawberries completely what I clean my strawberries went is a vegetable wash and I will put the description the link in the description below but make sure that all your strawberries are completely clean all right so I'm just dabbing my strawberries and while I'm doing that I'm going right into our Q&A segment so here we go feel free to ask your questions let's get it into this and go hi everyone [Music] [Music] very great question being that this these are fresh fruit any fresh fruits that you dip does not last long at all strawberries grapes these does not last no longer than two to three days two to three days is the longest that these are going to last because a lot fresh fruit a lot of fresh fruit cannot be dipped okay it doesn't last long at all two to three days tops no longer than that if anyone wish to purchase from you any fresh fruit you must they must get them that same day or within the three days I wouldn't recommend shipping because they break down even with chocolate-covered strawberries they don't last long at all best way to store them this look this winter storm if you put them in a container a cupcake container whatever little small box container you want to serve to your customer it's totally up to you and you store them right into the refrigerator you're welcome someone see me live and they're live in the video if you see if you're in here and you lie please refrain from inboxing me I am doing a live video thank you is this recipe is this the same recipe as candy apples yes I use this my same recipe I just took the recipe a half just the half recipe if you want to thin off the candy I would advise if you add at least four tablespoons of water or you can do a half cup more of water all you do is just turn it off the mixture and you can cook it to 310 degrees at that point because remember water breaks down sugar so it's safe to add a couple more tablespoons of water to thin out your mission how do you make it grow what is your Jolly Ranchers sour me I'm glad you asked it is a video on my channel that I did some candy grapes but all I mix is and here are a few of my colors I do something a little different I mix Jolly Ranchers and sanding sugar and citric acid into this mix okay the center assets you can order offline you can get at your local Walmart and actually this is just a total mix of pictured ethic and sugar I mixed the citric acid and sugar I do have up in half so this is gonna be very sour and sweet and then I just spread them into my Jolly Rancher mix okay so that's Jolly Rancher mix grind it up playing a full full processor or blender standard sugar your citric acid and a little bit of sugar shake it up and wallah now I gotta break this up but I have green blue orange and yellow and you can make whatever color you want to make with the Jolly Ranchers and all I did was took some took a few tablespoons and mix this together to just blend it all together all right so this is actually like a sour mix and if you don't want it to be soft where you don't have to add the citric acid okay to blend to blend down the four grind up the Jolly Ranchers you can use a food processor or a blender and once you grind down the Jolly Ranchers and I want to you I unwrapped $25 Ranchers and mix them into the blender so you can do more or whatever you choose depending on how big your blender is I use the hand blender so I counted out 25 so I wouldn't tear up my blender thank you can you also use this Jolly Rancher mix on candy apples yes you sure can long as the candy long as your candy apples like you like you do with sand and sugar I will take my Apple put it over the heat let some heat boil or what-have-you put your Apple right over there the steam from the pot let your apples get sticky and then you can just dip your apples into a bowl of the Jolly Rancher mix and you can coat it that way now I don't know who long eat that have a police um buddy gotta really have a good dentist they were good Dennis plan to be eating that Apple end of Jolly Ranchers on them on that Apple alright alright so I'm there checking your thermometer put it in a glass container with water okay [Music] and I just want you to take a look at how your mixture turns brown okay so I'm gonna use two of these sticks for my strawberries piercing right at the top okay you don't have to go all the way through not normally I take the leaves off okay I'm not trying to burn my fingertips trying to hold the leaves while I dip them I take them off okay all right so this is the original way to coat for the candy strawberry if you just to coat it with just the mixture all right you can flavor the mixture if you like I'm just gonna scrape that there okay so as you see here now I'm going to also show you flavoring at the end it's not a problem it's going to bubble a little bit if it's smoked that's fine just mix it in there you can see the smoke come up don't be a line let it settle all right and you can also add your flavor around to 200 to 250 I'm just showing you all the difference of what the outcome would be if you forget to add your flavor once again taking your sticks piercing them into your strawberry now this time I'm going to add a little bit of red this is a super red by Chef Masters just adding one drop okay you do not have to add white okay unless you want your candy strawberries to be a solid color all right so if you ever seen candy strawberries and you can still see through the candy and it looks really really pretty this is the way to do it just don't add white just add the red color all right it's gonna look transparent and that's the look you want if you want the red delicious candy strawberry tilting your pot dipping it right in coming out kind of Kitsch step okay I'm going to sit this down and i'ma show you in a few all right now with this strawberry I'm going to dip into the Jolly Rancher mix let that drizzle off I know I'm definitely not gonna put my hand behind there so you can see okay you want to dip in your mix just dip into the mix s oh all right and that's how you make your candy strawberries pretty cool huh also leave a comment in the comment section if you have done this before you left your leaves on would you rather leave your leaves on or take them off my preference is take them off okay then I'll show you all of them in a few there's some that off strain it to mix okay these are fairly large strawberries I've got my strawberries from Sam's Club I always like to aim for the bigger strawberries the bigger the better and this one I'm just going to dip originally and that's why I feel is so much better and safer to have longer sticks to dip your strawberries with all right very pretty vibrant now if you want it to look solid then you add white but this is how you would do that classic red candy strawberry okay just sit it down onto a silicon mat and then this is the original just original dip strawberry right into the sugar nothing at it you can add flavor but it doesn't have no color it's just the candied mix okay so this is the original and this is the original classic red okay and remember they do not last long okay it all look very pretty and there you have your candy strawberries any questions you can't reheat this mix just pay attention that you don't overheat okay did you see it slowly getting a little thick let me just turn it up you want to turn your stove on low to just heat it up a little bit to continue to dip okay but to remember to pet that strawberry completely dry before dipping okay so you see the mix heating back up just takes a few minutes for it to get so then out once it has the net [Music] let me just go in and do [Music] [Music] and don't reheat it too long it just takes a few minutes if it if you reheat it longer than that it goes into a taffy so remember you're working with a homemade hot mix okay just sit that down all right to clean out your pot just add you a cup of water bringing it over the level you want to put enough water in there where it goes over level of the candy mixture and just boil it out until it comes a liquid form and you are good you are set with your mixture and just clean out your pot but there you have your candied strawberries okay so I'll take a few questions before I sign out you welcome I hope you all are enjoying this series I think you all are if you're not following me on my social media I am on Facebook your sweet connection also my Instagram is your sweet connect okay go ahead and follow me if you new to my channel don't forget to subscribe and hit that notification builder let you know some great videos is about to come on and girl you know raw was about to come and give you life for show alright excuse the interruptions earlier that's the thing about going live but can I cut one in half I sure can there you go remember the tire candy hmm got me smacking okay there you go hmm someone asked can they do cherries I wouldn't do cherries and I'm really I'm really here to educate y'all to let y'all know everything cannot be dipped in candy mixture the lifespan does not last long so if you're looking to do like a pop-up shop and you're trying to get them up out of there you selling the same day they need to come and pick them up that day or within two to three days okay I did my daughter's pink party and I did candy grapes and they fell in love with them which the high schoolers always do and they ate them that same day you know they got up the next day looking for him but remember fresh fruit whether it's plums peaches they were peaches gotta look more tough skin but plums grapes strawberries they're fresh fruit so cherries yeah I mean you can dip them but just know they're not gonna last exactly someone said now I see why you say who gonna eat the apple with the candy mixture it's hard yeah you put hard candy on top of hard candy keep in mind this is a home made mixture things are a little different when you make it homemade you can store them in your refrigerator for them to last up until the time that your customers or your family who ever come and get them how would I price them it varies by these strawberries being as big as they are I do three of these for five dollars they're huge okay and it depends on your area okay some may sell a little more for five dollars that makes sell six for five dollars but that's how we price them so just keep in mind what may work in my area may not what mark is in my area may not market in your area so pricing is a little different over brought abroad just could I do fruity pebbles alright cereal on candy Chattanooga has everybody okay someone eggs how do you package these you can package them and whatever clear container you can put them in cupcake liners and put them in a cupcake container and put them in a refrigerator it depends on the packaging that you choose to put them in depending on the size of the strawberries but me per say I will probably put them in a cupcake container or there's a container that I did do my strawberries in that fits like four in the container I will leave that link in the description box below check out that link and they're good to hold strawberries it's a clear container just put them in and sell them in that container oh my goodness candy peaches we'll see no I do not leave the sticks in at all nope I do not need the sticks in so you don't need to stick then they come right out as you see okay no I do not leave the sticks in check them out please don't settle with the sticks

My name is Matt and today we are ranking grandma's hard candies. We got them from a real grandma. She wasn't looking and\nwe raided her pantry and stole all of her hard candies. We did not do that. If there's a grandma out\nthere that's missing candy right now I'm sorry it wasn't us. I was just joking. (upbeat country music) Matt's gonna wrap. Not in a R-A-P way a W-R-A-P way. This is gonna get noisy in here. (wood taps) Here's how it works. So things we're looking for. Obviously taste cause it's candy. Appearance that's kind of important. You don't wanna put anything\ngross in your mouth. Also like how long does it last? It's hard candy. It should last a long time. So this Bless Your Rank is all about of course grandma's candy, but really more specifically\nthis is the kind of stuff that grandma might sneak you a piece of while you were in church. Or if you had a grandma like I did she probably would just quietly unwrap it and hand it you cause she\nknew you would manage to make that wrapper louder than the pastor. I wasn't trusted with a\nlot things as a child. But now I can just be as loud as I want to with these wrappers. How about that? Number one. The I don't know what you call these. These are just the little\nstrawberry candies. I don't think they have an official name. The get a bad rep. People like to trash\nthese strawberry things and say they're not really\ngood and they're cheap candy, but they have this like soft gush strawberry gel on the inside. It's like a bonus candy. It's like candy inception. Candy within a candy. This isn't as sweet as I\nremember it being as a kid. Also double wrapper for some reason. They just really out\nto get the environment. Taste right now like\nsome weird piece of candy that barely has any sugar in it and absolutely no\nstrawberry favor whatsoever. This is a huge let down. I remember these as a kid just like killing it with some strawberry flavor. I'm not getting any of that. I'm gone bite into it now. There's the strawberry flavor. It was hiding inside of it the whole time. Now we're finishing off pretty well. It was a really good ride. Exiting to the gift shop now. I like it. Grandma hand me one of these at church I'd probably be like\ngrandma what else you got? I think you can probably\ndo better than that. Do you have like a tootsie\npop in there somewhere. Even a dum dum that you got from the bank. They're OK. They're good once you bite into them, outside not that great. Grandma maybe keep these in your purse just in case you're craving mediocrity. Gonna put in on the doily here currently in first place. Our next competitor. Peppermints. The original hard candy. It's stuck. (wood taps) Alright there we go. These are the hard peppermints. These are not soft peppermints. Grandma wouldn't have those. You never know when she's\ngonna have her teeth in or not. These are good peppermints. Strong on the pepper mint. I mean I know what a peppermint was like, but see there's a lot of different types of peppermint out there. You don't really know what\nyou're getting sometimes. Maybe that's something that\npresidential candidates should look at becoming\npart of their platform is that you correctly label peppermints. Is it soft or hard peppermints\nto avoid confusion. If you agree with me, then you use the hashtag\nregulate peppermint industry now. This is a traditional peppermint. This is what you think of\ngetting is a hard peppermint. It's really good. It tastes like a candy\ncane which is exactly what a peppermint should be. This is more like a paw paw\nwould have these in his pocket though I think. Beware though. They may come from his last trip he took to Sonic Drive In in 1997. Alright so I'm looking at taste. Peppermint was good all the way through. Appearance? I mean what do you not love\nabout the strawberry thing? I'm a take a gamble and I'm\ngonna go for the strawberry cause I know what the potential is then. The potential is very high. Peppermint's a good\nstandby, it's a classic, it will never let you down,\nyou know what you're getting. But I know that we can do better. Contestant number three is oh no. This is black liquorice. What are y'all trying to do to me? Don't make me do this. (groans) I've got news for you. If this is your grandma's hard candy, you're grandma is the devil. I'm sorry. This isn't even candy. Isn't like, legit liquorice, like a root that you found in the dirt? Candy is not from the dirt. Candy comes from heaven\nor the Wonka factory. Aw man. Can we just fake it? Like mmm but not very good. Blah blah blah last place. Ew. This is what I imagine like taking a bite out of a dog turd is like. So many flavors and none of them are good. It's like it's punching me in the throat. Like karate kicking me to death. It's like it's effecting\nthe way I breathe. Like I can taste it in my breath now. (groans) I have absolutely nothing\ngood to say about this. This is a waste of space. I'm sure it came in a wrapper\nand it's a waste of that. This is terrible. If you are in church you're\nlike grandma what do you got, you got any candy, and she hands you a\nhandful of black liquorice go to the alter immediately\nand pray for grandma's soul cause it's gone. Where do I wanna rate this? This is without a doubt the worst thing that I'll have today. Not just today but ever,\never, on Bless Your Rank. Dead last. Contestant number four\nis cinnamon hard candies. Of course obviously cause you can read it right here on the wrapper. So to our three fans in Japan, and I'm probably off by\nthree meaning we have none, there you go. This is a little tribute to you with the cinnamon hard candies. My least favorite chewing gum is Big Red and this is I imagine is\ngonna be right up that alley. That's not candy. That's not fun. I like spicy things. Hot food, spicy food, I love cajun food when\nit's like super spicy, but I don't want my candy like that. There's a line. For the love of me I can't\neven open this wrapper! Alright so much for that. It's like a peppermint that's\njust gone just all red. This is a communist peppermint. That's not overwhelmingly cinnamony. It's not bad. I'm kind of a fan. Lot's of flavors. It's getting a little\nspicy, coming back down, getting a little spicy, coming back down. (upbeat music) Not as much cinnamon as like Big Red Gum. This is not bad. Whoa! Can't talk a lot with it in your mouth. You got a grandma that\nhands you these in church you got a spicy grandma. That was grandma that had\na little bit too much fun at the bingo hall on Saturday night and she's in church Sunday morning kinda nursing a hangover\nand is also like here and she will hand you one of these after she accidentally\nhanded you one of her pills. Where do they rank? They're still not better\nthan strawberry candies and I don't think that\nthey're really better than peppermints either so I'm\ngonna go ahead and just say third place cause as I've said before nothing is worse than black liquorice. Contestant number five. Werther's Originals. I love these. Maybe I'm a grandma. I don't know. They are delicious and\nthis is something that I definitely had at my\ngreat grandparents house. I feel like there was an old man at church when I was at church that had these too. I may have just been imagining things. Mr. Werther, can I have\none of your originals? And then he's like yes you can son and he pulls out like a handful of them. Take as many as you want. Thanks Mr. Werther. Here we go. (laughs) A little difficult to get\nout the wrapper there. This taste like grandma\nand grandpa's house. Like distant banjo going\non, you hear birds chirping, and you're just kinda\nrocking back and forth. That's what this tastes like right now. It's like a caramely cream. These are so good. This is gold standard. Pun intended. I mean this is like if you ask\ngrandma for a piece of candy and she pulls out one of these originals, your grandma has a good\ntaste in candy number one, number two grandma just got\nher social security check so she's affording the good candy, and three just grandma loves you. That's what that means. This is as good as grandma\nhard candy gets maybe. I don't know. There's more to rank so we'll see. This is so much better\nthan strawberry candy. It's not even close. Contestant number six. Oh Tootsie Rolls! Cotton candy, sweeties, go. Let me see the Tootsie Rolls. Fun fact about Tootsie Rolls. They haven't made any sine 1978, but I believe there might be\nsomething to the fact that grandmas are given a certain\namount of Tootsie Rolls and they can't go on to heaven until they've handed out all the Tootsie Rolls. Here we go. Now that looks like chocolate. That looks like a hunk\nof chocolate right there. This is good candy and\nthis is candy's evil twin. Grandma hands you one of these at church grandma's playing a prank on you. You're definitely gone get\nthis stuck all in your teeth. This is my teeth isn't it? I feel like it's in my teeth. I'm quite the butter finger. (laughs) Holy crap! Do you ever finish chewing this? I love Tootsie Roll but this\nis not good for my teeth. In conclusion, Tootsie Rolls are delicious but they are really going\nto mess up your smile in a heartbeat. Also why are there so many of them? We as humans are outnumbered\non Earth right now three to one by Tootsie Rolls. Contestant number one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. It is unmarked yellow candy. What are these? - [Producer] Butterscotch. - Butterscotch candies. I don't know what to expect with these. I don't even know what they look like. If I saw a bowl of these sitting out, I would think that's like\na medicine for a dog. They spend all their money\non protective packaging for this candy and not the candy at all. Yeah this is like a\nyellow peppermint kind of. I like this. And there goes the flavor. Didn't last long. Short little visit. Yeah this was like at first I\nthought this was pretty good, but I could do with\nnever having one again. This is like showing a red pill blue pill. Like you don't know if you want the red candy or yellow candy. Both will be very mediocre. At first little bit I was\nlike it's not terrible. I kinda like it. And then it's like it's\ndoing nothing for me anymore. It's like a terrible relationship. It was really fun at the start and now it's just like it's a chore. I don't see these definitely not better that Werther's Originals, not\nbetter than the strawberries, I am gonna say that they're\nbetter than the Tootsie Rolls. I'm gonna say that currently\nthese are in fourth place. Let's move the devil's candy down and then make some room here for unnamed butterscotch candies. Our final competitor\ncontestant number eight is Andes Mints. This is the chocolate and the mint. This is like a mint sandwich\nwith chocolate and then mint and more chocolate. I love the smell, I love\neverything about these. These are so good. Here we go. Aw man. These are a treat. I don't ever have these. Can you buy these? Granny stole some of the Andes Mints from the Olive Garden again. That's exactly what she did. Man these are good and these are all mine. I got a whole bowl of them now. I've never had this happen in my life. I don't know where these come from. Can you get these at Wal Mart? I'm a have another. I'm a do it. I'm a do it. It's the last one of the day. I'm a do it. Shout out to the Andes wherever that is. If you are a place, if you\nwere just a guy named Andy, I don't know, but keep\nup the good work Andy. And if you're grandma hands out these, congratulations you've got the greatest grandma in the world. (sighs) This is one of the\nclosest Bless Your Ranks I think that we've ever\nhad and I'm trying to think of all of them right now. And this could almost be a tie, but we don't do ties on Bless Your Rank because ties are for little\nleague sports and communists. This is America. This is Bless Your Rank\nand Werther's Originals is the best of grandma's hard candies. It's the best of grandma's hard candies and it's one of the best\nhard candies period. Like name a better hard candy. I'm to just go ahead and take\nall of these with me here. \u266a Werther's Originals is a taste of home \u266a \u266a Grandma and grandpa's house \u266a \u266a Something that rhymes with home \u266a Don't tell grandma.

Smith here and today we're going to be reviewing the heavy hitters cannabis infused gummies we have strawberry pineapple to try today we're actually very excited to try these uh if you don't know already heavy-hitters is possibly our favorite brand I would definitely say I would say it's also primarily smoke heavy hitters for our everyday cartridge and then when we want to like it up a little bit we'll grab some other stuff but heavy hitters is definitely always on a cartridge for us so we're also going to be trying the heavy hares GSC I say trying we've had it many times but we haven't been able to find it for a while not what you are it kind of it kind of went out of stock just weird it used to be available a lot in like 2018 but it kind of just fell out of favor except for certain places would still carry a guy in town by our main delivery service was no longer carrying it but they had it the other day so I had to pick it up cause it's been too long it seems like they almost haven't had it in stock since the name change so JSC used to be Girl Scout cookies I don't know if they changed it in others stances I'm pretty sure it was part of the laws that happened I'm pretty sure it's part of the laws that happened in 2018 for California that's they weren't allowed to call it they can't call it candy I believe they can't use the term candy and they can't use the term anything that could be marketed yes towards children can't market towards children right Paul any so that's why it says gummies or it'll always seem medical or cannabis like that they never never make yeah that would be appealing to a child exactly it can't be bears or anything like that so I mean it's a good law honestly I totally understand why there's some other laws that happened in 2018 which I will give you a refresher on right now now there was some weird stuff that happened when California passed a recreational marijuana back in 2018 I believe it was one of the things that happen is towards the middle of the year they actually switched it to where edibles could no longer contain more than a hundred milligrams per package now if you work in the medical marijuana industry or if you were a user or anything like that prior you know that there used to be packages up to a thousand milligrams in just one treat and what that used to be really good at is you could like just take a nibble off of a treat throughout the day and just kind of keep yourself dosed and medicated off one treat for a whole week basically but they changed it because there were way too many people who would come into a dispensary have no idea what they were doing by one of those really high potency edibles eat the whole thing and then they have a really bad time and end up going to the emergency room they got sick of dealing with that so they made a law saying you can't have more than a hundred milligrams per package there are certain things you can get around that such as cannabutter tinctures and pills those three items you can definitely get in higher doses than 100 milligrams but for edibles and then kind of cookie or anything like that max you're gonna get in a package is about a hundred so today we're reviewing B's from heavy hitters and the way they went about with these twenty milligrams per piece is you can actually rip the pieces in half so it's actually two servings per piece so it actually comes in two to ten milligram servings which I'm pretty sure is the law is that each piece inside a package can only be ten milligrams or something like that I know five to ten milligrams is a state recommended serving I'm not a hundred percent clear on the laws but it's just an unfortunate thing that happened with edibles in 2018 but I am absolutely dying to try these guns so let's go ahead and open up to the [ __ ] strawberry cuz I'm Joey it's been it's been a long time looking for out that let me grab the a7 r3 with the 70s [Music] [Music] yeah we just won't have us we won't help you all this video it's just not working at the moment six and a half hours Nathan I might open the pineapple real quick to maybe these do not open well I feel like we should show just how much of a struggle these were to open just like a montage of the [ __ ] difficulty this is bad this one opened much easier but that first package it just ripped in such a way that it was really hard to open but this is just like the other one has a really strong smell I figured it's it's really strong artificial pineapple mmm it's it's kind of a a bit herbal but not like too herbal it's not like overly pungent or anything like that like you're not gonna have you're not gonna get in trouble they're just keeping these in your drawer or anything like that like no one's gonna smell it yeah I don't know if this has any actual like pineapple juice or anything in it it doesn't have it listed on the ingredients mm-hmm so we're not sure if this is artificial flavoring or real bad no artificial actual coloring and flavor so is that natural flavors that display really use the natural coloring and flavor like or is it a flavor that's kind of that's kind of weird I don't know if I feel someone from heavy Harry's modified food yeah I don't mind it I mean that's just what I mean the people are heavy hitters you might want to put that it is natural flavoring as well like actually specified natural color and natural flavoring because natural color and flavoring just sounds a bit odd it's it leaves it up to the imagination as to is the flavoring also natural or just natural color you're always a nice flavoring this yeah always alright so let's try the pineapple yeah I'm gonna do a full 20 but I'm gonna show the camera how it splits so this is the gummies from heavy-hitters it's a square and if you look very carefully there's this little seam in the middle that if you pull whoops it starts to come apart yes it does if you start to pull it comes apart very nicely into two perfectly even ten milligram pieces so let's start well I'm actually just gonna eat the whole thing at once wait so where's our list of like criteria so I know what the hell I'm supposed to be doing bring it up go on top down your mouth and just roll around a little okay yeah my hands are all sticky now you know I gotta say I'm a little disappointed I'm a little underwhelmed actually I had I had much higher hopes it could just be the pineapple yeah because I mean the strawberry definitely smells better than the pineapple the pineapple is a little strong it's kind of it's very herbal forward which isn't a bad thing a lot of people enjoy that it's not a bad flavor necessarily but it is definitely herbal forward if you're looking for something that you could just totally mound shun and forget that there's weed in it not that we recommend it's not gonna be that yeah definitely don't recommend that but I mean like if you're if you're a fan of someone who like Eric or someone who likes really really flavorful very liked gummies that don't aren't bitter or plant alike at all this is not for you this is made to be strong and to be potent and it definitely tastes like it so keep that in mind and next up we have the strawberry so let's go ahead and pop these open and yeah will rate them in a second let's try the strawberry and I want to go ahead and split this one yeah because there'll be 30 milligrams each mmm much better much better mm-hmm all right strawberry is actually really good um I would say it's definitely pretty it is still has that herbal flavor but um let me bring up the criteria so we can actually start to break these down aftertaste yeah yeah really bad yeah I would say it's a bit odd I I'm almost feeling a little bit um disappointed I know me too it which it sucks because I'm such a fan of their oils but that's where comes in would we be as disappointed if we hadn't hyping it up so much yeah we did we we've also we've held on to these for about two weeks we've been waiting and waiting and waiting to try these specifically for the on camera experience and you know I think that also kind of built it up the fact that we've been we've been like dying sitting on me dying to try them the whole time and I mean they're they're good [ __ ] effects for sure by new user mm-hmm will probably like would probably really like it however its strong grams each heavy hitters recommends 10 milligrams as a dose the state of California recommends that california recommends that I personally have very low tolerance when it comes to most things so if you're like me I would definitely recommend starting with 5 milligrams when it comes to edibles but I mean you've been doing it you've been using medical using marijuana medically for two years yes so her tolerance is pretty high so we can handle the 30 we just say no problem but the big thing is though from let's let's go ahead and actually break this down but the main thing that I'm getting from these is but from trying both of them it is quite herbal forward the the flavor is there the strawberry is much sweeter and more flavorful I would say than the pineapple pineapple is a little more herbal forward as well but let's actually start talking about our rating categories here and give these are actually solid score each [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] we're also gonna open this GSC previously known as Girl Scout cookies for those of you have been in the game a little longer and actually know the OG strings we're gonna be trying that card out today so anyways hope to catch you all later and see you in the next video like and subscribe [Music]", "BhBnkbvzuCI": "[Music] so [Music] 308 it is 308 extra trees what's the temper of the table we got uh between 100 and 110 what's on the other side the other side of the table 104 one same it's like 100 between 100 and 110 okay do you know what it was last time cold it was like 98 oh yeah and it cooled off really fast yeah so this time should be better yeah it's trying to be a little bit better we've got everything i guess hey sure i am watch your head oh screw this on the other side and the ball's not over there oh that's not important i'll do my best [Applause] that's good watch they're going to be perfectly even i'm going to feel kind of done with the air i'm just kidding i feel dumb it smells super banana right put a whole hand of bananas in here it already smells very behind me whoa gloves are going to smell bananas [Music] that's it you already put it all in i should have wished i missed it how many shots you have to put into that 1.75 and then max putting in seven and a half seven and a half yeah i guess that's why it's not as strong over here wonder why i totally smell strawberry yeah no i feel like it's not as strong as a banana which i feel like is extra strong well you know one of the one of the flavorings is twice as strong as the other one yeah i still smell strawberry though it's pretty well you guys haven't tried it yet have you joe did you try basically i had a piece yeah yeah how was it it's good nice juxtaposition flavors well balanced as all things should be we should take a temperature reading between the two and the kettles yeah i mean you gotta assume that the other one on the main stove is cooler but i mean warmer yeah i don't know for sure yeah oh that's cool yeah i'm pretty sure this one's colder yeah yeah i mean it'd be nice to have that on all this so is the the bottom of that double boiler not quite as warm as the stove then well it's that and um we lift this off and move it and that's still sitting on the cut the cast iron ring over there which holds a lot of heat yeah and uh the conductivity of copper is really really it's the most conductive metal so it cools off the fastest so when we take it off that and move it to there it's going to cool off quite a bit yeah by at least like one or two degrees i mean i don't want to get too difficult according to my calculations it's like 3.7 oh exactly every time oh wow no wonder we're having so many cooling problems do you believe me yes very believable oh what calculation stinking spoons that'll do you perfect [Music] do you guys think it is uh evenly split or uh not really probably no one's sure if they just just took more time to fill out and that's actually going to get there this if you look at that i think the table is not quite level because this end is usually thicker it's actually so i guess you guys could invest in like a scale to put underneath to make sure it's always well that's not that important also i guess you would also have to know how much the other one weighs because it's not always going to be the exact same yeah we could like fill this up dump out like exactly half of how much we put in and then mark the kettle but even that and the kettles are different weights too you have to take that into account it's a whole thing is it a whole thing or a whole kitten caboodle i like being alone it's fine just uh come out when you need a hug we'll find terry for you we know how much she loves giving hugs the people who don't know my mom that well because they don't know in real life i've seen my mom reject hugs from family members yep can you count them all oh no like i i've seen i've seen people ask my mom for a hug and my mind goes no [Music] she doesn't really dance around it just goes no yeah we mcdonald's we got pretty good at saying no [Music] um your kingdom look looks good yeah are all your loyal subjects doing your dirty work well i could still uh just bring this off but you're just bringing off stuff that looks clear so you can't really what to see much of anything oh you might be able to see it you see that one line disappear yeah cooled off a little bit but it's way better than it was before yeah yeah last time it was just i could see how cold it was even even me the guy who doesn't make any candy and his eyes are closed all the time yeah that sounds cold the last one actually did sound really cold though yeah you like you picked it up and you put it down the table is like yeah that one's coming together a little bit watch max open up i guess they can i almost said openers but he doesn't really want to use it i got to tell you okay have you ever did you ever play with legos when you were a kid never never ever not even your house with you yeah so so you wouldn't understand no do you know like it's like the gray piece and like you click it on it's got the two pieces you click it onto a piece and then you can bend it to get them up yes i never even used that thing like i i can't listen are they really yeah that's just not right lego i'm disappointed in you yeah remember those giant legos the what do they go clothes lego yeah oh sure he just loves building with him right next to the train set you know i guess wood it's kind of like legos for adults wood yeah yeah just make whatever you want although legos are also legos for adults dude i'm telling you every year for christmas i'm like well i hope there's a lot guys yeah logos are awesome yeah that was like my thing when i was growing up and uh i was subscribed to lego magazine same here yeah did you get the bionicles uh comic uh yeah i got a couple of them yeah yeah and i was trying to i think i remember telling my sisters and my parents that my animals because i was like they wouldn't it wouldn't say bionicle on here if it wasn't a word oh boy show me show me in the dictionary define bionicle these robot things it's a nickel that's made out of bios wow okay so just a heads up joe this this next batch the corn syrup is pretty soft so what's up the corn syrup oh yeah i don't know if that'll have an effect does temperature have much to do with that or that's humidity i think yeah but we've had some batches that are like wicked wicked soft and other batches that are you know you get the water really cold yeah yeah nice and icy and um i don't know if you guys do but i like to shake the excess water off too because sometimes you get more water on your hands or yeah for real yeah when it's sticky i put more water on my hands if um if you have too much water you form a layer in here and then that'll like eat away at the the invert yeah oh yeah yeah yeah yep all right so in one of the last videos that we posted somebody commented wait so putting water in your hands makes the corn syrup not stick to you but then you put water on the candy to make it stick to the candy yeah and they said how does that work i said magic we can put uh the kettle over there that we do for the banana and the lemonade that we usually do you can put water in that pour the candy before it's hardened into there and it won't stick to the copper kettle right this is madness joe it is madness water how does it work absolutely nothing who needs one again water's overrated it's about electrolytes it's what plants crave it's great all right i'll be back you guessing my age yeah i could never remember i know that you're always a few months younger than me and i'm 48.48 what am i younger than my dad yeah hey dad you got five bucks yes we'll give it to you later yeah this seems a little bit warmer than the last this is a little warmer than last time i was going to start with my caramel here oh i'm calling for a new carpal stirrer more sugar in candy this is the broccoli sugar so don't oh my god did you as soon as it touched it was like yep let's go find a scoop wow got even lighter hey steve hey how you doing buddy good you need a hammer yeah i got a little piece stuck on here how could i tell i because of the way it is oh that looks nice [Music] do you know why we hit the hook with the hammer why the vibration loosens it from the hook oh cool wow isn't that amazing i learned that from from the old country the science guy he will not be denied you've been in that room too long buddy humans i remember talking is it coming off no it's still stuck there come on steve work your hammer man i thought you were worthy okay little joe's getting tired dad yeah it's still warm it's a good color i'm thinking tired i got this i could do this all day long and that side [Music] there it goes i think you got it all right good you know one more one more [Music] oh i got a little bit huh so close [Music] that's not too much so are they about the same temperature oh no this one's a little warmer remember when we were pouring these out yeah and i said uh let's dump a little more i shouldn't have said that no they're about same size oh yeah if you kind of squint at it and turn the lights down they're like the exact same size yeah turn the lights off yes close your head you better turn a little less just believe what you want [Music] to switch for this one sure what do you mean you want to pull this one this up extra banana just the way we planned it get your hands up all i can hear in my head was get your fingers off of my butterfinger we'll probably put it up on top of this if you need it go back a little bit further i would i wouldn't put a lot of it but the bottoms would so yeah this thing's plastic yeah [Music] what do you think it does seem a little more strawberry right yeah yeah because it's a little bit cute yeah it just like pops a little bit differently yeah because a little see-through it seems almost like strawberry jelly is there anybody in the planet who doesn't like a piece of toast with some butter and jelly on it like strawberry jelly specifically not something that i ever eat but still delicious did this uh hmm that color difference it's not too different or it could just be the first couple pulls cause you know the car will change a tiny bit yeah uh when i make candy we have been going like every other like i'll first i'll throw it on the hook and then i'll oh yeah he didn't do all the hard work yeah yeah i see what you did there i understand i i am almost 30. yeah we had a lot of youngins next that's it he's only 30 since he's 26. right i've been almost 30 for 15 years dude when i was your age i was almost 40. all right so back off yeah i should be a little bit more understanding well when i was 40 i was 50. oh that he's been 40 and he's not even 30 yet yeah yeah you almost have two friends named bill and ted yes i'm going to pretend like i i i get i get it so like i've never seen that movie huh yeah where do you meet him um they're at a different school you have a girlfriend kevin yesterday [Music] so but people have asked us many times before where they get a candy cutter like that and we usually answer it saying if you find out please let us know because we don't know we just basically inherited these i think that they have friends yeah steve says we just talked about this yesterday because we made ken yesterday he said he always keeps an eye out for those things on the market the last time he saw one six years ago oh yeah he hasn't seen anything that's not burning yeah i mean i guess if you're if you're good with metal you could make one i'm sure i mean it's just like hinges and blades i don't know metal stuff but blades yeah i mean if you can fabricate i mean i'm sure that you can figure out most of anything it's not exactly like a modern model no different book dude you tape like six kitchen knives together you can make one of these at home and you can buy those from them like custom with like as many blades as you want different size spacers they've got those things where they mounted them on a like a table with a motor and they just kind of like push this whole giant tray through oh man it's an accident waiting to happen it's all it's like you know it's an industrial candy setting so they've got it all all the safety precautions in place most of them yeah it's it's pretty safe after like the 37 things that got caught up yeah we should put a guard on that imagine like going to work and you just ask your boss like so is that pretty safe like yeah so is that pretty safe oh so your birthday's coming up huh hmm you ever had banana ice cream uh made out of bananas made out of bananas yeah just frozen bananas blended yeah it kind of makes like a big cream okay but i don't know if i'm gonna eat ice cream bread yeah well yeah because if i'm gonna have ice cream i wanna have like cookie dough or oreo or peanut butter and chocolate i'm a stalker for strawberry ice cream i mean yeah like if someone offered to cover i'm not gonna i'm not gonna deny it yeah that's not my favorite choice yeah see i do like ice cream but i'm not much for like cookies and cream and all that well this is coming someone who doesn't like sweets you know what do you know about sweets yeah a little bit i've had ice cream before did this get smaller a little yeah i think it doesn't do that correct i think the heat might have melted it oh okay yeah yep oh can you see what you're doing real quick dad no no this is also a table too huh what's the temperature of the caramel 190. oh wow it's also because obviously that doesn't have to get tempered so it goes through the funnel right so it has to be like pretty hot to go through with them yeah cool stuff have fun brush turtles hey craig i'm not really sure that these are that sharp we just quickly yeah i'll give you a scale of one to ten how sharp i think it is the louder you scream the sharper i guess i'll take this this almost looks like um the first batch almost looks like a cheesecake-ish kind of color yeah see i i think they both kind of look cheesecakey yeah this one's definitely not good yeah it'd be a good color for the strawberry cheesecake though yeah yeah strawberry cheesecake i think would be great flavor like my mama i know was threatening to do cheesecake of all different types of pumpkin cheesecake yeah well i was just saying i think that would be good i figured the pumpkin flavoring was like the pumpkin mix or whatever i think that's why we don't want to do it outside of the season because we can't buy more pumpkin spice right but uh but yeah those were all really good yeah i think you know everybody knows that i'm not the biggest fan of chocolate but cinnamon over chocolate do it good work kids try our best strawberry first i flipped it over and got the banana that's kind of cool that like it's like a sandwich where if you eat it upside down tastes like a different salad i was afraid i was only going to get bananas because i just ate three bananas maybe we should try the fancy connection here well i cleansed my palette first by standing on my head that's yeah i i just read an article about that that gets all the blood out of your tongue totally works well you gotta stand up really fast oh is that how you do it so what do you have to do like a handstand to a flip or like you just get up really fast and then a somersault you've done an arab fast in a plie yep you do that right mm-hmm i'm gonna say this is a good combo yeah i um viewers or subscribers ideas do strawberry banana yeah yeah i had never heard of this flavor combination a few of them asked but max kept whining or whining i couldn't take it anymore well you wouldn't let me throw away the banana flavor i just had to stare at it didn't i get new banana flavor yeah but the old one smells really good too take it home with you okay i'll put it in my car there you go banana bread it's just flavors flavors it works good in the radiator oh does it hey it is glycol based is it's good in the radiator yeah i mean my regular antifreeze tastes pretty good so very sweet right right right blue is sure a little more sweetness i just put gatorade in mine build up a tolerance no one will ever get me but you know every time somebody's trying for very professional taste duster yeah i already gave it 10 vegans yeah wow 10 whole vegans and i think steve's giving it an 11. oh yeah well he was only giving it one thumb up yeah he definitely gives it two okay i like that's eight out of eight vegans yeah so max it was a good call on your part are you happy now yes were you happy before yes okay good so so what we did here didn't really change anything for you all right this is going to go on forever hey guys littlejoe here reminding you to like the videos and subscribe you", "GopidLYktQA": "and in our Health Alert tonight nine students in Florida hospitalized after eating marijuana infused candy apparently a student inadvertently brought the THC candy to school mistaking the product for a popular sour candy our chief health editor dr. partha nany joins us now with more on what happened and how those kids are doing now doc thanks Alan well first of all the students injuries were not life-threatening the kids were between ages 10 and 12 and were sent to the ER because they were having stomach pains but this is still a warning for parents who have edible marijuana products in their home if the packaging and the candy or treat inside resembles any products that kids are familiar with then they're more likely to see it as normal food and be tempted to eat it unfortunately these types of accidental poisonings are on the rise so dr. nany why does food prompt more overdose incidents well Glenda edibles often have several times the recommended dose of THC now t-h-e is this psychoactive ingredient in marijuana yet the edibles take a longer time to kick it me that you won't feel the effects right away so oftentimes people end up eating even more of the drug as for kids they can experience severe effects like trouble breathing loss of coordination altered perceptions panic paranoia and heart problems all bad things all bad things for sure doc so when kids overdose what are the long-term effects super important question Alan and honestly I don't have a good answer for you because acute marijuana exposure on children has not been systematically studied so there's no research or science findings regarding the full effects so it's super important that anyone who has kids in their homes keep edibles and all types of marijuana products out of reach and out of sight they should also be kept in child resistant packaging that also contains the the way so that it seals it conceals the contents rather so it can't be seen and please don't consumes the edibles in in front of the kids because we need to keep them safe we do dr. Nandi that's great advice thank you for joining us and if you a question or health concern for the good doctor email him dr. Nandi at ask dr. Nandi dot-com or send it to us on Facebook or Twitter we'll get it right to him", "lQ_d1FNelTQ": "okay and today's tutorial we're gonna be doing candid strawberries and I've been getting tons of requests for these so I figured I'd go ahead and make the video but I'm trying to make this video short sweet and to the point so you're gonna be just try there's of course one in one cup of sugar 1/4 cup of water 1/2 cup of kale Oh sir you know twist ties and your bamboo stores and these are going to go inside the strawberries I mean because you don't want that I came to get on your fingers opinions came back I know I don't but um as soon as I get all the ingredients into the pot I'll be back to show you also apply the sticks and twist ties ok now that I got my mix on the stove I'm gonna let it go to 300 just like you would do candy apples and I have my stove on between 6 and 7 okay you're gonna take your berries I'm gonna put the stories high s so you're gonna take two leaves just in your twist tie and you're just gonna twist it on and so so I do that this way because when I'm dipping I don't want the candy all on my arm skin or whatever that's not cute so you're taking when you dip them it'll be so much easier so we're gonna get all those stuck and twist tight on me take it put it back this time you just twist it on take it pull up take your twist I just twist it on okay I'm gonna get all those done Pope you're tired or whatever and I'll be back when my mic's reached 300 okay now that I have got all of them talked with the vampers doors and twist hide I'm waiting on my mixer reach 300 which is already almost at 300 but before I call that I want to give you the ingredients again because I think I said I'm wrong in the beginning but it's 1 and 1/2 cup of sugar 1/2 cup of Cairo and 1/4 cup of water and you can flavor it if you want to use the dreams of the Lorien flavor enormous or you can use just that I got from Walmart I mean so each is own it what you want to pay for yours with I mean you don't have to play with him at all when you remove it from the stove let it cool down for a second or two and then dip them like that but then you also can color them and if you want a color you're running niche or white base in order to get the color that you're going for or you can just dip it is like I said before but my mixes almost a 300 and as soon as it comes off the stove I'll be back ok now that my mix I'll cut off the stove I went on hit it and it my flavor in my extract but me and the instruments just like a banana yellow and I know y'all might be saying if I'm usable you know why I'm not doing yellow cuz I don't want to but I'm using a metallic color by Chef master it's a blue anything really pretty moon I'm just going to everything and with this I don't need you know white because I did them for my apples awhile I'll call a few weeks back and you really don't need white you don't need a lot as you can see see that blue color listen metallic calling me she's they're all completely okay and I'll be right back when I position is fun okay now we're gonna take a strawberry remember you already got yours get still pull it up and twist tie it so you don't have to worry about that and now we're going to take something we're going to dip it just as you would on a candy apple I'm gonna shake the excess flip it sit it okay I'm gonna do one more you can see take it shake it twirl it and flip it okay dip it take it shake it twirl it make sure you get all of it almost set it down and place it okay in y'all these do not hold up for long periods of time I mean if you looking to make these and you say you want to you know keep them up for like five six hours you know it's not gonna happen not even if you place them in a refrigerator the longest they have held up for me was for about an hour and a half other than that they start breaking down and it's just the way it is I don't know why I guess because I mean they're strawberries and you know they are already you know salt and they starts to break down thank God I got that paper though huh and you're gonna place it okay one more just yeah got it on mice twist tie thank God I can just cut it because I'm not gonna touch it into the cool down you know be careful cuz this candy is hot I don't know if I thought my hand was made of steel or what but that's it that's one you place it okay i'ma show you how to look as soon as I get all this out the way so I'll be back okay this is the finished product remember see I got this big bottle on the bottom in strawberries this is the same technique it's apples you don't want this you wanna dip as usual you want to shake Toro and hold upside down for few seconds so let it hor it and then you want to place it down then you have a bottle like this I like this but this is the same technique as candy apples nothing different about it we just use the strawberries instead of apples so if you liked the tutorial give it a like so

Hello, it's Emmy, welcome back, today I'm going to be making Tanghulu. And Tanghulu comes from China and it is a dessert that you can find from street vendors, and it's typically made with ha or Hawthorn fruit that look like little red crab apples that are skewered and Dipped into a sugar syrup that hardens and sets and it looks like resin, it's clear It's gorgeous. And then when you eat it, it has this great big crunchy crackle of sugary sweetness, and it sounds fantastic So Hawthorne fruit or ha is not really common here in the US, actually I've never seen it before, but I've seen alternate versions with fresh Strawberries, and now we're really coming in to fresh strawberry season here. My sons and I just went and picked them the other day so I have a basket of beautiful strawberries and I'm going to make a version using these So the first thing I'm going to do is get my sugar syrup going, it does take a while for the sugar to get to the right temperature (pans clatter) and get myself saucepan and a thermometer. Now, I have a spotty relationship when it comes to making Sugar syrups, if you want to see me fail a few times, you can check out the Dragon's beard video Put the links there, so we're going to be 1 cup of granulated sugar, 1/2 cup To that, we're gonna add 2/3 of a cup of water (Emmy makes a neeurp noise) so what we're going to do here is bring this up to a boil and evaporate a lot of the water I'm going to bring this all the way up to the hardball stage about 260 265 degrees and then we'll kill the heat and then coat our fruit. So it's important that your thermometer remains submerged So I'm going to double this recipe and I'm adding two cups of sugar and one and 1/3 cups of water So while my syrup is boiling I'm going to prepare the fruit So I'm gonna set this off to the siiiide Humanah Humanah I mean really Ya'll are beautiful. I'm just gonna take off  the little stem here So in Japan when you buy strawberries they come in little flats just little boxes and they're arranged like this with the little butts Pointing upwards. They're just so cute and irresistible. Next, we're going to skewer the strawberries. I've got a variety of sizes here My pot is pretty small. So I think I'm gonna opt to go for shorter skewers I think traditionally they use long skewers and they display them that way on the carts But they're also using large pans of syrup where they can just drip it on top of the fruit So, but I'll try both and see what happens This is after just a coffee stirrer and I used scissors to make a little point on there And I like the idea of using a flat because then the strawberry won't rotate as I I'm pouring syrup on there Cute So this size skewer I can have five I Think I'm just gonna stick with these tube sizes. Cause I like that Although I'm tempted to make the big one too, and we're almost there. We're at the hardball stage. We're at 263 Degrees, so the next step is to take our strawberries and we're going to pour the syrup on top and then set them aside on A tray that has been covered with some parchment paper. I'm going to step on the steps will cuz I'm a little vertically challenged. Okay. use a spoon and just Ladle the syrup all over the fruit Cover the strawberries completely What is it about a clear finish that is just so Sexy I don't know. It's like all those resin tutorials It's just because it's clear, you know. Alright, let's try a longer one So cool Quickly onto a tray Okay, why is it getting not clear? Not into that. I'm not sure what's happening here. But my syrup is now not clear. I Think maybe there's some water that got into here and so it's starting to seize. Look it's turning and turning into like taffy That's not cute Alright sugar syrup experts what's happening here? So I'm heating it up Maybe I should have left it cool and not increased the heat. This is totally seized Wow There's another sugar fail for you Okay lovelies I think I have yet again Failed when it comes to making the proper temperatures for syrup now while my first attempts look quite beautiful glistening gorgeous covered in a Resinous almost plastic shell they're not as hard as they should be although I do have to say it's about 100 percent humidity right now because we have got thundershowers going on outside Maybe that has something to do with it I suspect it has to do with the temperature of the syrup and then my subsequent attempts and depth looking like this my sugar completely Seized and it's not beautiful and clear. Although it is much harder. So I suspect what happened is that a little bit of moisture got into my syrup and then it act as Catalyst and started this kind of crystal formation that happened but sugar experts do chime in with your expertise Alright, let's go ahead and taste these itadakimasu! See, that's not supposed to happen. this is definitely more like a taffy it's sticking to every crevice in my mouth and it's supposed to have an Shatteringly glassy like texture. Now there are tons of ASMR videos of people just eating tanghulu let's try this one, which I think will have a better texture here we go. Mm-hmm. As far as taste goes they're absolutely delicious You've got a juicy juicy strawberry in the middle That's a little bit warm from the hot syrup. Then you've got it covered in sugar. I mean, it's fantastic. Ohh, look it doesn't even come off the dish All right, as you might expect I'm not giving up on this sugar and strawberry nonsense I'm back to do this again with a different recipe and a slightly different setup as you can see hair's in pigtails So that means it is very humid outside But I've closed all the windows. I've got the AC on so That might help I am also back with a new recipe Thank you guys so much for chiming in on social media to tell me that SAS-ASMR has a recipe that works. So That's what I'm doing today This recipe includes a little bit of corn syrup and I have to cook this up to a higher temperature Which I think is the major fault of my last experiment that I cooked to 265 degrees which is the hardball stage and I should have cooked it to a hard crack stage I was following the recipe directions, but they didn't work for me into a lovely pot. We've got here 2 cups of sugar doink 1/3 of a cup of corn syrup That's new and in her video, she uses a dry measuring cup for liquid ingredients So I'm just gonna do exactly what she did because I want this to work What is it with me and like hot sugar? It just doesn't work like Dragon's beard anyone? Not perturbs, not perturbs. Happy. Okay, according up of water Which is significantly less than the other recipe Okay. All right. I'll crank this up Let's get her going And we'll stick the thermometer in there and that will be our indicator of doneness Do do do do do. Another thing I learned in her video Was that she skewered just a few strawberries rather than having the beautiful long stick of them Which the vendors have in China which makes sense because they've got vats of this syrup And so they have a lot of surface area to drizzle the strawberries But since I'm working with a relatively small amount of syrup it makes sense to just have a couple berries on the stick and then dip the berries into the syrup rather than Using a spoon to drizzle it less chance of contamination last time when I did this my syrup started to seize as in it turned into Crystals, and it was definitely not a syrup anymore. I'm hoping to avoid that too by doing that kind of dip in twirl technique Let us see don't we love failure, failure is great. Actually, we should fail more often. I keep telling myself because this is how learn Certainly. I have learned a lot about candy syrups, and I've learned that you must get it to the correct temperature Now if you don't get it to the correct temperature, then it's not gonna do what you want to do, right? Right. I refer you to the Dragon's beard video because that is full of you know, candy syrup Follies, but it's good It really is good And I'm trying to be aware of that as a mother as well to let my children fail and that is the best teacher Surely so there's the syrup. It is pretty cold that 120 degrees almost and it's just Starting to bubble and we're just gonna let this go for about 15 minutes Holy Smokies, it's already at 220 okay, so I think the corn syrup must accelerate something here because when I make Fondant for my bees, which is the winter candy that my oh I keep bees By the way, if you guys don't know that I refer you to my bee blogs I make fondant for them in the winter time and it has corn syrup in it And I noticed that it comes up to temperature a lot Faster when I use corn syrup. Huuuuuuh Food scientists do let me know what's going on here is if the corn syrup is ready established to a certain Something something that it gets it to go to like to holy smokes 32 to 40 like last time when I did this I was trying to get it to the hardball stage and it took me forever And this is already at almost 240 degrees. Okay SAS-ASMR  I'm already liking your recipe. This is beautiful Don't know if it will be successful yet but it's a good sign that was super fast that was about seven minutes It's already at hard crack. Okay, now I have to work really quickly this time I'm gonna take the strawberries and just dip them into the syrup like that Allow it to drip. Okay, that's looking gorgeous Set on my tray yes dip drip Yesss! These are looking fab now they just got to get crunchy, okay That's actually a lot easier than spooning it too. last one oh Yes So far it is looking beautiful I'm so excited and that happened so fast in seven minutes when I had this on medium high It came to temperature *sighs* SAS you're a genius Thank you guys so much for suggesting her recipe look at the So out of failure comes success and it makes the success all the sweeter, yes! I'm so excited about this. These are perfect and beautiful and they're crunchy as I can tell already They're gorgeously clear. I didn't have any seizing the temperature came up very very quickly. In less then half the time that SAS said so Beautiful look look at that It's like they've been dipped in resin. Alright, here we go. itadakimasu! Delicious Delightful so much better than my first batch the first batch was chewy and The strawberry was juicy and delicious as well because these are fresh and ripe strawberries But the textural sensation that goes on here is so much fun the strawberry is slightly warm because the syrup is so hot and just so juicy, and then you've got the sugar coating on the outside that is just glass shatteringly crisp so that contrast between textures is so surprising and delightful and then of course, you've got the delicious flavor of strawberry and then just sugar I mean So much fun. What a great dessert. All right, I'm gonna eat this last one before. All right Really really great Super fun. Alrighty I hope you guys enjoyed that one. I hope you guys learn something here on my beautiful tanghulu I'm so excited about this This is actually very easy when you have the right recipe and the right technique If you make these, please share your results with me on social media I want to see your lovely sugar coated strawberries and yeah, share this video with your friends. It really helps me out Follow me on social media so you can see my follies and foibles Sub if you're not subbed already and I shall see you in my next one Toodaloo, take care.

comments comment ok CC b9 Clare [Music] [Music]", "fX1Dq9T9pS8": "[Music] they come in different colors different shapes and sizes in flavors ranging from fruity to minty from tart to tangy pretty well everyone enjoys sucking on a hard candy from time to time for children and adults alike these sweet treats are just irresistible our love of sweets goes back to the caveman who delighted in eating honey from beehives in ancient times people indulged in treats made of honey covered fruit and nuts in the Middle Ages Europeans made candy from boiled sugar but the high cost of imported cane sugar restricted this delicacy to the wealthy candy finally became affordable for the masses in the 1800s with the discovery of a new and domestic source of sugar the sugar beet these hard candies aren't mass-produced confections they are gourmet candies custom made and crafted by hand the candy maker starts by bringing a pot of sugar and water to a boil then he adds glucose a thick syrup made from starch he heats the mixture to a specific temperature depending on what type of candy he's making and lets it cook for about a half hour then he stirs in liquid flavoring once the mixture is evenly blended he pours it on to a cooling table the candy maker has several flavorings at his disposal from eucalyptus oil to fruit flavors he also chooses from a wide range of food colorings this candy will have a strawberry design in the middle so he and his assistants are working with three colors green for the leaves red for the berry and yellow for the background [Music] to enhance the flavor they add citric acid then they keep blending until the candy has cooled down and hardened enough to be malleable they separate the pieces by color and put each piece on a heated table to slow the hardening process so that the candy will remain pliable now they create the design they form various shapes and sizes and like a puzzle put the pieces together to make a jumbo version of the candy design [Music] once they've assembled the red berry and green leaves and yellow background they roll on more yellow background then a layer of red for the outside trim all that's left is to reduce this giant wad of candy into a bite-sized version to do that the candy maker pinches one end and stretches it out to form a long uniform strand called a rod he cuts the rod into pieces 60 centimetres long but he has to keep rolling them until they cool and Harden or else they'll go flat when the rod is just the right diameter the design is in perfect proportion all they have to do now is cut candy sized pieces they use the same technique to make kiwi candy pink grapefruit candy and banana candy to name just a few varieties want to order up some candy with a personalized message here's an L an o avi and II a y/o and you again they create a yellow background and red trim then it's more pinching pulling rolling and cutting until the rods are down to just the right size if you look at the back end of each rod you'll see the lettering in Reverse that'll be the underside of the candy when the raw candy comes off the cooling table it's transparent to make it opaque or to lighten the color they pull it on a hook here they intertwine two colors and feed the rod through a special machine that forms bands of pillow shaped candies after cooling they simply break them apart by hand if you're no sucker for hard candies no problem they can also twist rods into lollipops [Music] you", "YFKNLym1r3w": "what is up ladies and gentlemen boys and girls it's your boy goblin and today we're coming in with a hoot and a holler hey we're coming in with something a little different a bit of an educational video if you will now hope you guys enjoyed this one drop a like if you do and without further ado let's dive right into it so first and foremost i want to clarify why this video is being made right i get a lot of people coming into my twitter dms or my instagram dm's and they send me pictures of edibles they get and they're these like nerds robes or these gummies or all of these different things and you know up until recently i didn't have as much knowledge on the topic i guess you could say as i did now right like i never really bothered to actually learn much or educate myself because i kind of stopped buying edibles for a while but as i got back into edibles you know i kind of started learning more about what the current street edibles are like and listen alright ladies and gentlemen there's a trend going on that when i mentioned it on stream the other day the vast majority of people in chat not the vast majority but a fair bit of people were like what are you talking about like oh i didn't know that and today we're going to address that right i'm going to give you guys some tips on how to spot a fake edible what a fake edible even necessarily is but first and foremost right i think it's important to note that there's really only two cases where you should even be buying edibles right a go to a dispensary dispensaries have great edibles that are made in ways that a lot of street edibles just can't be made because it requires equipment that is so expensive no dude in his garage is going to have it 99 of the time right or b buy it off a friend of yours who makes it right if you are buying a street edible and it advertises a milligram amount 99 of the time that is wildly inaccurate nothing close to the real dosage right but we'll get to that part later because the real thing i want to push here is like folks make your own edibles okay before i get dive into how to really spot these edibles it's so simple to literally just get together with your homies smoke some weed and cook edibles it's some of the most fun i've ever had in terms of anything weed related making edibles is a blast dude if you've never done it before it's literally it's so easy dude brownies are the easiest thing to make give it a go okay but now let's get into the the real beef of this video okay so first and foremost there's something i want to highlight right not all edibles are made the same way right there's some edibles that are sold on the street you know specifically if you're buying a pre-packaged edible if you buy nerds ropes i guarantee this is probably what you're getting 99 of the time right i know these are a huge trend right now everyone's eating these [ __ ] nerds ropes dude there's probably a few of you guys smacking that [ __ ] right now while you're watching this video okay listen i'm on to you okay i'm on your ass now all right listen so there's different ways that edibles are made edibles of course can be cooked and that's more common when you've got like a brownie or a cookie you know they take an oil or a can of butter and they actually cook something but there's a new and kind of i wouldn't say new but a what's becoming more common trend which is spraying right and a lot of people when i mentioned this on stream the other day this is the whole reason i'm making this video a lot of people didn't know this exists what people will do is they will take distillate and just spray it on the edibles you take a [ __ ] piece of wax paper and you lay it out on a table right and you take nerds ropes obviously are such an ideal candidate for this because you could just put them so tightly together and just spray them down and waste no distillate right so you take this wax paper and you lay these [ __ ] edibles out you lay some let's say you go buy some candy you know you go buy some cheap wholesale candy you lay it out and you just spray the [ __ ] out of it it's so much quicker than actually cooking and think about it for a minute do you really think your plug knows some guy who is handcrafting some [ __ ] nerds ropes one by one in his garage or has like a nerd's rope machine listen there's machines that do a lot of things but there's no machine making nerds ropes and there's also no guy dumb enough to hand roll a bunch of nerds ropes when he knows he could just buy them and spray them and sell them for a shitload of money right you have to understand that this is a very common trend in the comment section i'm actually going to link an article that talks about this right there's a couple articles i found i'm gonna link you guys can actually read some stuff hey you don't gotta believe me that's fine i'm not always the most trustworthy source hey but these articles are okay these will tell you some facts right but moving on from the whole sprayed part there's a couple prop well not moving on but there's a couple problems with it a you don't know what the [ __ ] the dosage is right you have no idea what these people are putting on you can't dose it they're not actually cooking it the spray is uneven but that's really the least of the concerns of the sprayed edible because you have to look more at the fact of like what are they actually spraying onto this product right when something is cooked like you know let's say let's say someone takes an oil or like a can of butter and they make a brownie or a cookie or something like that with it typically you're you're more going to be questioning the strength of it you're not going to be concerned about a synthetic or something fake in it but when you spray an edible you are opening up the door for synthetics to be sprayed on it and this is becoming a more common thing people don't realize that not all edibles even have thc in them sometimes you can get an edible that is just sprayed with synthetic [ __ ] right k2 for example they spray that right that's not like an actual plant they spray some plant matter and you smoke that [ __ ] right they can do the same thing with edibles if they really [ __ ] want to right they can spray it with some synthetic chemical [ __ ] that you don't know what it does to you you don't know where it's from and there's a million different chemicals that they can choose to spray on these edibles and that's why you have to have due diligence when you're buying and you have to look at what you're purchasing and honestly in my opinion the brownie in a ziploc bag is a hundred times safer than your prepackaged nerds rope or sour patch kid is ever going to be okay because like nobody like sure there might be exceptions i know there's of course gonna be that one guy in the comment section he's like well goblin you know i actually have a sour patch kids nerds rope factory in the shed in my backyard and i have over 15 employees churning out nine different machines of nerd ropes you know what good for you you're the one in a million all right but the rest of the people watching this video they aren't in that scenario they're buying it from some guy who is spraying some hoopla right they're buying it from some guy and they're not buying it directly from that guy either it's passed through a hands on hand so you're getting marked up sprayed [ __ ] you're not you're not even getting a good deal on this you have to realize your plug like if you hit up your plug and you asked to buy like a hundred of these edibles in bulk i guarantee you're gonna get some ridiculous price that makes you realize wait a minute how does that even work and i'll tell you how it's probably sprayed specifically if [ __ ] are selling these little nerds ropes or whatever man are these other candies that are on you know trending nowadays you know you go on tick tock and you see these people claiming they they make these edibles you know oh look at these candies brother just spray that [ __ ] dude 99 of the time they don't actually cook something into it but even when they do cook something into it here's the next concern the next concern is that there's no actual viable way of really testing a street edible right you you can't really know you know nobody's taking dispensary weed where they know the exact percentage and cooking it in edibles they're taking street weed that's never been tested and cooking it into an edible that that that's then also never been tested so they really don't know what the dosage is in these you know they could tell you how much they put into it and you can maybe ballpark it but when you get something that is packaged and your plug says yeah it's exactly this dosage don't believe them right if you've got a plug it just tells you yeah these [ __ ] are strong eat half that's honestly probably more reliable going to be a better product than the guy who's trying to sell you some thc milligram that he doesn't actually know exists right so always should have your due diligence and once again this should just be a an advertisement to cook with your homies dude go make some edibles hey go hop in your group chat right now all you need is literally like like a half ounce an ounce and you can make a small little batch of edibles bro that's all you need you and the homies will have a good [ __ ] time you know what i'm saying listen and you don't even need good kush you can get mids bro you don't even need good [ __ ] but hey that's for another video all right another thing that's very important to talk about specifically i see this on some of these right this is a small little disclaimer that we're going to talk about here is i see some edibles advertise activation time and that then and there should tell you to run if if there's ever a packaging on an edible you purchase that says oh man you'll be stoned in 60 minutes oh dude man activates in 45 minutes dude everyone like it's your digestion dude like everyone digests products differently the only way you could advertise that is if you're spraying it with some boo-boo [ __ ] that does actually activate that quick but if it's actually cooked into the product and you have to digest it right that's a whole different story right that's a whole different story and obviously you can't advertise activation time like that so just what i'm trying to say here in this video guys is is really think before you purchase an edible and it's really sad that the street market has become this way you know when i was young and i first started smoking it was just you'd buy some mids and you buy some mid wax and edibles was something you made with your friends out of one of those two things nobody really sold them unless it was your homie with a tray of brownies who was selling them right pre-packaged edibles were unheard of around me right now that's like the norm everyone's selling this crazy carts [ __ ] fake edible [ __ ] it's crazy man and that's why that's why i make some of these kind of informational videos just spread the word about it dude hey man listen if you're a plug out there selling these shits dude you're guilty okay you should feel terrible about yourself but either way hope you guys enjoyed this video drop a like if you did hope you guys learned something let me know in the comments if you did thank you guys for tuning in i will see you guys next time peace and subscribe if you haven't already peace out everyone", "kC0PG3GqVMo": "thank you too so today I'm going to show you guys how I do my any type of gummies any type of any type of salt cane the way I do this is no fail and it's really easy all you got to do is boil some water mix it really hard and you're good the main idea of my gummies and probably everybody else's but I use a little bit more just to be a little safer is a lot of gelatin so usually for a recipe for gummy bears and anything anything like that it usually calls for one box for tax which is fun you know that really will work if you made some gummies with one box of jell-o and four packs of it will work it's it's I'm not saying it's not gonna work but but now during a hot day or even just a little bit of moisture in the air your gummies are going to stick together and they're going to melt and you're gonna be pretty pissed off so take my advice and follow my recipe and I'm sure that your gummies are gonna hold up in your pocket you're gonna be able to go to work and go on with your day without any worry that something's gonna happen to basically the money you spent making these guns so let's get started so this is really simple like I said all you're gonna do is boil some water and that's it so we're gonna add 1 cup of water now that we had our water will crank go on so this isn't gonna take too long to get hot it's one cup of water so it's literally about two minutes it will probably be there so we got to think fast to move this so what we're gonna do is usually now you can do two full boxes of gelatin and that's only gonna make your gummies last longer they're gonna be a little harder a little more firm but they will last and that's the main idea but I usually like to do seven packs just because it's a perfect amount of like thickness in there so so now we're about to start boiling so I'm gonna add my gelatin sooo some cold water so it does AHS a little bit so when we actually do mix it doesn't get love you not sure if you guys know it's the Spanish shirt I'm wearing I believe design and he's out of Philadelphia PA and you guys like these shirt so I'm gonna be wearing check out his website I'll have a link down at the top lots of hats lots of shirts who's got lots of stuff ok so now that our gelatin is dissolved I'm gonna add our gelatin to the water after I have my gelatin I'm gonna have my gelatin pack then I'll add our additive and we're done so what's that era now it's at our gelatin give this a good a good old stir because you want to break up anything that's happened to not dissolve John says it's fish so this mix that we're making now I have three volts here this one box recipe should almost perfectly cover all three moles so now that our gelatin is combined and there's no more lumps now get out our gelatin so I'll do let's still line add your whole pack you really don't gotta rush this that's the best part about gummies and jello you don't it's not hard candy it's not like the minutes it's done you got the rush and it's gonna solidify on you if it does solidify you can just reheat it it's good again all right so now our jello has a gelatin and it's ready but does it have any good stuff so so it's outer additive and then we'll take the next step all right so now do you added your additive to this thing's ready to go you're ready to have a really fun day so the hard parts done we have it ready now the biggest problem is filling your molds I see people using turkey basters don't use surrogate of turkey basters think about when you suck it in just the two go over here you're gonna lose by the time you're done here you probably lost about seven to eight gummy bears worth of drop so don't use the turkey baster it's a mess and you're gonna lose stuff what I like to use is a squeeze bottle a squeeze bottle you can pour it in perfectly and boom boom boom boom no mess and no loss so let's do this so if you have a big squeeze bottle you can burp the bottle like that so when you tilt it it doesn't shoot out at somebody sitting across the room and you kind of control it a little bit better so you just go over each one how easy was that using a squeeze bottle way better than using a turkey bass boom all I got to do is wait for these is wait for these things are cool and I can be poppin these things all night long feelin really good so we'll check back in a couple of minutes when they're ready we'll see what they look like so we are all solidified see what we got the fact we used a lot of gelatin these things are gonna come out nice and hold your shape and it's gonna be nice so yeah boom just like you went to the store got some gummy bears this time they're gonna get you baked it'll look way cooler they won't melt in your pocket none of it okay go on your daily business don't worry about these but I just got these little molds I got from Michaels and they see more there's so many cool molds that you can do I really want to try the Lego molds you can build Legos with those things just so so cool but that was easy boil some water add your jello add your gelatin add your additive mix it up mold done I hope you guys can tell but I'm freaking freezing it's cold so what I like most about these is you know hard candies they're great when they take too long and you know sometimes you just want to eat some candy really fast and these are really good for it so you could be boom-boom-boom and be on your way instead of sitting there having to suck on some hard candy for a while these are these are

"348s5l3DjQo": "[Music] hello and welcome to lofty pursuits and public displays of confection in tallahassee florida i'm greg this is our first video of 2021 and i don't know what your plans are but nothing is going to stop me from making 2021 a great year for lofty pursuits and i hope that means it's going to be a great year for you too we're going to capture the flavor of chocolate covered strawberries chocolate-covered strawberries are kind of unique because we know exactly who invented them lorraine larusso and she did it in the 1960s and we'll get to that at the end as i mentioned this will be part of our image candy assortment for valentine's day it's available at www.pd.net and here's the full 2021 assortment what we're going to do now is add the food coloring and if you take a look as i stir it in you're going to see the steam start coming off you know that's because the food coloring is water-based and the candy may look like a liquid but has no water in it and this is how we're going to build their palettes we're going to have a red section which is of course going to be the strawberry and in this case also the outside wrap we're also going to have a little bit of trouble today it's a cold day in tallahassee and i know those of you up north are going to think florida coal well the inside of the store right now is about 67 degrees and that's giving us some trouble the candy's cooling faster than i'd like it to so this is going to be a bit of a rush the entire time we're going to see how that goes and yellow is going to be used for the background fortunately yellow a little yellow goes a very long way we always use yellow for the background because it also lets us use it for the yellow seeds of the strawberry we're going to the brown which we're also going to use on the wrap don't need very much of that you'll notice the top layer of candy is getting a little hard it's getting a little hard to work but it's still boiling out and we're still getting a lot of steam it's been a long time since i made a batch of candy just by myself this should be interesting candy's just the right temperature i didn't wait too long there you go now i'm going to cut our candy into it the palace the stop light of color here we've got the brown and this part over here cooled a little bit much so rather than fight it and take most of it off put it in here it'll reheat there i can do the same thing with the green maybe i can save a bit of the edge of this now i got too much green on the edge i'll just use it all now to go for the red if i got the temperature right it won't stick too badly to the table well that's just perfect i can keep everything apart but i didn't succeed on everything apparently came apart good so this green can do the same thing let's see how fast everything's cooling i'm not getting the drips i normally do which i kind of have to do i'm doing this on a hot summer day it's the only way to aerate the candy enough to cool it off now that the sugar is evening out there's no real cold places that i can find to put the sugar or put my hands on so i don't get burned [Music] [Music] if you'd like to try this candy for yourself please visit our website at www.bd.net [Music] [Music] so every time i pull this and fold it over i'm trapping air bubbles into the candy this is really useful for me because it's like setting up little mirrors inside the candy and every time i do that it reflects more light that means it's going to bounce the light out of the red and it's going to make it look a little more jewel-like and that's the goal here to make this more jewel-like and it also creates more surface area in the candy and uh that means that the candy dissolves a little which is good because it makes the flavor more intense [Music] the first thing i'm going to do i'm going to make the strawberry frond the strawberry friend's gonna be sort of like half of a citrus if you've seen our citrus video three i think i'm gonna have four little green prawns so this is my heating table and different parts are heated to different amounts so i'm moving it around so let it cool off but not cool off too much got to make sure that the green edges touch each other [Music] [Music] and that'll be the top of the strawberry bread we need some more yellow we're going to need less yellow than the red by a substantial amount because these are going to be the seeds i don't even need less than that this area is going to be the wrap for the seeds and the body of the strawberry and normally i make 10 little strawberry cells and i'm going to make fewer this time [Music] because i'm making fewer because i'm going to be making the i'm going to be making pewter because i'm making the chocolate bit too and will be part of the same triangle so i'm going to end up doing seven of these little things so this will end up being four and that'll end up being three two three four the center of each of these is going to be yellow giving that little strawberry seed and this will be in thirds i'll do one two three i'll get the brown and i'll start pulling cylinders off this lots of leftover brown i guess it doesn't really have to be a cylinder but it definitely lets me measure the amount of candy in my head better there we go just like that one of the problems with the green is i always have to make too much so i'm not going to use nearly all of this the patron is never as wide as a strawberry but don't worry much of this can be saved and used for the stripe the noise you just heard with me turning on the batch roller it's a little squeaky today gonna have to lube it after all this is done a little bit of red isn't going to be a problem because we're going to put it right against the red from the strawberry or the brown and it's not ever going to be noticed [Music] there we go now all we have to do is do the outer wrap and in the meantime i'm going to put this on the batch roller let it spin for a few minutes but i don't let it go flat so now we get to see how soft these things still are they're plenty soft so we're going to be able to use these as stripes and you may wonder why we don't do much audio here live audio here the noises like that squeaking is definitely part of it also the noises from the customers are part of it because we can't use that audio according to youtube but today it's raining and we have no customers so we're not going to have that problem [Music] yeah approximately approximated the size very very close now i've got my log chocolate covered strawberry [Music] and off to the batch roller so so [Music] if you think about it chocolate covered strawberries are different than other chocolate covered fruits chocolate-covered orange peels are preserved orange peels chocolate-covered cherries are preserved too but chocolate-covered strawberries are fresh and they trace their roots back to the imagination of lorraine larusso a candy maker from a candy maker's family in chicago who was working at a grocery store that had a large candy section the cool thing about this story is i don't have to tell it to you even though lorraine passed away in 2014 she can tell her own story the produce department was right next to my candy department and ralph who was a manager used to get these driscoll strawberries from california i said you know i got a good idea we'll set up a display and we'll dip strawberries for mother's day and it became such a success and 25 hours is selling with an investment of only 700. i had a return of over 3 dollars we took the lag of candy and we drew it down into rods of candy and now we have to cut them into individual bite-sized pieces for the final assortment and we do that on our canvas if you're interested in hearing more about lofty pursuits please check out our other videos we also have a weekly or roughly weekly podcast that you can get wherever podcasts are available or off our website www.pd.net it's very different from the videos because i don't limit myself to candy do and now to see how our chocolate covered strawberry came out i really wish we could put the smells across on youtube too the smell of this candy being made was so much like a chocolate covered strawberry you could almost imagine biting into it in juice running down your fingers thank you for watching we

"first pass of the day first batch this morning what is tiny bit more look at that you'll be a professional one day you gotta just think in this turn you know yeah they're just having had the bigger bag I don't know why but you take sugar sugar right [Music] fewer forgotten ahead that no don't think so it's just a habit so i'ma start today I've never really looked it up to see exactly the properties of it to what it really knows what my father and my uncle's always said it was just to stop cracking it's for the hood if this for the sort of cheese a fan on the go outside Karen which I get other people yeah most smell outside like you when you said you were a kid becoming on getting off the bus right yeah I'd smell the candy and you knew what we were doing hey I can smell on the park console packs the old days was following the publication small not yeah [Music] [Music] regular [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so every lemonade was going to be the first batch but I I messed up with it like that because I didn't do that all right with them we're supposed to be 24 Compaq for you - 21 are you it's just because you most of the time to do 21 pounds yeah I'm just not to have it I put it together and that was that yeah yeah I realized later worse things have happened to it oh yeah like what crack mean one so for this condom good part that's the other day you guys burned that didn't happen so we're gonna just pour half yep that's good you'll have to scrape the kettle yellow they might want to get the last chick a mini letter then we're gonna add strawberry in the kettle some actually go ahead and do the lemon oh no I've got one 3/4 I believe you you crunched the numbers I wrote down what was she putting they're pretty stronger remember we just did this driver this one oh wait you did write it down yeah you said to take point here two and three quarters it's one of the worst it's I got it written down I'm telling you three quarters it's two or three quarters for lemonade one three quarters for card remember we were just talking about how strawberry gets three shots here double batch and lemonade gets the five shots yep that makes sense next doesn't think this he'll be very awkward but he does I'm just his heels they were dug in okay okay I guess worst-case scenario just isn't growing strawberry well do you put too much strawberry and it takes chemically don't want that this good I just want to make sure it was like a compass it's so cool over there if you like it does smell a little bit chemically but also like Captain Crunch and over here there's no men women hands huh well just look lemon oh my god yeah this smokes just like oh yeah it calls just like hold yeah well it was calling off a little bit you want to stay in there bring it back to the basement we have to pour this bench Craig yeah so you need me recycling me out right here okay let's not burn that to you it's so annoyed so I was thinking some crazy candy related thoughts I mean some off-the-hook stuff I'm almost afraid to say it but I miss it because I forget it but don't forget it I'll remind me know the savour would know nothing not to see every line of every candy I was thinking of what if we put something crunchy and like what if we got crushed up Oreos and added into peanut butter peanut butter full mandatory all just murdered us for reals yeah and peanut butter and then maybe a free chocolate cover yes yeah so I have an idea that I am pretty certain would work be and I know that because one of our viewers actually did it and sent us pictures and it came out really great they did caramel filled ribbon candy well we totally want to do that don't try that our example yeah they didn't yeah well we had apple pie so should we do that which go for our plans the summary only it's a public experiment but SMERSH Mona seems to change this all up yeah it's over I'd still like to try that out because I'm gonna be me but yeah that would be pretty cool but then I had another one we're talking about I came here what flavor ribbon candy we were talking about the other day Cara was there she's saying well what could we fill that flavor with cuz you don't feel things with they ask you how you are you just have to say that you're fine when you're not really fine but you just can't get into it marshmallow fluff chocolate I was thinking what if we took actual cream max actually cream some crushed Oreos in the back into cream request Orioles in the cream and then we put that in urban candy justic Crisco and confectioner sugar make our own Oriole fill and fill it with that we could make like oh my god because we could take the the chocolate liqueur uh-huh like a chocolate flavored ribbon candy and then really ribbon we did anyways yeah and then just fill it with Oreo filling oh okay if you put it in just cream I think that they would get like Siamese huh I really like well I was also thinking wouldn't it be interesting if we crushed Oreo into creamy feta green Oreo cream green I'm talking to treatment we make for our starters I know crazy but I think yeah I'm saying just take some cream you've you know and you'll drop it don't don't starts facets that in the middle of ribbon candy and then you can have a flavor whether it be Oreo or whatever that you're like fruit flavored oils we could do anything if we did if we put out your ice cream oh we have people are want maple maple pecan and there's my crunches I just asked for fresh pecan and oh wait crushed up Oreos to cover the whole thing okay yes Oh ain't you glad well if you wanna you can make him 24 cuz the watermelon all the watermelon we need maybe should make it 24 we I mean we need so much watermelon orange you glad this is probably so wait you something take it down put in the hook yeah oh yeah you see that's way too soft it's just sticking to the table so let's talk about strawberry lemon-aid so I don't know if you picked up all that wasn't we flavored lemonade this one we played strawberry I was dropping here no we figured instead it's like pouring both in there we thought we'd keep himself at the trial that's how that worked out and we we might get some point inside football flavors in one pedal and see how that works so today is May 30 and this strawberry lemonade is going into our fruit and friendly bash but by the time you guys see this video I'm friendly badger probably sold out yeah and the strawberry lemonade assuming it tastes good cuz this is an experiment we're just trying it out but hey let me taste great Oh strawberry tastes great alone why would the taste great together me so that time you see this video we'll probably be doing separate flavors women in is a separate flavor to buy as a standalone flavor yeah because we we just tried that out with watermelon and put that video up one yesterday can't start out with 120 bags of it it's gone and that's where we're making more today kind of on the fly we're gonna make another 48 pockets today but there's just so much to candy makers can do out yeah they're giant they're trying valiantly but it's kind of like trying to push a boulder a really big one up a hill and sometimes it rolls back with crushes this is what Mitch fossil wants to make up strawberry-banana hmm right I think we should do a bunch of bananas in a bag blueberry banana mmm banana Irish cream Oh banana anise banana peanut butter banana peanut butter would be killer good the Elvis heart candy you certainly feel tired just watch me yes I mean do you wish you were me I'm not tired I just thought the water table should be much more bringing it over warm seems like a good idea until you realize that like you can't trap the air in felt school that just means that you're no longer just doing this for fun just do more work for longer yep yeah your mom kicked in my side you see I like its second form the strands in it and stuff like that's usually like you know when it's super cold it's not it's very pretty quick get that nice silvery look though that'll be cool yeah if you pull it can you call it too much like was it was like I'm a lot of it way more because it kind of stopped oh no it'll it'll keep trying Baltimore white yeah yeah we've never thrown into like it like right now on rough you just saw but like it just got a lot paler yeah kind of go on for that like silvery can I make it a hammer please hammered telling the cameras that's a beautiful collar hey how did you do this it actually feels fluffy hey I think you pulled it you really did this is puffy feeling are you calling me yelling Oh yellow yellow belly how'd you make all right we talked about like the Old Yeller esque movies like what was up with that what you're like let's make kids really sad Shiloh Old Yeller what's the other one Bambi there's that one between two ferns do you remember occur between red fern where the red friends grow that's what I never saw it though wait what the book yes I've never seen that car hmm yeah classic motif boy s dog boy doesn't have dogs yeah the brave doesn't have dog in sad way talks to the hound lady in the all right think so I think there has any okay let's don't bring that up yeah I'm sorry come on I'm gonna cry right into the strawberry I was just gonna say is this a good pink or should I keep lighting it up I need your strawberry you're awesome he knows you can do a strawberry but don't do a raspberry I can't wait to taste this I wonder if it's okay if everybody before lunch I gotta call my mom I want you to trust him right now no I said I call my mom okay I guess I guess that going now hmm how close did you come I guess AR purple or I mean this one this color here this light right here there's a little bit larger there you go do it do it you well yeah this one's really soft a college dealer plates I can tell this is 24 pounds I didn't realize he was gonna be together the old days we've done this before but we put him back to the back what flavors we gotta do that way to do two flavors in one yeah [Music] I guess Lord or twenty pound batches pete'll it would it would save us a whole 45 minutes of cook time you know what is it your arm zone would you be able to pull it oh you'd pull it in two different two halves you know they'd be two separate flavors I mean one flavour ran into the next warm funny this way we used to do it to save time especially if you're doing half batches you don't want to cook up like 10 pounds of time does Oh I forgot to bring moving or [Applause] yeah I saw that because they're talking about you have a second favorite SNL star you know first or second favorite you have the ranking in your head I mean Will Ferrell's probably but I really like John Belushi is Santa present shiny all right so what do we have to do for the water bug and we're going to throw the green is that what we did last night yeah yeah everybody knows watermelons are pink in black and brown looks like a whale you is that belong [Applause] [Music] [Music] Wow that's good just come back one more piece of candy laughs you know [Music] I'm telling you this batch and the last won't like by the end

telling you ever gotten a good okay ID in a while extra dump will conquer the world okay well I think it's just because it's cold it's it's softer than old Hawaii just watch stuff we do it man [Applause] probably just device and Ida scrutineers lie no me Craig [Applause] all right so like after this point it's just gonna be strawberry we control that yeah we keep that separate no no no I mean it touched the lemonade and got kind of a fix right here voila sent my line kids [Music] if you right now oh they let it get cold then once it's called [Music] these pants that's well okay but a

"[Music] hi guys so today by a super super popular demand i'm going to show you how to make candy strawberry if you guys are new to my channel i have my main channel at sas asmr um i made these it's super super easy all you will need is corn syrup sugar and water i've i've made it once without this and it was a total fail so if i were you i would go out and get one of these it's super it's worth it you'll use it again for sure um okay so let's get started i've already cut up my strawberry and my um golden berries is what i use they're so delicious they're actually super sour so it goes really well with the um the sugar and it kind of balance it out a little bit too so so we'll just get that ready and set it aside because once your syrup is ready you have to work super quick otherwise the the sugar will the temperature will drop too much and then it won't and then it'll go all hard and weird after okay so in the pot two one fourth cup of water water and then one third cup of corn syrup obviously you don't have to use this brand this is the this is the brand that i happen to have on hand because i use it for um my korean recipes then you can kind of give it a stir i'll show you what it looks like give it a stir a little bit now you can at this point add your food color in um because if you add it at the end because of the heat temperature difference it will splatter i mean you can but it's just not suggested so i kind of i stirred it before i put it on the heat so this is what it looks like before i turn the heat on and then now all you have to do is just turn the heat on for i think let me time it for those of you who don't have a candy thermometer like so let's let's see how let's see how long it takes for it to get up to 150 degrees timer is going let's um get our skewers ready our strawberry and our golden berries these are so delicious and so so so so so easy to make so i have my wooden skewer sticks now on in in my video i actually have some with the with um the strawberries not cut up like this just so there's some variety i think i'll do two these these are what i have left from making it last time i love these by itself anyway it's like sour and a little bit sweet i love them oh and when you coat them you can either put it on a foam like stick it on a foam so it will dry or you can just get parchment paper lay it flat once you coat it you just set it and then it will it won't stick that's what i'm doing today let's go check on our syrup it's been so far four minutes it's like the easiest thing you'll ever make um oh and i forgot to tell you guys it gets super super hot the sugar syrup so you you really really have to be careful um i would not suggest making these with kids because they would want to touch it and it can get pretty um pretty uh dangerous you guys so five minutes so far um got our parchment paper ready our strawberry golden berry ready just waiting on the syrup let's go let's go let's go i'm just waiting so it's been almost 13 minutes and our temperature let me show you what it's at right now it's at exactly 150. see that 150 and this is what it should look like kind of sticky bubbly so i have to work somewhat quickly turn this off so you just turn the heat off take this and that's what it looks like all you do is basically drip it coat it let it drip let it drip see it's like getting hard already so [Music] if you guys want to see the full video of me eating all this well not this set in particular but you can go and check out my main channel on sas asmr but for now i think i will have one of these huh um well give these a try and let me know how they work out and i will see you guys in the next one bye", "PseB0ndEc2s": "[Music] [Music] what's going on dickweeds Mike an abysmal order came

right now though for down the road what since we have this back you know when you stand there and you go around what do you get dizzy yeah we should do that the backyard are you doing up that's a good idea maybe but here's the problem this is a t-ball bat that would work for a short person like Donna how the [ __ ] do you think I can't do that that's you know just just hold it there and go I might as well just [ __ ] go like this anyway okay the videos get long okay that's it yes we're gonna [ __ ] off out of here and smoke some more weed I don't look for something munch on I apparently she's

like subscribe and [ __ ] off hey I thought you were gonna say the [ __ ] off part I also subscribe but today I was gonna let you say [ __ ] off you could have said to everybody [ __ ] off I don't see it that", "p6oKnG_sEwc": "[Music] hi welcome to diamond delight edibles my name is Liz if this is the first time you stopped by and for the rest of you guys welcome back thank you so much so somebody asked me a few weeks ago if I could do nerds ropes and to be perfectly honest had no idea what those work so I googled those little puppies and found out that they're a gummy candy covered in nerds who sew off my kitchen I went a little experimented little tickety-boo and look at what up I can make your it's ropes so I am going to bring this recipe to you so without any more in further babbling here let's jump right into those ingredients what we're going to need and then let's get these guys made alright so the ingredients that we're gonna need for our nerd candies so this recipe is basically my W candy recipe with the cooked syrup and the reason that we're using the Kochs syrup is is going to help with those candies to stick better than just using the gelatin one so with that set you're gonna need about three or four boxes of the large nerds or about seven or eight of those small ones that are the two flavored ones you're gonna want one to two boxes of cornstarch and don't worry you can reuse it we just sift it up and you can reuse it over and over and it doesn't go bad so not a problem plus it's not expensive you're going to want two boxes of the small gelatin the three amps or the 85 grams two of those want three tablespoons of unflavored gelatin or three or three packages of the Knox a quarter teaspoon of kaurav cannabutter and we're going to melt this 1/2 a cup of either kanna syrup corn syrup or you can use inverted syrup if you don't like invert sugar if you don't like corn syrup and we're going to split that quarter in our gelatin part quarter in our candy syrup we're going to need 1/2 a cup of we're going to need 1/2 a cup of liquid so I like to use the kool-aid jammers or the kool-aid waters ones because it gives it extra flavor than just using water and it's pretty much like using water so you don't have to worry about things going bad so these are great to use so I'm going to use use a half a cup of this to bloom our gelatin and a half a cup for our mixture then for additional flavoring I know I feel I know these could be a little bit difficult to get is I use two tablespoons of drink crystals so I get these at the bulk barn Jurek from spring onwards they have me during spring in the summer during the winter they don't carry them or other box stores the stores may carry them otherwise you can just use the Lorena's oils if you want to add some additional flavoring but it's not really required because of all the nerds on it so it's not that big of a deal and that's everything that we need for the gelatin part for our cooked syrup we need 1 K 1 cup of sugar and again if you've got candace sugar you can divide that up a quarter cup of can of sugar to three quarters of a cup of regular sugar as long as you equal one cup of sugar it doesn't matter a quarter cup of water and a quarter cup of our corn syrup and or kit canister that's it for our syrup oops sorry and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid goes into our cooked syrup as well then for the glue that they that they used to stick on top technically they're nerds the Nerds use confection confectioners glaze unfortunately being in Canada wasn't the easiest for me to get but an alternative for an edible glue and glaze is to use tylose tylose powder and water so I'm going to show you how to do that and this is what you're going to need to this stuff a day before but it's super easy it just happens that time to do whatever it needs to do but it works great if you can't get the confectioner's late and for and then to make our clear to make our edible glue we're also going to need one cup of water that is all the ingredients that we are going to need let's get into that equipment there so there's a little bit of equipment this time so let's get into that equipment and then let's get these made alright so the equipment that we're going to need is a double boiler if you don't have a quote double boiler you can always just use a metal bowl that will fit securely into the pot and has enough room on the bottom for water without touching you're gonna need another small or saucepan a small medium saucepan for our syrup point you need a candy thermometer digital or the one that you hang on doesn't matter a couple of spatulas gonna need you're gonna need a pastry brush and I'm gonna use a funnel for putting it into our molds you can get these candy funnels or if your pot has the little specks on it and that will work as well or you can always put it into a measuring cup or something with a spout anything to make it easier to pour cause we gotta pour into some skinny guys offset spatula is something to be able to smooth out our corn starch and you're going to want to get some dowels so I got these at the dollar store in the craft section they're 12-inch by just slightly under a half inch size dowel so you want about half inch sized dowel by about 12 inches as I said dollar store craft stores usually how these pre-cut like so otherwise you cannot just buy one of those read it on once and cut up your own so we need basically one if you can is many has many dowels as you want to make ropes now this recipe probably makes around 10 to 12 I'm only going to do part of that today and the rest of the stuff I'm just gonna make regular gummies and I'll explain why when we get to making them all so if you want a bunch of those dowels a cookie sheet or doing them on and you want to line it with parchment paper another pan that we can use to press down the cornstarch with or something flat that's that's kind of heavy a drying rack and then another pan or something that you can use and we're going to put Phillip put the skittles in to cover them up later on once we get the glue on them so it makes it easy if you've got some kind of pan like that so basically all our equipment you know me I always forget something but let's jump right in and let's get these made so if you go and I'm using the tylose powder as your glues your edible glue what you're going to want to do is to bring one cup of water to a boil once it's come to a boil turn the heat off and then we're going to add in three-quarters of a teaspoon into into our boil water you're gonna whisk that around and you're gonna see it's gonna lump up and it's not all gonna dissolve it takes about 15 to 20 minutes for it to fully dissolve all right so my water's come to a boil I'm going to turn off the heat gonna remove that oh remember that thing that I always tell you I forget yeah it was the whisk one whit so we're gonna add in three-quarters of a teaspoon these are quarter teaspoons you want to kind of story sprinkle it around like so and then you're gonna whisk it and it's gonna stay lumpy a little bluffing like that for a while and every couple every two three minutes you're gonna come back and whisk it around and you'll notice every time you come back more and more will be dissolved and as I said it takes about 15-20 minutes for it to fully dissolve once it has you're going to put it into the refrigerator sorry you're gonna let it cool first then put it into the refrigerator overnight and the next day you're good to go and it lasts for up to six months so you can use this over and over not as well as for your any other projects edible food products projects that you have that you need glue fork so I'm just gonna continue to do that to stir that I'll show you once it is clear and next we're gonna make up our starch molds alright so here's my tylose my edible glue all clear now and dissolved so just gonna pour it into a jar and once that's cool I'm gonna cover that up put it in the fridge overnight alright so now we're gonna make our starch folds and starch molds are what they use in candy manufacturing so there's not a whole bunch of people on the line pop and they've silicone molds they use these huge place with corn starch they stamp in the pattern fill up the molds once they set the plate opens all the candies fall in Iraq all the corn starch falls to the bottom and they reuse it so we're going to make our own makeshift version at home so as I said you need about one to two boxes depending how large betray your you see because you do want it almost look for sickness of your cookie sheet whatever lip on that so carefully pour it into your pan and you want to do it on parchment paper because it's going to make it a lot easier when you need to put this back into the box as well as to get it thin too sifting and again you want to be very careful otherwise it's going to look like Scarface's come through your kitchen this stuff it gets messy again you want to carefully move it an offset spatula works really well so that you can move it and spread it out around your pan evenly so I'm just moving it around here so that is all trying to get it relatively all even so that our moles will all be about the same size and you want to have enough room as I said to be able to make them a little bit deeper there and you don't want to be going all the way to the bottom so once you've got it relatively smooth out gonna Mimi and stuff everywhere so what we want to do is to take another little piece of parchment paper and you want it to be able to fit over top doesn't all stick to our pan place it down on top and then use your pan to press down don't press down too firmly but a little bit just to get that compressed and the parchment will stop of the cornstarch from sticking to the bottom of your pan in defeating the purpose of trying to make a flat surface carefully pick this up so we're good like that there so now you want to take your dowels and that's why I said you want to try and have as many as you as you were going to make because your we're gonna press it down so you take the one with a your dowel and you press one down and rock it back and forth so that it makes a little bit of a wider crevice here or so it makes a little wider it up a little bit wider of a trench and then just leave it and then use your next one just go over a little bit button in half an inch or an inch and again you're gonna do the same thing gently press and work it down so the reason you say you want to use multiple dowels is if I go and I take this out if I took it out and push the next one in it pushes some of the cornstarch into the one that we just made so the multiple dowels will help you from avoiding that problem so I'm just gonna pull the camera in over top here so you can actually see it up close all right so it's that you just go over a little bit here from the other one about an inch is good and just gently roll it into place now if you don't have as many inch you're going to like you can see like I'd oh I'm now gonna take my first one so grab it from end to end with your fingers like so so that you don't interrupt your Bowl and now I can move that one there without interrupting that one and then the same thing carefully take this one and here how're we gonna get one of our box the Nerds I've just put them into a bowl or something for you to make it easy we're gonna fill up our little trenches here with our nerd on here a bowl here no jar from a bowl today and just grab some with your fingers and gently drop them fill out the trench chair you just gonna drop them along the bottom don't fully fill it up we just want to line the bottom of it and then anywhere where there's naked spots that we miss don't worry cuz we're gonna glue glue bunch on afterwards so going along do that my trenches removing the dowels grab them use your fingertips in the end to gently pull them up then once you're done filling up your molds there with nerds you're going to carefully place the tray into your freezer so we're gonna make our mold nice and cold nice and cold so when we drop our candy syrup it's gonna start to solidify and grab onto those candies really quickly but you want to be very very gentle because it'll fall easily and yeah you don't want to do this all over again so first case scenario you make a mess him if you have to redo it just to sift out your cornstarch and your nerds and just redo the process so the first thing that we want to do is bloom our gelatin so I've got 1/2 cup of and this has got to be cold but liquid needs to be called 1/2 cup of our I use the kool-aid jammer and then you're gonna sprinkle evenly on your gelatin all over the top and this is to prevent clumping and then you want to mix it in until it's all dissolved and while you're mixing it'll start to bloom and it should call right automatically kind of go to the texture of applesauce if it doesn't your gelatin is not is not very good it's lost its Jo so you don't want to add a little more or get new stuff so we're just gonna set that off the side until we need it God needs about five at least five ten minutes to bloom so the next step is going to be our gelatin side that we're gonna do you're gonna turn your heat on to medium low you're gonna boil a half a cup of your liquid so I used a half a cup of the cooling water pour that in and you're gonna stir to dissolve your jello and then just note for your double boiler don't forget to put your water in and also you your water should never touch the bottom of your pot so I said you just gonna stir this up until that just starts to dissolve and if you're using flavor drink crystals I this is where all added in as well so it can dissolve at the same time I add about two tablespoons as I said if not you can use the Lorraine's oil and you add that more at the end so we just stir this until it's all dissolved until it until it starts to dissolve then I'm gonna add in our corn syrup and our citric acid now that my syrup is mostly the sugars not have mostly melted I'm gonna add in 1/4 cup of my can of syrup or as I said you can use corn syrup or inverted sugar and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid and the citric acid and the syrup they are both for preventing crystallization well the can of syrups add a little extra but regularly corn syrup or the inverted sugar is to help prevent crystallization so again I'm gonna mix that stir that well until it's all combined and everything's melted together in the meantime make sure your can of butter is melted and you're going to get your hand blender ready to so we're gonna need that shortly and you're gorg um so now that our syrup our gelatin and that everything's dissolved now it's time to add in our can of butter and our corn gum so you're gonna take your melted can of butter throw her in mix that around just a little bit then we're going to use each ordered teaspoon of fargo and you're going to spread gently sprinkle it try and do sprinkle it evenly over the top please let it sit for just a moment get your hand blender and we're going to blender up [Music] so you're gonna let that blend that up for about probably about two minutes you want to make sure it's something it's a really wild ball supply then once you're done just let it sit for a couple of minutes for about a minute or two and see if any oil comes to the top raises to the surface and you'll be able to tell that the air the bubbles will start to dissipate and if there's any oil if it's not fully emulsified the oil will come up to the top and you will notice kind of little oil slicks if you do see any kind of little oil slicks just add a little bit more Gorica no more than about an eighth of a teaspoon and re blended with the hand blender until that's gone so you should have one uniform texture and then just turn off the heat on your gelatin mixture here there is enough warm water in in your pot here to keep your mixture liquefied now on to the candy side the candy syrup side so for our cooked syrup you're going to add in your one cup of sugar or I said or your mixture of sugar and can of sugar get add in a quarter cup of our can of syrup or corn syrup as I said use that inverted sugar and our quarter cup of water and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid mix those together and you can turn your heat on to high heat so you're just going to continue to mix stir this until it begins to boil once it starts to boil you're gonna stop stirring that and we're gonna cook it till two hundred and eighty degrees so now that it started boiling just do it's just start it just around the sides here I'm gonna stop stirring at this point and then I'm just gonna check my temperatures every once in a while till we hit two hundred and eighty degrees so I'm gonna need to check it right now because obviously we're not going to be there I'm gonna let it boil for a couple of minutes and then I'll check its temperature so I start my syrup has been boiling for a couple of minutes so I just want to see where it's sitting right now because we only use a quarter cup of water and we're cooking a high temperature it will get to the 280 very quickly so already at 270 almost there just after 2-3 minutes 280 once it hits your temperature pull it off and allow it to cool for until it hits about 240 so why I like to set it on a stone on natural stone like granite or any natural stone it helps to pull the heat out thicker or if you've got a trivet that helps as well so said just let that sit until it hits 240 all right so my temperature my syrup now is at the correct temperature it's down below just below 240 so now I'm going to and the reason you want to do that is if it's higher it's going to break your gelatin so we don't want to do that so now we are going to pour our gelatin syrup into our candy syrup if that well mixed well together and if you found that your candy syrup has solidified on the bottom or along the sides you can put it on to low heat just to melt that so you're just going to mix this for about a minute or two till they're both combined and make sure to get right on the sides it does like to harden up there see and once everything is all nice together and all melted well together we're going to treat our unflavored gelatin and I recommend kind of break it up into smaller pieces if you can plop her in there see this way again your syrup is not going to be too hot to break your gelatin and this way we get the gelatin all through everything kind of binds there both of those together so you're just going to gently stir that until the gelatin is completely melted so now here's a way that you can kind of give a kind of little pretest to know if your syrup is going to gel up well because on gummies were okay because we can always read about those but these a little harder having all the Nerds stuck to them so we want to get it right the first time just take your syrup take your spoon and allow it to drip off if it starts to solidify in midstream like it'll start to solidify and gel right up while it's dripping you're good to go if it continues to drip like mine is it's going to need more gelatin so what I'm going to do to make sure that that's going to work is I'm going to add another tablespoon of blooms gelatin so I'm just going to go bloom another tablespoon of gelatin in a quarter cup of liquid let that bloom and then add that in and that will take care of that problem there all right so I added one tablespoon of unflavored gelatin to a quarter cup of my cooling water and I bloom that for about five minutes and added it in and now you can see how much it's thicker and how it'll start to solidify find a mid stream and it'll it'll hold there that's how you should that's a kind of a quick test for you to be able to see if it's going to gel up correctly in your moles before you actually cast them so now we wait to pour it into my little funnel here well shoot and then just line up with your trench and you're just gonna fill up the trench I have to say this funnel makes it really really easy well I needs you then try to free pour it let's go just go along you fill up all your little trenches little cavities and then you take your Nerds actually found it's easier to pour and break from the box so don't bother putting them in a bowl it's just easier to pour them from the box just take off a little lip there so it doesn't get your way and just kind of squeeze it together so you have a little bit of control it'll all come flying out and then you just fill up the box alone and you just want to be gentle with it go easy because otherwise they'll come flying out and don't worry about all the excess that goes off into the cornstarch there we're gonna sift the cornstarch when we're done and we'll be able to retrieve all those I just give it a very very gentle pat you don't look like literally just feather touch it down there you go so we've got our ropes like that so you're gonna put them into the fridge for them to set up anywhere from about a half hour to two hours it can take for your gelatin to set now that our candies have set you're just gonna take them out of the starch mold here and just lay them on to a harsh line drying rack parchment paper drying rack and you're gonna set those out to dry overnight and I'm putting the start my topside is good with the amount of candies and stuff that are on it so I'm gonna I lay them with the starch side up and that's the main side that I'm gonna add any additional candies to that they need you the sec so I'm gonna let those set stay out overnight for them to dry before we apply our glaze all right so now why are candies for setting so you don't want to waste all that cornstarch and all those nerds that are stuck in there so you grab your um your corn starts with your parchment paper inches pull it up like so take a strainer take a strainer and pour it in a little neater than that and you're gonna slip your parchment paper paper back underneath and sift it back onto the parchment once you got all that all the cornstarch sifted through just drop your candies off into a hole here and then you can get your cornstarch box add your parchment again or back in the box and you're cute most of it and once your candies are dry take them off and just slip your parchment paper underneath it's just gonna catch the excess gonna catch the excess glaze so I've done this recipe a couple times using the tylose so I would recommend out of the two I would recommend going with the glaze and the reason is the tylose because we use water it makes them very well make sure candies very wet it does dry completely and that's not a problem but they are very wet they're very sly mean it makes them difficult to kind of work with and sticking the extra candies on so I think the glaze would be a lot better this you can definitely use if you can't get the glaze but I think they set the glaze would be better so a little bit so what you can do is you're going to grab your pastry brush dip her in and just kind of take off a bit of that access and you're going to go along and you're gonna dab it on your candies on your rope and you want to dab it you don't really want to brush because it will take the color off of the nerves their wallet water soluble so I think again using the glaze would help that with that issue once you get it get it blazed on you can fill in the little spots that are miss then just gently put them on and don't try and bustle it too much because I said it'll just kind of slip and slide off but just leave them like so and again we're just gonna dab that on and you don't get one they're wet you don't want to move them because if your ropes can fall apart they can break apart so but I said once they're dry they're really they're good so I know before I said okay we could use a pan to roll them in I found that method didn't work so well because I said after one or two it gets really wet and it makes it difficult to roll in so I found just pouring the freight from the box but is not the best method once you're happy with that that me and again you're gonna let those dry probably about 12 hours to overnight once they're dry they're good to go do not store your candies in ziplock baggies if it's especially for gummies it's not good you either want to store them in glass jars or in cell bags or the miler Ziploc bags those work really well so instead I'm gonna let those puppies dry overnight and I'll show you the finished product and here's our finished product so check them out look I hope they look just like the real things as I said we don't have live here so I don't hundred percent sure but looks like it from the pictures it looks like a lot of fun alright guys so I hope you enjoyed that recipe if you have any other

do this [ __ ] better so I can do in the next video alright peace out guys", "DuWDJEI1NZo": "this is Sofia because it's not the same thing as Facebook where they're just going to stream in I wonder if I can share this on my Facebook though but I really just want to do a video so I guess anybody who comes in and just pick up when they come in so I want to get this done all right I don't know if I'm gonna wait for any people to arrive I'm just gonna start doing what I'm doing and if someone comes in that's great okay I'm gonna be making Jolly Rancher edibles with canvas so what I'm gonna be using is tincture you can get from you dispenser re I made it myself if this is a THC Pro and chem dog what I do is I actually cook live plants I have an illness I have fibromyalgia so I cook with live plants and I cook cooked the plants for about 24 hours in palm palm leaf glycerin you can get it on Amazon or anything like that okay so we're going to be using the tensor that I made which is an indica indica for night time I usually I just got finished doing the day but I want one for the nighttime we're gonna use 45 Jolly Ranchers seems to be the best for the the molds that I have which are emoji I'll show you those so it's white die very just unwrap them when you unwrap them what's going to happen it's cool they're gonna go like this this is not gonna be the situation afterwards okay afterwards you're gonna wind up with you're gonna wind up it's gonna be a little bit more sticky so don't anticipate for them to be like this I keep the rapper's after I drop them so there's 45 of them I keep the rapper's I will show you afterwards they won't go in the same way like this they'll go in from the side and it's kind of like the same thing and I'll show you in the end how that's gonna work out now so I use 45 of these I use watermelon I get them from Amazon I love them then like my what about one's my favorite and Jolly Ranchers are by far my favorite and one of my fav one of my things was trying to get this recipe so that when I put in my liquid cannabis it stays more like a candy I must have gone through so many tries doing this and it winding up you can actually cook if you wanted to cook less of them you could get like a gummy candy but my fake teeth so I'm not using that I need to have a solid candy and be able to suck it all the way through and and you know what I don't really want to eat them like that because when you start to eat them like that though you can get a little bit carried away especially with like my Jolly Ranchers I like to have probably one every hour or so so I don't want if I said chewy candy I'll just chew it up but not with these teeth okay okay so 30 milligrams depending on what you want it's tin sure you can use the alcohol tin sure if you wanted to just the alcohol will burn off you could use I used cooking hash before and I would just throw it in and it almost didn't matter what how many how many Jolly Ranchers don't kind of glue up back up the same way okay so I'm also gonna add a Tama butter just to keep the facts rolling because cannabis stays glues itself just absolutely glues itself to any fatty substance that's why it's good for them to go into baked goods brownies and all that's fun stuff so okay we're gonna I'm gonna use my like nonstick pan just a little tiny pan it's not gonna take much the smaller almost the better because I mean really look I just this and it's gonna be on the bottom and you want to be able to keep control of this now this has been on D carved you need some decor of your cannabis most of the time if you're going to do almost any cooking with it except I cook fresh so what I do is I'm cooking it fresh for 24 hours which actually then activate the cannabis so that and furthermore I'm now gonna cook it again now if you do a cooking hatch or you're doing a concentrate it hasn't been activated yet so you need to make sure to stay in this pot for like 20 minutes and try to keep it on 300 for that 20 minutes if you do that you should be golden okay so we're gonna get started now and I'm gonna put it on on a very low I haven't looked at the stove so and I'm currently I have an electric stove with this I hate electric so I so much more prefer fire if I was cooking but now that I'm cooking cannabis I'm so glad to have a an electric stove okay so I'm gonna throw some butter in I'm gonna take my t-shirt here I'm taking in 30 gram 30 30 milliliters milligrams no I'm not exactly sure mm ml in grams okay so it is at 30 taking me a minute to get this going to make sure that it's the exact right consistency your marijuana after you're using it okay so here is gonna show you here is the what it looks like in the pan and then I'm gonna start to you see that yes so let's get this going and like I said it's on a medium very not even meet him he on like a three I have it on very very low I just want to get the butter into the tint tincture I don't suggest you use a I suggest using only plastic utensils with this because the candy when it when it becomes a solid again it's going to get into the wood it just the my wooden spoons are just not the greatest okay so now what I'm going to start to do is so now this is all ready now if you were gonna do this with a hash you would start with the butter and really make sure it's on low and then start to cook your Jolly Ranchers I'm shaking you guys like nuts I'm sorry alright let me hold this a little bit better see that looks good so like right now I can the marijuana smell is starting to come up into the house now it's not a heavy duty smell this is probably lighter than normal but if you are gonna have guests your house is gonna smell like marijuana you may not smell it but your guests will want to give my sister cookies in public she's always says that they smell this is just gonna take a minute but you gotta keep it going you got a he picky pick go in keep it go in and it's gonna be funny because it's going to once it gets totally liquid it's gonna be really easy to work with but it's gonna get not easy and fast go a little bit slower to and you can see that the water the texture is starting to get pink and I have one viewer on here hi how are you I hope you're enjoying this please share it I would okay even though I've had a ton of people asked me for this and now I can just point them in this direction and they will be able to go and make it I'm always being asked on my social media to do videos so now I am doing them I'm just doing them live I can't see any comments if there is any so we're getting there we're getting there were getting there once these get warmed up and get heated it's gonna like it gets very gooey very fast and then it gets really really easy to work with I was very surprised how easy it was for me to work with this once it got melted because I have I have fibromyalgia so my I incorporate cannabis into my life because I have fibromyalgia and I think just by far is the best medicine that I take I think it would definitely be the last one that I would allow them to take from me if I had the choice I still I'm all medicines and I'm really working hard to get the right dose going with the cannabis but the more I the more I I know the more that I eat it the better I feel so one of those I like to have a second candy so I wanted to make sure to have I actually had a company that I was buying from and they had something that was called Ranchers and it's by want to say baked it's the company but really nothing nothing for the amount that I was spending on them I could just cook it myself and be done with it I don't want to be bothered with having to put money in other people's pockets when I am gonna be leaving my own money in my pocket and being disabled I gotta keep as much money as possible all right we're starting to really Eric we're getting there we're getting there it's getting there it's getting there it's getting there but I like to show how it's going it entire time so that you understand what what it takes to and what it's going to look like and not just oh all of a sudden it looks like this no it's gonna take you a minute to stir it and start it start started started sir they still have these candies left to go so but as soon as this gets all liquidy I will be able to start throwing in more and they will liquefy much faster and of course I would normally use my other hand to hold this still which I'm holding the camera with just so you can see it right I should get a stand we are getting there see now look how easy it's getting to be worked with like this is just so much easier now and see how the the tincture is still like it's not mixed in all the way so if you were to do it like this you would really have to whip it and like if you wanted to do a smaller amount say I guess I took about half in there where you wanted to make it a chewy you would like really make sure that you whip it whip it whip it whip it whip it whip it whip it whip it whip it whip it and then put it in your mold but I didn't really need to do that because I am going to be keeping it solid usually I like throw maybe in a couple at a time but they almost all fell in anyway so I might as well just take it from there all right yeah I'm having a hard time because I normally just stick in a couple of something and I just said that no I said it twice and that's what will happen when you smoke cab as you'll say things twice some talking all right well hello hello my second person watching I'm so excited I cannot see comments right now if you are commenting there I have to push on the thing I have gloves on so I'm not gonna be able to see anybody comments but um please share [Music] everybody always wants to know how to make cannabis candy it's so easy so easy just so ridiculously easy now if you wanted to you could go to your dispensary buy like want to say an ounce of some nice you know some nice weed and cannabis marijuana pot have you wanna call it and you're gonna bring that home you would take a full pound of butter and first you would put the the cannabis in in a tin in a tin pan and you would put tinfoil over the top and then you would cook it bake it on low for [Music] see then it's not the recipe I'm just giving you extra because this is taking a long time you were D carve it so you put it in the tappan you put it in the oven with the tinfoil on top and then you bake it at like 125 so like 150 for two and a half hours no no no no you know what look it up on the internet I'm pretty sure it's one no no I'm so sorry this is not my recipe right now because I don't cook this way I always to cook with my pictures I don't ever use anything else so the fact that I'm trying to come up but this is old and I headed that's its problem okay so if you'll go to the Internet it's kinda butter and it really is just bake it you have to I think the baking in the oven could be for 25 minutes or can a be an hour of 25 minutes or two hours and 45 minutes I can't quite remember like I said it's not my forte I am going to make some kind of butter and get it right and then put it on live as well let me just put this down so I can get this going just first live ever so sorry for my one person who was watching alright I just needed to get in here a little bit like this but it's it's a very sticky but then you're gonna put the cannon we after you cook after you D carve it in your oven you're going to you're going to melt the pound of butter in like a saucepan and then put the cannabis into the butter now you died I think you're gonna cook for an hour and a half to two and a half hours I'm not exactly sure and then you would use the butter right into here and it would probably like even out you only want to use the wood you would be using like one stick so like an ounce and now it's a butter and that would be comparable to the tensor and then it would in my mind it would definitely come out the same way I don't see any reason why it wouldn't come out the same way all right all right but my one person is watching I don't know who you are but thank you so much for watching okay so here we are I see I still have a little bit there's still a couple in there but this is primarily what it looks like so it's not going to be as see-through as its start first started because we're use that we used butter so it has just a small tint on there this is so easy so so so easy yeah almost there I should have thought about this in the first place goes right into my crook of my arm here and I'm a little turning now see it's very I mean better than you would think it is but is when you're holding it but it is very easy to work with I was very scared that it was not going to allow me that I was gonna go get so stiff on me now you're gonna lose like a little bit like on the sides and whatever it don't really worry about that most of you medicine is gonna be in here it's gonna be nicely mixed okay so that's evenly evenly through all of your candy it's gonna be even it's not gonna be like there's a piece here and this piece here and this piece here and this piece there it's not gonna be stronger in one spot then it is gonna be in another so now these are gonna turn out to be about five milligrams of THC this might be ten I'm going you know what I'm gonna say it might be 10 because the I used the THC Pro and I used the chem dog which are you know pretty strong indica breeds strains so this one could be stronger it's not really intended to make for me it's just about kind of making it through the day with my pain so if I can put it on myself a little at a time that is just so much better for me and being that this is something that I like to I try to have to incorporate it into something that I like to do because I'm actually like handstand medicine until I was sick but cannabis just was not a part of my life I didn't do any drugs I didn't drink I didn't do anything but cannabis has just made a whole world of difference whether it just be for me being my fibromyalgia or the fact that I'm gonna have an attitude with my family and you know we're getting in there that the world is changing so see how we're getting now with that so good I love these they taste just so amazing I brought to my door and she was like no I don't want to eat it she really really doesn't what she likes to smoke it but she doesn't like the taste of it in her food so she put this one in her mouth and she's like oh my gosh this is so good okay so now what I'm gonna do is super spoon okay now I'm going to just hold you up here get this as good as possible kind of far away but alright I might have to put you back here alright so now at this point so easy mix it up still um okay now this is the special part because you want to get it in to the molds and put to the side is kind of as quickly Funko's you're gonna take off the heat so we are gonna go ahead and take off the heat I'm gonna leave it there okay for this second do this on the stove it'll just be easier to wash off so you I have emojis can you see that yes see they're emojis they don't really come out looking like that though they they kind of do but not really so they're adorable but they're also like all the other ones had like edges and I had one that have hearts on them and then it has the edge and then it's in my mouth and I really frickin hate that so alright okay so now you're just gonna take your spoon and just go ahead and stop putting it into the molds and that's about it feels like one spoonful almost wonderful but was CMI you see how bad I shake oh my goodness okay look because I want to not like have candy everywhere and of course with my shaking of course I do and at this point with my fibromyalgia I'm trying I usually yelling at my husband to help at this point oh I'm in so much pain but because I'm on here talking and I know someone is watching that my Adrenaline's running so I'm not in pain but I'm still shaking that also could be my nerves too from doing my first life fill my [ __ ] person it takes more Muslims more time to get this in here now I should be able to pick one out once I get them into both molds I should be able to pick one out and show you what it's going to look like should be almost cool by then I think might be yeah all right so this has this mold has 24 and so I'm doing 48 candies though I'm getting it everywhere okay seriously last time I did this I did not get this like this this is horrible I'm gonna put him gonna want to put this in my freezer after this into mist you can see it's true see you know what you know why because the spoon that I used last time was a little spoon that was like perfect every scoop fill was perfect this one's a bit larger and you know what I'm short if you know how to cook candy you're probably looking at me going holy God what the hell is this person doing she's just making like an absolute mess of it but I will show you that it looks like right now I still have the other ones that go so there we go okay so yeah I did get it everywhere cuz that's just the way it is now at this point I really need to get moving because it's starting to get solid on me you see the strings coming out that's it getting solid I'm just gonna let some heat go on that so it's not so bad because this is a horrible mess but you know what I'm gonna do right after it's done I'm gonna eat the candy that smoke that's upbeats because it still will come out perfect it's just on the side it's not a big deal still candy see I didn't do that last time I had nice what a mess alright it's alright here we go heat back on it cuz it's just a mess right now well it's hilarious see that stringy stuff should not be happening see that won't happen if you use a smaller spoon and it drops right off and it's like perfect at the zone I use is old and gross and I really don't want to show that to you guys so I don't want to show you that that's what I'm using because you should be used to make sure that like everything that you're using is good because this is your mess and it is going into your body it's just an old spoon and it has like it's like it says 65 year old spoon so you could just imagine you but it's clean and it's usable but it doesn't look like it's used I'm gonna wind up with less than 48 I think and I just think that's because I got them on all the sides but don't worry whatever you get into the hole this will go down into that area like and you still will have a good candy and you can like spread it although it just seems to be sticking to me but I'm sure that you could [Applause] see now I'm a little a little bit more salad [Applause] it's stupid super-sticky when you let it go this long okay I should be done by now super super sticky so see that so once it goes kind of past you got you just sometimes you're better and just get it done really you could put it into I would assume that you I could probably put it into one of those cake things that squirt it out but I am bought one I don't really big all right I know it's my blog right but it's so good all right [Music] and my face but I have candy on them [Music] okay so stove off I'm a dumbass is what it is the first one was pretty much better they're heavy alright so this is what we have I don't remember which side we started off with so I'm just gonna pick us up I'm gonna pick this side because there's a little one in here now I was still little and it's not wrong it's not cold enough I should have put it in the freezer while I was taking care of that alone I'd see it's gonna come out looking if I pop it out now they're not ready they're still warm you know I don't have it open okay so just you really don't need to put them in the freezer see this comes right off it came right off oh yeah it was just wipe it down and it comes right off with the pan just put hot water into the pan don't forget to lick the spoon okay so that's my lollipop but like the next hour I let this dry chemical right action this is what I know because it is a decent amount that's been here I'm just like okay so this was what's left over in the pan and I usually they look that behind because I'm gonna eat this for the next like half hour or so because I'm a high dose er today I didn't have any but normally when I'm going to cook I always wind up running out unless my oldest daughter is here and she will my youngest daughter will cook for me as well I just hate asking her because she works so much but at the time I am cooking something that means like I have not had like I didn't have any candies today because I really needed to cook but I didn't get my approval to do my online my life until today so I just waited I don't know why I don't want to take the tension or just regular like in my cup or something but so this is like a big lollipop in the end so you can't take heed that's all but normally I would like to start off with a candy and then and then I would probably maybe have one every hour every couple of hours and if I haven't had something all day then I'm looking to have something more like 25 milligrams or above by the end of the day I usually hope to have a BMI system around a hundred and fifty milligrams which is just perfect for my body my [ __ ] body feels really really good at the end of the day I'm never actually stoned your body it doesn't edibles don't really work that what's in some edibles could really like send you into another space furthermore these edibles could also do that em it really depends on your tolerance it depends on how much them how long have you've been doing it you know someone actually could be there they're just even one thing just and you could smoke it and smoke and smoke it and then edibles will just not work for you so but for me they work really really good with my fiber males I really really really enjoy the fact that I have something that's more on the holistic side to working and that I can make any medicine so this was my video on how to make Jolly Ranchers go over real quick again I used my own

where I got the cheesecake ready now this is my version of the ultimate cheesecake it's based on a Dairy Queen cheesecake ice cream they do in New York a royal New York cheesecake ice cream and it's to die for so yeah I'm a dis because of that I love the stuff and I tried to get something you know on those lines so it's not just the cheesecake it's a cheesecake ice cream but uh the the one from Dairy Queen it's got it's got the vanilla ice cream it's got little chunks it's like cheesecake bites it's got fresh strawberries with like a syrup right down through the core and then it's got this graham cracker mixed in the graham cracker is quite pronounced is it's really good so in this recipe I'm putting a little bit more graham cracker in it and I've obviously tasted opening on it all day and it tastes fantastic is it for once I've got a cheesecake round taste the graham cracker and it really does something to it real good I can taste the strawberry as well as been steeping for about 15 days I think it needs 21 days but I'm ready to put this one I taste great and it can only get better after steeping so anyway like further ado let's go ahead and start mixing first of all I put the recipe up for you okay recipe is up and I'll display that right here like I normally do the recipes also going to go up on ELR which is a liquid recipes comm there will be a link in the description for it it will go into the premium Dropbox folder kind of store all the recipes in that's there's a link to that the bottles the scales the label maker the handheld frother best thing you see me working with here and I have links to where to get that from as well in the description because I get asked a lot you know what skills you use where hey where'd you get that froth or - where's your label maker come from so all of that now is in the description so hopefully we've got as much information as I can give you but anyway let's go over go ahead for this video and I don't want it to be too long I want to give you guys the recipe I want to make it nice and quick and and that's what it's all about is getting this cheesecake guide to you so let's go ahead and get it done first off is vanilla bean ice cream by capela we've got 2% which isn't much but I find it just about is enough to give it that um that taste you know and above all it is a cheesecake I didn't want to drain it with ice cream it's just uh I think just - nothing known it makes it very creamy now some people get a peppery taste from this one I've never had it personally if you don't have this one by the way you could use TFA's and it'll be an ice cream but yeah if you get a peppery taste from it even swap it out to one you don't get a peppery taste from or get rid of it and up the amount of New York cheesecake by maybe a person or two and and up the vanilla swirl from half a percent to one percent maybe a little bit of sweet cream or something just a little bit maybe we know one one and a half two percent or something just to fill in but uh that's if you don't have that if you get the peppery taste from it I know some people do and they don't like it so I thought there that in mind and kind of let you know what I'd do if I wasn't using it anyway vanilla swirl again cheesecake to me has its basis vanilla a little bit too much there's only half a percent of weight not that far over neither strawberry strawberries difficult I mean it's easy to add when you shake in vape it's kind of very strong and pronounced but when you're steeping it after its steeped it kind of just fades away and drops into the background and very hard to taste the only time you really taste is when you've got like a clean palate you know first thing in the morning after you've adds you know eaten something strong or something like that it's fun if I'm vaping other stuff like lemons and things like that I don't taste it okay if I come on over to this one or come on over the little gay vibe in this one I do get the strawberry a bit more now I have only been steeping for fifteen days which is normally enough for the strawberry to fade off but I am getting the strawberry so that's good and I'm combining them on doing 6% all very sweet and 3% strawberry ripe and I find that that's not a bad not bad combination I used to do it the other way around I just put more strawberry right and strawberry sweet but recently I found this to work anyways this will be sweet going in a way capella and it's going in at 6% I'll only do in a thirty milk bottle because I already have a couple of thirty milk bottles made up and I have like this is version six of this one I have like version three four and five and six not there in my drawer over there the other versions are very good so I am vaping those as well so I didn't want to make too much of this off the bat Plus even if I did need a whole bunch of it I would we do a 30 mil mix online on but online on video don't want to be putting in tons and tons of flavoring okay just takes longer otherwise alright next thing is creamy yogurt I like to put this in if you think of a cheesecake it's cream cheese right and if you spread cheap cream cheese on a bagel it's got like a little tart note a little little sour note to it the cheesecakes that I've tasted use don't have that you know they're very sweet they kind of change they do taste the Cheesecake you know you get a British it will be with them if you're lucky but you don't get that little hint of it being cream cheese and I find that this one just a little bit just half a percent really adds that to it I did start off putting a 1% and out that Brookes great as well but a half a percent is just enough just to add something to it and the next thing you are eat Euston a cheesecake a juice never has enough graham cracker in it but this one has and you can taste the graham cracker this is a one and a half percent of graham cracker by flavor West which is a strong graham cracker and it's a it is a real graham cracker you know crunchy crust that's what it tastes like so it reminds me of soul and I put that one in I have got some graham cracker clear going in as well which is everybody sir seems like everybody's favorite is a great one basically Scott it's not got some pronounced crunchy graham cracker to it and it's kind of got a caramel e smell to it but it is nice it's nice and sweet and I thought it's still nice to blend it with the other one just err just just to make it that final kind of graham cracker which is got the crunch but it's also got where if you think of a cheesecake nap it's very hard to get the crunch and keep the base together if you make a cheesecake and I didn't make cheesecakes very hard to get both this one kind of reminds me about if you still need something to bind it which is normally butter butter and sugar I think that's where the caramel flavor comes in okay New York cheesecake by capela just 3% this is a cheesecake and you think wow just 3% yet if you look at all you of her ingredients in here they're not much it set for the strawberry because the strawberry dies off so quick after it's steeped so I've Kaizen have kept the strawberry up there and just kept everything else and lower because I know the strawberry is going to weaken and then it kind of comes down and and comes down level with everything else you've got and it works so 3% is there's plenty okay last one for me is a ethel model or equal mode or wherever you want to say it it for me it sweetens the strawberry sweets in the mix a little bit without using sweetener sucralose or anything by that it's a I don't like the taste of artificial sweetener there's something about it it just makes everything so sweet and just ruins it for me so I normally use that for model or ether model I like to say evil model so that's what I'll call it m e M if you don't have a full model then um cotton candy has it in a cotton candy is mostly ether-wall also use a cotton candy if you have it if you don't have the actual evil model and if you like your um if you like your sweeteners then go ahead and use a sweet / sweeten it to taste you know I don't it's sweet enough for me but uh some other people it may not be sweet enough and if you want it more like that premium juice you're going to want it sweet so well sweeten it the taste however much you normally put in a mix okay next thing you notice I am mixing the gloves I do have the nicotine going in nicotine's just starting the darken up a little bit is how I've come to the end of the bottle I do have some more time but it's a so I actually put in three point two eight percent when I asked what it worked did I as a nice perfect because I want a little bit extra because obviously it's lose it lost its potency obviously the nicotine put it into how you normally have it I use three milligrams so that's what I'm going with or just a touch more exciting my nicotine's probably lost its kick a little bit plus I don't mind it being up as much as four sometimes you need a four or five when you've had a bad day and that does it for me your skin it it's getting a little bit off there okay put that back put it away and okay yeah nicotine is not something to mess around with I used 100 milligram strength nicotine and it will make you pretty sick if you get in on your skin and it is no joke you see are these other mixers wearing gloves and saying about how bad it can be and it really is I've had it on me and it's no joke so be careful with it and I'm using a hundred percent VG base so by the time this is all said and done because there's PG in the flavorings and I think we've got somewhere like eighteen percent sand like that you know I'm looking at like a eighty two eighteen VG PG mix obviously if you like a 70/30 and stuff like that you know adjust it to add a little bit of PG to it you know people worry about when they doing this 70/30 or a 60/40 that they need to change the flavors if you changing it from mathematically like from a fifty to a fifty fifty or something we've got a lot more propylene glycol we know which carries the flavors a lot better then by all means maybe drop the flavorings a bit like word now it's still even where they are I don't you know you're just up something a little I ain't gonna hurt anything it may help that strawberry at the end of the day okay remember the links to this father is in the description okay I've got some warm water here watch it with that up ahead of a number on it hi folks well I think I said oh let's put a label on it let me put the tip on it first turn the scales off slide them right away phone off let's take the gloves off okay I've already got the label actually made so we're ready to go just need to print it and again this is a DiMeo letter tag that will be in the link below and the description below the link will be in the description below I knew what I meant okay anyway go ahead give it a go let it steep for two three weeks then come back put your comments in here and let me know what you think of it I mean be honest I'm fine I can if you don't like it or if something missing from it by all means for me it's perfection but not everyone's taste buds are the same I absolutely love this stuff there we go one strawberry cheesecake ice cream I focus I appreciate you joining me and you've got any questions stick them in the comments below and join me for the next one that the lucky dip that we have every Friday and I said I'm going to postpone it to Sunday well today Sunday but this thing was ready so I had to put it out I think I'm just going to leave it for another week we'll go ahead and do it Friday there's not many comments on the last one so go go into the last one see what the format's like and that and put down what you would like me to mix underneath and and then maybe have a few more to pick from but anyway until then have a great day enjoy the rest of your weekend and I'll see you real soon", "-7N80ptxDCk": "hi everybody it's Brad with big family homestead and in this video we are making candy sweet awesome simple easy candy so let's get to it that's right we are making candy some friends of mine at church said they really liked watching these silly videos we make up and and all the different desserts and and sweet things but they said also that they like watching Animalia videos too so I started thinking to myself how could we do this I came up with the perfect solution cooking with animals how about that we're going to cook up some candy with animals how crazy and fun is that going to be if you're wondering has he lost his marbles the answer is probably yes but we're going to still cook some candy ax it's awesome it's easy basically going to show you the ingredients we're going to do it fun easy cheap cheap cheap and you should be able to make it and you know it only takes like 10 minutes so this is awesome stuff okay so four ingredients as always or generally speaking I should say if it's a complicated recipe I generally don't make it and this one is very very basic you really only have four things that are going to make this candy up you've got two cups of granulated sugar 2/3 cup of light corn syrup 3/4 cup of water and then some kind of a flavoring I'm going to show you up close what I got here this is a raspberry flavoring but it's from my believe Lord and Lord and oils raspberry flavor and you can use whatever you want I've even seen people using essential oils and all kinds of other things but we use those because it's pre-made pre-measured out easy to do I think it costs like 50 cents or something really really small so there you go ok for tools its basic stuff you're basically going to need a saucepan a spatula and you're going to need a cookie sheet or whatever kind of form you want to pour it into if you're going to make lollipops you could get little forms for them or dinosaurs or even ape-like looking things that would be crazy candy candy apes but yeah anything whatever floats your boat you will also need a thermometer to monitor the temperature of your soon to be deliciousness in candy yay okay now that we've got our ingredients sorted we're going to heat up our saucepan and I'm going to need help from my lovely assistant David because it would be truly a silly thing for me to be cooking with a rabbit in my hand so here is my lovely assistant David ha the hammer the cannon DJ magic snappy pants whatever you want to call up so he's getting the saucepan ready and we've got our thermometer because basically all you're going to do is you're going to heat these ingredients up to 300 degrees they're going to boil then as it's cooling down you're going to stir in your lovely raspberry Ness for us it's raspberry nice it's whatever flavoring you want and that's it then you put it on your tray it'll spread itself out and as it cools down you cut it so here we go let's get it going over a medium-high heat so now as David's putting ingredients in I want to make a note there if you see that thermometers stick the sticky thermometer you basically don't want it touching the bottom or also will give you a false reading but you do want to make sure that's fully into your mixture here and in goes the water and now it's simply a waiting game as the temperatures coming up to 300 degrees you do want to make sure that you're stirring it regularly you're looking for a boil make sure that you're checking that temperature you don't want to get it too hot or you will burn it now you do want to keep stirring but when when you reach 260 degrees then you're going to stop stirring because it's going to continue to elevate in temperature that's already at a mass a critical mass critical critical mass and it's going to keep getting hotter so basically at 260 you stop and then it should start to clear up okay so we have just now crested the 260 degree mark so we will no longer be stirring we will still be waiting oh yes we will be waiting alright so now we're keeping an eye on the temperature like good little Scouts that we are but keep in mind that the last few degrees the last 10 15 degrees jumped quickly so you got to be ready to get this off the heat then you're going to stir it up again as you add your flavoring and then on to your form we just crested 300 degrees we've taken our goo off the heat we're adding our flavouring we're going to stir it up and pour it into what we're using for form is just our cookie sheet so we're going to take that thermometer off there be careful keep in mind this is 300 degrees stuff and if it sticks to you it will stick for a while it will burn the stew out of you be very careful so here we go now we're like I said we're just using a cookie sheet for our form because we're going to cut it into squares you just pour it on and it will spread out just like that now some of you might be saying yourself right now hey inner chubby guy why don't you lick the spoon that would be a terrible idea it might tear off your tongue it's very hot don't do it resist the urge all right let's see if this thing is cooled down it's been about 15 minutes what you do is you just take a regular little pizza cutter you're going to score this yeah like that into whatever size of shapes pieces you want now if it's not see that if it's not ready it'll just kind of blob back over itself and the idea is not you're not cutting it we're just trying to get it to a score so that when it actually does get completely hard then it will break apart very easily now if you let this go too long it will start to break right away so there's a sweet spot it's usually about 10 or 15 minutes oh so you look started to blob back together the edges are fine I got to wait so we'll wait another five now at this point it's all gridded up and it's not going to blob together anymore and if you were a normal person you would just let that sit there for a good 40 minutes or whatever but well let's just say I'm abnormal and I'm also not very patient so into the freezer you go baby all right so we very impatiently waited and reluctantly waited and waited and now it's done it's ready so basically you can just take and crack it bust it out of here however you need to do it I can sometimes get under here with a knife which was exactly one we'll do right now so now you have made candy delicious delicious candy one more step that we do is well actually take some powdered sugar and dust this stuff with it shake it around I mean this this little container is not big enough we'll do it in a bigger container but the reason for that is it helps it not stick together which is really nice so there you have it folks cheap easy delicious homemade candy it literally cost us maybe 50 cents for everything and in the great part is you know what you're getting you know there's no nasty weirdo chemicals no asbestos or fungal material well anyway I hope you liked the video and the animals so there you have it I'm Brad with big family homestead please pass the video around yes we're silly it's just silly here anyway have an amazing day that is one lazy dog one lazy dog indeed", "SYzvvuMq3qI": "at last the elusive square strawberry you see this you see this glorious bounty of fruit that I've collected for you well if you

life has probably seen one of these things you might have even eaten one of them whole if you're gonna be this old lucky but finding out the name of these things was actually quite difficult to do because I've seen these everywhere I've seen them in suspicious candy dishes nobody knows exactly when the strawberry bonbon first came into existence some people say the 50 some people say the 60s some people say nothing at all because they're stuffed with too many strawberry bonbons and it seemed the Reaper has come too so what he made and others like me just assume they're one of those candies that was always around it's probably older than the earth itself let's go ahead and cracks bad boy half nah yes assha boy with that cough drop swag strawberry bonbons you might as well call them strawberry sticky bonds because these things are sticky stickier than the desk below my computer chair these things had almost two mousetrap like sticky appendage to it ah and remind me of getting some sort of delicious strawberry milkshake at a local corner shop I'm eating a lot of cough drops in my life and I can tell you right now they're all awful but they all pretty much look like this the demographic that they seem to be going for is the guy that's had a flu for the better part of ten years and it has never seen with that hot water ball on his head and you know what it's an ambitious demographic and one that is surely right for a for strawberry goodness let's go ahead and take a taste oh my god that's so good that is so good bunny into the strawberry bonbon is like biting into a giant piece of cotton candy there's hints of cherry soda in there there's hints of strawberry in there and the crunchy crunchiness I love let me give you the crunchy crunchiness listen

are juicy bursting with strawberry sweetness and a tart lemon flavor that's just right I wasn't wincing or pinching my lips while chewing on this gummy like I might with other sour candies if you're looking for that experience though I'd suggest mixing this gummy with some sour patch kids medicinally wanna sour gummies provide a one-to-one ratio of THC and CBD per gummy this translates to a medicinal experience that's both mildly euphoric and relaxing used a few hours before bed this gummy is excellent for distressing after a tough day it's also great for inflammation relief rest and sleep euphoria creeps up with this one building to a crescendo about an hour or two after eating the edible I could initially feel a slight headband effect that grew in intensity before peaking and slowly dissipating this was followed by immediate pain and stress relief overall I rather loved one a sour gummies they are great for the evening providing gentle euphoria inflammation relief and smooth relaxation before bed if you've been searching for a good gummy edible be sure not to miss this one final rating 4.9 out of 5 be sure to LIKE and subscribe below or share this video on reddit

don't even know why it says gummies maybe that's French for something else cuz they're not gummies they're like those sour liquorice strapped or not licorice but the sour strap things that sounds Donna she's just getting out of the shower I don't know if I told you guys that she was in the shower but she was in the shower and that's her getting out so if you heard that just ignore it hey anyway yeah there's those like those sour straps you know you got him at the candy store but they're not sour though this sweet and they stink bad anyway YouTube was down today for me I don't know for

knife goes for fifteen to twenty-five dollars you could check it out yourself hope I said that right you could check it out yourself [ __ ] I hope I'm not [ __ ] this up but anyway you could find that for fifteen to twenty-five dollars online but today I got lucky and found for five dollars and 80 cents Canadian free shipping and after I placed the order with the tax it was six dollars and something cents and his brand new comes in the box and all that [ __ ] I'll even show you which says it's somewhere here right there new brand new unused unopened undamaged item and I don't know if

do you feel about it let me see your hands are they shaking like a surgeon he's ready no problem yeah you guys so Terry told me you guys are gonna split them into like three different color groups and then kind of mix them like like yeah it's gonna mix a couple colors of together okay yeah and this was inspired because of loft watching you know love to pursue its Greg you're gonna give it a whirl yeah we're gonna it won't be like his butt no you don't say that we'll see you want goodbye for you golfing you're ready everyone's been saying that very sorry he's wrecked out for this out to nor shall counter to and let's then come it's a holy Angra needs its cereal this smells really good so what is the actual flavor barium punch orange if you're saying old cliche and gummy go punch somebody all the time I would say couple sets back there so why are we hitting up there the cool entails because we're going to divide this into three pieces we're each gonna man our piece or woman it depending on what you are but we're gonna so we're gonna color it but then we get this whole it and then come back here and swap some colors just sitting around a little complicated exactly so this is gonna buy us a little bit of time by not letting it get too cold hopefully Thank You Ronnie no no no back in the kettle for a second we probably don't want to be you know we aren't gonna be mixing them all on here I think it's time so we're a little squirt down here a little squirt there they told you about these bubbles the clown middlesex let you do all this oh wait every time I shoot a video oh hey well yeah not necessarily every time you shoot a video could be every - ah - - every time I hear that could just be my thing I'm not known for being perfect hey Steve I said I'm not known for being perfect yes you are yeah yeah ouch so what is he right now actually no that's my wonderful son from another mother one of many your collector right yeah I have a collector of sons so what was your question I've seen Greg he'll like yeah but then it almost looks like he's holding on to the corner with I don't know we want to be quite that tricky well I'm just trying to think like like whenever we try to split the batches this is more liquid than typical and whenever we do it we have to pull the batch away as we're cutting it otherwise it comes back together no no we'll figure it out maybe or unless we don't we might just have brown tie dye earthtones panic max noises [Music] requite panting yeah give it a minute you will there's so many things that could go wrong here man what are we gonna do it trust me this could affect us for the rest of our lives at least for the next couple of minutes yeah well that looks really easy mmm it is I'm just making about what I do okay so we've got a nice warm ish table which is gonna come in handy oh it's warm make sure everybody else is ready okay okay max oh that didn't really work though yeah it's terrible how we gonna keep it separate yeah you're right hey Steve may be different yeah I mean know your books so hard you're gonna have this little piece of candy here well if your name is Greg it takes you one if you're so far it takes three but we might do put the camera down another stop oh I guess we should be telling what's going on here okay so we're taking the challenge that we gave Greg we're taking the challenge back we're gonna make tie-dyed okay - we're poaching his techniques we studied the game film you saw how Greg did and we're like okay well I don't think we one person wants to do that she really wanted to make tie-dye but you can figure it out so she was like oh so we have first of all you gotta know your color wheel okay so we're taking our primary colors of blue red and yellow pulling them on the hook then we're coming back to our warm tail so we couldn't do it without this whole cooling table but right now and put hot water through here so it's a warming table so gonna we're gonna each take a turn and pull our handy on the hook then when we come back we're gonna swap pieces out we have to make orange so I'll take your head hash yellow mix that up in the orange I'm gonna make purple so I'm gonna take half half red make purple then we're gonna take meat green which will be half blue half yellow make green I'll see that again I will do it Steve I think my head's spinning honey make orange orange yeah I don't know what that is that's adopted now we still gonna use the welding gloves or where we just use pull out right here magic don't make me come after you the colors always been really awesome alright not bad it's like a mini competition everyone's gonna have to fall in luck candy triathlon yeah dude I've been losing for a candy little bit so yeah I can't do that I think it's because of the color cuz that's that's kind of what I'm using to to allow me to do mine oh the stupid stick yeah oh it's the biggest batch of ever thrown I don't know my arms are getting shaky believe in yourself no believe in the heart of the cards huh it's kind of weird I gotta tell you really tense we're tested you in yeah I'll hit the camera don't test me all right how red are we going here is this just leave it here should I give you someone who should we swap our colors now I mean what do you think I think this is pulled enough yours actually does already look like Oh what's my name again Wow this is the right color yeah well I need somebody hit hammer hammer time we've decided that I don't have to pull mine so what we're gonna do now is we're gonna divide our little colors into thirds and we're start so we're gonna play the swifty swappi game okay okay so if we do this man this is huge it's roughly it doesn't have to be even remotely even just come close is that gonna work off thirds well just let me feel that there doesn't have to be even no I mean the colors at the end we know we're gonna make it no we're gonna make a flat layer so if there's two thirds going into orange but we have to give red I have to give one red and one red so then the the secondary colors will be twice as much as the primary today that's what and these two together are gonna equal turf all this is me and I'm gonna give you I don't really care come on it was ripped off that's true what mix mix this these together mix them together they're gonna be equal great no maybe some mixed some neat I like this just mix them together to remember as a kid having later that was it okay this is alright I won't get in trouble yoanne oh you're gonna get in trouble anyways Max is coming together really cool yeah that's right I'm cooler than you guys said yeah yeah I want turn an orange orange alive right because I'm stronger and faster I'm not gonna do that although my arms is a little close to red so we'll keep it oh I'm trying look at the stripes we don't want start well mix it up do you like you do I want to try yours that's looking green that's what we're she's like a platinum purple right now I guess we can start off Oh Greg uses a rolling pin do we have a rolling pin - quick the scheme Jim I was gonna say miss Carla theorist oh we're just hanging okay yes we don't do we have never a dull I'll take it if it wasn't labeled Oh doesn't say for candy only hey this is green no okay that's it so everybody make your stuff black guys want this cause I'm gonna use my rhythm method I just found my thumbnail okay I'm just gonna decided the order that we're gonna kind of stiff for us to be pulling let's pair hurry up let's see if he'll do purple on top of the orange hair and this does not have to be exact light dark light dark really handsome colors anyway this feels like like an airhead or something it's you know Steve has said that this is ixnay on the even candy ray and as we turned this one into ribbon candy what you want the red right next to the orange we'll take your greens Wow Wow I'm on God give us the cruddy okay yay teamwork no we're not out of the woods yet any work no whoa she's curling it to make the tie-dye circle and then we'll form it into a triangle for dodge yeah have you like watch the video no I made this all up from my brain big brain okay it's all for you now I do the honors well you can do [Music] that means no one met speaker i means I don't know misty please don't make me please don't make me I'm so nervous I could it also screw it up [Music] can't wait any think just like a newborn baby 21 pounds and 3 feet long oh we have to taste this - yeah I think you know think it'll stay nice and soft in front of the heat from your lips to God's ears I'm sure listen I'm trying to I'm willing the positivity into this candy all right cuz it looks too good to not work please triangles bro that looks so cool oh wow yeah look it there it is there it is that's the way it is that's the way it so Steve how do you think it's coming out looks pretty neat yeah I like it probably look really cool in the the packages cuz I know that Terry said that she wants to do packet sets some of this in the fruit and friendly ones and then their own tie-dye yeah so it'll be cool to see an entire package full of these rainbow sick it's not burning my mouth you finally got something right to you all these years I took all day are you sneaking some already Terry you can see me I knew you couldn't stand you can stay away from the tie-dye tie-dye tees good this is Kara hey everybody it's Dylan I was just sitting here doing my edit of the hard candy video and realized when I was doing this taste test with Kara that there was some music playing in the background typical me I didn't realize that that was music going on and we can't have that in the videos so I just wanted to do a little voiceover let you know that kara loves the hard candy she loves the fruit punch flavor and she can't wait for the second without telling me I think they still do that I think they do have I think my kids a lot of a die I always just hit the reset button how do you know because of the way it birds can fly north so any direction and it's totally up to them I think what I'm excited about is the next guy see what happens you know and that's the coolest part is like I think a lot of people think that you guys would be like test it once it works out perfectly or something you know what I mean or you doing it's the best way and then when we keep trying to it make things better yeah keep giving the riddles and stuff that we make all the time we're always trying to well I mean you guys did cashew and peanut brittle this time and then recently just fixed and brittle yeah and that's like that's my new favorite yeah that's also I never knew how good it was and then we did it it was like my eyes were opened yeah first time we got the first batch man the first batch yeah I bought you can't send a little too early but they tasted like Oreos man the whole what it tasted like Oreos to me I know everybody else they call me crazy [Laughter] yeah oh wow Alec it all nice work men yeah it looks like s you candy just wait a sec it's all or a cute boy yeah oh wow yeah you're right I got a blanket over looks just like that maybe we're a little biased I think it's pretty cool while we're making very nice trip you really like who's hot Oh hot I was always on the ball pulling over tow he's a little fruity he's okay with citrus [Music] it's pretty cool worried about that almost coming through analysis very 70s yeah well yeah it looks completely different now yeah just from like the last like series mission so now yeah does it for 70s Steve you're a superstar max you did it work okay I mean as in like handling it yeah look it's a little cold yeah but I don't max was a little concerned we got quick Steve on the candies probably if you wait until this cameras off we're gonna tell you I really I mean wallah sir last time you did this get you miscounted in the audience oh really I did miss count four right yeah oh and they caught you they were like thank you you put it and I counted I go so there's no - number two right number two are we doing anything different this time I know I'm gonna arrange the colors a little differently okay and then put into a triangle already done okay yeah I mean it came out awesome but we're real close we're just gonna make more colors oh it well it's just we'll learn it might take us a couple times to get it down okay that's good some of my extra students actually max I just wanna log in to the table want to keep it up - he may be of this pose setup it's pretty cool toward equity oh I'm hoping I want yeah all right we're saying watch our heads like ironically to each other but you really should watch yeah you're behind they do yeah I kicked it back last time that I wanted hit the bear line [Laughter] [Music] what are you thinking about yeah he showed us how to make orange image candy we showed him our technique it's like did we show them how to do a little different something that was so last year I can't rely seems like we're gonna use off-color crops I think yeah let's color - yeah slip I almost busted my butt there no I think you got a crack in it I know I think it said I might supposed to be that I don't know the times you're floating back isn't a bad even this one's in the back you can sell a piece of art I'm thinking less color seriously I'd say take some out yeah I'm going yeah take some not just scoop it out did it again did you get that at drop me yeah I got three four three now yay no I don't think it's another batch okay let's snip it and mix it I don't think this we're gonna mix either Oh fiddlesticks very sticky on my fingers they'll be sticky finger Terry that's really not what I need to be known as it's better about them Terry who runs she runs their walls [Applause] [Music] it's at 1:22 no know if it's gonna stay at this I don't know I'm just gonna get cool enough for us to throw so do you wanna put a lot of cold water longest I actually want us there it's all mixed up and you want it to win get the point where you want it to be cooler just bring it over here how sticky is here man I'm like Ronnie's like in a canvas well yeah well it's not okay it'll be all right I keep sticking like right in the middle here well basically the Sun is your colors on me that's right Mike I don't cause of color and that's kind of widows boom it'll still be a Primerica sticks to the canvas all right why would it because it's so really that's not oh and I think this video why she's had to be split for parts she said one half and then I don't and I think it'll help us with the color distribution this definitely had some heavy heavy colors in that last batch or you know we gotta throw them first it's still a real toast it feels better that be interesting to see how this yellow turns out to perfect well the longer that we throw it the better it'll go more like pastel I thought you didn't want to be noticed - he finger Terry so we do want to go extra pastel yeah we will go as past those I don't know how do you think Dylan is that changing color anymore Wow looks like it might have change it might i think it's hit it to limit i've been watching in free pass already we got another challenge or approaching oh okay now last time this turns real quick you know if i want to hook it the way i usually do because it's so small it's kind of harder when it's smaller takes a lot of focus years of training oh yeah they get twice a week for the next year all right toys a week making somebody use the hammer for a minute mommy told me where it is at our front so all right right there right there I see it that's good thank you I'm watching it like so much so as you guys can see there's a lot of multitasking max you're just doing some more handful on you yeah sure hey let's get it off of that hold on you're right okay hammer right yeah that yellow looks a lot different from the first time obviously smear in it so what what are we cutting these into just like you did before Mex it has a different ratio and I don't see how that is when really we're doing we're gonna need six pieces so hopefully colors are gonna be two parts right [Music] [Laughter] [Music] that's your purple okay who's on first nobody is the problem what's on second oh I know who's on first stay Brown I see you've got us beat this time I didn't understand I didn't Steve looks like I felt so wrong doing I think I'll pay the rent no so we're gonna go dark light dark light light and I can get eco six right say that again I know you told me in between batches you had an idea for how you wanted to try and oh yeah no no okay I think if I Steve Steve's away this time and then okay if we you know still wanna experiment I was thinking if we did it like spokes on a wheel then the outside layer would be evenly distributed for the colors well we are gonna do this twice a week next year some of the true-true yeah okay so I must let's start with orange on the bottom where can we do a difficulty on the bottom actually orange on the bottom last time on then it was mostly orange okay what color would you like to do max okay yellow we could build it like a backwards quick whoever's watching write down in the comments which one you wanted yeah so that we can see your comment a week from now yeah run do it in rainbow colors am I one to start late darling let's have yellow next Lakers candy yeah that's accurate going for her hopes do that one else sure can now hold on that's a stretch yeah whatever Network top Seattle you guys are making just too long it doesn't have to be a hundred percent it's okay if it's random ish let's do orange next okay so we're just kind of you know saying like we're still doing it order it's like did somebody say something about cutting this whole mess in half and then no I said that don't care you know okay I don't want to I don't want to mess with the UH okay what's not terrible you know what I'm saying it would have more colors than it would later yeah so I trust you for what right so what does that mean sure all right okay here you go Steve quick you know I got a half an hour what's she trying to say I think she's just pulling our collective chance to put in too much color yeah yeah let's do another batch after this yeah another that got enough less we need more or less more or less he's trying deleting it right here and now [Music] start to go down no yeah just kind of keep it super green guac okay ground beef Mindy lettuce there's some lettuce there's some corn pork a new porky suckered in porky [Laughter] you're a big meanie yeah how's that feel huh you big meanie that's the look at those it looks like one big image on there and then not leave on any more joke's on you [Music] we'll wrap it up right at for anything less Jason Joey don't wanna fall backwards to try to make Fanta phone select roasting this like indicators that's what I was thinking yeah as long as you you're just got to push this much of it but but also trying to keep it separate so too it should be separate though could you guys put it separately right he'll take the clip well okay I mean max I'll take the credit yeah the yellow is making it a lot a lot more vibrant I know it it almost reminds me of two is uh oh is that zebra bubblegum seems right all right subscribers like that right like

under 45 percent all day so huh pretty toasty the past couple of days on with me that had something to do with it yeah first couple armed agents number heard you guys were scared yesterday tornado warning yeah actually I got an alert on my phone oh yeah first I thought that it was saying I was gonna be I was approaching like my data limit and I was like just for NATO warning oh I was like I don't know I was like I'm not really gonna take it very seriously just because is weird like in this we're pretty close to the city like winds have a very hard time looking up you know next to the city right and also it's Syracuse yeah and I live the Kansas yeah still you get a message it's like there's tornado heading your way but you know there is not there wasn't an actual tornado there's any potential nobody seemed that the rotation on the radar so that's why they were like oh nobody has seen it touchdown but yeah yeah it was like I was like 15 minutes the winds weren't even like super high it was mostly just raining yeah oh man that rain came down yeah that's crazy but I guess if I started hearing like the walls creaking and stuff okay I'll go downstairs but I didn't hear like any wind really I mean I I was like worried about it like that but I was like glued to the window like I wanted for a phone o clock yeah well it said that it was coming from the east so I was like [Music] we didn't go to the basement but then we went down there and we were like why do we come down the basement yeah well our basement was not as fun hopefully the Simpsons are taking yeah oh yeah I played that and wasn't really that fun we got over it pretty quick because they basically you just move and then you jump and then you attack and those are the only buttons and then like I played the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle game that Karen I grew up playing did you play - oh yeah no we didn't have you oh you didn't have you oh well basically what the want Athiya at the laundromat oh oh well when I went to Milwaukee it was a hat I played some Simpsons game and then I also played the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle game and wasn't as fun as I remember yeah I guess when when you're little and you're just used to the NES and you haven't had the Xbox one yet you're like wow this is great look at the graphics look at all eight of the pixels this is 16-bit we said this Looney tune for the NES at daycare like we never had one the blouse and I don't know why but I could think about that game so much recently I'm ready to drop like 50 bucks I wish game it was like a Looney Tunes basketball game we used to love project raisin no I remember it was like the airplane game there's like a 2d airplane game Oh oh man yeah and that was awesome and the plates of like great you could like match them up or something yeah do you remember the one the car won and like you'd be wait you're like driving down the highway I think you were trying to like get away from the police or something and there's like a certain the police would catch up to you or something and then there would be like a semi or a semi you know truck and you drive into the bed change your color and you come back out oh no that's like the only part of that game that I've ever taken oh yeah you don't member what game that was oh okay all right so is that kind of all put together then just to walk okay yeah that's candy right there so three and four three and three-quarters just uh first I never make anything one another we did it once before but dreams are hard and pillows wow look at that that looks so cool on the fruit even gonna be able to do like a green green piece like if it's all just talk well it smells so good yeah it does not really good it's got strawberry what's most on the Jolly Rancher like watermelon Jolly Rancher yes always have a work to do great we need someone videotaping me videotaping you guys [Laughter] here yeah chance possible help it maybe we'll just do a green stripe watch your hand oh maybe we did paint body because it's already things okay so it seems it pink by the green stripe can you still make it green though like with mini make green and pink stay really practicing with best bachelor just really try to scrape it yeah virtually invisible are yes spatula you got it Oh like so my glove that's right so we're gonna do green body pick strength right there dude peace that's what we did before hey I know I know I know I know Green Valley thinks it's a modern elements like remember you don't remember how you did it I know we did it that came out good yeah and I think I have I think I wrote down there I think Friday 3:00 and strike what if I put green in here what's gonna happen with this color we want to turn it well you turn this train probably turning brown brown yeah we don't wanna yeah but we still have to have two colors here yeah we'll just leave this color pull it under them take release I know we'd that'd be so controlling crazy doesn't water long before yeah he did green by who did do it and I got my notes if you add green it's gonna overpower well go ahead look at any old snaps and I will do this you know actually I think I do remember reading that flavor yeah I know we did you do that an extra hand here can I make up the next petal we're gonna go ahead make a petal in our life I'll do something here speaking as Steve I'm envisioning it and we did a green body right bones aren't good with their custom well I want thinking green however we do it okay we'll get ready what if you guys just broke off the little tiny piece and then just put in like one drop of food coloring to see what color it changes it to remember being like we only did it one time mix is destined to watermelon this is a brand-new bottle or no we only have the one all right smells good watermelon ewwww yeah no smell really good and you no matter the color it's gonna taste great listen I can turn shop yeah okay so you want to do pink body green stripe I still want to add like a little drop of red so it's a little bit more vibrant a pink because watermelon is more vibrant pink thing did you pull this it's gonna be pale pink we want to take our piece off yes we do Green yep we'll just agree of course this is the part where I wanted max to do it but uh this is this is the part the learning part that I wanted to match is just how much to add yeah and handling the small you've done that before have you sorry you have you've done have you colored small stripes yeah okay I guess back in the basement hmm can you can have that that big blob see you kept custody in a big blob I'll take a little bit more for my straight would you think that us discussing the stripes and get cheers over on your side more drama yeah he's also develop flavor it is great no keep Gary strawberry know like required yes i'm the cut-open and put it my backseat the darker color is just going yes not here won't know the whole thing deployment yeah well no I was wondering if that yeah is it just food coloring yeah this way Brenda right we flavor the whole batch I was just wondering if it's gonna go to Jersey - mind blowing flavor it like two separate dogs like partner flavor that sense they were that sided yeah you know now that you've said that I'm not saying I'll never do that favor what's your flavors would be complimentary no I mean lemon lime a big one right we're in the future now and you can see that they are packaging up peanut butter fill driven candy well I just wanted to let you guys know that we now have whole yeah shirts available because a lot of people in the last video left relieving comments saying that they wanted those shirts and what I was thinking is in the future if you guys really like a certain saying or really want a certain thing on a t-shirt just leave it in the comment section we got enough people requesting it then I can make it on t spring and I will let you guys know in the next video when it's available so what I'm thinking is would be like a limited time only and then once you guys decide you want another shirt then we'll make that and now just like replace those shirts so if you want the whole yeah shirt check out in the description before it goes away back to the rest of the video you do like yellow and green Dan then you might be on something and if we get sick of making the same old flavors over and over we'll get into the two-tone what else could we do too bad this wasn't a live stream huh we access an American classic and then the next one I am breaking bread trying hot dogs fantastic oh that actually didn't ring yeah because I did it before yeah and dad doesn't remember or believe me so I'm just let him have his way I'm surprised like I don't know cuz it was like so pink and you would think good heavens way when you've been married for 35 years which we just celebrated 35 years of bliss yesterday [Music] by number two the first year can be a little awkward like who takes out the garbage who knows of that yeah oh honey I already watched this it was you wouldn't like it was though I wasn't in either so Mac says how you do it oh very good thing well no I was wondering why yours keeps just like flattening out and hers doesn't but I think yours does too well mines getting - remix and quickly cuz it's smaller so it'll get cool off faster he's got more leeway because he's got bigger blob so pretty soon she's gonna start mixing it up pretty well because what but also what he's throwing it on the vocal it mix it a little bit but he does want to be sure not to get on his gloves that's the color on is on most puffs because tired to get out of both of us yeah SoDo with colors sweet are done with colors so next we've got raspberry and grape so we're just in the purples after this okay so where you guys come from Batavia oh did you go in there yeah we were gonna stop and we went up to our friend pallet palaces in the McKinley mouth it's a sponge candy we were we when we bought a few things from him kind of odd to stop it I love it on the way back over here just two tires home get unloaded no so words like oh I'm relieved next Oliver okay can you take over yeah I'm in oil shipping so I feel like I should finish FedEx DPS are coming whether I'm ready or not yeah how do you know when you had to put it probably put her in front of the heater right now

equipment and stuff that you had down there - yeah yeah I love that cable yep yeah it was funny when we got everything in here is like I don't know how we fit it all in a little but we did it suppose this couple decides or something and then the first two weeks were robbers and we thought oh this is far bigger than we really need but that's okay we'll grow into it and then by the third or fourth week now why do you have to keep mixing it I'm just looking at and stuff because I want to see how it is flowing wise put it on the Hulk I gotta be able to handle this load slowing down a little bit each time almost ready oh that's when I graduated from yeah I was I was a super senior I supposed to graduate until the 14 but I'll be here so I should wait a while I think by my senior year I was

going to get going to back in November apparently is from like tungee youtubers right now they you too big yeah and I saw just from the YouTube comments there's some people there's a lot of people saying like hey I stopped by yesterday wow really Wow ya think because like obviously I think the viewers realized that online sales increased whenever there's a video but there's also a lot of people coming in to the stores from out of town from the YouTube videos oh yeah so people just forget to consider that there well I don't think that like videos necessarily have to do that but basically from the YouTube channel goodness has increased in walk you don't want to know when you get to yes I mean you don't want to squish it up and stuff because then you'll never I'll mess up the stripe so just try to keep it at this one size as if it keeps squishing that yeah I was thinking about that but I'm like well I can't have it be three feet long either how do you keep it and just keep with the same size you just can't really formula moving a lot on me the extra hot now you're getting in my way now you know what it's like want to be in your way worry about that dance around each other all day we

you got another very hard candy first the first time I tried the blueberry and oh we had the boys yeah I think the mango one needed more laborers I think that's why I didn't like as much as the blueberry just wasn't as strong let's try that again and we made the peanut butter yeah holy cow and that is some good stuff yeah really good yeah I think it would be good to have the mango again and just like another another shot a flavour about you really good yeah this just seemed extra soft yeah maybe way I can just kind of watch you do it a little bit across the whole thing crossed all the way sliding across kind of losing it shine up here that's kind of what was happening we're shining what I was doing it fine you know I think it's when you chop it it dulls it like watch see on now

well it's nice it doesn't look sloppy because I've just gonna run out of staples soon yeah too good to be true it smell really good 16 hey there you go you get out of here yep all right well let's get out of here [Music]", "96y9vctDktw": "hey guys Rebecca from elements of eternity so today I am working with cannabis again I am making a edible medicine I'm making chocolate peanut butter truffles these are actually going to be dipped in homemade organic chocolate so I already D carved my marijuana and medicine and today I am using sunset sherbert this strain is actually known as galette oh it's a indica dominant hybrid 85% indicus of 15% sativa strain it's very potent it tested about 29% it's mom and dad is Girl Scout cookie and pink panties actually so I was wanting to make an extra strength medicine here I wanted them to be about a hundred milligrams apiece by the time I'm done with them now for starters they recommend around 10 milligrams and see how it goes so to make my butter I used a organic here's my gonna be the mix I know it's cream but it tastes just like the inside of a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup but I used an organic hormone-free churned butter cream like a butter and organic coconut oil is going to be for my chocolate and what I did was I usually it is about two ounces per pound of butters but I actually used three and I didn't use trim I actually use the buds I got this from the cultivation car farm the other day and I grind this up so I ground up the three ounces of this and to measure your THC when you're making edible guys it's always a rule of thumb that one gram of cannabis has a thousand milligrams of dry weight that means a strain house like say for instance 15 percent THC now this strain has 29 percent CHD their THC so it's higher but for instance the average medicine flower has 15 percent THC it'll have about a hundred and fifty milligrams of THC 15 percent of say a thousand milligrams equals 150 milligrams but sorry I got dizzy for a second but the average strain actually is only 10 percent anything over 15 or 20 percent in your strain is considered above average and high in THC and it's considered extremely potent and this strain here I'm using actually for edibles is really good with appetite stimulation it helps with pain restlessness and sleepiness the great thing about these is that it doesn't it does make you feel good and euphoric but it's not supposed to knock you out now if it does knock you out that means you took too much and since everybody handles edibles completely different it's highly recommended that if you're not used to edibles to start small like say for instance these are a hundred milligrams apiece to start out actually in a fourth now if you're you know used to this and all that you've got to eat the whole thing but yeah so what i'm doing here actually I need in my hands are sterile I need 50 of them if I have 50 of the these right here that's a hundred milligrams each now if I don't make it that far and get actually 50 of them then they're actually going to be more potent than that and I have my labels and ingredients in all that forum these are amazing alternative medicines for you know people that are really having a hard time with illness or cancer say nausea energy or whatever and I'm using the stainless steel ball is half of them because I want them all to be the same size and what I do is I dip them in powdered sugar so that they don't stick and kind of just pack it in there and knock off the excess so that and like I said they're going to be dipped in chocolate so they're going to be so they're going to be truffles chocolate peanut butter medicated truffles mm-hmm by the time I'm done with them and you know for people who are not familiar with edibles when they eat them they expect this high like you would smoking marijuana and it's actually nothing at the sort now you do get high and you do get intoxicated I'm not gonna lie about that but it's not the same you can be in a lot of pain and within a half an hour you'll start feeling your pain ease away or nausea or joint pain muscles it's great for arthritis hey guys I'm back along my camera father so I just did my chocolate oh and by the way I'm sorry my phone cut out I had to lower my resolution on my phone so I could finished the video so this half is going to be a little less better quality so I made my chocolate which is just organic coconut oil organic cocoa powder some honey and since it is summer months I want my product to hold up so I added a little bit of organic beeswax to the chocolates so that it holds up and I also crushed some Adeem a nuts which are kind of like a bean they kind of taste like a roasted peanut and I crushed them up it's gonna go on the tops and I set these in the freezer anything easier to to handle and for the chocolate to free zones or set up so we're going to do and let it drip off c6o and if you chop wits like this and you're wanting to add toppings you have to do it right from the get-go because once it cools um just like so so I'm gonna pause this and get more done and then I'll be back okay guys I'm back so I ended up getting them all done dipped in chocolate and they turned out really great I decided to only put the a dummy on some the Adame nuts and for packaging they actually go on one of these a little and they hardened up great so they go on one of these and in one of these boxes and plated with the ingredients and the sonim so yeah they turned out great I must say guys that I know they're at a hundred milligrams but I'll tell you what I test all my products so I um tooth like I don't know it was like a [ __ ] half a teaspoon of just the filling and let me tell you I'm I'm really feeling motion but I was really nauseous and hurtin and that's all gone a little loopy I honestly wouldn't drive that's for sure so yeah I'm really really happy with how they turned out and they turn nice and hard because I put the little bit of beeswax in it so yeah that's about it so I'll talk to you guys later bye", "bhnjMZA-sm8": "i mean wednesday night all right i don't know if we're actually live because it doesn't say

we do have a question now jules wants to know what's the weather like here i don't know it keeps trying to snow and then it won't stick just overcast and trying to snow but it's not quite cold enough to snow it's just on the edge yeah it's been overcast for the past several months since august basically um christine's nintendo super chat thank you very much i really love you guys i lost my mom november 8th and you guys made my day brighter i'm very sorry to hear about it terrible but i'm glad that we could you know make your time a little bit easier yes how is the business the business is a booming that's why i'm only allowed to post once a week tops right now we're very lucky that we're busy like we are consider myself lucky yeah could be the other way yeah and uh trevi says frank and beans franken beans yeah uh barbara everett sent a five dollar super chat love the videos live watching maybe live watching i don't know only way i can pretend to have candy been 10 years oh it's been 10 years since you had candy i guess well either way thank you for the super chat appreciate it yeah this is great thanks for watching oh someone wants to know if we can ship to saudi arabia unfortunately we cannot do so it breaks our heart as much as i don't know if it's the laws they have there or what i forget now my mom says she's threatened to come in at some point we could ask her i forget oh there's so many rules and so many places yeah and also i know saudi arabia tends to be pretty warm so i think a little bit yeah and usually i think it would take more than two days to get there so our cold pack would melt yeah that wouldn't maybe it wouldn't make it and you have to pay at least like 80 bucks for shipping to get melted candy and i don't think at that point even you would want it yeah it's kind of a strength though and then then may not even be worth it yeah basically you're paying like a normal leg for a really bad prop quality yeah can we ship to ireland yeah i believe we do ship ireland uh order base company says hi syracuse greetings from ohio was wondering if you all would ever make a straight strawberry heart candy pack you all you're all awesome yeah just yeah well we i think we do sell just strawberry uh i think they meant only strawberry yeah no no i think they meant a whole bag of only strawberry yeah no i don't think we do that i'm pretty sure we put it in like a fruit and friendly bag i don't think that we will that we've sold just straight oh just oh i don't know okay i'm pretty sure mom put it in but so that's to answer the question i don't package it yes your mom i don't know yeah just get strawberry lemonade break them all in half oh if someone wants enough that's malic acid no that's actually actually citric acid the reason uh caravan north sent a super chat thank cara for the lovely message and my candy arrived at the okay let's go take care of that hey kara so i wanted to say thank you to you uh caravan north sen super chat said thank cara for the lovely message in my candy that arrived in the uk today cheesecake candy you're welcome kara oh they're they're thanking you oh that their name is the guy's profile looks like it was a guy but who knows thank you whoever you are in the uk uh someone said what are we making but it should be in the title of the livestream strawberry lemonade they're just making conversation strawberry lemonade linda said uh please stop spamming this right yeah if there's anyone spamming you the moderators can feel free to put people in timeout no that's actually what it's called that's the term like if you right click if you're on a computer and you right click it'll say put user in timeout you can't behave yourself then this is what basically i think it means you can't comment for 300 seconds it says uh so anyway uh mrs barnes sent a five dollar super chat uh hello everyone my husband and i love watching your channel thank you for putting a light in this dark world you're welcome thanks for watching that's for sure and someone else wanted to know uh why why you guys put the citric acid in the candy because we want it to be tarty right a little bit tarty yeah yeah yeah so you know a little sour it's a little sour yeah tardy sour just add a little a little a little something to it yeah when are you supposed to [ __ ] her up you know uh i just want to ask your favorite thought about doing like a mystery flavor did you say mercury yeah you only try it once a mystery no mystery flavor yeah so it'd be like maybe you don't color it but then you you flavor it or something i don't know how many people notice this but when we do like the ribbon candy and stuff we usually have like a long bit of white in the front and i've been saying that for a long time that we can just make all white ones put them all in the bag yeah yeah see if you can tell the difference uh we got a 50 super chat from uniquely yours crystal says happy new years everyone thanks hercules crew for all you do hey craig happy new year well thank you for thanks yeah thank you for the very generous super chat and also happy new year yeah thanks for watching again uh jack wants to know if we can ship to australia and unfortunately we cannot because by the time it gets there it will be melted and also i'm i think there's also uh shipping like label requirements yeah there's something about the labels or yeah she says it all the time and i just i forget too i don't know but we can't overall we just can't stand up there we wish we could yeah we wish we could but that's one of the ones where you'd have to convert the label over into australian right right yeah it's pretty tough yeah you gotta put meat in there every other word today all right uh travelguy67 a super chat i really like my faces of steve calendar but now i feel like i need a 365 day desk version for next year i'm sure steve has that many faces no pressure yeah that's a whole lot of faces um so mom can you i know we ask you all the time none of us can remember why we can't ship to certain places we know it's like shipping stuff oh um a lot of countries have specific labeling regulations and like you have to list the percentage of glucose and starches and carbohydrates and some of them just do not allow the importation of food that has milk and or meat in it but it's labeling usually yeah they have labeling or it has to be done in a certain language like japanese or in japan i think it would have to be translated yeah and not necessarily does not necessarily translate correctly so if it's too much of a hassle i don't think i'm gonna it wouldn't be worth it for me to jump through all those hoops i'm just a big fat no yeah so yeah so there's that and then also like if the place is too warm yeah in some places like australia it does not matter how the fastest you could possibly get a package there's five days and even if you had a cold pack those are only good for up to two days and that's depending on the temperature so even hard candy with really hot temperatures will turn into a sticky ball so it's just not worth that yeah he says that makes us well i've got you on the phone i should point out that our store is still close to foot traffic we've had some folks from youtube land show up and want to come in they don't realize that we are still supposed to put treasure because we got to protect our talent yeah he's uh national treasure so no germs must ever come near him yes so that's what i'd say about that was so oh something that i was asking max say what he thought about if we um made easter eggs early because i feel like people just sometimes get them to eat them and maybe they're not really celebrating a holiday but they're just creme eggs they're just a perfect little handheld thing so if it's okay with max we might make easter the cream eggs a little bit earlier than usual okay would you mix what's up well he's i'm working on it i thought you had to have a family meeting and [Music] all right yeah we're gonna figure it out right but she has to be well rested right otherwise she might not give the answer we want yeah she's gonna have to sleep 24 hours today yeah uh little sparrow sent a super chat are there any products you've uh stopped making now that you have no foot traffic love you folks by the way actually uh if you're gonna answer could you i don't know if the microphone's gonna pick it up that loud over there certain novelties that don't shift but they're kind of fragile because we don't have them on our website even for our local people to buy so it's like okay they're not selling so yes we have stuff from certain novelties that are not shipped well because i had a dude lined up to make us a local website but then something happened i don't know what but i have not heard from him okay but i'm doing other things on the website so i'm just kind of checking off a list so we'll get to the local one but yeah if you're watching this on youtube you probably don't care about the local website you're more concerned with the national website so that's yes so like canada uk ireland yes you guys have shipped to germany before right yes but the last time we shipped we had a big problem with it um the milk and meat thing because i've tripped to germany many times and not had any trouble but this time i got held up in customs and i mean they're almost going to ship it back to me but somehow it went through so i have unfortunately taken germany off the list because now they're getting a little nitpicky so that's off the list so it's kind of like a moving target i had a couple problems with canada um the duties and taxes that the recipient is responsible for paying those i mean it says on the website but people might not always pick up on that yeah so what happens is you get your package and then a couple weeks later fedex sends you a bill because they they take care of the duties and taxes but then you're supposed to pay fedex but a couple people that didn't pay fedex so i got the bill so i was like oh this is going to be a thing i won't be shipping to canada but i sent the two different people the bill and they paid it right away so so it's not an issue but that's the thing is you get a bill separately and it depends on the dollar amount so i don't really have any control over that depends on how much they bought some people might not even get a bill but that's that i'm gonna go over there and make some noise okay so i'll try not to make it noisy for over here so you guys are is it just really runny over here that's really one yeah a little bit i guess i could have waited another minute or so that's all right i can do it yeah you need a workout yeah yeah look at these pipsqueak cards no problem i'm just gonna go lay down after this yeah oh my mask is moving uh-oh oh no i said that step in to do my mask so you can adjust yours uh why don't we take it and shape the candy into a triangle pull on a round circle yeah well i think you'll triangle the circle conversion uh yeah i think they were just confused because i think on youtube they always see people doing a round candy well that's because they have batch rollers they have somebody just rolling it while somebody's pulling it out we don't we have the same person as raw as a twisting it or pulling it out and and turning it at the same time so yeah so we can't roll it at the same time it's pulling it out because it takes two hands so you know if you got a triangle and then also i i know greg i think does that too but he also has a very like wide table because you need to be able to roll it all the way because people have a tendency to roll out halfway like we wouldn't be able to roll all the way because you think you're rolling the whole thing but you're only rolling half of it yeah it's hard to explain unless you see it in front of you being done like this is there any way to maintain the soft texture of the candy without it being hot i think that's taffy but i don't [Music] no know don't take it just pull it up and then we'll get it up with that you know we'll use the scrapers yeah you don't have to get it wet or anything it did okay did we make candy canes yeah we made candy canes uh we have a couple of videos actually recently about making candy canes i think our last live stream was making candy canes might have been the last video we did yeah it might have been actually yeah okay the airplane's starting here goes there's probably a parachute pair of shoes joke in there but [Music] um i think did we already sell a lot of that i thought we just made that a few weeks ago but i mean it's pretty popular though right yeah yeah if anything's very popular you can only guarantee we're gonna do it again yeah enough with the back and stock orders right there yeah as you know as uh you know as any successful company's gonna oh so our customers want this okay so we're going to sell it yeah and we have a proven history of selling this thing i don't know maybe we should stop selling it i just came up with something give the people what they want no way what do you think is that is that catchy i don't know let's run that up the flight department or i have to be on a t-shirt right there cause i said a ten dollar super chat when i was unemployed in 2019 you guys were the only thing that got me through the day i've written this message 20 times but i'll say that you guys are wonderful please adopt me and even though i'm 30. hey world next time are almost 30. quadruplets okay we'll have more kids that's all and i really am sorry if i i'm not getting everyone's uh comments but there's almost 1500 of you guys only one of me uh so let's see we got another little chat from carla says hi everyone my grandkids are coming up to collect their 20 candy canes i got last month from you uh will you try the taffy machine this summer that's a good question i don't know we haven't even really talked about it yeah we haven't been able to get to it yet yeah we didn't expect this you know the whole virus that happened this summer and we also didn't expect this like when the first time we made strawberry lemonade hard candy the video went super viral like it got like i think two million views in the first week wow and so and then just kept going from there now i think it's close to like 10 million views so yeah that one everybody went nuts and we weren't able to post like five or six weeks um so there's just a lot of things we didn't anticipate the summer that we initially before the summer we were like oh yeah we'd love to do taffy we'd love to do all this stuff and then nothing but uh it was all for good reason so pretty much other than you know the virus so we've got another five dollar super chat uh i started my fuzz business because if you guys you guys left mistakes and make the job look fun i am hoping my kids will carry it on after me go fudge it up [Music] yeah well greg i think did do that at lobster pursuits because he does do a [ __ ] candy like a biohazard size yeah i think it was actually just like what the the virus looks like like the circle with like a bunch of things shooting off the top of it so if you want image candy then i would just say you know go to lofty pursuits because we don't do image candy but a lot of people suits make great candy yep uh katy petz sent a super chat hello from tennessee hello katie from new york no she's from tennessee oh right yeah yeah i just heard about some donut shopping in tennessee um made the donuts i don't know those apple doughnuts that you made that one here that's really great melting that's how soft it is oh yeah so that's a question somebody had earlier is there any way to keep the candy as soft it is now when it's not hot and i i think the answer that would be happy right but i think it would just so it's just basically not with this type of hard candy that's what it's called a hard candy yeah once you go up to a 290 to 300 to 310 or so uh it's going to be hard yeah it's kind of hard basically you just wouldn't get that high if you want it to be it's got to be like maybe 240 or 235 at the software so the is you could do it but at that point it's no longer hard handy now it's a different type of different type so yeah you could make candy it's just not gonna be hard candy they buy a candy thermometer it'll say right on the candy thermometer all the hard cracks soft crack uh fuzz all that kind of stuff right on it there's even a stage where things turn into a softball i like softball yeah that's good i was playing softball enough yeah sure yeah we had to when we were in gym class yeah yeah i think i remember that it was not my favorite coffee when i looked at the kids they didn't have a hardball team yeah did you make candy yes that's what it said okay it's a good idea i don't think that would work do we still do curbside yeah we still do curbside anna says just rediscovered your channel after a few years i remember steve playing steve learning max to pull hard candy back then and look at him go now he's such a pro uh great work guys love from the netherlands thank you guys it's kind of crazy for me to hear that people are like yeah yeah i remember years ago when you were doing that man it's been years yeah it's is it weird going to like it's like a job it just seems like a normal job and people like i remember when you first started your first day i you know i mean i don't know weird it's not the right word for it but it's like uh like you know when you went when you used to work at uh tim hortons like imagine someone seeing your first day on the job and then like hey i remember back in the day when you first started like a customer saying to you remember when you first started you could really pour a cup of coffee now oh yeah oh yeah i mean most people do but i i try to stay in shape you know just in case i ever want to go back what do you do um i make like 10 pots of coffee a day and see how fast i can pour them and then i i don't drink coffee so i mean i got to dump it all out after but uh morrison

for sticking around uh the cowboy hundreds of super chat hi i'm such a big fan well thank you thank you for being a fan thanks i thought you're a cowboy thanks for watching uh someone wants to know what's the worst thing we've broken while making candy maybe they're talking about equipment broken yeah i guess so they said what's the worst thing you broke so i don't know we never zoom in there [Applause] anything else well that's all we try not to break our stuff yeah it's frowned upon yeah usually most of it's kind of old so we don't want it especially since yeah steve's grabber running over on the boat so yeah mark simpson sent a five-year-old super chat do you make liquor chocolates uh no we have to have a license to do that here in new york state yeah yeah it's not like the watercolor but we do have like i think there's still some amaretto flavor creams yeah we have we have rum raisins and we have the flavors but no alcohol irish creams out there oh someone said popcorn flavored candies i got a problem yeah like you know they did it with birdie bots i'm pretty serious oh yeah no those ones are really good too i think they have popcorn flavor yeah i don't want to know if you guys ever slammed your finger in the cutter but i don't think that's really possible oh god everywhere no not yet i mean not unless you really tried yeah dude yeah you kind of you put both hands on top not the candy cutter definitely yeah sure uh the cowboys henderson another super chat uh hi i was the one who sent you the video on instagram i think a year ago me pulling slime on a lamp how's it going that's the slime business treat andrew says van i have a job no question mark it says advance there's no question man i have a job right next to each other on the keyboard yeah no i

anything i don't have a job for you guys oh sorry we have two positions you know if you we had a job but we just filled it up oh oh he said that was the last i said oh my god can i have a job just okay we got another super chat from mal pazar says have you tried desiccant packs to keep moisture down for shipping also using a 3d printer to make new interesting shapes for starch holes well we do do we do use that contestants yep uh and then we don't have 3d printers i don't know if we would have room we already have we need to yeah they're making the boards on the printer that'd be cool it would be really cool we could do like all sorts of things yeah uh any idea where i can find a candy press like that uh no if we knew we would have more than 18.50 have you got a time machine i've been looking online for a long time and uh yeah there aren't any we've just had it passed down so i the best place to probably be a candy shop that's going out of business seeing if they have it yeah that'd probably be your best bet i mean you can check like the antique candy stores and websites and all that but you're going to spend like thousands of dollars i mean if you find one call me i want to buy it i mean it seems like it's a relatively simple design if you know someone who's a metal worker they could probably it's just a spring yeah you know it's not like it's a very high tech piece of equipment not not like you not like your dad oh yeah okay good thing we got a super chat from jackson so thank you jackson and then alex sent a twenty five dollars so 25 super chat thank you for

cream center is fast yeah the mango cream the maple nut those are killing but you know what i'm still a sucker for chocolate from potato chips yeah old-fashioned great chocolate drops yeah malfunctioning two dollars your cat uh what shape would you want for the starch press like maybe one that you don't currently have oh it'd be cool to be able to do like specific things like we could do like the bills logo well no not to sell but i just mean like you could do like very specific like characters or something trying to get like trouble don't listen to him no no you just have to give it away you can't sell it oh no all right uh byron says valentine's day candy yeah i mean it's mostly uh assorted chocolates but yeah you guys do sell like heart boxes and candies all kinds of saudi chocolates heart get caught boxes from like small to like five pounds i mean uh said he was thinking bars but uh i i think maybe he forgot the stars presses for assorted chocolates maybe that's maybe he was thinking molds because the starch starch molds are different than molds but i think he just got confused um cherry says random uh who still has their christmas tree up uh cara and i still have a christmas tree that's it well uh uh see we got i know super chat uh my sister and i are from the uk and are excited to try your impressive vegan chocolates oh well we would love for you to try them

if we don't sometimes my mom's being very sarcastic like if she's talking about chocolate cauliflower we literally have to flash some like uh words that just say jokes or sarcasm alert or something like that because other people be like ew colored cauliflower even if we do people will still all right like i i totally agree with you like come on you know you don't know that we're kidding but yeah

i have these adjustment things i can like up and down that's neat um yeah that's for a lens or something yeah yeah this looks fancy yeah fancy actually the reason i got this whole rig was just because

mint ice cream what's it called chocolate chip mint chocolate chip that's what it's called i was like yeah that's it i know it's the wrong form of words but basically yeah so i mean chocolate chip it

and i make dad jokes and we're not dads doesn't that make us faux pas four paws faux pas what's a four paws like uh oh f-a-u-x yeah yeah a poser yep yeah posers uh maddie sent a 1.99 pound super chat or maybe it's pound 99 i guess that's what you'd say faux pas someone says boo that was hilarious malefizar is another five dollar super chat been watching you guys since the basement days max has come a long way i'll email about the molds keep it up you nut jobs i'm off to work six four thirty two percent human okay hired now all right you drive a hard bargain well we already hit our goals for

chat whoa that's because he's 100 human it says what do you call a mexican man with three eyes iii is that like what does that say in spanish i i don't know didn't care take spanish uh yeah also do you guys sell candy online um yes our link is in the description um forget about it what you think i never saw candy before uh brian the australian keep up uh final super chat keep up the awesome videos guys steve is the best one day i will visit keep up the dad jokes all we'll think wow we can't help it yeah thanks ryan correct don't give them the url yeah that's a top secret one of the moderators whatever you do do not post the url and delete any comments it's saying right keep us safe maddie mentioned uh senate stupid says how is the revenue split from the youtube channel uh well i get paid for the youtube channel and then you know dylan gets his paycheck uh but hercules what he deserves yeah hercules gets paid by uh all the increase in orders so basically it works out pretty great because google is me to advertise for my parents so my parents never have to pay for advertising and they get huge spikes in order so i keep the the youtube money and they get all their orders it's a win-win win says i definitely want to order some we got some special stock just for you buddy what does he put his hands uh what does he put his hands in uh before the corn syrup oh it's just uh cold water make sure it doesn't stick to his hands don't ask why not we have no idea it's way how tall we do it yeah omg that would be awful making money and selling stuff online imaginable unimaginable yuck the real live guide says oh yeah give me some sugar i'll show the more sugar and pour it in i was gonna say that that's his request and by the way thank you real live guy for that last super chat yeah no kidding oh boy look at all that sugar it's gonna jump right up yep that's it i know anti-climactic so can you explain to the people at home what that is and why are you adding it this is i always want to say citric acid but no it's acid or cream of tartar um i i don't know um the acid that goes into the mix keeps the crystallization from happening for longer so that you know we can actually handle the candy before it solidifies i'm pretty sure that's why yeah yeah so it doesn't crack on you while you're pulling it out and stuff um you know just makes everything go smooth and like we were just saying it's what they told us to do in the first place yeah that's the recipe yeah oh computer testing said they tried to do a super chat and was denied by youtube i don't know you got to talk to susan about that apparently yeah well susan's uh ceo of youtube yeah like what steve yeah uh tim cook jeff amazon yeah i'll allow it panel just this one time i promise do you need a hammer or anything are you all ready for this just just let me know and i'll put this down for a sec someone says why do you twist the candy like that i think they're talking about pulling it on the hook variate it and it makes it turn a lighter color and it gets it gets kind of thicker makes it easier to handle too uh just joined what are you amazing i know the title is very confusing but we're making a strawberry lemonade hard candy chocolate isn't it doesn't it look like chocolate you give it 10 minutes uh computer testing just sent a super chat looks like they figured out the super chat well thank you for that appreciate it gotta hold up susan really quick yeah i know the question susan if you don't let me give you money i'll get very angry and do nothing about it i'll sit on my couch i won't just forget about it not this time listen i got an envelope and i got two dollars in cash it's going out uh do we make savory hard candy we do not although i think uh around thanksgiving time uh greg from octopus suits does super spicy spinal fluid says i want to smack the goop okay and other people are saying picture quality isn't great um i don't really actually have any control over that believe it or not um i know what you would you would probably think that but i i actually don't just from a phone i can't really change anything um the only thing i could say is it might it's either our wi-fi or your wi-fi but if only some people are having that problem it's probably your wi-fi uh does it get hard if you leave it out for a while yeah i mean that's that's how it just cools down that's how it gets hard mr forget about it so he's about to order some some of the hard candy i think so yeah i bet you'll like it yeah someone said a brush yeah so you're getting the extra sugar crystals off there right yep so when we stir it all up when i'm mixing the water in here um the sugar is just in suspension it's not melted into the water so the crystals will get left on the side and then as it's heating up they have no water to protect them so they all get like nice and brown and dark and it you know tastes good it's all it's really just caramel but uh we don't want to get the colors dark so try to wash it all down forget about it says i'm going to do look at your website and do a little shopping do you really like your beast no i'm starting to think you're the real wise guy i know what is your website called uh actually so if you have like any if anyone ever has any questions like what is uh the email what is the website where are we located all that stuff if you just google hercules candy all that information just pop it right up you're gonna throw it yeah that's awesome you've thrown all of them so mossy girl says what do you recommend i cannot decide i'm assuming she's uh on the love your new york italian accent is what the real wise guy said um yeah the assorted chocolates are very very popular chocolate potato chips very very popular i like peanut butter the cow chips yep and where did you say uh the peanut butter cups max oh i was saying the catchers but the peanut butter cups are really good they're made with like actual peanut butter

come down a little and i i'm sorry for the viewers that are watching i wish there was something i could do about but there's nothing really that i can do on my end we actually restarted the wi-fi before this live stream started so that we wouldn't have troubles like this but i mean i wish there's something i could do but there's really nothing i can do for my phone so you guys just have to suffer through this separate through the pain tony says crystal clear quality okay so i don't know you know i'm not having any problem seeing it yeah either uh jacob says i love you guys ever since i started watching i began making my own candy i enjoyed it so much thank you for these videos i hope i can make a trip soon so i can learn more about candy making great yeah what kind of candy are you making oh so correct did you know andy milinakis is a fan yeah he actually ordered from us so at least once again yeah he ordered again this year oh yeah yep yeah we're uh we're a big indian melanocus fans here oh yeah and because here yeah is he is a bus yeah people kept saying spongebob and patrick flavor when we did the video one person said that yeah steve can we get your chris barley impression i'm a motivated speaker i live under a fridge no does it look dead i forgot now there's a van down by the river yeah that's it oh remind you there dude yeah said old bill shakespeare shakespeare over there my favorite life bill shakespeare chris carley he was awesome oh my god we still got david spade yeah david's great if you ever want to learn how to make candy dude for real come on did you ever find yourself in syracuse new york yeah hey his mom was here last year he still didn't come by man i called john he said he said he's disappointed travis says i love it i rob it i hug it i squeeze it jacob says i love making all different types of griddle the most i almost it makes he likes making brittle the most i almost make hard candies and some chocolates and barks a little bit of everything yeah uh jackie says why are shipping costs so high wanting to order hard candy but paying over twenty dollars in shipping is tough yes we agree 100 and if you do have any questions about why it's so high i would suggest asking either fedex or ups because they're the ones who tell us what the shipping price is going to be we make zero dollars off of shipping so we have zero control over the shipping and we actually have a wrap i don't know about at ups but in fedex we get a discount on off at actually yeah believe it or not it would be hard we're doing our best to get that price down yeah but because of the volume that we do we're gonna slight discount we buy shipping from them you know um so again yeah if you do have any questions about that i would i would definitely recommend just contacting ups and fedex and maybe they'll be able to walk you through why it costs a lot um it probably has to do with though like um the fact that it has to get there in a certain amount of time yeah um and then also because yeah we are doing enough shipping for us to get a slight discount but we're not doing so much shipping like amazon where they could be like oh five bucks they're like we can just price it in your mom said too that like it depends i mean obviously depends on where you live but like there's literally like different zoning like uh prices and stuff so like if you live in like a rural area you'll get charged more because there's less traffic going out there yeah so i don't know if it's something like location or yeah yeah i think my mom said that before too like because if like you live in seattle that's going to be different than if you live in like i don't know countries i know of cities but i don't know yeah i don't know i know like um rural areas around here yeah i don't know what rural areas around anywhere else yeah yeah i was about to say bakersfield california but like wait is that also a city or is that i don't know it'd be like if you look then uh you know why not nobody not l.a oh yeah jackie says world georgia here that's probably why yeah yeah so yeah that can do it yeah if there's nobody else around you you pay a mixture to incentivize them going out there right well yeah if you do have any questions please just contact ups and but actually they'll probably i'll tell you why oh i wanted to ask a while ago i know i'm a little late for this but what's everybody's favorite uh chris farley movie oh yeah heard a lot of tommy boy references um black sheep was being promoted on amazon earlier so um yeah someone said baker's building yeah so that's why i was like i almost said i was like wait is that not a rural area so i was like i don't want to put my foot in my mouth and that's why i didn't because i was right that i was wrong i was right that i was wrong that's part of growing up isn't it being like i don't know what i'm talking about so i'm not gonna yeah i'm just gonna tell him yep a crisp barley fan all right theresa i'm going to kick you out of dummy we're kidding where's terry terry is working in her office bobby is trying to save me he said there's a lot of rural areas around baker's field making the case he's like so technically you're still wrong but not not as wrong as you could be yeah like like uh kirtland you know yeah everything's good holidays so you know everything is why is it so exciting hey watch your money well you know it means that they're paying their employees well hopefully and giving them benefits and stuff yeah i'll take some money yep let's see uh farley and billy madison okay yeah tommy boy is great let's see beverly hills ninja and black sheep yeah beverly hills ninja is another one look that's all of them coneheads he's in there i don't know i haven't seen it i don't even know what that not movie chris barley okay yeah he's got some really good snl skins yeah he's a little more prolific as a skit or uh yes cafeteria lady oh yeah what was it what was it billy madison um it's something lunch lady yeah punch lady yeah a little bit better in my body also it said air heads i actually haven't heard of like happiness oh yeah barley was in their

well we're all looking to buy a house so yeah the biggest goal hopefully this will be over yeah yeah my goal is to especially listen to where i'm at get through the real wild guy says can't wait to try my peanut butter cup and cherry chocolate almond ribbon candy yeah and you better send it because i won't forget about it he didn't say i'm paraphrasing between the lines yeah yeah i know i don't want to mess with him no no no although he did say in that earlier comment that he's not a real wise guy but i think that's something that a wise guy would say it's just to try and get out of it if this youtube chat everyone ends up in court i know what's the most interesting candy you guys have made them all which one's this the chocolate and fluff and nut and peanut butter and caramel and uh i'm a wise he says i'm a wise guy but a jokester not a mobster they call me funny funny how funny like a clown uh jennifer says i have a question craig has the shop ever experimented with kool-aid packages is any candy here's the guy who invented barley wines he's the motivational speaker motivatable speaker he lives in the bridge down by the air can you do that again dad i'll see if i can do anything it's going like this i don't know what this is all about i keep screwing it up you can do it dad will delivery to uk ever be cheaper or will you guys first stock it in the uk no unfortunately i don't think well unless global warming could go up the ocean could go away we could just drive across yeah or not it might happen um unless technology improves or fedex or eps gives us a steep discount probably not it might be cheaper to just fly over here i mean really well we uh we were thinking about either investing in like from springboard to like some rocket ships they're just like launching yeah oh yeah trevorship star truck or something with a what like beamless stop yeah setting a probe what would you call that uh transporter transport transporter module or something transponder can we potentially sell globally via amazon or something um no we don't really like shipping through other companies because you guys have done other things in the past before right they weren't as delicate with your candy so we'd rather be in charge of shipping but we know that it gets there on time and know that it's not our fault if they could screw it up or i don't know we just we'd rather be in charge of it and then it's just easier than uh there is a problem that we know we can find out quicker yeah yeah just less uh less middle individual yeah more middlemen more caught we'll just hire dylan he'll be our drone driver deliveries okay i live in a van down by the river there i got it the real life guy says i love watching you guys make candy from scratch i hope to catch more lives when i'm not working my 100 legitimate job don't get caught wow more like did you just do it no dad did but the colors look very different these are much more pastel they're very vibrant all right well it's been like an hour and 40 minutes wow and uh five minutes yeah i'll let you guys get back to uh not being on camera we're gonna stop making candy yeah okay yeah we're all done all right well say goodbye everyone bye like for your everyone", "TGHWwV_CI58": "hi everybody so today I'm going to be doing a review of the medicated hard candies I've done reviews on this before I've just never done uh it's root beer so there are 30 milligrams each and I still have this really bad cold like it's it's horrible I don't have the the muscle pains or anything but everything's just kind of here and you just feel like [ __ ] so I'm hoping that this will this will feel better this will feel better this will make me feel better okay so let's let's see I'll do okay all of it why not it's Saturday I have nothing to do I've been like this since Thursday maybe you know oops make me feel better I'll put these two in at first um they taste like the root beer surprisingly because I haven't been able to taste [ __ ] and then you could taste like it tastes a bit of that that we'd taste or whatever it is but I will say the the root beer ones here you can taste the root beer I've done a big fan of root beer but at least least I'm not tasting like the weed because it wasn't usually when I do it really sticks in your mouth so what I'll do is let these dissolve and when I come back I'll let you know how long it took for them to kick in and also what I'm feeling and all kinds of stuff like that so it'll be doctor probably usually takes about an hour yeah it's like around 12:30 now so probably it'll be a little bit it doesn't work if art used to work really quick and notes that's real roughly about an hour you know what sometimes I wake to I've been waiting I'll go a little bit over when I first start feeling it because usually it what I'm done telling you guys it's you know if I would have waited the extra 15 minutes or whatever to do it or even half an hour sometimes cuz it just keeps getting stronger for me anyways and anyways we'll be back I'll be back to tell you what I'm feeling and everything else ok so it's been like um like an hour and a half I would say and at first like I started like when I first started to filling in feeling feeling this it was like roughly about it like an hour in ten minutes and then hang on I'm gonna I'm gonna light a joint so that one's looking around in an hour and ten minutes and then um I was like well like I started to feel better right I was like oh my sickness it's finally going away so I you know I went out and [Music] it's nice but it's like really windy here you know and then I put some like I had like these little um glass pumpkins you know whatever so those are going inside and [ __ ] this [ __ ] joint so then you know then a I had some other things I had to do like ahead of this list Lola this list that um but I you know whenever I thought of something that like had to be it has to be done before the snow comes and then I went back in the house cuz I was in and out doing stuff and it was like so nice and cozy in there but i was like no we can't feel okay like I feel better than I did yesterday way better there's the bus we better than the first day I'd say smoke this when when you're gonna cold still feel like that congestion and [ __ ] but you if you need to get some stuff done let's stand in here in the cubby [Music] somebody's mowing the grass and I don't know why anyways I'm dumb so the medicated hard candies you get them at Canada smell the root beer is actually pretty not like it's it's not that bad like you can taste a lot of the root beer taste some I find that you don't taste like you know I don't know I say strawberry Kiwi I think that was one of them but you taste like a lot of the THC the root beer I tasted the root beer I'll stay stay on stuff but the root beer was I need to just keep puffing on this [Music] thank you Charlie likes this kind of weather I know what I want to give this [Music] I'm gonna give it a 9 in the oh my [ __ ] category just because like this this feels better than when you take like cold pills you know like cool pills gets rid of like say this stuff you know is for a couple hours and but sometimes this kind of cute nut cures but it makes it better than the cold pills not too sure how it would work on the COFF maybe because I reek like if it's a indica and it was a really one of the things and it was feeling relaxed maybe you would kind of slow down your cough ever think anyways that's my gig at night because you know you're sick but it feels so much better like it's the only thing to is okay so this is we're still spoken the new Caen before I got sick I like the munchies like crazy since I've been sick I have like and cuz that's part of the cold they think that you have no one no appetite you can just you eat but it's like it's not a big deal and maybe it's because like you can't taste either I don't did you hear the bang fire a Charlie wait Charlie's right there he didn't even alert me what's wrong with you there's mr. Berg [ __ ] I was okay and now like I'm really maybe they don't like the smell but it's really windy oh maybe not just slam the door what the [ __ ] this review went from like being grade and it's still great but there's just a little paranoia anyways I was gonna say maybe gonna rake the yard but I'm not really sure I want to do that anymore this [ __ ] joint that's not even me that's rolling it's like a little machine so dr. everywhere there's one year that's one over there just keep smoking it and they won't know if maybe I'm having us like it just that cigarette cigarette come on this I'm just a little nervous I was all talkative Oh forgotten I'm coffee I [Music] don't think you all forget it's a little close I don't think you want to watch me rake the yard like that's a little bit boring so I'll just keep talking um yeah this stuff is pretty good I could move or they'd probably be so much better if you weren't second did it but and and you'd probably you know like when you're sick and you don't sleep as well this stuff here would probably you would probably get a good night's sleep yeah I would have thought a like if you [Music] stop charlie you take like cold medicine and whatever for how many years and like you don't even there is stuff that is and it lasts longer too like cold medicine is it doesn't last that long like four hours like maybe two hours this stuff lasts way longer than two hours and you feel way better there yeah there's Charlie he wants to play hey Charlie want to play um okay so um my hands are starting to get a little bit cold and I think maybe I should go inside so um I'll meet you guys back inside in like a minute or two okay so um it's been like it's just about been like two hours and then still I'm feeling uh still pretty good I'm a little bit hungry not like um not like you just you just need to like chew on something like a couple chips or I don't know whatever it is right and bettan you're good like you just um the only thing that I noticed that's different is my nose is really stopped right now but tomorrow I still feel good and get it at can abysmal and I was also just thinking like maybe it's not mad for everybody but I should take this before you know taking the cold medication and you're still like um you feel like when you do when you're high except if you have a cold then you feel the cold part too but it's like you know it's there but like the symptoms aren't really bugging you overclock the the type of day it is today like gum it's I don't know it's ten or eleven or out and sunny and there's like a wind and there's like there's not much there's not like a lot of leave while the trees most of them are pretty bare just the type of day it is it's like a you know it reminds me when I was a kid just like though you know like you can smell Thal it's like one of those days these hard candies you know pretty good and if you want to maybe experience um [Music] now that he said that okay so yesterday there was like a little bit of snowflakes here not like a lot but there was so many like there was not like enough and I remembered when I was a kid that we had a deck and there was me and my brother and my my friend and her brother so I was friends with her and my brother was friends with her brother I don't remember we're outside playing and and we were on the deck and for whatever reason I don't know what worden I remember when it started to snow and it was like around like 4:30 ish so it was it was um like night I think it wasn't a sunny day so it was my not dark but you know it was like kind of like dark anyways remember we started jumping up and down saying they was snowing and like how we were gonna go sliding from this little bit of snow and I was like I forgot all about bad yeah I find like other than like the the the being sick part it's good like I just I wish I wasn't feeling like this so it would feel better but it still feels good um and I think that's everything said nine get them from I can't abismo the medicated hard candies there thirty milligrams each and and oh my god no this is just getting really bad Hey oh yeah there's like a lots of different flavors they have on there I enjoy them [Music] and I think that's that's everything so that's it that's all bye", "UirMWx9OdK8": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of that crazy crazy confusing place you call your dispensary today we are taking a look at one of those especially confusing what exactly are we talking about here kind of products that your dispensary may carry and what exactly kind of product is that well it's none other than other than tincture i guess what we're calling tincture in this day and age um and what we can also just call um emblematic of all of this sort of inconsistencies in uh weed policies especially when it comes to um dosage requirements so uh and how is that true well we are taking a look at an 800 milligram tincture that stretches the very definition of what tincture is and that is the five star extracts flavored tincture taste of peach oral uh tincture product again 800 milligrams of thc so what why am i so dubious it's not that i'm dubious of the 800 milligrams i'm um they have their lab testing results on this little confusingly curled up sticker here and you know shows the amount of thc in there i just bring this up because this isn't tincture by any traditional definition uh this is the exact same stuff that they were selling years ago when there was no limit on a thc in products and they called it syrup which was an allusion to the codeine sort of cough syrup that people used to drink i guess the idea was that it would get you so high it would be like coding i don't know i think but it shows you kind of how far off we are the mark here this is that exams exact same stuff which is now no longer able to be sold because the only thing you can sell over 100 milligrams is tincture so their notion or what they decided to do was not so much rewrite or create a new product but just simply rebrand existing stuff and i'm not saying that i actually don't know if they existed then or not but i've seen a lot of these syrup companies doing this cannabis is another one and i love them um but it i'm not blaming them i'm not saying it's anything wrong with them i'm just saying the laws are so stupid and screwy that way that you get weird stuff like um candy flavored syrup being called tincture which is nominally at least supposed to be medicinal um and uh this is again just like pink snow cone syrup except it will almost certainly taste gross now they do uh back when they used to sell this kind of stuff before they had you i think the consumption idea was you would take it like a syrup you'd mix it in with maybe soda or something here they really do suggest you take it like a tincture which i don't know if that sound is coming through it is just as thick as cough syrup so uh that seems kind of odious to me to have this much under your tongue of that thick goopy liquid but you know maybe we'll try it both ways and see uh so for an 800 milligram thc tincture i believe this was 60 bucks which is um more expensive than say your breeze uh kind of tinctures but kind of maybe in the range of some select those kind of levels so it's not the cheapest tincture out there either um uh it comes with this fancy and by fancy i mean the least fancy thing you've ever seen this little syringe for dosing which again thick thick syrup um so yeah not the cheapest um i've seen these five star extracts all over southern california especially in the long beach area and they usually come pretty highly recommended from folks as well uh and like all of our wheats reviews the way we're going to do this i know this is 800 milligrams i'm not going to do all 800 milligrams of this uh thing my guess is that it's gonna be quite gross um i uh when we do our tinctures the way i do all our edible reviews here on wheats is we do 100 milligrams because that's generally the size that you're going to buy in most edibles um and that's what we use as a baseline to review things off of so i will try to get as close to 101 8 of this bottle as possible really should have brought some scissors live and learn um i think i was able to just kind of pull it down yep there we go that smells like uh cheap gas station peach rings and weed lovely uh so yes as i said uh about 100 milligrams and then after i do all 100 milligrams it'll probably take me about i'm usually go over about an hour to do the whole thing i'll come back about two hours after that point let you know if this stuff is worth the hassle and the expense um my initial instinct is gonna be there are a lot of other tinctures out there that are cheaper and smaller so this one has some strikes against it already but we shall see you know maybe the thickness of the syrup something something yata cannabinoid receptors binding gabanoids done i don't know what i'm saying what i am now saying is wish me luck oh yes um our dosing uh instructions here on the back say that boy everything about this is just so cheaply uh or so rush put together 2.2 milliliters from here is 10 milligrams of thc our syringe is 3 milliliters um so you guys can do that conversion at home that's what roughly 13 milligrams ish in three milliliters uh in a full syringe which would be what how many of those in totality oh 13 times seven yeah like seven of those uh well no eight right yeah eight of these oh boy eight full ones of these that's gonna be fun well there's our oh my god okay they want me to put this all under my tongue that is ridiculous guys oh jesus okay well we'll try it um i'm guessing i'm gonna reserve taking this like normal syrup here we go oh [ __ ] um oh my god wow that is oh that's so bitter that is so insanely bitter wow wow oh my god oh that's um that is up there for most disgusting holy [ __ ] yuckers i've had to do that is nasty man at least i mean try to keep that all under your tongue as soon as it hits those taste buds ugh it is i mean it it tastes like cough syrup just straight up cough syrup ugh six more to go um i'm not going to be doing all of these sublingually i might try to do one more right here sublingually for you guys and then the remaining five i'm just gonna probably pour into a glass because and mix it with something this is just too much to bear [ __ ] okay oh [Music] oh oh holy christ disgusting oh it's still coming up oh jesus whoo well this is what i'm definitely suffering for you guys [ __ ] i hate this wow so what five six more six more of those for me everybody and just what um i'm gonna try to do these as uh over the next oh it might take me longer than an hour to get through all of these lovely little sons of guns but trust me i will and two hours after i get the last one of these hello buddy how are you doing the last after i get the last one these nasty sons of [ __ ] down i'll come right back here let you guys know if this is in any way worth all of the the uh rather prodigious amount of grotesqueness you have to stand ugh so far got a lot working against it sorry about the uh so much bitching um but you know we're just trying to be honest here and i will see you guys uh you know three three and a half hours pray for me see you soon [Music] welcome back to wheats guys it has been about three and a half hours or so since i first said hello to you um in about 90 minutes since my last dropper under the tongue of this five star extracts the taste of peach as you can see or maybe our camera i'll show you the level is down to about 1 8 down as we're doing only 100 milligrams and uh this is gonna be a fun little end of this review because not very often anymore do i get sort of conflicted feelings about things it's pretty binary at this point this is good this isn't good buy this don't buy this like you know it's there aren't so many shades of gray but here um i i there's some yeah some interesting things um first and foremost does it work hell yes uh this is the 100 milligrams i did which was a [ __ ] lot um of liquid uh hit very hard i have no complaints in that department this is among the strongest tincture i have done um it is yeah the i don't know what the formulation is here but wow uh very very very um uh positive when it comes to your uh getting your your actual high off the product 100 milligrams this did the trick and then some um but there are other things about it that are that may make me say like well maybe not you maybe not want to invest in this and um we'll go back to the price again briefly it's more expensive than some other tinctures uh for theoretically less thc but i'm gonna guess that this is gonna i mean with as strong as that hundred milligrams that first one was um it's gonna feel very much as if it had the full thousand milligrams or more uh in comparison to other sort of equivalently strong tinctures out there um so yeah again price theoretically it's more expensive but it feels quite a bit stronger in some regards um the other big downside is how much you have to do for especially for tinctures so i brought a comparison here i'm working on this review of this breeze um cbd thc one to one spray um and this thing has a thousand milligrams of combined thc cbd and i've reviewed one that has a thousand milligrams of just pure thc so this is oh it's half a fluid ounce it's not even oh my god okay that uh changes things again this is a half a fluid ounce 0.5 fluid ounces um and it has a thousand milligrams of cannabinoids in it this is six fluid ounces and has 800 um uh milligrams of thc in it and that is crazy um i thought this originally was one ounce it's not it's half an ounce so i have to change my calculation thankfully just gotta double it um that makes this right here 15 times literally 15 times stronger per volume than the syrup and the syrup is revolting it never got easier to go down um i did take it sublingually every time i did not end up mixing it i just decided to stay consistent but it is truly gross i am very much looking forward to doing the rest of this bottle because it's it's a really pleasant high but [ __ ] is it nasty um it way worse than i mean i feel like such a prima donna now with these um these are nothing compared to this so it's real gross real strong and you have to do a [ __ ] ton of it but it is real strong and it will get the job done you just gotta kind of suffer through it um and you know uh kind of hard to say whether or not it's uh you know that that is ultimately gonna come down to you those factors whether it's worth it or not um if i want a uh a really powerful high this may be something i go to in the future but if i'm looking for something more casual something that i don't want to just have to put on a clothespin over my nose and just gack down probably stay away um and before i go guys normally i like to save the cherry on top so a little something extras a little just extra recommendation that's not weed related um i usually like to save those for our favorite you know overwhelming two thumbs up style reviews however today let's give you one that i'm a little conflicted about not conflicted about the actual thing but conflicted about oh man it'll just make you uh feel uh conflicted in your soul uh and that is what a terrible segue by the way um i was trying to think of like oh [ __ ] i want to recommend this book what's a transition don't do it while you're high on five-star extracts try to think of one beforehand anyways the uh book is called oh my god why did i not look up the title exactly as hot as it is called um ah yes the book is called evicted poverty and prophet in the american city by matthew desmond uh released in 2016. uh i just finished it earlier today uh it was the pulitzer prize or a pulitzer prize winner uh for nonfiction in 2016. and uh dessert absolutely deserves it it is a book that won't make you feel very good it is a book that will uh continue to you know make you realize oh boy we've been kind of living in a collective delusion for a while but hey no better time to burst that bubble than in the middle of a pandemic so give evicted poverty and profit in in the american city a chance it it's as good as everybody has ever told you that it is if anybody has ever told you about it um but again if you're not looking for something that's going to thoroughly depress you to your core avoid uh and that's the conflict and because we were conflicted about our five star extracts the taste of peach super strong but also you got to do a lot of it and it tastes like rotting ass so thumbs up for evicted poverty and profit in the uh american city thumbs sideways for how it makes you feel and thumb sideways for the taste of ass boy this has gone long you can see how strong it is when i ramble it's because i'm high thanks so much for watching guys be sure to stay high but of course even more importantly stay healthy my friends it's crazy out there and in the meantime oh i already said stay high and stay healthy [ __ ] do those things and i'll see on the next review goodbye", "neH3wA3YHyI": "it's time for some delicious strawberry candies today I'm walking the candy aisle hey guys Jeff here with her review of well I don't really have to describe it I guess these are just the strawberry hard candies right um I actually think that technically I'm not I'm sorry I was trying to figure this out I'm not 100% sure because I bought these at a bulk store but I think that these are the our core our core brand strawberry candies but there are a couple different companies that make this kind of candy I think that this will probably be familiar to most of you out there this is a hard candy strawberry flavored this kind of wrapper design has been imitated by a number of different companies I know I like I said I think this is our core is the company which I reviewed a couple of their products before in the past and they're like a parent company stay on like a lot of different brands but they're all a little like somewhat obscure brands but I think this is the our core one I think the other major one that you'll see a lot is the Brax one but the Brax one they take take care to at least now they put Brax across their strawberry candies but like this is like that standard like long-standing strawberry candy that you would have seen for years and years and years I know I always saw this at every waiting room I ever what went to as a kid I remember when I was whenever I was like where was I at the hair salon the hairdresser and I would be like waiting to get my hair cut as a kid and they would have a candy bowl there and I would always go for these ones oh they're so good and I know I mentioned these when I did my review of the para Gina linking candies because those along with these these are really the ones that were always like the special find they were kind of all over the place at any candy bowl in any like office that you had to be waiting at these were all we always seemed to be around but but they were fantastic they're just they just I always have such good memories of these kind of candies so let's let's let's have a look here you open one up and okay here you go is the rapper so obviously it looks like a strawberry which is great and it's a strawberry candy and it's a hard candy so I think these are technically the pair dark or strawberry filled bonbon candy I don't know what they're called they had some like dumb name but sorry not dumb I'm sure it's totally appropriate but you know there's strawberry hard candies the thing about these hard candies when the strawberry ones in particular is that and this is kind of the design that everyone goes with with the strawberry candy is that in the inside of this hard candy it's got either a cream or a jelly sort of a filling like like a juice filling almost right so it has that extra burst of flavor what was I just reviewing recently that had that now I can't remember some sort of uh wasn't it was some sort of a toffee a taffy candy what the heck was that oh my god guys I'm sorry I review so many candies here I'm getting them all confused anyway it doesn't really matter this one is the strawberry candy and obviously it's pretty straightforward just looks like a hard candy let's give it a shot and so right off the bat strawberry flavor he's pretty good but you're just like it's like equivalent of like a mild strawberry lollipop say kind of interesting that there were these strawberry candies and yet strawberry lollipops I don't feel like they were ever a huge thing lollipops far more often cherry flavor right okay I'm gonna get into this mm-hmm hmmm so much like the para genome as I was describing that one hard on the outside but it's about some apply to it especially as you start biting through it you really can make some headway and it's almost like a like a real softer interior and it's got all that flavor in the middle hmm now it does had extra flavor I didn't taste any actual like cream Center in this one so maybe this one is not the same as the right so when I was thinking of maybe this isn't the arc or one cuz I'm pretty sure the arc or one has a cream in it so this could just be some random you know off-brand one however it has the same like substantively it's it's more or less equivalent when you get to that softer Center it still has more flavor to it so it must have had a little juice in there or something I just I just noted that I didn't taste any like an actual like cream in the center which I know some of them really have like a like a real distinct different kind of a liquid in there right but this this must've had something in him because the flavor was is pretty strong once you get into the middle and I always loved that about these strawberry candies in the there they're so they're just so so flavorful once you get get into them I'm gonna open I'm gonna have another one see if I can hmm no not seeing any specific cream in the middle this one or jam or extra juice but it is softer and it does have the flavor so we'll just call these strawberry hard candies I still think they're great um I'm gonna go out and try and find some of those other ones though maybe I'll try the Brax cuz that's like you know sort of a top to your brand right mm-hmm but this is really good if you like hard candies these strawberry hard candies are a great one to get well I just wonder if it's maybe hard to navigate the market of them because maybe you want some specific one cuz this is clearly not the one that I remember exactly from my youth but it's almost someone that I remember from my youth you know what I mean so if you're looking for something mm-hmm I don't know this is it but for me it really brings back the memories even though it's not exactly the flavor is still all there and I gotta say it's really good anyway walking mikania I was gonna rape the strawberry hard candies I'm gonna read I'm a 4 out of 5 it's good stuff and I'm still gonna go on to search for the ones with the actual cream Center or or a little bit more juice in the middle but but that's what I think of these you guys let me know if you have memories of these or any other specific kind of hard candies down below in the comments and thanks very much for watching everyone I really appreciate it click the links you see on the screen if you'd like to see more reviews and I will talk to you next time have a good one everyone bye-bye", "XrXf1ENRbEU": "hey guys welcome back to another video if you're new here my name is Korra and today we're gonna talk about chia-chu I discovered these recently in a dispensary that I have never been in before these are called sleepytime they're a chocolate taffy they taste just like a tootsie roll so they're pretty tasty um there is five milligrams of THC and two and a half milligrams of CBN and then this has melatonin in it these are really nice for bedtime if you I have issues sleeping the CBN and this is really gonna help I'm actually gonna see if we can't get these in the dispensary that I work in I really like these and I think this would be pretty beneficial to a lot of people with the CBN in it I've never tried any of the others but these are nice small doses so you can add add to it you know if you needed more than five milligrams you could definitely add to it so yeah I just wanted to do a quick pop on here and let you guys know how good these are if you can get some definitely try to okay thanks guys if you enjoyed this video please consider

"i-C006ckDu4": "that of faith channel checking in on this episode of the supplement review i am going over the top three intra workout products of 2021. i'm going to talk about what an intro workout is and who should be taking an intra-workout product but if this is your first time to the channel do me a huge favor hit that subscribe button down below on this supplement series i typically review a supplement on every episode to help you decide if it's right for your fitness goals your health needs and most importantly your hard earned money but full disclosure i'm not a supplement expert i'm not a supplement snoop i'm not a supplement engineer i don't have a degree in biology i don't have a degree in medicine all my degrees have nothing to do with ingredients that you might see in the products behind me i am just a person that does honest reviews i reviewed over 400 supplements on this series and i just do honest reviews to help you figure out what's going to be best for your needs and frankly and most importantly for your hard-earned money so let's get into an intra-workout product so many people have heard about pre-workouts that you'll see a lot of them behind me but the reality is pre-workouts are not as important as intra workouts during your workouts you're just frankly beating up your body you know you're breaking down muscle you are sweating out tons of vital vital minerals and you're doing everything you can to just kind of put yourself through the paces the purpose of an intra-workout product is to replenish those minerals and to give your body the ingredients it needs to rebound as quick as possible oftentimes during our workouts we're fine like all the way up to almost the very end we've got those endorphins we get the adrenaline we can take ourselves all the way to the very end and then towards the end we kind of get a little lethargic and especially after our workout we bonk right you kind of hit that wall so to speak the purpose of an intra-workout product is to help us not hit that wall it's to help push you towards the end of your workout and more importantly to help you recover quicker after your workout so that you're not going to just hit that wall and crash and oftentimes we don't see it coming we don't see that wall coming until we hit it square in the face [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] i am a big fan of intra-workout products because when i don't take them at that 45 minutes post-workout that's usually when i crash and i crash hard i happen to think that these have the best benefit for me more so than all the pre-workouts you see behind me and i am a big fan of just making sure that your body has everything it needs to recover as quickly as it can how do i use intra-workout products i typically start drinking them probably a quarter of the way through my workout and i make sure that by the end of the workout i still have about half left so at the end of the workout when i'm done time to wrap it up throw in the towel i just guzzle the rest of it and that's just how i take it everyone has their own preferences on how they drink their intra-workout products but that is the way that i found to help kind of fight off that post-workout bonk before i get started i want to know from you what your favorite intra-workout product is drop it down below and let's see if yours made my list on this channel i do honest reviews and i don't play favorites and typically when i do top three videos i will do like three two one and will pick a favorite however these intro workouts are so close i mean less than a hair gap between them and a lot of the differences is really small nuances that depending on what you're looking for might put one above the other so i'm gonna give you all three of these and i'm gonna tell you what i think our standouts for each individual one to help you best pick what's right for you but rest assured if you have any of these three you've got a winner the first of the three intro workouts that i'm gonna mention in no particular order is from apollon nutrition their enigma they've had a number of uh versions of them and they've all just kept getting better and better i've reviewed their latest version i'll put that video link in the description of this video and frankly they outdo themselves with regards to their ingredients panel the one flavor that i tried was pineapple and omg that tastes like a fresh ripe pineapple they know how to put ingredients panels together and they make sure that they always over deliver on all of their ingredients next on deck from nutrabio.com is intra blast and if you've been a long time subscriber to this channel you know i am a nutribio fanboy and i only tell you that for complete honesty and transparency i've been a long time fan of their intra blast and frankly it still makes the top of the charts because they do everything right they've got third party testing they've got transparent labels they make their own supplements not a lot of supplement companies can say that one serving is going to be 24 grams that's a massive intra-workout scoop and lately i've been a fan of their new york punch which has a beautiful coconut finish um but yeah man i cannot say enough great things about nutrabio and their intrablast definitely is the top of the charts when it comes to intra-workout products i have one more intra-workout product that i want to discuss and then i'm going to do an honorable mention but as i talked about at the beginning of this video any of these three intro workout products is an absolute winner it's an absolute banger it's an absolute top shelf and a field that is cluttered with supplements near the top of the top here we go from alphalion.com i have their superhuman intra they just rebranded a lot of their supplements to be under this superhuman moniker but they've had our intra-workout product in the past that was amazing and this one is identical it just has a different bottle and a different title same thing trade name ingredients fully stacked label and they always deliver 21 servings per bottle for some weird reason but it delivers everything that you would need and one of the things that they do absolutely probably better than anyone else as a as far as their entire lineup especially with their intro workout products is flavor they are really uh head and heels above a lot of other companies when it comes to delivering great flavors i know many of you don't care about what your products taste like what your supplements taste like you don't care about flavors i care about flavors right because i'm drinking it and i paid for it so i care about flavors superhuman intra another of the top three intra workout products for 20 21. now here is an honorable mention for those of you on a super strict budget when it comes to your supplements if you are looking for an intra workout that is going to cost you pennies then you should look no further than sea salt specifically himalayan sea salt you can buy a bottle like this for like five or ten bucks and you only need to sprinkle a little bit of it in your water is it going to compare to the absolute monsters that i mentioned in today's video no but it certainly doesn't cost as much because you're only going to sprinkle a little bit every time into your water it will help replenish some of the minerals and some of the sodium that you've sweated out during those tough tough workouts if you came this far in the video i want to know in the comments below did i get the top three intra workout products of 20 21 right or am i way off let me know what your top three is in the comments below as usual thank you for watching and don't save anything for the trip back this channel is dedicated to my life as a father of two wonderful children and it centers around health fitness and all of the tricks and tribulations that i go through to try to be a great parent to my children and

she's almost as tall as Donna pretty soon Donna's gonna be getting jealous because she's gonna get taller than Donna anyway yesterday we tried to put that inside of the glass skull over there right there and I didn't charge it enough so early this morning I put my plant my which imma call it here my pot plant over there like I do every morning and I bring it along here with the Sun and well it's been out here for I don't know it's been out here for a boat maybe six hours now five or six hours I guess something like that and there's still lots of hours left of the day so yeah it should work tonight we'll give it a try tonight and if it doesn't work I don't know I don't [ __ ] know hey I don't know anyway back to Donna and her joint her birthday joint first joint of the day oh let me Street man there we go anything to say on your birthday how do you feel old you're wise oh [ __ ] sakes why is old Donna she's like an owl I will say you're wise old owl okay make it sound like I'm 80 [ __ ] hmm I will say do you find in your forties that you like you just you're just done with stupid people I was done with stupid people on the first day I was born that's what forties is so far for me you're done with stupid people yeah well it's time for us to pack her up and move the [ __ ] over Timmons n you gotta let them know what you're thinking yeah you got to tell them how stupid they really sound or look or R or whatever it is you just want to tell somebody about all about their stupidness gets in front of you because that happens to me lots you need to tell them you get that was here get the [ __ ] out of my way that's what 41 feels like what might be short but I'll kick the buckle you hang no because you're kind of worried about your bones at this age - like there's a video for you short and worried about your bones Oh old short and worried about your bones like you feel like you still love it yeah but I mean it's probably like a one-time deal and you're saving that for the one time you need it your one last time yep but that's what Balboa said in like part two or three anyway there I think mine's never like that these guys are pros Donna they should they should fly us there maybe the guys I can't abismo should make how to roll [ __ ] joint yeah video and I send it to you I know I just want to know this part the filter part there's some tough cardboard maybe it already maybe is this like a thing itself this thing I was like do they roll that I would imagine that they roll it but I mean I wasn't there so I don't know you might be able to I do not know there's something for you to Google later type it into YouTube maybe somebody will show you how to make one if anybody knows where she can learn that leave a comment Hey real easy steps I don't want you know 15 minutes I put the cardboard right five you know five minutes you can't be all like cheesy there when you know somebody's trying to teach you something they take it may take a little longer than five five minutes don't think so it may take 20 minutes well then I'm not gonna use that way then and then you're gonna not have good joints for the rest of your [ __ ] life I will make something huh so you almost done that thing yeah I would I will end up gluing a piece of cardboard inside the paper and then as I rule [ __ ] inhale glue everybody say y'all it dawns on blue [Music] she's not allowed to [ __ ] weed it's because she's on blue you still [ __ ] sucking in the fumes heating up the fumes and inhaling them I get that would blue isn't it would blue oh thanks so I think it's like an all-purpose you know that oh maybe you know the glue that some of the kids used to [ __ ] eat when it was all hard at the top of the little slit that's probably something that happened back in Killarney where you're from I don't remember anybody in blue but you know where you're from you guys look like a bunch of glue eaters I remember round tables but yeah I don't remember eating glue or having people eat glue but there might have been glue eaters picking off and they chew on it yeah it's pretty [ __ ] I never did that I don't know why somebody would do that maybe they couldn't afford the Bubblegum's glue glue breath some kids they did it they didn't die I don't think anybody wants to hear your damn glue eating story anything else to talk about it's your birthday and the biggest thing you got to talk about is [ __ ] people you remember eating glue talking about the joint I know but your faith you know mm-hmm you might have a birthday memory or something instead you have you know memories of your friends eating glue mm-hmm No you almost done that joint just about like two puffs yeah and then you can lead the way and we'll show everybody the stakes you're gonna have for supper they're marinating oh well then maybe we'll await this okay well Donna wants to show them anyways where are we going right now oh we're going to Donna's giant ashtray and the giant ashtray how many you got in there can't even see any yeah one two - no [ __ ] that there's another one right there creeper guys under the [ __ ] pay for this tree what's that over there is for I think you're just making I'll [ __ ] off you can see them one two three and I know there was another one here's one two three four where oh yeah yeah and it's probably more oh go ahead guys scan it you're probably counting like [ __ ] 12 or 13 okay let's go to the steaks lead the way here is Charlie hey so Donna's feel lazy that's perfect birthday [ __ ] weeds so you gotta wash your hand she's gotta wash her hands so it smells like weed well I don't think anything the [ __ ] show right now I got some [ __ ] brownies here that Donna brought if anybody cares mm-hmm she brought some brownies Lakes went on it looks like that right now it'll look better once it's cooked steak and that's what you wanted for your birthday yeah steak and salad steak and salad or something I mean well uh I don't know we'll be back I guess later on when we got the barbecue lit up and we'll whip those bad boys on hey good Donna wave the barbecues all lit Donna threw some potatoes on because well they need a head start a you know how it is anyway there goes the steak there's one stake to stake and yeah close her up Donna [Music] [Music] ah I almost had him I should have leaped on his back hey I said jumped on him like it was a horse hmm okay are they done come on come on let's go coming uh whatever welcome welcome anyway oh there he is he was just being testy hey or something Charlie gets like that sometimes it might be a little bit dim in here but Donna has everything closed up because of the heat and I don't even find it that hard anymore but it's her birthday well let her have control of the window today hey anyways I got some steak sauce to go with my steak Donna's just getting stuff ready over there I guess what she's doing that I should do my supper Tok hey it's nice to have good weeds for my supper table today hey rock star gilli it really gives me the munchies that was dawn and putting my plate here if you guys were wondering maybe a scene I don't know anyway I was gonna [ __ ] make the steak myself for Donna for her birthday but Donna's one of those people when there's cooking involved she has to take over she just won't [ __ ] leave it be so don't say to me why didn't you make Donna's supper I tried it doesn't work around here hmm anyway here's what we got steak baked potato some cheese some cucumber and some tomato Donna I hope that cucumber was only used for eating now anyway yeah that's where anything and I'm gonna wash it down with a cold can of coca-cola I would face the camera at daughter but she doesn't like to be on screen when she's eating she's one of them me I don't give a [ __ ] hey I don't go you gotta have some steak sauce with your steak you just God you want any Donna Donna doesn't like steak sauce hey let's cut some steak hey Charlie he's like right up against my leg Johnny he wants some steak he's almost humping my leg Charlie's trying to hump my leg Hey on my flock that's a tasty [ __ ] steak I like the steak Donna really outdid herself on her birthday hey Donna really showed herself that she loves herself mm-hmm by making a good steak you made yourself a big steak I was supposed to make it for you you might as well be buying your own gifts yeah anyway where was I you gotta have lots of butter on your potatoes a on your baked potato [Music] and move the to pot plants underneath that lip right there because it's supposed to pour and we don't want to have our plants destroyed Hey and the little solar light that was in there that we were gonna put in the skull I took it out and brought it in the house with the skull because it's gonna pour and we'll try it in the house hey let's see how it works we'll try it out right now there's Donna doing bong toks getting all [ __ ] up on the rock star hey hey so I got the skull on and I'm gonna turn the weight off and that's what it looks like not too bad we're trying to find some more old solar lights and stick them in there too but for now it's not too bad that idea came from Corey 87 91 and yeah that's how it looks in the dark we look at it another time outside but it's supposed to pour and I'm not gonna show you guys out in the [ __ ] rain because that's [ __ ] eh anyway hopefully I'm in the middle we're gonna be smoking rockstar all night except for Donna I'll probably get in a couple for [ __ ] pretty rolled joints because she loves the pre-rolled joints hey oh yeah you're still doing that okay well keep doing that anyway I'll come over there to you just let me set everything up better without some new subscribers cigarette holder Diaz Corre 87 91 thanks for the [ __ ] idea for the light in the skull cigarette holder - you too can abysmal thanks for all the [ __ ] yeah thanks we love free [ __ ] [ __ ] stuff weeds hey and Donna likes anything free kids love

little bit on another day right I could I can show my new gear and we could if we could tweet it there you go expect the tweet from Donna with her cannabis smoke here anyway um anything else you can

weed and by the end of the night we're gonna watch some YouTube videos and still be smoking weed Hey so till tomorrow like subscribe and [ __ ] off hey", "WDgDnNerFqY": "welcome to diy or die today i want to talk about cloning this is the third episode in the cloning series today we're going to get into some actual mixing something that i know you've been looking forward to so here we have jam monsters pb and j strawberry and we're gonna try and get as close as possible we can to this e-liquid now in this episode we're going to break down batching and what batching is is essentially the first process of configuring your recipe to get to a point that puts you on the right direction now if you haven't watched the last two episodes i implore you to watch the last two episodes because they are imperative to understanding the next process that is batching if you don't know what defining characteristics are if you don't understand how to properly look and evaluate your e-liquid that you're trying to emulate then this process is not really going to help you so make sure you go back and you watch the first two videos now batching to put it more simply is just making different batches of the same profile the purpose of this is you can narrow down your recipe hunt you can narrow down your development to get to a point that puts you on the right path so in this particular case we have jam monsters pb j strawberry here we have identified our defining characteristic which is that combination between the strawberry and peanut butter that really makes that tick it's sort of like a jammy strawberry it's a little sticky it's sweet and then you get you know a pretty vibrant peanut butter uh on the finish so now that we know what the defining characteristic is we can take that and batch it out so we can try to really hone in which path to go down where we're going forward we're going to start to add in our accents and finish the recipe so here we're basically trying to figure out what pair of flavorings or what combination of flavorings gives us that defining characteristic and obviously you can't do this in just one go you're not gonna be able to vape something and then immediately go oh it's this flavoring in this flavoring you're going to need to do some batching where you're gonna take the recipe and just split it up across a spectrum of profiles that are within the realm of your defining characteristic so here we have the strawberry and peanut butter defining characteristic and here i have three different types of batches that will that i think are gonna get us to that defining characteristic they're all across the spectrum though so for instance this first batch we have tf is dx peanut butter we have flavor arts juicy strawberry and we also have capella's sweet strawberry so what i was trying to do with this particular batch is get like the most basic generic strawberry peanut butter blend right capella sweet strawberry with flavor art strawberry is a common strawberry blend here i wanted to add that with the most common peanut butter which is the dx peanut butter and what makes sense about this particular batch is that you know commercial companies they want reliability they want flavor houses that are going to always be in stock that have a really good distribution network that are just always reliable and also have good prices so that's why you always want to kind of look at the main flavoring companies when you're going with your batching or your recipe development now here in batching we want like a wide spectrum so we can kind of pick and choose where to go and really refine down the recipe and that's the first batch now the second batch we have one-on-ones strawberry jam chem nevadex strawberry and we also have tfa peanut butter the nandy version just regular tfa peanut butter and in this particular instance i'm utilizing two sort of left-field strawberries right one-on-one strawberry jam you don't really see it in many recipes because it's not the most popular strawberry but it does have like a jammy deep strawberry flavor so i kind of want to see if it's close to anything that is in the original and the same kind of goes with the chemnovatic it's kind of got a stickier jammier flavor though it is brighter than the one on one strawberry jam and then the tfa peanut butter uh mainly because it's just like the standard peanut butter so it would either be that or the tfa dx peanut butter in this case i just wanted to choose the different peanut butter the difference between the two is the dx version is a little bit thinner but it's still just as textured it's still just as flavorful and the reason you choose dx over the over the non-dx is that it lasts a little bit longer and then our last batch here we have wonder flavors strawberry baked and we also have flavora peanut butter yes flavor peanut butter which is a little bit more of a natural peanut butter and just a little bit more uh has kind of like an earthier note to it so i want to say when you're going about your batching you're probably going to do many more batches than this i'm just doing three just for the sake of the video but you would probably do along the lines of like i don't know a thousand two thousand batches like this is a long arduous process this is the most difficult aspect right once you have a defining characteristic translating that into flavorings is very very tough and that's where it's going to take a really long time so we have the more sort of mainstream strawberry peanut butter blend we have one with a few different strawberries and then the other one we kind of have one completely left field right so we're covering that spectrum all right so let's get mixing here let's do our mixing we have dx peanut butter at four percent and remember this is mainly to give it a little bit more longevity as opposed to the original tfa peanut butter which is arguably better in flavor but not necessarily in vapor experience and then that simple strawberry base blend that we have where juicy strawberry at two percent um which is gonna help give it some brightness and then we have capela's sweet strawberry here at four percent to just fill out the rest of the profile the rest of that strawberry easily one of my favorite strawberries to use i i always have like six of these little 30 mils now when you're doing batching and you're doing testing i always get asked should i add super sweet i think you should because it's going to just if you're going to put it in your final recipe well then you might as well put it in your tester so you can understand how the sweetener or the sucralose reacts with your recipe and with your bases especially with your defining characteristic which is what you want to be really accurate right now someone also asks i always get this should i add nicotine to my final or to my testing batches and i would say yes to that as well mainly because without it there is a slight difference in the way that the vapor feels you know it's not necessarily the flavor that gets affected but you'll notice a pretty big difference in saturation and vape experience without even one percent which is what i use in my testing it's what i use here now something also to keep into consideration is steeping right so when you're steeping your batches you want to make sure you're keeping note of that sometimes what i'll do is i'll make a bunch of batches and i'll forget to write down the date that i mix them at so when i try them later i'm like oh man how many days have it has it steeped because sometimes that steeping does matter should you always steep your batches you know it really depends on the profile with custards and tobaccos probably you know when you're going for your defining characteristics but with other fruit blends or if you're more of an experienced mixer and you can tell how a steep is going or you can tell how a profile is going you probably don't really need to steep it that long now we have our second batch here which is tfa peanut butter at five percent and this is um going to really give us all the peanut butter flavor we need you really kind of want to push your peanut butters a little higher especially tfa peanut butter mainly because it does fade a little bit again that's why i was using the dx the other one with this one we're going to go five percent because it might fade over time the chemist strawberry here at four percent so it's a higher percentage um base here and um this is a newer flavoring right this is not a flavoring that you're gonna see in a lot of recipes but that's why it's good to batch it you wanna know where it's at you want to know me hey maybe they did maybe they had some sort of secret contract or something you know we have our strawberry jam at two percent which gives us a little bit of that sticky strawberry flavor and now we have our last batch here which utilizes flavor peanut butter at two percent which i don't necessarily think it's gonna be close but again you want you want to batch you want to cover all your bases just in case maybe something pops up something special or something uh unique and that's kind of where you're going to find that defining characteristic you just never know you also want to know how far off you are you know you want to know how how far off is this batch maybe we'll you know take something uh from it and here we have the strawberry baked at four percent also try to get your percentages spot on you know um try not to be a little over or a little under you really want to this is the most important part so you really want to uh to maintain a lot of accuracy and don't trying to rush through it like i'm doing here all right we have all three of our batches mixed up and before we start to test them let's just go back to our desktop here and let's just make notes right let's just make sure we put down what type of notes we need okay we're going to go down to our recipe notes we have to make the date here right so november 19th 2020 and then we're going to put whatever it is our notes are for the first batch maybe you didn't have tfa dx peanut butter and you used a different one that was something that i don't know you didn't expect to be in there it's just good to know like writing tfa dxpb was not yet available but could be useful stuff like that you know just mark everything down stay organized make sure you're dating everything make sure you're just being completely uh detailed with all of your processes with all of your tasting notes and with just the the entire thing you know it's only going to help you and what's great is that after years and years of your mixing you're gonna have this library of notes and library of experiences and just just a gigantic encyclopedia of mixing knowledge that you can constantly go back and reference to and you don't have to keep that all mentally all right here we go we're going to do our testing i do want to make a note uh it's a sort of you know do as i say not as i do type thing but when you're going about your batching it's a good idea to swap your cotton out you don't want to really keep the same cotton when you're testing between flavors sometimes you do though sometimes you do but for the most part you might want to have three different builds or be ready to to wick a few times because sometimes those subtle differences start to blend and it's really hard to tell what recipe is giving you what um but again in this case uh do as i say not as i do i'm just you know trying to speed this up for the sake of the video so here's our first batch to me this is already pretty much right on the mark of what the original tastes like which is a good start right because that's going to allow us to understand oh [ __ ] we're on the right path we are on the right path we've made the correct decision in identifying the defining characteristic and now all of it is a matter of refinement and balance and making sure we get the right ingredients to do the job and we hit the right percentages so in terms of the first batch with the sweet strawberry and the uh flavor art strawberry we're pretty dang close already like it's pretty nice already now it's always a good idea to to always get a little reference so going back to the original and just testing the original against your batches so there's something a little bit deeper about the original something a little bit more saturated less bright it's just kind of a little bit lower on the palette so let's go and let's test the third batch which is the flavor peanut butter with wonder flavor strawberry here strawberry baked and let's just see where this one falls in line and we'll see how close or how far away we are with this specific blend and this one is just too deep right it's bringing it too far down the peanut butter is a little too prominent the strawberry is just a little too deep and not quite as sticky and sweet and bright as it is in the original so we've kind of went too far on the other end of the spectrum now we're gonna have to pull ourselves back and go towards the more of the center now we're gonna try our second batch here and our second batch in my opinion is the closest one i'd say it's between the first and second batch where the the original profile sort of resides and what that means to me is that all we really need to do is figure out the rest of the recipe the rest of the accents and try to just enhance what that defining characteristic is to push it towards whatever is uh is giving this the flavor that it's giving it we figured it out right we've got our defining characteristic we've did our batches we've landed on uh kind of where we need to go and what we need to kind of do to get us to the promised land the next step is putting in the accents the next step is building out the full recipe and putting pretty much filling in the spots that are lacking from what the original is giving so hopefully this helped you out hopefully this helped you in your batching processes and remember that the batching process is the longest process this is what's going to take a really long time it's also going to take a lot of resources buying all the different ingredients that are available testing them pairing them all up is a very intensive process so just be ready for that but just know that this is where like that 70 to 80 of your is going to come from it's going to come from this specific part the rest of it you know that an extra 20 to 30 percent that's going to come from finalizing the recipes finalizing those percentages and finalizing those accents and that'll be the next step putting in the accents building the rest of the recipe out and the step after that will be finalizing it making sure everything is refined and that'll conclude the cloning series hopefully you

that means it means that I've gone out to my dispensary I picked up some edibles that are infused with cannabis that are industry available professional I suppose not homemade because that's what we're here to do today today I picked up Thank You Rex I picked up a little bag of saints and sinners and eaten most of this bag that's why the top is opened up I just want to talk about our package today some of our packaging sometimes they try to save money wherever they can these companies so the saints and sinners these are real generic white bag this back piece is just a sticker it has all of their flavors on here and the ingredients the front also is just a sticker it's just a sticker so they can put them on the ones and on this one you'll see that we have a hundred milligrams of THC new formula they saved this bag the candies inside are 10 ml are 100 milligrams of THC 10 milligrams each and then they've where they put new formula is actually a sticker over 10 milligrams of CBD so these were originally what they call a one-to-one which is same parts THC to CBD but if you remember that I talked to you last week the more CBD that you take with your THC can lower the high or the psychoactive effect that's because the CBD attaches itself to the same receptors that THC uses so and THC can't go can't bind to a receptor that has CBD vice versa and let's talk about this not for kids stick or two there is a poison controlled number on here so it's not just not for kids but if you if you have a bad trip you can McCallum they'll tell you what to do which is gonna be lie down try to sleep have something to eat to have something to drink to this day yet no one has died as a direct result of cannabis there is no overdosing on cannabis you might feel weird you might feel like you're gonna die you might feel like you're gonna have to lie down I know for me when I get overloaded I get crazy inside I get real jittery and it's like it's kind of like having too much caffeine and here's what our candy looks like also these saints and sinners have decided to label the actual candy itself marijuana marijuana marijuana not for kids not for kids not for kids which is you know I mean it's okay but it really cuts into you discreetly get getting rid of these baggies you know you'd find these little baggies are you kidding me right now okay okay when I went rinsed it off this is the strawberry saints and sinners this is a pebbles this is my favorite candy this is a runner-up strawberry [Music] it's really good oh my god the strawberry sub it's so juicy much so juicing well alright well I saved two saints and sinners I do like the name the flavors really good you have the second one [Applause] well that's two down now set your timers and I'll see you in a couple hours let you know how I feel hi everybody we are back it's been a couple of hours and I'd say that they worked pretty good pretty good I'm not gonna complain about it I wanted to cover off on a couple of things that's good for me it's good for you and good for the companies that make these candies and these edible products first of all the name of this company is called evergreen herbal you can reach them on the web at their website at for evergreen herbal calm for evergreen herbal calm as I spell that our ingredients today are granulated sugar citric acid corn syrup coconut oil cannabis oil artificial color and artificial flavor that's not great although they are using neem oil for our pesticide which is nice 27 calories per candy seven point five grams of sugar I'm gonna tell you that these candies are pretty good I'm gonna give them on a scale of ten for flavor I give them an 8 a seven seven and a half let's give him a set of and a half for flavor and for efficacy [Music] let me give them a six they are not as potent as some of the other ones that I've had and I know that it seems strange that everything is supposed to have 10 milligrams of THC but you can't control the quality of the THC that is in the product so I don't know what they're using they don't tell me what strain they're using probably many but if you know this bag of candies compared to some other bags of candy this was only $12 pebbles run at 15 some of the other candies are going as high as you know sometimes $30 for 10 candies so for price I'm giving them eight for efficacy and giving them a six and for flavor at seven and a half so these are worth it get some lets see you next time oh but wait I had mentioned that we were gonna make some actual food I'm gonna start my Baker madness back at it so I've been sent some recipes by some of you guys which is really great I'm gonna I've got a I've got three people send me the same banana recipe so I'm gonna do that one so if you sent me the banana bread recipe we're gonna do that and I'm also I think the next thing I'm going to do is infused candied bacon not everybody can get candies at a dispensary I would say that almost everybody out there can find cannabis flower somewhere so we'll talk about that in the weeks coming up I love you guys thanks for tuning in and we'll see you next time on Baker madness [Music]", "IIqB1wlfboE": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today i'm going to be showing you guys how to infuse any type of candy that you buy from the store well at least any candy that has a sugar coating on it for example um we're going to be using sour patch kids and sour patch kids watermelons but any other type of candies that have that sugar type coating will work i've also done this with just like generic gummies that you get from the bulk section or anything yeah anything like that will work and this is what they will look like so essentially they will look exactly like they did in the bag and this is what a lot of the time people are selling so like they put them i don't know what they have like there's a different name for it but the logo and everything looks very similar to this and you're you're buying these and they look exactly the same as a store block gummy and the reason why is because it is a store-bought gummy and it's just been um sprayed or um in this case dropped on um tincture um this method is not going to get you exact dosing so please don't do this with intentions to be um like having a perfect dose because it's not really possible to do that but you can get it pretty close but for most people who are just using these for themselves like i am it doesn't really matter in the end so yeah let me show you guys how to make these and i just want to say a huge thank you i just hit 10 000 subscribers this weekend that was absolutely amazing it is my birthday in a couple of days and i feel like that was kind of like an early birthday present to me if you haven't subscribed already please do now i would appreciate it so much here's what you're gonna need some store-bought candy um the sour kind with the sugar on the outside some tincture and a syringe okay so we're just gonna start by getting our surface ready i'm just using a baking sheet with some wax paper you could use parchment paper a plate whatever it doesn't matter and then i'm taking my candy that i have here um i chose sour patch kids the kids and then the watermelons but you can use any candy that has a sugar coating on it it doesn't need to be a sour sugar or not sour it doesn't matter as long as it has that um sugary coating so i've done this before and just gone to like bulk barn and just chose whatever candies i like um you need to have that sour sugar on the outside because that is what is absorbing the tincture so yeah once i have the candies i want to infuse i just lay them out on my baking sheet and then here is my tincture so now i'm going to get my little syringe thingy and pull up some tincture so i'm not measuring how much i'm really using because it's just for me to use by myself but if you want to know how strong they're going to be you could like keep track of how many syringes you use per x amount of candies but anyway so you're going to take your little syringe and you're going to press it on to the candy and not too hard but hard enough that it's not going to go flying everywhere um here we get a little bit closer so you can kind of see what i'm doing so yeah so i have i fill up my syringe and then i set it on top and push down with a steady hand that's why i'm using two hands so i can be really steady with it and then i just push enough that um fills the cat the sugar coating with the tincture but not enough that it goes onto the tray if you add too much it will leak off of the candy and go onto the tray and then you're wasting stuff um so just use less at first to see how much it can kind of hold and just a reminder here this when you're doing this is not the candy itself like the gummy candy the chewy part is not absorbing the tincture it's only the outside that absorbing it so then now i'm just doing the exact same thing but with my sour patch kids now this is what they look like after i did the first round so that means i've only added tincture to one side of the candy and there's those watermelons you can see they've already started to dry um and you're just gonna leave these out with um air circulating so i just have a fan facing them um to help dry them off um but i have kept on having to move the tray because it kept on sitting in the sun so you don't want to be in the sun or it's going to melt as i put them into the sun here but you know that's for the visual effects so has that good lighting but yeah so in the fan leave these to dry until they're dry ish and then you're going to repeat the process of adding more tincture okay now that they've dried which i think that took like 20 minutes not even i'm just flipping them all over and then i'm going to repeat the process so with these watermelons i could flip them over repeat the process and then turn them on their like other side i feel like they kind of have a couple sides they could sit on whereas with the sour patches i can only kind of turn them over one way or another but you can keep repeating this process over and over again so i only put tincture on or i only put one layer or one serving i don't know what you want to call it i only did each side once i guess is what i should say just because i wanted to be able to eat a lot of these in one serving so if i kept on layering the tincture on it would limit how many i could eat at once um but yeah so you're just gonna let them dry after this and then you could flip them over once again and keep on adding and you can keep on doing this over and over again until it no longer absorbs any tincture and i think you could probably do about four or five rounds on each side so keep in mind when they are drying it's evaporating all the alcohol from your tincture which is why you're able to add so much to it but um i think you could also add some more sugar coating to this to allow for more tincture on the outside but i didn't want to mess around with it too much i just wanted to kind of show you guys the simple way to do this um and you know it's kind of guaranteed that this is gonna work um you could also do this with your already infused gummies so if you actually make some gummies with your tincture and then put a sour coating on them you could do this again and that would make them like extremely extremely sour non-sour extremely extremely strong because in this case these ones are only having tincture on the outside whereas if you had a gummy that was already having tincture on the inside you could also add on the outside and that would just be super strong and lovely now i'm just gonna zoom in here so that you guys can see a little bit better about how i am actually adding the tincture without it splashing so i'm taking this little syringe and i'm pushing it lightly on top while still having control of the syringe and once you do a couple of these you get really used to it and you kind of know exactly how much you can use [Music] so they were all done but i guess i decided i was gonna add a little bit more which i shouldn't have done because i got kind of sloppy about it and you guys are gonna see what happens when you get sloppy about it or when you put too much tincture on your gummy and it's not able to absorb it so let's just take a little look closer up so you can see that tincture on the bottom of my waxed paper those little greenish brownish splatters there so that is tincture that is wasted i mean obviously you can lick the parchment but if you don't be so quick and lazy when you apply it it shouldn't happen so if you see my sour patch kids here there is pretty much no tincture that leads off just a couple of little specks and that's what happens when you're patient instead of when i went overboard with the watermelons without letting them dry in between okay now let's just take a look at some of the finished ones versus the original one so here is a finished watermelon um and then yeah that looks good and let's grab a un tincturized un infused i guess uninfused watermelon and that's how it looks so you can see that sugar chunked up and then it gives it that it also have that little bit of the brown and greenish after the um alcohol evaporates so it kind of looks like grubby i guess i don't know i just feel like it kind of looks like dirty but um it's only if you look kind of close up and then let's compare it with some sour patch kids on the left there that's a uninfused sour patch kid and on the right that is a infused sour patch kit so it looks a little bit like wetter kind of it's not wet though um but yeah the sugar kind of clumps i don't know i don't even really know how to explain it but i guess you guys can kind of see on screen there yeah then there's our little watermelons um and our sour patch kids um i guess now that i'm closer with my camera here i can show you a little bit better kind of the tincture that is still on the pan um it's not too bad but i was doing this with one hand part of the way because of the camera and stuff so i was a little bit sloppier but if you guys are careful there shouldn't really be any waste now they are all dry and i'm just packaging them up um they dried like i said for like i don't know 20 minutes half an hour if you want to be super sure they're really dry i would just leave them out overnight and if you want to you can always add more tincture there is nothing stopping you from adding more a day later two days later a week later whatever it's all gonna work now you have a bunch of delicious infused candy that was super simple to make and i hope you guys enjoy this little trick as much as i do okay so now these are finished let's taste them and see how they are i'm going to start with the sour patch kids here so immediately when i open it has a very strong smell and these are going to taste stronger than gummies usually would because the tincture is all on the outside of the gummy so when it touches your tongue the first thing you taste is the tincture whereas if you're making your gummies homemade the tincture is mixed in with the gelatin with the sugar and everything else and it's less of a like direct flavor as soon as you eat it um but once you start chewing it kind of all blends in so it literally just tastes like a sour patch kid with tincture i didn't make mine super super strong so like i would eat this whole bag probably but you can make them so that they're really strong yeah oops very good very strong tasting but that'll be depending on how your tincture tastes so it's just going to taste like sour patch with a touch of tincture okay now the watermelons they're just so cute i love these bags so much i reuse them to be honest they're super super cheap but i'm cheaper um so whenever i use them and they're just like for gummies like this i'll just like reuse it after but i wouldn't reuse it if i was giving it to someone anyways [Applause] um these ones are better not just because i like the watermelons better and surprisingly they like you think they'd be all sticky and stuff but they're not i literally put these in the bag like right after i made them instead let them dry because i'm lazy um yeah they're not sticky at all they're very good strong you can definitely tell that they have tincture on them but yeah thank you guys so much for watching this video i hope you enjoyed it if you did please leave a comment subscribe and give us a thumbs up thank you guys so much for watching and have a wonderful day", "LLzin4WP29Y": "we've a presence on you boy early stay we'd be doing a review on crafty cannabis once again another strain another new strain

face law a lovely ink [ __ ] with a maximum Madeleine meds hi candy I'm og what you think candy apple TV see before I got this strain I didn't think about candy at 1g I was just thinking okay candy I bought cheap I didn't think about it all I was thinking was it's gonna taste like Apple it tastes like a my eyes did not remember as a kid I mean they still exist but as a kid I've seen him a lot candy apples go to the bodega I'm from Jersey so every quarter was a corner store every corner bodega okay I went to the bodega and as a little kid I always seen them candy ass never got one I never really liked it matter of fact I don't even think I would've tried it as a kid I just wasn't into it I was like damn an apple covered weekend he and caramel and peanuts laughs not for me I think I tasted it one time I didn't bite into it I licked it cuz I was a little kid and I was scared such lifting they taste bad the toilet remembers the candy and the caramel taste fast-forward a thousand million years later now I'm a grown man I have not even a candy apple tasting this I would assume this is exactly what a candy apple tastes like for everyone out there whether you're grown up or you're a kid if you have an addiction to candy apples right here my friends this is what you're going to need the candy oops oh you're gonna need it it tastes exactly like it I know I know I know it's been a long time I know I only licked it one time but this is what it tastes like I promise you you know Andy does not lie try it out for yourself Cheers okay like I told you last time my stranger knew everybody's palate you know your tongue everybody's tongue is always gonna taste something different than person so just because I tell you I don't taste Atlas doesn't mean that you will not take that much me personally I taste caramel I taste I don't want to say it cherry well I taste some type of candy which you either outer shell and the layer of the Apple obviously I don't taste peanuts that would be kind of weird but yeah all I taste is caramel and candy the caramel is in stronger than the candy the candy the candy is a powerfully them but you taste the candy a lot too and that the caramel is is there it's very consistent I just really wish our technology was also here stick this in the camera and then you must put your lips on it actually hit it cuz I wish you guys forget this for those of you that have tried the candy apple then you probably know what I mean that it tastes like any other house caramel has a cherry candy space once again I'm sorry but I do not know the percentage of this but I do know all of crafte Candice's they it starts out like 70% and it goes up there's nothing lower than 7% from what I remember from what I've had nothing lower than 70% and everything is higher than 70% which is don't forget to hit the subscribe button don't forget to hit the Lights thumbs up don't forget to turn on hit notifications so when I drop these videos you have

these for free like three weeks ago labor day weekend from uh lbc excuse me the corner lbc i just got back from my run i'm very out of it kind of right now um so they are precision dosing and visually wrapped uh five milligrams per piece so it's pretty weak sauce i don't expect that i'm gonna feel it too much because i probably have a high tolerance as vegan gluten free natural flavors and colors and let's see it also says emerald sky brings together 25 years of candy making experience with the vision of infusing time on our confections with world-class cannabis extract we are dedicated to an uncompromising standard of quality flavor and potency and all of our handcrafted tsc infused confections um one whole piece wait two hours full effect that's i wonder if it's like a hybrid i'm assuming it might be under this part but i guess i should have killed this earlier yeah we're not going to get over this um i see it does contain dairy or maybe it doesn't but it's vegan so you guys do see it's made where peanuts are made okay well i would love to figure this out emerald sky edibles.com let me try to peel this off i'll get back uh it does say ingredients are sugar corn syrup citrus acid natural mango flavor gum herb and also cast extract um it has zero milligrams of sodium zero grams of fat i think four grams of sugar six grams of carbs it does have an algae warming it is made in a facility the process is dairy peanuts true nuts oil good stuff so [Music] wait like it says for two hours and then they're very hard to open so your children will oh my goodness will not be able to get them out so inside is actually two individually packed so it's pretty cool i guess so the other one won't get dirty while i'm waiting let's put a few little bear on it and we'll die and see his heart dropped it's gonna be a lemon truffle mango so let's see let's open one of these bad boys up let's see all right it looks like sugary like super sugary it's like kind of almost the size of like a jujube you know what it's called mega knight it's hard definitely hard candy not much for the waiter i just get over it flavor is really good mango flavor for sure knocked over my water and 12 23 i'll be back in an hour okay so it's been about 18 minutes i've also hit my cz i kind of cheated so that i hit a sour tangy so i am drinking a little restaurant but i do fill in a little bit we'll see in 40. two minutes all right it's been an hour i've hit my susie about three times [Laughter] me hmm blinkered the sadder people this might be sorry angie [Applause] okay i ate candy an hour ago the emerald emerald sky here's the other one a little tropical tropical manga now i'm staying hydrated i'm also drinking a rock star or like i said i hit my cv a few times i've only done in the last hour i've been trying to work out i've done only 50 one legged chair squats it's 25 meters five but excuse me um because you can't paint i have painted one side of sativa edibles and then um i almost faded at a cardi b concert up to the fifa edibles but these aren't stupid so anyway the candy is delicious i will say that um usually five milligrams uh don't usually hit um for a while i was eating slices of like 30 milligram brownies every night and then for while i was doing 50 milligrams tonight um i haven't been eating edibles like that lately i'm just smoking with longer and stuff so and like easy but i know we ate some of the cano nanos canadas the other day nanos and they were really good and those are like fast acting sativa candies five milligrams of cheese and those i don't eat too much because i don't want to paint but uh i'm assuming because i've been exercising a little bit i mean i've been kind of feeling like i'm not indica but kind of like my adv is in full effect right now like i can't concentrate so come on come back here come here don't go nowhere okay so what i'm gonna do now they said to wait a full hour actually i think they said wait two hours but we waited the hour i'm gonna start the timer again try to do more spots we'll see how many i do from now until then and uh be back in an hour i am three hours in to the edibles 10 milligrams not very much uh my berry feel it i am hungry now tank just called me and was getting his food for his breakfast slash lunch so made me super hungry and so i post me postmated some subway tuna cause that's what sounds super good right now so i'm waiting for postmates to brand says any minute now um like i said i kind of have a high tolerance so it's probably why i don't feel the edibles as much um i definitely got to boost the energy off of doing the season blinker paired with the edible i think this is so oh [ __ ] hello thank you have a good is pretty high so the um edible part wasn't gonna do much uh for the most part it is a really good level though if you don't have a high tolerance then you could probably get super baked off those um oh yes subway tuna gotta love it when you're high this is the way to go all day every day and it's healthy it's good for my run tomorrow it's good for my run that i did today tuna fish no this has nothing to do with zombies but this is what happens when you get someone and even a but so i would say that i do like these levels i would try them again uh would i buy them uh they're pretty good depending on the price but uh i would definitely recommend them because like i said if you don't have that high of a tolerance then you are definitely going to feel those and they're gluten-free vegan so definitely will make a lot of people happy so we might do another follow-up in a little bit but like i said i don't expect to feel these much more but they were delicious so thanks to the corner lbc bam we'll try the other ones they gave us in a few days maybe we'll have dank take those instead see how he feels all right thanks for watching literally just posted our info on mega md i we got it on sunday i was approved actually monday it was approved [Music] dr frank and pc wow that's pretty cool they even came in a handy dandy little envelope please sounds really cool yay so now we got a wreck i would definitely recommend going through negmd nugtmd.com in your medical lab for whatever state you're in we offer a few different states and you can't beat saving money and taxes california especially long beach and santa ana they pride themselves on taxing any high but this is definitely handy i recommend you guys go get one okay it is like seven o'clock we are now t minus seven hours past the initial edible eating um after i ate the subway uh and took longer i actually felt the edibles kick in a lot stronger than they had been so i would definitely recommend them i would definitely buy them they're worth it um felt real good of course a real calm high not a very buff one but because it was only 10 milligrams but like i said once i added in the long wrap i've i think i did some packwoods lemon squeeze once i added that in took my high to a whole nother level so you guys look out for the emerald sky on weed maps we got them from at the corner lbc that's a dope house shop they know what they're doing they have great products they offer like the best products out there um check them out check league maps out because they are really good all right thanks for watching guys i'm gonna put this on like and subscribe share with your friends peace out by the wg tank and dabby", "1zZV8VnNShI": "okay fellow youtubers this is DM Blair wolf and today's video is gonna be on this tiny little green lollipop well I was at the Harrisburg East Mall yesterday and a friend of mine Ted owns the supplemental store east coast supplements in there and he got these they're called chronic Tandy what it is is it's got ten milligrams of CBD and it has o G cush terpenes in it so it's an all-around wellness candy okay but as small as it is in this little city CBD it has in it I think it might be more geared towards like little kids maybe for like seizures or or a DD or even just wellness in some way because ten milligrams isn't a lot for an adult I would think cuz I personally need it probably the whole case of pops to be okay because I think it comes with like twenty or so in a case so I would probably need two or three hundred milligrams of this stuff but we're gonna open it up we're gonna try it out and see what it tastes like and see if we can get any you wouldn't get any wellness out of it okay so just give me a moment I'll rip this sucker open and we'll see what's in it cheers pop first off Wow I smells like an OG plant rate right allogram holy moly doesn't seem to be any low chunkies or anything yet so I guess it's just straight candy that's like flavor right off that's like you stuck the whole plant right in your mouth holy moly [Music] it tastes good yeah yeah I think it tastes great there's definitely terpenes in it you can taste them right off the candy itself has room it was sort of a like a sweet flavor to it I don't know if it's my imagination but I feel something well I was gonna get to that I actually even though it's only 10 milligrams I definitely feel calmer and that was just a little lick that I did well or someone who doesn't ingest or take CBD in a lot the sights a little bit could probably be you know you'll probably be beneficial do you like calming or making you are relaxed be another thing like your kids run around the house bouncing off the walls like a Gibbon throwing Legos everywhere you've been one of these little pops be like your kid you know son daughter child have a lollipop it's definitely appeasing in flavor I mean like the more I eat it the more I want to eat it I mean totally is when I was a kid I probably just want to ask for another that like definitely is like peanuts chronic candy is that it definitely has a a sense of appeal in its flavor okay like I can say that like if I were to take like marijuana or so forth and put it in my mouth I would be like this definitely has flavor and I could say that when you do it if you don't continuously lick it it goes away like I felt something but now because I ain't continuously doing it yeah it's not doing anything anymore yeah you probably have to ingest a whole pot like it's supposed to be one dose but one does for who wonder what type of people would benefit from this like I said like maybe like people with seizures because CBD supposed to be great for seizures and focusing concentrating relaxation just watch them move like children it's a pop yeah ten milligrams I feel it but I don't think it'll last long not for me cuz I'm you know kids like fifth my size it'd probably be like hey I'm ready to watch Sesame Street hey bring on the spongebob I'm ready for cartoons is it snack time yet so let's go through our daily thing here first we'll say that one one two five one being and five being presentation what it looks like what definitely looks appealing ain't a person in the world unlike a pop so due to four and a half it was a little bit bigger around maybe a five because then it'd be more appealing flavor would it taste like right off the bat man it's like you put the whole plant in your mouth so I give this sucker a five color I'm not so big on the color could have been yellow like a lemon maybe put some kind of flavor in it just not just strength terpenes in the CBD but you definitely know it's in there effectiveness I feel it I don't feel it like like when I used like the flowery products like the CBD blunt or the bubble bag hash and that's a BAM in your face you're you know I'm medicated this is just an underlining feeling that definitely is calming and medically it's good so those three things combined and the price is nice um I was giving this one for free to try it but if I remember correctly on the box here were like two bucks apiece I think I think there was like 10 or 20 in the box and he had like two or three more boxes you could just maybe buy a whole box for 20 bucks or something it's probably gonna be a big deal especially for since I work here at that new Nannan it's [ __ ] stressful working in there sometimes cuz there's definitely a cultural gap so being able to calm down and being able to focus yeah I'm sterile these are your mouth at work no probably never know I know so if you have any questions or comments if you've tried these before or you know a different flavor or a different company or a place where you can Vicki's wholesale or even ones that are stronger 20 I think a 50 milligram one of these would definitely be more adult in a in a in a dose cuz I know when you buy just like the hemp bombs those pills are like three pills for 60 milligrams total you take all three of them pills you know you took them so if you have any questions or comments please feel free to leave them down below thumbs up like subscribe comment comment comment meanwhile while you're commenting I'm gonna finish this lollipop so till next time guys have a great calming relaxing medicated day", "MTQryyFsTcw": "hey guys so uh I've been trying out these wall-e jobs for the past couple weeks I've tried pretty much all their different flavors and stuff and tried their CBD stuff and 160 milligrams ones try them in the past I got to say right off the bat I tried this one maybe about six months ago it was the same as this they were different I do feel like now they do get me a little higher but back when I had these for sure there was like a real strong weed flavor on the outside of them after sucking on them for a few seconds the weed flavor would go away and it was just the berry flavor this one the same exact same thing same flavor everything six months later I don't know if they found a new way to you know mix it or wet but the THC flavor was infused throughout the entire candy and it got me real nice and high I remember at some point I only had like four of these mixed in a couple of these couple of these and I was real nice and high well maybe like I took about ten hits off the vape or so so I mean it's pretty good also their heat CBD candies were really good they tasted really good but of course there's no THC in there so these the 90 milligram ones I've had a few I had a blueberry one it was pretty good I lost a little case to it but it was alright surprisingly I liked the Pina Colada ones the most and I'm not usually a fan of pina colada but out of all the 90 milligram Walli drops I like the Pina Colada the most I had a strawberry cheesecake one that I did not like at all I gave it away I gotta say that these grape ones No they kind of taste like detergent II to me not very good this also has like a really fakey flavor the blueberry was kind of fakey too but it wasn't bad he's one pina coladas are okay he's kind of pineapple e to me honestly I did not like the flavor of any of these 90 milligram while he drops I probably would not buy them again yeah all their 90 milligram while I don't know what's going on but whatever flavor they use it just tastes really fake II really chemically they do get you high then 90 milligrams is probably pretty accurate but I mean flavor-wise it's just not there what I buy these again no if I wanted CBD stuff I would buy this again though I like the peach was pretty good and if you can find it I would get the hundred and sixty milligram ones they didn't taste awesome but they weren't terrible that flavor wasn't like super fake and they got you nice and high 160 would be worth it these 90 milligram ones not so much I wouldn't get them again but I mean it's stronger than say like a crappy lol edible or something but still I mean if you have other options you can get something like this or I would probably get something else but uh I mean while he drops all in all they're okay they're not lying about the THC content so I'll still give them a thumbs up hopefully they can get better flavors in the future and yeah stay tuned for more reviews and box and stuff like that subscribe and uh catch you guys later but", "jqQ2kfFFDo0": "[Music] is JimBob looosers please we're the whiskey track somebody that's right

video ever on our channel and this first video is just going to cover how easy it is to make a juice most of you know if you buy your juice from a from a store brick-and-mortar store and not online it can get pretty expensive anywhere from twelve to twenty dollars for 30 mil and if you just on a normal tank you know like a kanga thang or you know the evolves then it's not going to be too much too much expense because you're only going to get through 30 mil once a week if you're lucky but if you sub own vape or you drip you I mean I get through about 30 mils a day so I don't want to be spending you know on average 15 dollars a day to vape instead I want to spend about 20 cents to vapor which which is about what it costs to make your own juice and it's not that difficult every time I tell someone that I make my own juice they look at me like I'm a mad scientist and I do something very special I don't okay well first of all let's run you through what you need this isn't normally how I'm set up I'm self on the kitchen table or just give it a wipe down make sure there was no crumbs or anything the contaminated juice I put at issue in front of me this is what I put my bottle on as I'm filling it with different liquids that way if it spills it's just straight on a tissue I put a tissue right here just for anything else I need to quickly wipe up then I have all my syringes I've got ten mil five mil three mill 1 mill the ten mill I used for putting taking the VG and adding it to the bottle because obviously you need a lot one would go over what Fiji is in a second that would take the the base and put in the bottle the five mil sometimes if I'm using one flavour and I'm making like a hundred mill with it I'll use a fight mill dropper but a lot of the time for my flavors I'll use a one mill and again we'll have a look at that in a second okay the main ingredients one is VG vegetable glycerin this is what I vape I don't put any PG into my mixers at all except what's in the flavors already because PG is a very good flavor carrier and keep saying PG this of another P Jesus is propylene glycol the main difference is between the two the PG make is very thin viscosity is is very watery and so it's great for the cheaper tanks you know the the little tanks like I said like the kind of tanks and the e vod's and stuff like that because they wick a lot easier now whereas VG will clog up your coils it's it's hard to wick through cotton because it's a lot thicker but this is the this is the main differences between them the PG gives you a nice throw hit the VG gives you lots of clouds lots of vapor production a lot of people just have them both together 5050 or a 60/40 mix myself I'm not so worried about the throat hit anymore I get a throat hit because I sub on vape and I get the throat hair for that but I I love the is kind of like a sweetness just just a very nice full body vape on with VG and also some people who've got allergies the PG and I have slightly all get a phlegm build-up in the back of my throat or the back of my nasal passage after a couple of days of a pin it anyway those for the main tube that's the reason why I've got a tiny little thing a PG which I've had for about two years and I normally use it just for like maybe mixing tobacco mix well you know you want that throw hit which I don't mix so many of them name but I'm mainly VG this is a small bottle for me I bought it because I didn't want to pay the shipping on the big bottle now I do have a gallon of it turning up on Monday which today - Saturday and I've got a lot of my favorite flavors being delivered okay next people need it some bottles I have I bought a hundred of them in bulk because I I just make flavors all the time try different flavors some of them turn out great some of them are okay and a couple of them are disgusting so maybe only about three or four out of the several hundreds of flavors I've made of being just unfavorable and other ones they're not an all day vape you know your vape it and think oh yeah this is real nice and then after a you know a tankful you like now let's go back to what I was on but I do have some all day vape so that I make this I'm going to make one for you in a second very very simple one which I found recently normally that good ones are a simple ones but I'm actually going to make it in a new glass bottle I drop a bottle and spit in the packaging I've had this for about a year and I just realized I've still got it of course we don't want to get anything to professional wouldn't okay so a lot of people maybe would wanna watch this I don't know where it came from not me it's I cut chlorine in my water I'd rather not wash it but anyway that's my ball that's a 30ml with a childproof lock they look it won't undo until you push it down okay so we'll get that one ready okay the ingredients ah before we even start I am do you know what to put in how much bgg now I have to put in how much flavour how much this how much that and you know and how you keep up with it I've got hundreds of flavors well the best thing I find is is a app in the Google Play Store and it's planning to the vapes ejuice calculator I will put that in the notes below but it's uh it's invaluable it's it's great so planet of the vapes ejuice calculator and this point I don't know if we can see that on camera but that's what it looks like and it's got on here it's got recipe name then it's got your base nicotine which I use a hundred milligrams base but I'd only vague three milligrams so I put in their base a hundred and milligram is three and how many mills which is thirty and then I'll put my base ratio which is a hundred percent VG and n ratio I put in ninety five percent and 5 percent PG just because I could put out one hundred and don't really I just don't want it to calculate any PG in my mix so anyway and then you've just put in there the first ingredient I've got it's called red touch it's strawberry by flavor and I buy this in quite a big normally my flavors are in little bottles like this flavors that I like are in 30 mil bottles and flavors that I love are in $120 so this one is one of my favorites red touch strawberry or white strawberry by signature both great strawberry flavors but today we'll be using red touch strawberry pie flavor art and we're going to be using berry crunch by signature and this one I call straw berry crunch not strawberry but straw berry crunch because it's very crunchy strawberry so yeah okay so I put in there that I want eight percent strawberry and three percent berry crunch I know this because I know the flavors so eight percent red touch three percent berry crunch and then point five percent of um I put on that which is ethyl mortal or ether mortal wherever you want to say it and it sweetens the mix without using a gluggy sweetener which I do have a sweetener here which I use now and again by trying to just save that one for when I'm dripping because it will clog up the tank real good but I do like the sweetness in a vapor so we'll bring that one forward and just to go over some of these over there there's my ingredients that I'm going to be using today right there there is four of them oh and nicotine this is what these are for I put them on the table I'm not using them today but what I do use I've got I've got this in here this is my nicotine I keep it in a silk bag and then I take it from there and I pull it into here that way I've got it in a squeezy bottle and I can drip the night without getting all my fingers but if you get a hundred milligram nicotine on your fingers you will know about it I thought I was dying one night horrible it was absorbed through your skin so if you get any on you wash your hands immediately and then it's better just to wear the gloves I guess I should practice what I preach but um some other stuff we got here got one called smooth which does exactly what it says it smooths out the mix colada which is a menthol I got Veit wizard this kind of just brings the flavors together normally when I mix in three or more flavors all right use bait wizard and it just tends to bind those flavors together and just adds a little something like the shock board ones do extreme ice again I use that as a menthol and then I've got two sour ones here I got gummy bear flavor and I'd like to use the sour on that and get some sour coming those but there's like my additives and that's really all I use as for flavors some idea there's some of them I think there's something like a hundred eight or something in that box so today we're just using two nice and simple and I'm gonna put this recipe in the description below actually I've gotta make sure that I don't make this video too long as always the camera turn off so let me stop here and restart it okay sorry about that it does twenty minutes i said a nikon d800 is my still camera just takes nice video and needed to a wide angle and so i thought this was perfect thing to use anywhere I'm blabbing on a little bit as let's go back to what we should be doing and that's making juice okay so the first thing we got is our bottle then I go under here I put in exactly what I want to do I name it and then I click now this will do it in drops or it will do it in mils and you can swap between them both and my clothes they can go to the settings I'm going to remember what I put applications things drops to use drops number of drops okay so I've got 30 drops equal one mil which i think is pretty accurate so you can have it either in drops and sometimes with the drops if you're only using like 20 drops it's better just to do that rather than rather get a syringe dirty anyway let's see let's go to Mills okay so it says here twenty five point six mils of VG normally I'll pull their supporters VG into a glass and then sucking out at the glass for the syringe but just what when I make what I meant I'm making batches I don't just just come in and make one like I'm do it right now little trick with the syringe the rubber plunger just put it into your VG and it makes its way easier okay we're gonna take ten mill at a time there's ten squeeze that in the bottle and again if you'd like a bit more of a throat hit oil means you know do half-and-half pg/vg and what you will find this with VG the flavors are a lot more muted you need to use more flavoring because the pink the PG is the flavor carrier that makes it flavors really pop DG doesn't kind of mutes them a little bit so remember if you aren't using it now what I do with my syringes I'll push the clean ones over not put 31 on the end of the tissue my hand is a little white okay so we've got twenty five point six in that twenty five point five I think is the actual perhaps you put in okay red touch two point four mil then red touch raw berry both flavor up and I get all of my flavors from ecig V sig Express which is our online store and I'll put a link to that as well again I don't work for any of these folks or have any affiliation with them just won't get my stuff and they never once let me down there they've never gotten an order wrong they were sure on one order once and they put a substitute in there and I think this ended up with funding my money for it as well can't quite remember but I remember being impressed about it okay I was two point four mil so what's good about this one is with the one mill droppers they're very precise again I'll put it right there okay now with the berry crunch of saying the same point nine and just hadn't eaten welcome says 0.9 so I'm going to go back to drops so 27 rocks so we don't have to get another dropper can you go 27 drops and then it also says 27 drops of nicotine you see I put poison on here I actually wrote poison just to make sure open thinks it's a yummy nobody goes into my vape kit but just in case and last but not least four drops just gives it a sweetness without using sacrum okay next thing is now you give it a good shake now this one's pretty good this one's almost thinkable straightaway but they aren't this one is better after about a week of steeping it's perfect after a couple of days I'd say two-three days it's it's a nice bait I conveyed it straight away as well but but it's not not recommend it's not the best flavor and you're just wasting it steep it for about a week and if you're not sure what steeping is leave the lid on put it in a cool dark place and don't touch it for one week or maybe just go back and shake it up every now and again but put it back where it is and then get it out it gives chance for the for the flavors to come together Kohi so I guess is the word I'm looking for that's a good word for me but yeah it just makes them come together and settle down in a mixing the in the juice and the last but not least we're put right on here what's in there very we'll put today's date which I'm not sure what it is since today's date is the 16th of July and it's 3 milligram nicotine take that off pop it on the bottle there we go that's how easy it is to make your own juice there's there's $15 worth in any store maybe more I mean this is a high quality juice it's all VG is what they called our premium juice in the store I don't know why VG PG don't cost any more than each other but they just like the cooler up their premium I guess because they need to use more flavoring I don't understand why again it's one of my own flavors in here this is my one day vape I called it Mother's Milk it's nothing like the suicide Bonnie's mother Mother's Milk just like the name Mother's Milk wanted something strawberry in on those lines but it's got 7 different flavors in and stick around watch the channel subscribe and you will see me make this one it is an amazing vapor I love it the strawberry crunch is also excellent it reminds me a little bit of the milkman not as creamy but it's uh it's more strawberry than the milkman and it's got that crunch just like it crunch and then crunchy but it's got the taste of that you know that pastry just just like now this means a very nice vape and I think if we were to put some cream with that I think it would be a good clone maybe I'll try that and something else we should do on the channel is post underneath what flavors you have at home or or ones that you're thinking again or what your favorite vape is and I'll go ahead and mix it and comes out good I may even send you it but if it comes out good I'll show you how to make it this is what this channel is going to be all debate we're going to make new flavors every few days and we will test old flavors when it comes round for this one that's been steeped a week we will go ahead with vapor and I'll give you my opinions I already know how good that one is but we'll do it anyway I'm going to show you how to rebuild rdas build coils whip them and also the latest tanks the sub own tanks I've got the TF v8 on here now the client beast and I've got a temperature build on the RBA section of it and it's a really good yeah a lot better than the tfv4 which again is a great tank and it's got great RBA which it doesn't come with my device separate but anyway I'll show you how to rebuild these okay sorry about that camera turned itself off which I thought it might do it's been on for a while well anyway but it's really just a quick recap of what we've done you see how it's simple it was to make the juice there's no mad science behind it it's just making sure you get the calculations right and able to reproduce it again if you like it that's why the planet of apes are you juice calculator through the Google Play Store I'm not quite sure if it's available through the App Store for Apple I'm not sure but anyway get that it's it's invaluable you can also put notes on there dead it does everything you need and you can get store just hundreds of different recipes but anyway here's our first one and our first video and we've got strawberry crunch I would say that cost me about 20 cents to make this once you've got all your ingredients and your flavors once you've bought them the flavors last a long time yeah oh it says by 20 cents and in the store somewhere you know anywhere from twelve to fifteen sixteen dollars so man and I'm a fake this in a day but it's probably more like a day and a half debate 30 mil for me so it cost me 30 cents - sorry am I talking about cost me 20 cents debate that rather than 12 to 15 bucks you know it's uh yeah a lot cheaper well if you've got any questions post them below let me know your thoughts I know the sound on this same quality maybe a little bit day now I've lost my microphone either and I need to find the extension need somewhere so I will try and get that and get you some better same quality but this is the first video hope you enjoyed it I hope that's helped again please post below even post there and call me an idiot or you didn't like the video or you know I'm gonna get the trolls I ain't worried about that but if you want to be constructive and you want to get something out of this as well post below I always return the comments unless there's the house thumbs of them when I doubt that very much is the first video but I post your comments if you need any help making this I am not the be-all and end-all juice making I've just been doing it for a little while and thought I would share how I do how easy it is to make this stuff anyway I think that just about wraps it up again subscribed comeback hope you enjoyed it and I think the next video would either do a rebuild on the new TF v8 would it be good to do one before it becomes you know obsolete which normally happens in just a few weeks something else comes out a lot better so I think a rebuild on that would be real good and maybe a quick review of it and then I'd like to do a review on my top ten flavors must have flavours for DIY that way if you want to start making your own juice it will give you some ideas of some very good products out there some that I have read reviews on and ordered it and it has been as good as what they said it is so I would like to do a top 10 recommended flavors to start everybody off anyway I'm going to stop the jibber-jabber it's not nothing I talk as much it's cuz I'm on my own and maybe I don't know I kind of one way over here maybe thousands of you out there watching this but uh anyway thanks for watching please please please come back", "-9em9kqHLDY": "yo what up guys mr. reefer here bringing you another video review on another product today I got these magic pebbles you heard it right magic pebbles they're definitely very magical the reason they're magical is because they are infused with 100 milligrams of THC so you know they're definitely magic anyways today I got you guys this video review of the pebbles because I love these these are these just jumped to the top of my list of edibles that's up there with spot suits drink legal drink there's there's a bunch of other books that I haven't made complete videos for but this is I'm glad I'm doing this now because this is definitely one of the top 5 I would say at least for edibles these are amazing I picked these up yesterday on our daily walk with our dog me and my fiance walk our dog to our pot store and because they love her there so she's kind of famous anyways we've been getting these pre-rolls there and I just haven't had a chance to even buy any other type of like even flour or especially in our edibles so I'm glad I picked these up picked them up for 25 bucks so we got ten pieces of ten milligrams equaling a hundred milligrams of THC so each individual serving is Timnath two milligrams and I gotta say these work fast like stupid fast like it took us it takes us half an hour to walk to and from the pot store so hat we ate one outside you know we're not supposed to obviously but we ate one each outside while we were walking here before we start walking here from the pot store tip to our home and it took us I want to say like 25 to 30 minutes to get home and by the time we were home we were just [ __ ] the lid like we were ready to just have a good time and we ended up actually going to the pool afterwards our apartments which was actually pretty nice because I took another another one of these magic pebbles and while I was at the pool and we were just gone just terribly gone we're just there this I couldn't believe how fast and how hard these actually hit me don't get me wrong they're not gonna knock you on your ass it's not strong like that but it was strong to where I felt it immediately after like 30 minutes which for me is good because I mean for anybody is good why would you want to wait any longer for your high right but I feel like with me it'll both usually take up to like an hour something like that from what I noticed forty minutes to like an hour but never as fast as these and these were amazing they taste these I got these blue raspberry ones that actually taste like the little lollipops you get from you know your your doctor or your barber or whatever you know just have like a bow out of out there and the front by the desk and you just like take one at the bank you know those little lollipops little dum-dums it tastes just like that this blue raspberry but I have I'll show this right quick so if you wanna if you feel like you're reading through all through all this you can just pause it actually have I will read part of this they actually describe how they do the cannabis extraction for the edibles on here I says the cannabis extract is uh I can't even talk right now I'm so high about to eat another one by the way but anyways it says right here it's extracted using BHO i winterize with ethanol and then it's distilled leaving no residual solvents so they say they grow with passion and extract with position so it's just a magical experience and it really is I really do enjoy these and these taste so amazing and they look I mean they just looked like candy you know I had to open one because it is trouble with the wrapper I do have trouble with the wrapper I do have to use two hands and since I am recording this I need one hand so I just had to pre open it man these are these are amazing they and let me just show them the light here of the Sun my baby like and you can see the blue where these don't taste don't have an overwhelming taste of THC it tastes just it there's like small hints or whatever but it's not actual it isn't it doesn't over overwhelm and that's what that's what I really like about this and edible because I love weed but I do not love though we taste and it and most of the most like there's some dry like brownies out there that just tastes like straight up ass I'm not for that these are so much better so I would definitely recommend getting these blue raspberry good flavor just go ahead and start eating that but yeah my review are you afraid oh sorry I'm just trying to the flavor I can't describe it's just like a small hint of like marijuana but the rest is just blueberry just straight-up and they're pretty good so yeah I love these definitely gonna be picking up some more 2010 425 it's not a bad deal yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this video because I'm about to enjoy this candy Almighty really another one I check these guys out man magic kitchen they were in the Southeast Washington area I Northwest Washington area I don't know I said southeast give these guys to try magic kitchen they got pebbles I think they carry there's different types of flavors for sure they got like pineapple strawberry stuff like that but I think they also have line for there's a different it's not just candy they have other stuff so I definitely give them a check check out see what's up with them but yeah that's it for this video man I'm gonna go roller joint finish this edible and then get high some more alright guys see you guys later stay lifted lift it is for", "21JMBlc-5M0": "well hello this is Darnell I'm 19 coming at you from my kitchen oh yes I am mm-hmm how the [ __ ] he doing I'm doing well I went back to the drawing board and I'm gonna bring you guys some Jolly Ranchers hard candy and suckers I've done these three times now and they've come out perfect each time so first let me just apologize that I'm not doing the demonstration live with you I will do one though I promise so this is what you're gonna need you ready 1 and 1/2 cup sugar 3/4 cup Caro syrup 1/2 cup water citric acid your flavor and color and a gel paste food corn okay candy molds sticks a candy thermometer a knife or a vegetable cutter an 8 by 9 pan or an 8 by 8 panel all of these products can be purchased at Walmart or Target or anywhere like that with the exception of the citric acid you probably will have to get the citric acid online at Amazon I didn't find it in any grocery store around the food coloring gel that I used there's a Wilson brand and I didn't really care for it because the colors work that vibrant so I went with a generic brand that's called great value that I bought here for 2 bucks and I use the tiny bit of the red ok this flavoring they sell at Walmart there's two in a pack they're considered a dram you used one DRAM per Sippi so you will need one of these in the flavor that you like punched in paper and a saucepan and that is it my friend that is it okay so this is what you do I'm gonna pick a rib first like always tell ya this channel is for eighteen and older you know this right cannabis and cannabis enthusiast and if you are not going my friend get the [ __ ] off my channel would you subscribe up there comment down there hit that Bell if you want to know how I'm gonna go why I put up any videos like this you never know what a girl's gonna put up you just don't know give me a flavor hit that thumbs up on your way up oh it takes a second if you love this recipe I thought about going back old school I was raised on a farm and we homesteaded and I remember Carol syrup water and sugar and flavoring and you had candy so when I brought you the recipe for the gelatin I thought it was gonna be a little bit easier and I've had a couple people that are having some problems with their butter floating on the top and I bet it's probably because the temperature is off one or two degrees now a couple things I want to tell you fYI when you're making candy have everything ready to go prepared ready to go eyeing your pan with parchment paper have your thermometer out your molds out sticks out your knife and everything okay so now what you're going to do is we're gonna take a rib you're gonna put down in the comments what you're ripping on and now I'm going to tell you how to make it choose that just makes everything perfect alright grab a medium-sized saucepan take it and put it on the stove on a medium heat and you're going to add 3/4 cup of your Karo syrup and your 1/2 cup of water you're going to let that dissolve until your Caro syrup is completely dissolved then you're going to add your 1 and 1/2 cups of granulated sugar keep stirring it mixing it up once that's all dissolved stick your candy thermometer on the side of your pan make sure that the bottoms not touching your pan or you'll get it false reading have your parchment paper in your pan lined your mold ready to go and your knife ready to go sometimes when you score you want to keep a little cooking oil on hand so have that out as well and we're going to talk about that once you get your sugar and your corn syrup and all that's incorporating it's boiling really nicely you continue stirring that so your sugars don't burn until you reach about a 250 degrees when your candy thermometer at that point I stopped stirring and I just watched my boil I don't walk away from my candy and then tell my candy thermometer reads 310 and when it reaches 310 I'll remove it from the stove place it on my cookie sheet I'm going to add my 1/2 a teaspoon of citric acid my one dram of watermelon my gel red food coloring a slight amount because I did watermelon candies I infused my candies and also used two tablespoons of gorilla glue tincture and 6 grams of teeth by no means do you need to any of that in your candies and you can have that as an option if you are adding cannabis or tinctures to your candies please do that after you've removed it off the stove incorporate it when you incorporate your citric acid your flavoring and your gel mix it up really well Labe pour it in your pan and just set it on your cookie sheet okay at this point now you're just going to watch your solution it's going to begin to cool and as it cools you want to come by and grease your knife or your vegetable cover and you're just going to take your product that you pick off the stove and that's in your pan and if you look at my Instagram you'll see how I scored it now we're just going to imagine that this is our candy for a second if you will grease your knife or your vegetable cutter and just score right here in the center I worked Center out and then I turned it and worked Center out and just kept turning that now just a couple points if your candy won't score it's probably because it's too hot if your knife is sticking to it it's probably because you don't have enough oil on it so come back and try it again if you score it and it didn't work your candy will just wine itself back out again just periodically go back and do it depending on where you live and the altitude of where you live is how long it'll take and it's generally around 8 to 10 sometimes 12 minutes and you'll be able to score it then just set it take it out of your pan set it on your cookie sheet because you're scoring it let it sit on your counter for an hour and you can come back and you can break them into pieces now I made suckers and I made Jolly Rancher candies wat kaminin and puts him in a pretty jar for me and I did six seconds and these are what the candies look like they're perfect and then I made up a little package of ten and I usually do like though giveaways and gifts and things like that with some suckers and some granola bars or whatever these are very perfect size they're just like the Jolly Ranchers they're amazing hard hard hard this will make about I'd say 35 to 45 pieces of candy depending on how big you cut your candy pieces up so if you have any questions let me know once your candy is all cooled and you've broken it up and you want to make some suckers I made square ones Walmart also has round ones like this what you do is take some of your broken pieces of candy mine are stuck because I'm videoing take and stick them in the molds and what I do is I really shove them down in the malls to well sometimes the mold looks deformed I turn my oven on at 275 I place this on a cookie sheet and I leave it in the oven for 15 to 17 minutes until the candy becomes a gel again then I take it out and I place my six in it a couple minutes after that to make sure they don't fall over and you think you've got candy now because I make these in blueberry in fire watermelon and an apple I sometimes have a lot of variety pieces left over and I take them and break them up in a baggie and I stick them in the mold so that my suckers come out all different kinds apple cherry strawberry so that's what I did with these so those end up being like that posh posh if you will medicated candies that I make sucker southern they're amazing I do apologize that people had issues with that recipe I did go back to the drawing board and I thought shizzle man homesteading sugar corn syrup and water and play-doh you got candy so star go back to homestead you're not good you guys are going to love them these you can store up to a year in your freezer on your counter for a good month or longer if they last that long these tastes exactly like Jolly Ranchers this is a must citric acid and the reason is is because citric acid gives candy its pop gives it its flavor gives Jolly Ranchers they're their sharpness their sourness and if you don't use this you won't get that Jolly Rancher flavor so make sure you get your flavoring of yours whatever one you like watermelon out or whatever use a little bit of paste they have the typical colors for Jolly Ranchers and use your citric acid you can use as much as a teaspoon of this the more you use I've used it it's better just don't go over a teaspoon and your sticks check your thrift stores go over and then I don't know where they have all the paperwork and all the books and coloring books and things like that they always have craft step-over they're not even open yet you can find your sticks with my duties since they're pretty cheap these molds Walmart everything here you can get at Walmart I will leave a description at the recipe below under this video and the only thing that you'll need to purchase online is probably your citric acid because I couldn't find it in grocery store unless you have a candy store near you I hope you guys love the recipe again any questions please let me know yes someone asked me for a how to clean glass bomb so I'm gonna bring that to you as well I have not forgotten about that she's been really really busy with the holidays and everything coming up orders are coming in so if you guys want your holiday orders get him in because miss Deb does get busy I'd love to fulfill your orders I hope you're having an amazing night I love you guys so so much

a [ __ ] in the head and I'll go back to the drawing board and bring you another one click one letter one tree right you", "5OFj2UuZV8I": "what's up what's going on guys I'm horchata lizzy who don't

recreational 420 and today we're gonna check out gaga edibles the juicy now what these are this is a package of ten ten milligram servings so basically it's ten pieces of candy that tastes amazing I'm guessing and the each one is ten milligrams so you get 100 milligrams per package the package itself as you can see is incredibly professional it looks super super high-end it feels high-end if you went and got like chocolates for like your boyfriend girlfriend whatever they would not be upset if they got chocolates in something like this anyway at the front of the package it just says that juicy it explains like what's in here over here you have your ingredients there's your servings and all of that nutritional stuff I'm gonna go ahead and just pop these guys open and so these are individually wrapped and sealed there's two missing because somebody behind the camera got into these yesterday but yeah so if they're wrapped up like this and I'm gonna go ahead and just try to pop one open and so just like that ooh this smells like mixed berry starburst and it's yeah I'm super chewy because it's a feature but hmm clatter delicious it tastes like straight up you through a bunch

I was sitting there chewing through that last video I had two of these and the high it is awesome it kicks you right in the face puts you right to bed as far as like an edible if you're a beginner take to stay at to give it an hour and a half if you're more of a like normal everyday smoker then you can probably bump it up to three or four but I wouldn't really push it past that not because you're gonna go crazy or anything but just because at that point you're already going to enjoy the effects of it so I use up the whole package and one like shebang anyway yeah if you guys get a chance definitely go give these guys a try that was Gaga edibles that juicy this was recreational 4/20 and I hope you guys check them out and give them a shot", "yQlPMFGdOHw": "[Music] hello everyone well via weights the net one edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary today we are talking about carrot candies I know in the past I have warned you about taking the candy version of gummies instead of the confectionery version I myself have found them to be laughing but I have a lot of people asking me to review candies a lot so here we are with can of candies 240 milligrams of THC spread out over for candy so I assume that means 60 what's the math sixty THC per candy right that's correct yeah it's gotta be okay they've got four different flavors we've got great we've got watermelon we've got lemon we've got cherry they are hard candy so I'm gonna have to suck on these bad boys these are from SC labs I believe is the company that makes them and without further ado let's open them up and give them a taste so if this is your first time tuning in two weeks the way I reviews work guys is I'm going to take these candies because they are all individually wrapped oh here we are they are all individually wrapped four different little candies you can actually see maybe little bits of fruit I don't know something on the inside of those gummies four different gummies because I don't want to break my teeth I'm going to suck on one finish it off camera and finish the rest off camera and then I will be back in two hours to let you know how these things are feeling because that's the most important part of any edible review okay so let's see we've got four to choose from any meaning not a watermelon is up first so canna candies on the back actually has its nutrition information which I like to see 27 calories / gummy has the ingredients as well as you know the distribute the sort of standard don't take this while driving blah blah blah blah blah yadda yadda yadda I am going to have to gear up some scissors I should have had these with me already or maybe I can just do it with my teeth let's find out Oh God um so that's something good to know I don't just take these into a movie theater or something with you expecting this good opened cuz there is no easy way to do so almost got it here there we go in the mouth this is the watermelon flavor huh taste okay you can definitely taste some marijuana the we taste it um not overpowering you can also taste the watermelon it's like a less intense it's like a less intense Jolly Rancher with a little bit of weed taste to it that's about the best way I can describe it it's not good it's not terrible I'm not dreading having to eat all four of these not looking forward to it you know come seeking side so with that guys I'm gonna finish these here for guddi's not coming sorry hard candies I'll finish them and I'll come back to you guys in about two hours to let you know how they are feeling and with that guys I will thank you for watching whitson on we will see you into a horse piece two hours welcome back two weeks we are talking canna candies today and I guess a so I want it right them very highly but this is my favorite candy I've had so far in terms of like non convection airy non like baked good so like gummies hard candies straws all those kind of things sour straws these are my favorite I'm not incredibly baked I've certainly had more potent 240 myelogram edibles before but for a candy something that you know you pop in your mouth and suck on for a while I'm pretty high so I'm pleasantly surprised with the potency on these I still want to did still want to be my first choice I really in most or any context to go with the candies because they don't taste that good and they don't get you that high although this was pretty cheap I think this cost me $8 so it wasn't outrageously expensive so you know I liked it for for a non confectionary edible but again not going to be my first choice at the dispensary but if you're looking for a candy and if you see can of candies these are not a bad one to go with and with that guys that's going to do it for

home I've been going to at home and I've been so bored so I resulted to watching food videos and watching all those food videos made me really miss the food in China so since I can't me the real stuff I thought I could just make some tongue Hulu I had it in China it was pretty good they usually make it out of I think strawberries and Hawthorne berry oh it's like I'll insert a picture here they usually only have it in the wintertime because I guess it gets really hot in the summer and then the sugar would just oh I don't know but this is the first time I had it and it's pretty good so I'm gonna try and remake it okay so I watched a couple YouTube videos on how to make it and I feel like most people fail on their first and second attempt but I don't know what makes it so hard because all you have to do is wash the strawberries dry them skewer them and then dip them in sugar it's just like four steps but I don't know I guess the sugar part is what makes it hard okay so we're just gonna wash this probably just pull it off and then put the skewer in it so now I think we need to dry them I guess it's like the same concept with like chocolate-covered strawberries if it's not completely dry then the day won't stick but I don't know like I'll try it needs to be yeah that's pretty good it's fine I'm just gonna dry these and then yeah we'll see okay so I tried these and now we're gonna skew them I got these skewers from a kebab thing from Moscow I never skewered the kebab and I just kept these but I guess now they're coming in handy I think I can only do one per per stick yeah I'll just do stick usually there's like I think six per stick and it's just like usually it's just like a long stick of like six strawberries but my sticks are too short okay I just need to make sure that it doesn't like wiggle yes so did one fall into sugar I don't have a candy thermometer I can't eat thermometer that says you gotta measure the temperature of the K of the sugar okay so the recipe that I saw they didn't use any corn syrup which yes that's not good for you anyways right so yeah I think the ratio that they used was sugar water two to one yeah so I'm just gonna do two cups of sugar - 1 cup of water that's a bottom secret it's not even one for the rest of Ag into the cup and see how much there is love should I just do one cup of sugar - half cup water yeah oh yeah that's a lot of sugar okay yeah just do that Wow didn't even cover all the sugar I think it says you're not supposed to stir it you're not supposed to sorry just let it burn you don't want it to hurt they said that if you stir it it crystallizes well should you like even it out first say something it's not okay and then they said to like I think it was a medium heat okay feeling really confident about this so first wait like eight minutes so it's 111 right now and then test to see if it's ready dip like a stick into the sugar and then let it sit in cold water for a couple minutes like I mean yeah when you pull it back out if it's hard that it's ready if it's so gooey then you let it keep going for cold more minutes nice see you guys in eight minutes she watch the video game it wasn't very clear they just said leave it for eight minutes and it's been six six minutes already yeah but like this is happening really fast I've also oiled a baking tray with aluminum foil so that once this is dipped I'm just gonna set it on there because we don't have styrofoam it's just statistics it's not very authentic but I was prepared for this okay so I have a cup of ice water I'm gonna dip this in here the sugars like falling off the stick you guys ready which I just do it and we just did you get any are you supposed to turn it off first yeah okay I'm just gonna go for it that seems like a bad idea but you want to pour it's not like grabbing a lot of sugar maybe it'll look I don't know it looks pretty good he's got to let it dry you think so harden yeah you know if this doesn't work we can just make like this like a smoothie Adam strawberry hey guys check out okay but like I don't know why this water thing didn't work oh wait you guys I'm looking for the one I'm looking for the sugar I think it just melted into the water the ice quad yeah so like this is probably sweet no just water we actually this made this really misses here see it's like disappearing oh is it because like oh what do you realize you know that might be why I might not have boiled it you said eight minutes subjective to a while they said that if you have the sugar of dip it in the water if it's hard it's done if it's still gooey you need to boil it longer and obviously mine was still gooey how's it going it's not hardening wait let me you just boil the rest when I boil it again and then I'm gonna redo pit because the sugars not hardening okay solid plan cuz it's not like it's overdone it's underdone people do this they do not like bicycles too like they literally just right around their bicycles selling sticks of tongue Lulu maybe they may give up hope I feel freaking blow sugar in my own house and they're boiling sugar on the back of a bicycle oh it's getting harder okay yeah now all the sugars like holding its shape but it's still gooey it's turning brown I don't think you wanted wrong no I to do starting to smell funny in here it's not sticking I see it holing up like what the like how much time I have from when it's ready to when it's like overdone but you should be good now I was like another four minutes eight minutes so I don't think it's ready yet it's six tears not funny it's not hard though oh yeah so gooey I don't know what took this long you definitely undercooked the other ones oh it's stuck you see like the sugar on here so like that's the first time it's ever like stayed on the stick Wow but it's still not like hard like it's very malleable oh you know and it's supposed to be hard oh wait you know what the eight minutes might have been like the sugar had to be boiling oh yeah that's just in the pot for a minute yeah yeah it made sense the heart or is it still pretty soft it's still a little soft dang we're getting there ah much different than the other one oh my god well out of tune oh yeah I think it's ready okay let's redo this this is a log go air then the last time promising do you see that drip okay they've been sitting for like two minutes really pretty hard but oh they're all hard should I try one I do it was okay that one came off pretty easily look it smells like nothing wow it looks pretty good try okay so maybe tell you I'm going to leave it out put hey you should probably leave it out for long funny just let it dry a little more it looks good we just need to let it harden should I put it in the fridge yeah cuz like they make it outside in the winter oh that's true and you're leaving it next to a stove yes the strawberry is pretty good though that's good I was happy dude that was tragic okay so I put the strawberries in the fridge for a couple minutes I don't think it's like it any harder than it was like it sounds hard but like you know yeah it was like soft on the inside like it was just chewy like it wasn't hard sugars chili sugar well okay ready okay cheers Cheers not a good time what hit it's worked oh it's pretty good sure there's pretty chewy it was very hard to I feel like I got a like two pieces of Laffy Taffy in my mouth yeah thank you all it's pretty good though yeah it's just I think we needed to cook the sugar for longer yeah when that made it uh-huh but lesson learned oh my god I think we need to put in the freezer for a little bit okay so I want more because it's good to hold on to for like two days did you have an entire no I don't think so so like when you eat it it's supposed to like straight up crunch off mm-hmm yeah I know what you mean we should have done like two at a time [Music] yeah okay we're gonna put this back in the fridge and then come back into it okay so it's done ten minutes I don't work what I pressed it and it's very gooey right yeah no so wasted all these I'm so hard yeah boy it's trippy that's just wrong here we go I'm still very chewy mm-hmm a little bit harder like it's getting crunchy mm-hmm I don't think the fridge is gonna do anything else no mm-hmm do you not want to do it again cuz I know we can do it we don't have any yeah part was good I'm sure yeah I'm just throwing this figure out I feel like we like went bail boy didn't succeed I feel like we got to see so like a 75 it's really good it just involves a lot of teeth picking mm-hmm I think which I miss again when we get more strawberries and when we get more sugar do this is pretty good but definitely follow up definitely follow the like dip the stick in sugar and then dip it in the cold water trick because I feel like that's a very good indication of whether or not your sugar is ready we kind of knew this sugar was ready we just did it in new ways which is we always stupid but it's okay but yeah thank you guys for watching and I'll see you guys next week bye guys", "QVW6gIiMNF4": "okay hello there everyone so today we are going to be making candy covered strawberries in the color pink so first you're going to do two cups of sugar 1 3 cup of caro syrup 1 4 cup of water i have a few strawberries here we have our candy thermometer and we have our bright red white and pink bright white is going to help us get the color that we want in the pink instead of it being like a translucent pink it's going to be a bright pop pink and we also have our pop so i'll be back okay welcome back so i turned our stove on it's about a six or seven now what we're going to do is we're going to put our sugar in our carol syrup make sure we want to get all of that out and we're going to do our 1 4 cups of water all righty be back okay welcome back now we're gonna go ahead and stir our mixture until it looks all mixed and it tends to get hot fast so you want to get it all in there before it starts to dissolve okay now what we want to do is we want to bring this to a boil a rapid boil and here's our candy thermometer and we're going to get it up right to 300 which is hard crack i'm just going to put that in here and let it let's put it over there so you can see it and let it stay i'll be back once it gets to our rapid boil okay as you can see it's about almost to 250. uh once it gets to about 275 i'm going to go ahead and take the candy thermometer out and add our coloring then we'll get it to 300 once we get it to 300 we'll be able to dip it'll be it should be at our hard crack stage by then and if you don't happen to have a candy thermometer what you can do is um you can take a spoon and dip it inside of the mixture here and run it or put it in a cold cup of water if it becomes hard it's ready if it's still kind of loose kind of sticky kinda um it's not ready so you'll continue um with your boiling stage okay so we're about at the 375 or 275 stage there so i'm going to go ahead and remove this and add a little bright right and we're going to add a couple drops of pink and we're going to stir so we get that pink color as you can see okay now we're going to add our candy thermometer back to our candy and it should almost be getting up to where we left off going it's way back up should be almost to 300. okay i'll be back once it gets to 300. okay so we've got the 300 so i've turned our eye off and i'm gonna go ahead and remove our candy thermometer and this is extremely hot i mean extremely hot so i don't suggest you doing anything with this without either toothpicks or bamboo sticks inside of your strawberries okay so here's our first strawberry and we're going to do okay so we're gonna go ahead and dip our strawberry this liquid is very hot be extra careful please i do not suggest you uh doing it without either toothpicks or bamboo sticks here's our first strawberry i'll do one more for you strawberry liquid it's hot hot hot hot hot i can feel the heat on the tip of my finger so please be careful all right when i'll dip the rest and i'll be back and i'll show you the finished product thank you", "ZMXBCHPjRw8": "what's good

cannabis community in the marijuana industry choose you to stay lifted", "2QMXLRUbvkU": "[Music] welcome back to free Mike here we are making watermelon infused it well cannabis infused watermelon candies today hard candies so let's do this so I got everything ready here is one and a half cups of infused light corn syrup how you doing today Russell what are you guys smoking on anything good hey guys doing some watermelon infused candy today because I don't know how it happened but I got a phone call this morning saying that we are completely out of edibles at the dispensary which is crazy we should not be out of it this is a third different cup of infused butter so I use infused whipped butter and infused corn syrup and we infused this with a pretty even dose of indica and sativa this is three 1/2 cups of sugar plain water it has a little little watermelon flavoring in it hey guys I'm going to do is I'm just going to kind of stir this up so we can look in the pot so I have infused corn syrup and infused butter in here as well as sugar water I'm the only thing I have left to add is the flavoring so what I'm gonna do is mix this really good and start bringing it to a boil and infuse but tired yeah this this will give you a kind of a head high as well as a body high you will get the euphoria with these candies I use I use an actual indica and sativa so it is a broke up trim of actual sativa and indica it's not hybrids so these are 2 together a pure indica and eight peer sativa put together to give us a pretty even body head high pain medicine this should calm your body down from any of the anxiety shakes tremors things like that do it yeah you know I think we all have stronger moments at times I call the chemo fog because I think chemo did more to my memory than anything so now that I have all of this really good and mixed up I can actually put Meister away and just go ahead and let it boil so right now you can really smell the cannabis you can smell the sweetness you can smell that but you don't really smell the watermelon yet because in to the mix this is super concentrated watermelon concentrate that I will put it that I'll be putting in here so basically I'm gonna put this on the stove I have my candy thermometer in here I want this to reach about 320 degrees and I don't want it to reach that fast I want to do it kind of slow because as it's working its way up what'll end up happening is it'll boil the water off that I added into the mixture boiling that water off allows for the mixture to activate itself and in fully infuse without burning it and that's very important so we want to keep this a butter between 250 and 300 but I do want it to hit 300 once and then I'm gonna bring it back down hey Kevin how you doing today you smell you actually spelled my name the way Nikola Tesla spells his name so that's the male version of Nicola the female version of Nicola is a C instead of a cane so it's Nico LA instead of n I K so you actually spelled Nicola like Nikola Tesla so just so you know and if you ever really have a problem remembering you how does how to pronounce my name just think of Nikola Tesla because we do we both pronounce it the same way well he did pronounce it anyway when he was what sorry I believe in a big Tesla fan Nikola Tesla fan nut car I like cars that go fast so today when we're doing our candies everybody has asked me how I make my candies the smaller sizes because finding some of the candy molds are kind of difficult so for those of us that are using cannabis that we dab quite often I'm sure all of us have seen the little containers so these goes straight into the plastic containers it's just a little silicone thing then you have your little silicone containers like this I use these particular ones I take and I wash them all up really good and then I use them as my candy molds so it's easier all I have to do is line a cookie sheet with them and then I can put them in each one oh it's no problem Kevin don't worry about it I just find it interesting most people spell my name like Nikola Tesla because he's he's famous but it's no worries no worries at all pretty much from this point on you really don't need to stir to too much you're gonna let this roll into a boil and you're gonna also keep a very close eye on your thermometer so I have this set where I don't want it to go over three hundred and fourteen degrees right now it is at two hundred and fifty-five degrees as the steam goes up you'll see all the water evaporating out of here and that's when you'll see the temperatures start to rise which is really nice it gives you a good clean infusion without burning your cannabis all it smells great can we do eat it the smell will be really really good when I add the watermelon flavoring in on this now for those of you that are kind of watching this they're like okay most people have everything in and cook it and do it the way that they just do it all at one time the reason why I separate my flavoring away from the rest of my candy mixture when I'm cooking it it's because I don't want to burn the flavoring because you can the flavoring is very very easy to burn and to singe and it doesn't taste very good once you've done that so you have to be careful hi um english-only sorry I know a little bit of other languages but not enough to really do much so but one of the things that you'll start noticing with your candy mixture is you're letting it go ahead and boil you don't need to constantly stir but you'll see that the mixture inside the bubbles will start getting a very clear Brown clean look to it and that's when you're gonna start noticing that the water is pretty much going away the earth evaporating out like it's supposed to you're gonna start noticing that your temperature is gonna keep going up a little bit more quickly so you're gonna want to keep an eye on that but again you do want the mixture to hit 300 degrees once and by once it doesn't mean it needs to be in the 300 degrees for a long period of time a short period of time is fine so today I'm gonna do this a little differently I'm gonna use it if you different types of molds I'm gonna use my dad containers as a mold and show you how I do it with that I'm gonna make some bunny butts for Easter with the watermelon candies and then I'm gonna make some squares so that's basically what I do is I just get silicon containers it's easy I don't have to worry about anything I don't worry about melting my pot or melting anything into it it works it works good so as you can see I am nicely putting it in there you can see that the bubbles are it's a full boil very clear we are evaporating that water out of there we are sitting at about 241 degrees so at this point you can just let it sit here and let it cook off while you're doing that you can set up your molds and it cookie sheet especially if you're using your your dad containers it's easier if you set them all out on a cookie sheet first now I always recommended you it with the plastic or silicone containers and the reasoning for that is because it's harder to break if they don't melt with glass trying to get the candy out you will break the glass I've seen it done a million times so stick with more of a silicone type of a mold I just do this basically what happens is you can just take and pop the candy right out so it works really really well so I just pretty much get my mold ready to go and set them up on the counter because once this process gets going and setting look at taking those candy off the heat it's going to cool very quickly so I need to have my sandy area ready to go so as you can see I have my area set here I have these all set out I have a silicon tray here in case I want to make shatter shatter candy I'll lay them in here let it harden and then break it that's how you make shatter candy so that's how I have all of this set up I don't know if I'll use them all yet but at least they're there okay we're sitting at two hundred and fifty-two degrees so we want to hit this to at least three hundreds one time so I need to just keep letting it go I don't need to stir it beyond this point until it put my flavor in with this I used I'm using super concentrated watermelon flavoring all of the recipes will be up on the website too so that we you can refer back to the website anytime you need to look at it with this I do most of my candy says a is a heavier infusion slowly I can eat them throughout the day and use them as pain medication so I use both and infused corn syrup and infuse butter in my candies so I'm looking at about 70 milligrams per piece of candy to make it safe so it's it's a decent milligram there you can eat one you can eat two even meet three depending on how bad the pain is or how uncomfortable you are they're gonna be amazing cuz wait till I send you some because I'm definitely sending near some or we'll get you over here we need to get you over here and so we do a video with you sweetie yeah guys let her know there are Miranda Lynn you tell her she needs to get over here and we gotta cook cuz get your butt over here we got some infusions to do because I got new pot art I got a new book new stuffs to play with check this one out haha we're gonna be doing some serious brownie infusions yep so I'm just gonna keep the boil boil boil so you'll see it the color becomes richer and darker and clearer it's not a hazy coloring here at all so I'm just gonna let that go ahead and you really don't need to stir it at this point I'm trying to make sure that I get as much of it off of the sides of the pan as possible because I didn't use my little wet sweat my wet flap to clean off the side so I'm trying to make sure I don't have any crystallization so that's the only reason why I'm stirring is to keep my candy from crystallizing but here you can see how pretty it is see the color in there so these won't be a real red they'll be kind of a brownish red color but they will tasty yummy okay so we are up to 264 degrees as you will notice the less as the steam starts evaporating is we have less and less steam you're gonna notice that my temperature gauge is going to go up significantly quicker and that's a good thing because it's letting me know that I've got most the water out of my candy and that I will be moving to the next step here soon I just want to get all of that back in there so I am not even going to think about putting my watermelon flavoring into this until I've hit the 300 degrees possibly 320 and that's when I'm gonna put my water on flavoring in here because then I'm just gonna let it cook a little while longer and take it off the heat it'll be ready to be put into it it's mulch so we are up to 270 so as you see the whit as the water keeps evaporating out the temperature the Blessed water the quicker that temperature is gonna rise so once you hit about 250 degrees and you start noticing that it's going to rise you're gonna state this pot don't walk away from it because I've watched people walk away from these pots at this point and within three minutes they've burnt it because it's gone well over 320 degrees we do not want this to ever reach over 320 degrees if that happens you will have burned your cannabis in here and it has it will have a burnt taste to it it is not yummy so be careful here we are less than a minute later and we're at we're at 282 degrees so you'll see 284 degrees now so it does jump pretty significantly quick once we get to this point yeah I believe they ran out of edibles shame shame shame I mean I'm glad there's enough I'm glad people like the animals but tell me before we run out so you'll see how it stays rich and dark right now you get you really get more of the sweets cannabis buttery scent to it so it has a very sweet smell you can definitely smell a smell the butter and and the cannabis in there kind of a fruity flavor kinda or scent to it oh I wish you could bottle the scent and send it off to you guys what we're also going to be doing the root beer of candies again - we have just reached our mark that's why that a beeper went off on us so now it's time to get this in there ready oh yeah lovely so this is oh wow you can smell the watermelon Wow Wow oh my god guys you can smell this watermelon something fierce oh and it is red look at this love love love love now I have this off the heat at this point I can add it back to the heat oh wow Oh YUM so young a little warm but really good so I'm gonna throw this back on the heat for just a couple of minutes that you take a look at what it looks like in there now I want the fire off simply because I just want to keep this warm enough okay so now I'm just wanting to kind of take a Scooby and I'm just gonna let it drip into the little molds and yes it does make a mess and then really all I'm doing is just filling them up one of the fun things about doing it this way however is that I make a whole bunch of little drips on to the pan and then I'm going to use those little drips as as decorators decoration on other stuff so these ones are all filled [Music] we can redo it sweetie you can also take these and put them in a bottle to make it a little bit easier I'm trying to do this quickly so because they can be little hardened in the pot sorry I'll look up here in a second so here's this tricky now we're going to move to a beat next ready oh my god they smell so good this is the first time I've used the strawberry or the watermelon recipe on this my bunny boots so I'll probably give a few bunny bucks away for Easter this year just because bunny butts are fun so those are the bunny butts well I have good flavor to it too it has a really good watermelon cannabis flavor to it so not only can you taste the watermelon but you can taste the cannabis Oh yummy yummy yummy oh I don't probably spin any sweetie you don't waste cannabis no no actually all of the hairs and stuff that you see that I pull off I will be using those in another type of candy so all of this leftover stuff fits in here I will still be using see all the little strings I love making candy I just love cooking I don't eat but I like to cook go figure however I'll tell you what as far as eating and stuff when it with my eating disorder hard candy really helps me for some reason it doesn't bother me to use hard candy I don't feel like it's doing an evening I don't feel like it's hurting me but I still use hard candy all the time I've known several people with eating disorders that can't because their eating disorder doesn't allow them to and by that is really simple they just it's a it's a mind over matter thing that it will actually make them throw up when they need something like that so it kind of sucks so hard candies like this help a lot so if you'll see when you make stuff like this what I can do is since it's still pliable and movable I can actually take this and turn it into like a flower like a rosebud and kind of and I'll show you it later but what you do is you take your candy you get it warm make like a little rosebud put a hole in here and then you can smoke through it and still get the flavor of your candy oh my god that's good Wow oh yeah I'm using this recipe again oh that's really good flavor too so that's just as easy as it is then you just pick all of this up so would you see that's all of the fun stuff that I'll play with with my candy and that'll be for what I'm doing my Easter candies and stuff I'll take some of these to decorate the Easter eggs and things like that for when we give it mmm so yummy so it's really that simple to do these candies um they're done I'm just gonna put in the refrigerator let them cool off then I'll pop them out and show you guys what they look like so thanks guys I will be back later have a great day [Music]", "4MD06UCMUd8": "hey guys what's up this is recreational 420 and I know I'm really close but there's a reason for it I'm gonna do an edible review and this stuff is the fat Panda or hot sugar Panda candy green apple powered by you fuse and every other brand that they like to throw in there so this is what it looks like this is just a one single serving ten milligram candy kind of like a it's supposed to be a soft chew so I'm gonna go ahead and open it like I said single piece I didn't you know just a single package I didn't get like they're ten pack that they have but there we go I'm gonna go ahead and open it up this is what it looks like once you open it just a weird little looks like a little turd kind of so look at me getting all smart using scissors now so that's what it looks like it feels exactly like if you if you've ever been a child airheads that's exactly what this feels like it's got that same consistency whoo it's got that same smell like I said this is green apples so I'm just gonna shove this whole thing in my mouth and enjoy it oh my god so as far as the flavor goes you guys are gonna hear me too it's fun all right so the flavor is actually really good I have it on the top of my room I like my mouth right now I've gone so the flavor is amazing I'm gonna have the other one right here in a second this was just a 10 milligram candy and yeah I'm gonna see how this reacts and I'll be back with you guys in a couple days to let your w tomorrow and I'll let you know exactly how this one hey guys what's up so I went ahead and tried those watermelon candies as you guys know that obviously I ate it in the video so about an hour and a half to two hours later completely spaced the fact that I'd had an edible hadn't smoked yet and was sitting on the couch and I look over to my girlfriend I was like babe why do I feel so hot she looked at me and just started laughing and she was like oh yeah the watermelon candy you duh so yeah this thing even for just having had the 110 milligram candy it was enough to like send me into that edible hi I felt it I got tired I got a little bit of like the haziness and this was all by 5 o'clock so if if you're new to edibles this would be a great one because it's gonna give you like just enough of that like effect that you're gonna feel it and get you know the base knowledge of how it in edibles going to like a react in your body so all around I would and if you're more of like I guess a more seasoned user you can take 2 to 3 and have a great night either way these are awesome so with that I think that's it this has been recreational 4/20 if you guys have any questions or anything leave it down in the comment section if you like these videos go ahead and hit that sub button trying to get to a hundred before the end of this month and I'll be back again with you guys soon [Music]", "o91SbVTCbRk": "[Music] what's up channel 420 la shirt girl queen candidates coming back to you here on YouTube for another medical Monday now the number one call medical Monday's is to review newer youtubers so the newer youtuber for today is the linked a show all right you guys that's where you can find him on YouTube the late taste show if you want to follow my instagram follow the famous boys hey hey we're for ease not one not two not three but four okay so we're gonna start off with the ten milligrams ask the bottle suggests 60 to 90 minutes amount you're gonna drink the whole entire bottle will come back with a full review and a reaction video to the leave I wanted to make sure that I was completely sober when I did this and honestly I feel a little buzzed like it's shut up okay so now I have the lit taste show pulled up I didn't change my shirt you know who say I'm gonna wardrobe malfunction there let taste show I'm going to be doing reaction video so here's 6 9 Nicki Minaj murder beats Fifi reaction and the reason I chose these videos because Fifi is one of my favorite songs out right now I do want to give you guys a review over the lemonade before we get started it's real quick three things first never go wrong with choosing TC with me when that lemonade sets in it's like the best drink ever I've never known a drink - just give me the munchies make me feel like I smoked without even having to smoke so to THC lemonade very organic just because THC itself is organic it's a very not a healthy lemonade cuz there's no such thing as healthy lemonade no matter what but it's on the more healthier side if you were to choose a little hc' we made is great number three my favorite thing is that you get to effect without having to worry about the smell of marijuana you know having to worry about if you have enough product or not it's a drink it's simple it's on the go you can take it with you to work and take you into school you're not throwing any suggestions out there I'm just saying it's a very convenient way to get okay you can drink it you don't have to light it up you don't have to roll it up you have to do anything but just pop the top and drink it so that's what I have to say about the taste lemonade let's get to this reaction he's funny [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so many times if they hear one thing from a song that's like new Minaj's or jzb [Music] [Music] no really thing that was any of this video okay so first and foremost I just want to say love the end screen I love the subscribe to my shade I left a picture of the body like everything is just so real about him this channel again the lates a show gonna follow him he has some pretty good reactions up here I like the fact that he's like I said slow the track down sped it up you know mmm switched up a little bit because again YouTube has a way he's taking people's videos down but right now he's at 244 subscribers so I definitely feel like his channel should get like 100 times more than that he has a lot of great views on here so definitely that should tell you that we want more videos from you the little taste show guys go

left gnc years ago i had no idea i'd be coming back to talk about them producing good products in their private labels they have not always had the greatest products their weibolic for the longest time was known as that protein that you were going to get pushed no matter what when you went into the gnc super proud today to be talking about beyond raw's lit their beyond raw line again may have not launched with the greatest of formulas but these days is actually touting some pretty good formulas they did their pump a few months back uh their rtd of the lit actually is tied for first with ghost energy for our top rtd's of 2020 and uh today we're gonna be talking about beyond raw's lit in the powder version uh specifically their flavor collab with jolly rancher now i i don't know if you guys are tired of losing me talking about flavor collabs i'm sure probably about 20 of you just nodded your heads yeah but you know i know ghost has done a really great job of pioneering this bringing it to the industry and showing the industry what can be done to legitimize this industry and i realize that most of my viewers especially on youtube maybe not instagram if some more mainstream people there uh are way more interested in like hardcore stuff but i can't state enough how much these flavor collabs help our industry out they help us legitimize our industry for mainstream consumers when mainstream consumers come to us when they say uh jolly rancher that's like wow that's a huge brand it's actually pretty cool i want to try this out this flavor i want to try it so today i'm going to talk about the formula and at the end i'm going to finish it off with a flavor of you this is completely sealed i have not tried this flavor out i'm going to put it in some cold water and try it out before we get to that you guys know i have to sit down and talk about the formula now uh we don't have a business affiliate relationship with gnc uh we were supposed to be their media group for their uh global convention this year but obviously with chronovice that didn't work out uh we are you know doing some kind of content stuff with them but i actually went and picked this up myself and wanted to do my own video on it so there's two blends in here the energy and mental intensity blend as well as the pump and no support blend now this product let's be real this is an in-house private label brand for gnc this product is meant to bring consumers to a better ingredient panel than before obviously it is improved but this is also a product that's going to have to have a higher margin for gnc they are cutting out the middleman and producing themselves but this product is going to be both aiming to be a good product and have a good margin for them they're going to want to make more money on this obviously so there's some good stuff in here there's some some stuff i would like to make better i'm gonna be honest about that but they're it is pretty net positive here and i i'm hoping at the end this flavor is pretty good carnitine beta alanine first ingredient in energy and mental intensity now i wouldn't really say that carnosyn beta alanine is really part of energy or mental intensity i guess you could say energy in terms of uh endurance energy long energy but they've got 3.2 grams of carnosine here now i'm not tied to needing carnosine i think that generic beta alanine is just fine but i hear at 3.2 grams they have uh the study dose or one of the study doses we're happy with 3.2 grams and we can move forward without talking about too much about it obviously beta alanine's gonna help add extra sets and reps onto your workouts over time it's something you need to take and actually be saturated with which happens around 179 grams in a short amount of time you have to feed yourself 3.2 grams every day for a while to keep that up over time it's going to help you out it is one of the more studied and proven ingredients in the industry so i'm happy that they put it in here it's pretty self-explanatory now here's one that i'm not all that on board with 1.5 grams of micronized creatine as creatine monohydrate now creatine monohydrate is my preferred version of creatine what 1.5 grams is not even close to the clinical dosage here now i understand why people when brands use 3 3.5 for because depending on your body weight you might not even need a full 5 grams now also with the rest of the package if you have a whole stack you're supposed to be taking i understand breaking up creatine because it doesn't need to be taken at any specific time it doesn't need to be all in one dose and well they want you to buy the whole stack honestly but here it's 1.5 grams i'm not aware of any rest of the stack that has another 3.5 grams to make it a full 5 grams but you know whatever if you're taking this product just make sure you're taking extra creatine it's a little unfortunate because crazy monitor is extremely cheap but you know gnc is gonna make their choices moving forward caffeine anhydrous 250 milligrams this is pretty middle of the road for caffeine i prefer to have a blend of short and long-term acting caffeine but at 250 milligrams it really wouldn't be that much of a difference caffeine anhydrous at 250 you're gonna feel nice um it's not overly stimulant for too many people if you're a very small female this might affect you a little bit hard uh this will mostly have to do with your caffeine tolerance so if you are a crazy uh starbucks shopper you may not have a problem with this but 250 is not all that much it's going to help wake you up but it's roughly a little bit less than a whole can of bang i love atp from ancient peat and apple extract 150 milligrams i'm a big fan of atp any stuff that that helps with energy and strength and power output is important for me i like it i think that more people should be focusing on that over just plain pump and energy this is a really great ingredient for performance athletes uh but even if you are a physique athlete your training is going to be what dictates your physique so heavier training harder training more intense training is going to translate into your body composition you need to be aware of that elevatp is a great ingredient for that purpose studies on lftp basically show that increases atp within the muscle now atp and sustaining high levels of atp is very important for high levels of training another study showed that it could increase one rep maxes of squats and deadlifts now that may be important to someone like me as a power lifter but as someone like a bodybuilder or a gym rat or crossfit or whatever that's going to translate not just in your one rep max if yours one rat max goes up you're also your rep weights are going to go up the only way to create hypertrophy is through progressive overload over time giving your body a larger stimulus now whether that's more sets more reps more weight up to you but this is going to help you increase that over time which is going to be important for hypertrophy and strength so great ingredient super happy to see them putting it in here they follow that up with a personal favorite of mine neuro factor neurofactor is an amazing ingredient that i feel more than most nootropic ingredients out there at 100 milligrams this is the clinical study dose so i'm happy to see gnc using this gnc is actually the first company i remember seeing this in their lit rtd the can i remember seeing it long time ago and being very impressed they were using something that was new um gnc's regulatory department their um research and development department i like them in some ways i don't like them in others um i was not a fan of how long it took them to include dynamine in their regulatory of allowed stuff but i do think that they do the extra step to make sure that everything is safe for their consumers i won't get too far into it because well i don't know if you guys all really care to listen to it that long but neurofactor increases this thing called bndf which is mostly concentrated in the brain it's very helpful for focus um and brain health but it also works synergistically with caffeine so you're going to have a great amount of energy for this workout using them together now the pump and no2 support ingredients here are going to be three grams of citrulline and 1.5 grams of nitrogen i'm both happy and conflicted here because i love nitrogen at 1.5 grams i get a great pump i love citrulline as well but i like to see a minimum of four grams of citrulline now there was a study at the university of arkansas last year that compared eight grams of citrulline malate which was six grams of citrulline versus 1.5 grams of nitrogen and they found that the two of them actually yielded the same amount of pump and when i was at supply side west sitting with nutrition 21 who by the way we do have a business affiliate relationship and i want to make sure that we do have a little bit of bias here i know you guys love to bring this up uh i am friends with the issues 31 i frequently go to dinner with their president joe is an amazing guy i love the stuff they make their whole team is passionate about improving this industry they are very good people and i like the products they make but their ingredients are backed by studies clinical data and human data and it's important to me and when they were presenting this data to me i was i said to them well that's great i like that these two ingredients are now in a level playing field but what happens when you take them together do we need to take these at these dosages because i think that a lot of times in these ingredients you could use a little bit less of both and yield a maybe better result at least the same result so i would have liked to see in situated four grams here that's the clinical dosage we don't have any other data to suggest that it being with neutron's gene allows you to use any less now theoretically we probably could theorize that using less citrulline would be okay alongside something like uh netraza gene which is a stabilized arginine which produces more uh nitric oxide in the body because of the way that it gets arginine to the body now citrulline also creates arginine in the body which then creates nitric oxide so we can theorize that using them together may have a synergistic effect we can use less of them but we don't know that for sure that's why i'm a little bit disappointed here with the pump product because i'd like to see one more gram of situation just one but that that is really only due to the technicality of what the studies show if there were studies out there showing citrulline and trusting together i'd be able to say well maybe this is actually synergistic or maybe maybe the data shows it is but we don't have that data we don't have a lot of companies studying ingredients together instead of you know against each other i think that a lot of the time a lot of these products we're theorizing what happens when all these ingredients get put together we don't know a lot so in any case i'm super happy that gnc went with a full dose of neutralization instead of going full of citrulline lowering the trouser gene uh but hey we're never gonna know until we start studying and trying it out um i have taken citrulline nitrogen together before and personally i do think it has a bit more of a synergistic effect so i'm not sitting here and saying that it's okay from the underdog citrulline next to the nitrogen but i can definitely say i would understand why they would again like i said in the beginning this is going to be a product that is going to deliver on results but also it's going to be a little bit of a better price point for gnc it is their private label right if you want a more expensive product a more built out product they always have uh third-party vendors for that gnc sell some great brands they now sell axe and sledge uh ghost is one of their main partners i think nutribio is still there caged muscle is there so you have a lot of options and you could actually stack a lot of the stuff with this product here uh it's one of the benefits of going to a store instead of buying straight from a brand so i've got about eight fluid ounces of cold water in this shaker cup next to me i'm gonna take a nice nice scoop of this and i'm gonna let you know what smells like jolly ranchers i'm gonna let you know if it tastes like them it's a nice deep thunk but i know that like a good percentage of you guys really only care what it tastes like so i'm joking all right cheers it'll taste just like a watermelon jolly rancher i got no complaints about flavor tastes literally just like a jolly rancher the messed up thing is i don't have a workout too after this i literally am gonna drink this and edit this video cracked out well gnc congratulations it tastes like a jolly rancher i'll let you know how how my pump is in a little bit but big fan of the energy blend here neurofactor is going to help me focus for this editing session i guess my really only complaint would be that you used a uh sleeve instead of a sticker well [Music] i'm a fan of the formula i think that it has some things that i would personally change but hey i'm just ben kane at price well i'm not gnc the you know billion dollar company they obviously know what they're doing obviously this product is gonna work for for people um some little things that i might change but maybe they know things that we don't that's absolutely fine uh there's this is why we have so many different products out there there's people that want different things and want to feel different things if you have any questions about it go over to pricewall.com gnc we also have the plum product there and pretty soon sustained protein blend girl scouts coconut caramel um we do that one sometime soon but seriously uh product is great for what you know gnc is producing i would never have thought that we'd be talking about a product this great back in the day when i left gnc um you know they've really grown over the years and i'm super proud to see them doing that in this industry as the juggernaut of the industry that they are um including brands like nutrition 21 including stuff like elevatp neuro factor i think is a huge step for the industry alongside that flav uh flavor collab in any case i really appreciate you watching if you may just point the video wow leave a comment below i want to thank you for watching this long and if you have any questions about the product just comment below as well i love talking about it in any case really thanks for watching me ramble for this long i really appreciate it and have a great day [Music] welcome to price plow [Music] my [Music]", "d0ab5GPZD7M": "yeah keep going up cardstock you guys got a business card now you guys know that yeah how do you guys have a digital one good summer lesson yeah who's the bandit it looks like the outline of mom although I can't see her that well because she's hidden she's an outlaw yeah her choose one in 17 states what would you do mom yeah I can't tell you it had something to do with tie-dye but I can't tell you what it was Oh counterfeit tonight yeah oh you did such a good guest couldn't tell me and that I got it pretty quick in one somebody Facebook messaged me that there's a video where max adds the flavor it was cherry the champion cherry & epified video and flavouring form performs a perfect part well no it's a little lopsided but if it wasn't perfect I posted perfect but it was a heart issue so should me where it was like to get screenshot I don't know I'll put that on the facebook at some point yeah they're a regular old Walter White well that's not so good [Music] a sketch like that's a good grandparent flavor like that I don't have a bowl of water spout their house my grandparents kept their butter whether Scotch they kept that out of tune is locked up but it's hard as a brick part of butter right just trust me on that yeah I feel like there's people in this world that love cranberry sauce cakes cranberry sauce love coconut I hit coconut like a fan on the sleep or don't like a family sake and then there's your heart butter people versus yourself but who like start over very soon in the comments who is on team hard butter and enlighten us Oh your mom likes it too no no I'm just saying she probably was if you never talked about it yeah okay so our family is very into talking about our feelings dad you do watch her head I was very quiet for but we didn't put any hot water in the table for this correct oh yeah I felt the table this field decides with a little bit warmer than the other side but I guess it's because that's where the I just didn't know if you did it for Hardy I mean I know we do for tie-dyed for a couple just not I'll put it on the table so you just put it in leave it in there for a couple of batches that stays warm yeah it doesn't hurt enough money too quickly the other lie because this is a butterscotch so I'm not gonna add any citric acid sour butterscotch there's a flavor that nobody wants and you guys are still trying to get the citric acid amount still messing around with that we're gonna add more today because if it lemony should be kind of safflower then once we nail that I wouldn't be opposed to it you're trying a strawberry lemon-aid mmm I'm just gonna have teeny tiny bit which is gonna be tough for me to add a teeny tiny bit next does drop mmm next those drops was trying to say he said it so easy I thought it was a sick thicker you know what I thought it was - I haven't worked with a brown a heck of a lot oh I know I saying I wouldn't be opposed to I thought maybe strawberry lemon-aid you just did that would be okay I'm talking to somebody maybe talking to me just like everything to go okay that's right that was the point I think we're talking about how we would do that but we would do half a batch would have to do strawberry half of you lemonade insurance they're trying to blend them together and just because one might cover the others or mix using other where's that the Kings are side by side that might work I'll come back to that I just want to make sure people didn't miss the corns are being put in because this is so exciting isn't it yeah Wow one more problem good to pick tomorrow to work that way right hand where our sketch is an extra flavor yeah those where we get the food and friendly right and it's not further that off route but it is friendly as opposed to being punched in the face or something wait clove is a popular one we had a Christmas time there's quite a few people that want us to separate clothes really yeah I know it's hard never we make spiced candy other than maybe like cinnamon and anise and the clove wow yeah or even like the cinnamon I I don't much care for it but if some people doesn't love it you know quite what we were actually make cinnamon candy cane yeah cuz I like brown cinnamon and cinnamon stick things but the Senate oil doesn't do a lot for me tell me this I have to make an emergency run to the nature time I'm almost out of organic oat bran hope that piano my guy about as good as quinoa and kale broccoli on a line of filled healthy ribbon cables bag yeah someone said that I can't take over the business because I would

a lot of times but I'd rather go yeah No just why we Steve over there Zuber something that's a big college sharpened you know we use the old like so sparingly now that I don't you don't put too much effort into it yeah I guess before we show you this wall material do you know use death actually why this made heart being the place our King oh this this one that were using for fruit and friendly before we started using it recently do you know when the last time was used they've got fifties or something I don't ever remember seeing that when I was a kid they never used that was just put away and you're a kid back in like the 1880s 70 1876 was just a little kid of the sixties running around the daily shop and I never saw pretty good 400 light in the kerosene Heights seven these I never saw it it was always wrapped all wrapped up and put into the shed I knew it was there I come I guess they've got a get kiddin cut it didn't make a good impression out of you know I just held on to everything because I was hoping to have this happen this is what I was hopefully for some days he said peace of mind so once is equipment huh didn't you sell one piece of equipment well I got rid of a couple it was like a year before we started to really wear it knows that I was in that beauty I'd like to tell what he ever had you know it was called the friend machine it was about this high on the table Table nine had a crank on he put cream in it and would push out the cream in us a shake like play-doh remember play-doh when you're a kid you push it in and then the shapes come out as the on that concept for making creams to face and I ended up throwing it away this man well you kept all the other pieces like there's a lot said yeah I kept as much as we could yeah she said behind her own me Jesus yeah she doesn't help us he do you guys know if there's much of a difference between citric acid and malic acid I think that metallic acid is awesome often used for sour candy - yeah where's battlecast have come from like citric acid you're like an Alan Canada Street right like dark Darth Malak a how is that who it is secret lemonade you're good man oh you know what I should have checked how many shots lemonade would you call me is that good for you this takes you the next time or citric acids yes we're bumping it up by 50% listen all right 100% I've got a fever yeah all right am I crazy or does this smell just like fruit loops it does smell like fruit loops but it like it like I could it smells sweet you don't mean like that you don't with pieces on my tongue whoa oh that's good it doesn't like the fruit loops I wonder if I would have gotten that if you didn't say it where our viewers at home last Intellivision it's good can you smell it I can really smell it if I get like almost over it but back here I can't let smell you know now I can source power it's good boy yeah terminate always makes me think that they will be kid at the corner of our house eating selling lemonade I'm walking up to him he's got a little pitcher he's got a little table he's only like five years old betting closest sticks his arm right in a big pitcher and stirs it up ha ha ha ok I just gave him 50 cents and walked away yeah would you like some lemonade to water your plants with I didn't really want any lemonade after that hmm not that you know kids wear what are they put their havens I remember too late he didn't do that for me when I got lemonade from him but he did he did stick his hand in to get the ice and then he stuck it in the glass sitting there like you could have dropped it in well I guess you can also put the hand in the lemonade to put the ice you don't want to drop that ice that is expensive [Laughter] I feel like a 5 year olds hand I would probably want even less in my food than an adult because you have no idea where fibrils hands have been dots it's usually more predictable the problem is that you watch your head I'll watch your head if you watch

your shoes thank you - what you're throwing mine no no those are just so like all in its power but all it's starchy and I can choose and there's fall apart the bottoms come with it yeah look at that they're all [Music] high school I had some old listen fella and so I'd like every stroke one greater self this I'm part of the European stick for a while and I just had more grippy shoes I would probably not had that injury all right it sounds crazy but like the best grip shoes that I've ever had were like super cheap Skechers boots like for real I wore them like in a kitchen during wintertime yeah and they were the best I could walk out mop floors like no worries I think the best answered one by hand before they were to choose for us they're like these croc type shoes but I really like no slim pretty great they're actually really comfortable he's very ugly like clogs when I worked at Panera they told us again no slips ooh yeah yeah it's like it goes with like some thought you taking too long pull it out don't get enough of it quick long strokes and you can get out of there soon well that is what we're even for I [Applause] [Music] just like watching you sweat Steve me I've never sweat in my life as we see now they do the longer your own that's neat tell me is that that's beautiful rope that's how you tell my beautiful this here's a smoky tree over teacher you know when you get things between your teeth Christmas trees no hero [Music] so max correct we're just talking about off-camera oh you're right yeah [Music] my opinion I think so as well yeah you guys are both saying it and last time we were all like do you guys agree that like when you think lemons you're thinking like your face puckers up but no it's super tangy and I don't know if it's just me but like sometimes it doesn't even have to be something sour but like when I eat something after a while it just like really gets me in the jaw muscles yeah yeah like yeah I mean lemony target right yeah definitely it's like lemon juice and sugar yeah so yes I fit every time the girl will just have to bump it up although I think we should pump it up we put we put 50% more in this one yeah I mean say we put in too much one bag you could even just call it like very sour lemonade that because people been asking for sour candies I think we could do like quite half a pub next time yeah but this time when they brought a quarter cup I won't have to okay yeah if I can convert teaspoons into cups that would probably help the 3 TSP 4 tablespoons and 4 tablespoons 2 1/4 cup the beach 2014 is going to convert yeah it is it's just kind of like the imperial system or whatever the Imperial I think that's all it is right the non metric system okay I guess I would say it's like Imperial it's like quarters you know threes and then borders and then it's it's it looks alright well there's no help being a foot and there's a feet in a yard and there's 5,280 feet a mile like what go on instead of like it's all making sense so far 1000 meters in a kilometer I just gotta think about it I'm super done I don't know if I should say this part on camera but we're just talking about there's no plans for us or anything but just like throwing the idea around of having like super sour candy if super spicy candy in and I may be calling it like that twelve trials of Hercules or really something it's like so sour it's like oh I don't know if I can finish yeah yeah I got a mystical challenge to finish it like warheads for foundry challenge when we were kids you know like yeah we got to tell you just talking about this and make my teeth definitely sour apple would be good yeah you said a challenge man I could be like joked chocolate yeah I'll give it give it some aegyo huh or you could just buy chocolate liqueur I think it's just someone every time that we use that stuff I try to get people eat it maybe I'll not eat it it tastes bad I like it yeah I want to get a video of you eating it and a spitting it out gun this is good all right could I stand what happened last time we had it out I tried to get here to eat half a piece and she ordered I ate a whole piece damn except in Islamic summer candy potentially spice it handy to be different types of brittle I can't wait that coconut brittle you guys it's great sometimes experimental season after Easter we got like two more months yeah the day after Easter all right we gotta do something experiment at home the numbering [Music] yeah can't sell it we could try samples I thought about making a hard candy hole a few times yeah we're going for it exactly on the floor very pour it into our baking pan if you just do a small batch [Music] nicely put you know some some muscle and amber yeah that'd be cool because you know I've been thinking about sour candy since I started people at home want to do it you can just do it and use a baking pin and then let it harden and then just take a little hammer to it and break it up I got it you made your own more you know all three guys in there's one more piece left over here uh-huh it's festive no way he's gotta be here with a heat up the candy panel corabeth there we go a lot faster we've been there Oh so they were all done with this and then they turn it on it's like why he they would get done it what - and he said yeah they'd be finished the hours and of course waste to me it's like I want to go home yeah yeah like making this stuff but yeah whenever we go to work felons that's why we do it you know what it's gonna sound weird but I think they taste like chocolate cheez-its what mm-hmm it does sound weird yep I just they have like a weird out like bacon cheddar quality to them almost is there any there's no animal products in there that's the 100% cocoa this anime content may contain their so chocolate liqueur presses up okay all right I'll try it on yep I'll see what I'll see it I swear it's like yeah can you be a camera person yeah it's very chocolatey at the end but I think it tastes like it's almost like baked cheddar or something in the beginning I haven't had this isn't bitter wedding 2013 the last time I had just pure luck or and I was like oh if I go to like it a neck roll like chocolate to your shop I'll always try there there hundred percent alright I'm just gonna stop sniffing for now be brave just get it over with Greg go suck on it I like to chew them up but if you chew it up it's gonna taste more like it taste so I assume you mean cheddar right which isn't as bad as I this isn't as bad as I remember maybe it's that one that you guys they're for the more better good the other one was strong okay this one's really not that bad it was like I remember yeah I had before like your hands I could spit I was so bitter this is this is a little milder it's definitely better a little strong I'm not a huge fan of it I kind of minds of like very chocolate baby hot cocoa that hasn't been sweetened ah yeah mm-hmm well that's what it is right yeah yeah so you get chocolate core just add some sugar I like it you know it's not bad I wouldn't seek it out but yeah goodbye let's see go regular chocolate either yeah I'm gonna try making that my in hot chocolate one of these days what's that I think it's just I think it's just that like cocoa liquor and hot water or something they didn't do sugar than the Mayans they just just use the beans and then they they may be diluted it with water possibly I don't know out of it I don't know coming read any Mike Mike Mayan that works lately yeah I'll let you get back to work alright we're hardly working [Music]", "1Z7Xb-rUgwM": "[Music] hi welcome back to token tv my name is mckenna i'm naomi and we're here today to show you some of the different edible products that we carry and some of the different ways that you can consume them um ma'am you want to get started on some of your favorite products yeah um so one of my favorite products is these wild gummies here i absolutely love them they're honestly one of the best tasting gummies i've ever had i took one and instantly i started feeling like very relaxed and i wasn't at first i wasn't um i wasn't aware that they were that fast acting but they are and i love them and they taste good um so we have a lot of different great products i would say that one of the top employee picks would be the peanut butter cups right here these ones are really really just as far as taste goes this is going to be one of the best tasting products on the market i would say it's incredible it doesn't taste anything like wheat at all and they definitely do still get you high so don't be fooled by how good they taste and get carried away eating them that's super easy to do it's really understandable because it does taste just like candy but you definitely want to be careful dosing these obviously it is strong and this is actually a new packaging for these ones it's a double dose so you always want to make sure you're checking how many milligrams are in each piece of the product that you're going to be consuming something that's really cool about all the different edibles we have is that there's many different ratios of cbd to thc that you can find them in so if you're looking for just pure cbd edibles we have those if you're looking for just pure thc those are going to be the most common and of course we have those as well we also are going to have many ratios in between those so for example the ones that naomi was just talking about the wild strawberry over here this flavor right here is going to be a 20 to 1 cbd rich inedible which means that for every 20 parts of cbd there's one part thc in it all the specific milligrams can be shown on the packaging as well it's going to vary from product to product this is going to be a particularly high one in cbd sometimes they're going to be one to one so it's equal parts sometimes it's going to be thc rich with just a little bit of cbd added it's going to depend all entirely on the brand and then the specific products within that brand for example we have another one right here the mindy's these are going to be really popular uh for kind of people who are just starting with edibles people who are micro dosing trying to get kind of that more specific dose so that you're not over committing with a big piece like maybe the peanut butter cups are a little bit more heavy duty um these ones are going to be partly cbd as well so again they are going to be very good for a beginner doser just to kind of get in the hang of finding what dose how many milligrams works for you it is going to be different for everyone so whereas i may need a higher dose or a lower dose naomi may take the exact same edible and need something much different from what i took so it's always going to vary a little bit just depending on your system and everything that goes into the different edibles is there any other products you want to touch on me yeah um me personally i love beverages um i personally like the beverages for my days off these beverages are no joke when it comes to full body all day high like when you are on your day off and you're taking a drink you prepare to be like um in a daydream so with this it's really simple and easy this brand particularly their cap it's kind of like a little shot glass so when you are dosing yourself it's easy to kind of just like micro dose yourself take a little sip um these kick in pretty quick it will keep you in a haze all day so um part of the reason why the drinks do hit you so much harder is because they do actually absorb into your system a little bit differently than actually chewing on an edible and swallowing it that way when you're chewing on an edible and you're swallowing food like that it's going through your liver and it takes a little bit longer to absorb it may not hit you quite as strong with something like this the drinks anything that's going to be liquid in your in your mouth as it goes down it actually goes through the soft tissue lining of your mouth which does actually kind of give you that quick activation and it does give you heavier effects for the most part again this is going to vary person-to-person but that's in general what the drinks will do um similar effects to that is going to be anything sublingual so tinctures is something we'll talk about in future videos another item that we have that will be sublingual in the edible category will be the strips right here we have a variety of sublingual edibles as well those are going to be taken under the tongue that's what sublingual means for the most part and it's going to be kind of similar to the drinks and that they are more fast acting because they are going right into the soft tissue lending of your mouth rather than going through your whole system and taking a little bit longer to process and absorb that way yeah from there there's many different ways that you can eat you know so if you like cookies we have cookies again we have the peanut butter cups these are incredible we have everything from taffy to chocolate covered almonds chocolate bars of course the strips the drinks we've got a bunch of different gummies we even have tea if you want to get a little fancy with it we have a bunch of different products so no matter what you're looking for or how you want to feel we most likely have an edible that's going to suit your needs there's definitely something here for everyone um we have so much product some that's not even shown on here i would say with edibles more than anything um it is kind of just you got to forge your own path so to speak you kind of have to really try a bunch of different products see what works for you and see what dosage works for you from there another thing that's good to take note of is that every product you see here is going to have some kind of guidance on how to dose it so that's always a good starting point if you um unsure on how to start your dosage every single package here is going to have some kind of information on what dose is going to be right to start with so always make sure you check that out but again it's never one size fits all it's always a little bit different everyone's a little bit different like naomi was saying your weight affects it your mood affects it what you've had to eat that day affects it you're going to eat a whole bag of edibles on an empty stomach it's going to hit you very fast and very hard whereas if you were to eat it at the end of the day when you have a very full stomach and it's kind of like more post you know everything's happening in your day that is gonna tend to take longer to set on and it might not be quite as strong as a high so there is just so many factors that go into edibles specifically always just be cautious when you start dosing and i would just say yeah just kind of start eating see what feels right and just make sure you always take caution don't want to get too high i've all been there hey guys so today we learned about edibles with mckenna and naomi for more information about these products click on the links down below and for more videos go ahead and

molten hot sugar lollipop sticks also tempered candy molds for the diamond door Jolly Rancher shaped candies you'll also need sweet bags to put through their beautiful lollipops and once you are completed you also need flavoring each bottle is one dram you'll want to use one to two jams of flavoring for the recipes that I am using food coloring and some high-grade eh-oh to make it real tasty you will be putting all that into the pot you need a candy thermometer it goes up to 350 degrees for hard crack stage in the pot you'll want to put two cups of sugar one cup of corn syrup and one cup of water slowly bring it to a boil and then let it cook until it reaches the 350 degree hard crack stage then you will have to instantly pour in your cherry flavoring your food coloring and your pho and you will have about one minute to pour your candy into all these molds before it hardens so you will need to be quick and probably need help as the popsicle lollipop stitch will move around a little bit I'll update this next video after the candy is made", "WXcNYfgVmxE": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause]

it is infused sugar and you can put it on anything like cereal just living your key I prefer to get my fruit in it like strawberries this is the sweetest deal ever - ten pack so you get ten little individual packets of sugar and it's $20 and for munching Monday you get 15% off of that so 100 milligrams of infused sugar and you can even make it into a recipe for the first time I ever got to try the Ruby sugar it's probably how I like this the most dipping my strawberries into it this sugar is kind of like more of a poverty sugar consistency so I did make some regular like granulated sugar with it you really don't get a lot of a THC taste but it just makes for a nice little sweetener on your fruit gave me a nice little buzz going to a while I was just slicing my name is Taylor and I work at the Bali store and I'd like to see you guys again on Monday don't forget about the sugar [Music]", "pNYALkJ2Xzo": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] do [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] you", "dHMl4kgId44": "[Music] hi guys and welcome back today we're going to be doing strawberry shortcake berries we're going to be making them with pre-made yum crumbs i will put a link below and a coupon code for you guys we're also going to be dipping them in almond bar we're also going to be using a ziploc bags a spatula some scissors and some toothpicks so i've already washed these berries i washed my berries in water with a little bit of vinegar in the water i just let them sit for about five to ten minutes and then i rinse them off completely with water then i pat them dry so now i'm inserting two toothpicks into each berry you guys if you watch my previous strawberry video you'll know i like to stick two toothpicks in to my berries because sometimes when i just stick one berry it's see i'm sorry one toothpick it sometimes slides off so i like to stick to and it's a very sturdy handle for me to dip the berries [Music] so i'm going to be using a plastic measuring cup for me to melt the almond bark in and guys i've just recently discovered almond bark and it is amazing it melts down so easily and so smooth i don't have to add any extra oils or paramount crystals or anything to it i've done it both in a double boiler method and in the microwave and this i'm just going to pop into the microwave for about 15 seconds take it out and stir it and then i'm going to put it in for another 10 seconds and it is perfect it comes out nice and creamy and smooth and like i said i didn't have to add any additional oil to it and it gives you a nice thick coating and no it's not made from almond or any nuts it's only called almond bark because it was originally used to cover almonds but it gives you a nice thick coat of chocolate and it has a very good flavor so i've like to use almond bark lately so we're going to dip half of these berries into the almond bark and then we're going to cover them with the yum crumbs like i said these are the pre-made strawberry shortcake crumbs i'm going to link below where you can get some and i also have a coupon code for you guys so check the description box [Music] so we're going to dip half of the berries into the almond bark and while the berry is actually wet we're going to use a spoon to cover in the yum crumbs so they'll stick and then the other half of the berries we're actually going to just dip them white and we're going to do a white drizzle so as you can see i'm dipping this one getting a nice even coat around the berry and then i'm going to go into my bowl of the crumbs and i'm going to get those crumbs on there quickly before the almond bark actually gets a chance to dry [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] hmm [Music] [Music] [Music] as you can see almond bark gives you a nice smooth coat and it hardens nice and easy and smooth it's just really easy to work with it's my favorite new go-to [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] look how nice and smooth those all turned out so now we're going to use the remaining chocolate we're going to put it into a ziploc bag and we're going to cut a tiny hole into that bag and then we're going to use that bag to actually do the white drizzle on top of all of the berries like i said it gives you a perfect consistency for dipping the berry but also for doing the drizzle as well this is like why i like working with it and you don't have to add any oil to it that is definitely a plus [Music] [Music] [Music] and this is how they turned out guys don't they look amazing and look how bright white that white is and how smooth it is it almost gives you like the coating of almost like like a m m or something that's what it reminds me of but thank you guys so much for watching don't forget to like

look juice back here that's all you want you don't want a super talk I can tell these are old people of candy because I feel like this flavor don't exist no more right you just like I thought we were

put out in the little crystal dish yeah brittle in the dish that's weird this is like it's not even a shareable candy how do you share that I got peanut butter for Christmas that's how easy you share I take it all back let me try the other kinds of doctor [Applause] give you baby would not athletic when it comes to food he ain't dropping it though do some further research they're not good but they are synonymous with poopy they taste like war stories at your grandma's did I ever tell you about 73 trans grandma I used to give him these tell them about all the colored people [Laughter] in church

how to make candied strawberries it's super easy the outside sugar coat is super crunchy and it combines well with the flavor of the strawberry it's a delicious fun treat they can show off to your friends we picked up some strawberries from the supermarket today but they're pretty sour so we decided to make a dessert out of them to balance the flavor first we're gonna rinse the strawberries in clean water try them out on a paper towel next we're gonna make the syrup in a saucepan at medium heat add two cups of sugar we're gonna need a lot of sugar here because if we only make a small amount the syrup will cool down very quickly and become solid the ingredients are very simple just sugar and water the ideal ratio to use is one part water to two parts sugar if there's more water you will need to cook longer if there's less water the sugar will be easier to burn before the mixture boils we can use a spoon to stir and help dissolve the sugar the goal is to evaporate all the water and leave only sugar behind that's the syrup we're looking for so even though the ingredients are simple the whole process and technique is preventing the sugar from crystallizing or else you end up with rock candy in your pan let me show you my crystallized serve first to explain you can see here around the edge of the pan the crystallized sugar there's a lot of crystals inside the syrup and it's pretty much useless let's think back the rock candy example if we put anything in the syrup it can be a nucleation point for the growth of crystals and we don't want that we don't want crystals to prevent that from happening the easiest way is just not to stir if we stir the end dissolve sugar might stick to the utensils and it will give the chance for the crystal to grow both on the surface of the utensil and also inside the saturated sugar water once we coated around the strawberry it looks like this and it's bad you don't want this in this video we're gonna show you how to tell if the syrup is done without having a candy thermometer but if you have one that will be the best make sure to put the thermometer in before the mixture has begun boiling to prevent any agitation in the syrup later to prevent crystallizing one of the most important points is to stops once the mixture is boiling not only then once the mixture begins to boil there's a liquid splash on the side of the pot it is also a chance for the crystals to grow so we're gonna use a brush dip it in some water and brush the sugar off the edge of the pot don't give the sugar any chance to crystallize don't let it grow or you can use a lid to cover the pan so when the steam rises up it collects in the lid and then it washes down the side of the pan but make sure to come back and check it the sugar is very easy at burn I actually burned my sugar the other day when I put the lid on and forgot about it that's how it looks when it's burnt it's very bad I prefer to use a brush because without the lid on it's a faster process we're using medium heat the entire time so the temperature won't increase too quickly and burn so be patient let it cook for a few more minutes you can see the syrup start to become an amber color if you use a candy thermometer we're looking for hard crack which is about 300 degrees if you don't have the candy thermometer here's how you do it use a spoon or a fork dip it into the syrup and then drop it into a bowl with cold water a small bead of candy will form you're gonna pick those candy up and eat it if it crunches then the syrup is ready but if it sticks to your teeth it's not ready once the syrup is ready we can start to coat the strawberries use toothpicks to hold the strawberries and dip them into the syrup spin them around to coat them evenly and then place them onto parchment paper to cool down once they have finished cooling down take out the toothpicks and you'll be left with these lovely candy strawberries they're very crunchy on the outside and soft and delicious on the inside I've made a simple stand from the egg cartridge so you put the stick through it and it holds the strawberry for you if you have foam blocks they are also good for this purpose and now I'm gonna show you a second way to coat the strawberries which is my favorite use a spoon and take some syrup and spin the strawberry at the bottom the sugar string will covered strawberry and they will stay there when they cool down you can also slightly fix its form while it's still warm and kind of design it how you want it to look it's very pretty in this whole process as the temperature cools down you'll feel the syrup become not very liquidy and starting to harden move the pot back to the stove and start heating the syrup a little bit so it can become liquid again before we finish this episode I want to show you how we clean the pan after heating a few times then during the coating the strawberry our syrup has become caramel and this cold caramel is super hard and it's like bullet proof I actually turn it into a drink my solution is to add milk into the pot and then turn to medium-high heat and simmer with the caramel once it heats up the caramel monster becomes soft now you can adjust the milk quantity based on how sweet you want this when it's about to boil turn off the heat and add a teabag in it upon simmer for about three minutes and then we'll have some caramel milk tea and most importantly the pot is easier to clean now voila that's the candied strawberry recipe very delicate and super delicious every strawberry is a work of art it's a nice touch to wow your friends or have fun with your kids or just for fun thanks for watching I hope you enjoyed this episode please like them subscribe and click the bell button if you want to see

tick tock that's right tick tock diy or die over at tick-tock and i've been making waves baby my latest video which i posted yesterday has 52 000 views check this out there's literally a whole pack of cigarettes in just the little puff bar it's actually kind of a false equivalency but let's just entertain this idea um you're actually it's actually a good thing because you're getting this level of nicotine which is not the bad part of cigarettes or vapor products the bad part is with cigarettes you get all that combustion all that burning all those carcinogens that come from burning tobacco the tar that comes with it that's what's bad and with vapor products you don't get any of that and with high nicotine vapor products you're actually using them a lot less than a lower nicotine product so you're inhaling less pg less vg less flavorings which are not even really shown to be that detrimental but those are the more harmful aspects of vapor products so there you go all right and uh i'm i'm combating all the misinformation that's going on on tic tac i've had enough of all of the misinformation that's going on around about vaping specifically on tick tock so i took it upon myself to start correcting all these [ __ ] so head over to tiktok give me a follow and also let me know if there are any like vaping tick tock videos that you think are stupid or egregious let me know i will respond back and i'm just taking down anyone who's you know who's just lying about vaping these days that's my goal here um and honestly i didn't expect for this to really start like making you know views and stuff but it seems like uh it seems like it is so you know it looks like the people want to know more about vaping and the truth around vaping and i'm going to give it to them so diy or die over on tiktok and of course my instagram uh diy or die over on instagram i'm gonna start posting the same sort of stuff up here um you know they do have like a tick tock competitor on instagram so the same goes for instagrammer right all right everyone thank you all happy acs happy saint patty's day is that true is it saint patty's day is that actually true god damn leprechauns and four-leaf clue what is saint patty's day you know i never really understood what it was nor what it aims to accomplish hold on let's google this what is saint patrick's day so it is st patrick's day it's not saint patty's day uh st patrick uh st patrick's day or the feast of the saints or the feast of st patrick is a culture and religious celebration held on march 17th okay um interesting what's going on here so how did we get to this how did we get to this being about st pat like isn't it weird how we take these holidays or like these traditions and we just [ __ ] destroy them like what does it have to do with saint patrick's you know the leprechaun hats and the green and the [ __ ] beer drinking and i i don't know i know nothing about irish culture or st patrick's or catholic culture for that matter i know nothing about anything um okay well go drink some shamrock shakes go eat some green eggs and ham i don't know what you guys do on st patrick's day other than drink i know that a lot of people like drinking on st patrick's day stay off the road that's for sure don't be driving around on st paddy's day okay all right so we have three recipes here on the docket today first one by npa homemade banana milkshake utilizing flavor art fresh cream flavor art milk creamy vanilla by mullenberry and soft banana by mullenberry simple easy easy to understand i'm excited to try it npa has this is his second time his or her i don't know if it's a he or she second time on the show um so we're gonna check it out looks like it's doing good morn sea is here with cherry sprite using interwear cherries cherry extract fizzy sherbet capellas lemon lime polar blast and ws23 and then a new victim pro b420 with dolce de cheesecake cheesecake graham cross doji de leche graham cracker new york cheesecake and some sweetener i'm excited these are all very sort of simple easy to understand recipes they all look pretty decent i don't see anything wrong with them uh just from a glance so uh a nice easy understandable show here and um i'm gonna give out as many helpful tips and tricks as i can okay i'm gonna do my best on that matter all right cool dudes now i got in something i ordered my nicotine fridge okay so i'm going to show you guys what i ordered i didn't get this in yet i'm it should be here any any minute uh wine fridge i guess no no no wine no this is the one here so i ordered this okay i put an order in for this it should be here in the next uh few hours maybe the schmeck 12 bottle compressor wine cooler refrigerator with lock large freestanding wine cellar 41 degrees to 64 degrees fahrenheit digital temperature control wine fridge for red white champagne or sparkling wine now you might be like why would wayne buy a wine fridge wouldn't you rather buy a freezer not necessarily not necessarily kind of but not necessarily so the reason i went with this instead of like a freezer or a chest for one this is just nicer looking right you can lock it up you don't have to worry about anyone getting in there if they don't have the key to it you could do that with a chest of course but this is like a nice freestanding one but it's just cheap it's 200 bucks it ships to you in a couple days and it's got temperature stability i i will let you know how stable the temperature actually is with this you know i'm not exactly sure that that will be found out but if this is one of the selling points that's why so when we look at what carolina extract says over on their nicotine website okay when we go to their faq which is uh i don't know where how to find it let's see here let me see if i can find it carolina f extract q freezer maybe google that faq okay here it is all right so when we go to carolina extracts faq on their website they state here okay should i store nicotine products in the freezer and then it says if you know that your freezer will maintain temperature below 30 degrees fahrenheit or negative 1 degrees celsius then yes otherwise no damage can occur to 100 milligram per milliliter nicotine products when oxidized when oxides form during near freeze thaw cycles caused by a temperature caused by temperature fluctuations of some freezer units but not all such fluctuations are typically caused by opening the freezer door and outside weather affecting the efficiency of the unit typical refrigeration temperatures or even room temperatures are a much safer storage range because they are well away from freeze thaw potential so this is really where you kind of want to pay attention is with that freeze thaw i guess area because that can introduce oxides when that happens now if you can maintain most freezers should be able to maintain a freezing temperature but if you don't know that for certain then it's a good idea to maybe find a chest or a wine fridge that can do that where it can just maintain a temperature so that's what i'm planning on doing um i planned on i planned on this product here this is exactly what i what i want to do so i ordered a bunch more nicotine so i can fill this thing up and i also ordered here some little uh i believe these are two ounces i ordered a couple two ounces that i'm going to fill up and they're also going to go in there and i got in the art spray so now we're going to be able to once i get my my new nicotine batch because my other nicotine it it's crazy this feels like it's empty it feels like they sold me an empty bottle but um it comes with a nice little cork let's see if the cork fits on these i don't think they will huh nah uh polycone lids but once the other batch of nicotine comes to me i'm gonna break them down into these bottles okay so i'm gonna get the nicotine i'm gonna fill this up and then i'm gonna screw it down chuck that in the fridge and i'm not touching it ever until i need to touch it do you understand so each of these filled with 100 milligrams per milliliter i'm stuck baby i'm good to go are you good to go that's the question right are you good to go me and my family and all my friends who vape don't ever have to worry about nicotine ever again okay so that's kind of the point that i wanted to to get no i shouldn't have crushed this because i kind of want to store this uh we don't have to worry about it right this is the this is where you might want to position yourself so you just don't have to worry about it can you get in the future can you not get in the future can you get it shipped can you get it black market can can companies from china send it over and call it massage oils nothing like that is known right now it's just a wait and see game so if you have the funds it doesn't hurt to be prepared if you don't have the funds i i i feel bad for you honestly i feel bad for you it sucks but welcome to america where the politicians decide on things without any input from you know the constituents okay so once i get the fridge in we'll do a little video on like nice proper storage so would i love it if this could be a sub you know refrigerator or temperature refrigerator sure i would but um this was 200 bucks and it was shipped and i rather kind of do it this way it's the the cheapest easiest way to show all of you guys how i'm doing it just so we can maintain you know the cheapest way possible and just know that it will work okay so that's what's going on here um and you can see all here here are the other specs which you know it all of this stuff rewind goes for nicotine as well temperature stability it's uv resistant so any sort of light that shines on it you don't have to worry about it it's going to go through the you know the stained glass the uv light is not going to go through the stained glass nor is it gonna go through the stained glass and then through the amber bottle so you don't have to worry about that uh it's got like a nice look to it you can lock it up so no kids can get into there if you have children um and yeah and honestly the best sort of way maybe i'll do this in the future is put some sort of like battery system so this would instead of plugging straight into the wall would plug into like a battery generator and then have that generator plugged into the wall just in case if power goes out it doesn't sort of affect the temperature it just keeps it running you know what i mean um that's a little bit paranoid thinking but it is the best way to do it and if you are spending like a thousand dollars on nicotine maybe it is a good idea to go that route you know it's really up to you on uh how crazy you want to take it so there we go there we go that's my uh my uh vape apocalypse um what is it called uh what are those people prepping system that's my prep there's my my bunker my nicotine bunker if you will um and yeah i'll be making videos about all of this once it all gets here should be here today i got everything else i just need that stuff i need that stuff all right what's going on everyone you guys have any questions comments anything you want to ask before we start getting into some mixing here um chasing classes don't want to be a bummer but can my dad get some prayers we just found out he has a lymphoma cancer oh man uh sad to hear man sad to hear prayers shout out to some prayers to chasing clouds hopefully your dad can overcome it i know nothing about that does it have anything to do with your lymph nodes is that why it's called lymphoma i don't know sorry to hear man stay strong you should do a video on storing your nicotine with that gas stuff yeah we will be for sure i have a huge bottle of 100 stored under argon from years ago yeah we're definitely gonna do that and i'll let you know if one bottle is enough to fill i don't know how many 120s or or two ounces two ounces 120 right i bought a few liters of nick so hopefully it will get me by for a while yeah a few liters is is a lot a few liters is a lot you know um you know it kind of sucks for uh for those who aren't in the know right if you aren't watching this channel if you aren't you know in vaping it's hard to know about all of this stuff it really sucks how are you like how how are you going to get by are you going to go back to smoking seems like that's what the government wants you to do i did not get the vso apple and that's why you're not on today sorry buddy i had my weightless arg good deal had my weightless argon cannon bottles arrived last week now a little over two liters of nick to store wait have you got your one shots figured out for shipping well as far as i can tell they should ship just fine they should just ship just fine uh we'll see what's going on with liquid barn but the ones over at flavor jungle there's we have no issues with them it's not a nicotine product it's not a vaping product it's a flavor product from a flavoring company you know what i'm saying should ship just fine now with liquid barn things might get a little interesting we're going to see kind of where they're taking it are they going to continue being a nicotine company are they going to become a flavoring company are they going to separate the departments you know is liquibar nick a different department from liquid barn flavor we'll see uh we've talked about it a little bit but there are no concrete answers it's kind of a wait-and-see game for all of the nicotine companies nicotine river included stuff like that we kind of just need to see where the where the chips lay um but in terms of just the just the flavorings over at flavor jungle they're they're not vapor products and they're not vaping pro they're not vaping products and they're not nicotine products they're not tobacco products so don't have to worry about that now if the government says like i told you guys if the government says you can't ship flavorings anymore then where i'm out of here i'm not a us citizen anymore and i and i hope it really comes across as like i'm not kidding about that if the government tells you you can't buy flavorings or ship flavorings you now live in a communist country and i don't care what anyone says about that it's it that's out of the question so if we get to that point you'll know because i won't be here anymore we'll be streaming out of some i don't know shed in the uk or something but we're not there just yet technically we kind of are but we're not there just yet hello wayne i'm a canadian communist thanks for that bc has zero issues with nicotine and flavorings there's flavor bands hitting canada federally this year this bc has issues with zero nick and flavorings there's flavor bands hitting canada federally this year um do you mean like you can't they won't allow you to ship flavorings at all is that what you're trying to say i've been canada been bugging fusion flavors to bug you they carry your stuff but barely um yeah tell them to contact me for sure for sure they can pick up some stuff canada is on its way there uh health canada soon will be releasing a canada gazette to propose a federal flavor ban we now have credible information indicating that we may see the release of the gazette part one as early as may uh in my country politicians are surely waiting for what else to do in the u.s politicians are so useless that they don't even think for themselves but you know the third world country what country are you talking about bobby told me they were going to be just flavors when you say you're talking about liquid barn are you talking about liquid barn two ounces is six milliliters right so four ounces those are four ounce bottles thank you for that four ounces is 120 correct um canada's on its way there especially notice grocery restrictions here are [ __ ] so when you say like you can't ship flavorings like that's my question just flavorings from a flairing company not a vaping company that's my question if that happens i mean let me let me put it this way if the u.s says you can't ship flavorings or any anywhere that i live says you can't ship flavorings i'm not doing this whole thing anymore i'm i'm becoming an advocate or an activist against the government because there's no point in living in a country where they're restricting your access to flavor for no reason and i hope that makes sense like i hope the severity of that makes sense like it's not a joke imagine if the government for no reason for there's no benefit to it they're just doing it because they don't actually know the industry imagine the industry said you can't ship certain colors anymore you can't buy certain colors of paint because a kid might use them to draw a red swastika so you can't buy certain colors of paint everyone would go [ __ ] insane and you would be like this is crazy we're living in a crazy country right now living in a dictatorship you could do that for sounds right you can't make music with certain sounds you can't ship certain instruments because they make certain sounds because a kid might use it to make a sound of i don't know sex noises or whatever they would deem is bad right you'd be like what the [ __ ] is going that's this that's the same level of what's going on with flavorings if they do that with flavorings it's a bad we're in a bad we're no longer having fun vaping we are now revolting against the government a tyrannical government you know i like i might even consider like suing like i would might even consider suing taking it trying to take it to like the supreme [ __ ] chord on that it's [ __ ] outrageous it's outrageous maybe i don't know maybe no one else thinks of it that way maybe i'm the only one that thinks of it that way i see when i bring this up to people when we talk about flavor bands they kind of go oh yeah i guess that is kind of crazy like they don't think of like wait a second they're restricting access to to flavor let alone just vaping it just the the just the access to it alone you know we sell flavorings at our shop to mix with unflavored base marketed as water concentrates boss was saying they might change to a diy soap supply shop to get around the vape tax on the vgpg nick yeah okay well we'll see if that works uh now i understand not saying i agree with it but i understand a company saying if you ship this vape product with nicotine along with this flavoring product then of course you know can't do that you can't just you can't do that but in terms of like look this is a multi-purpose flavoring it's just a flavoring you can't ship it bad news bad [ __ ] news because there's no precedence for that there's no precedence for that they're limiting your access to a specific sense that's 1984 bad we're we're not having fun anymore this is not a joke anymore we're we're now living in a dictatorship if your country already does that they get the [ __ ] i mean you gotta do something because i don't know what to tell you i don't know what to tell you you're living in a you lit you're living in a prison you're not living in a country you're not living in a state you're living somewhere like a prison i feel the same way unjust laws need to be challenged on an individual level yeah that would be that would be where i would draw the line and say okay it's time to it's time to really fight for your rights you know what i mean now how to go about that i don't know i don't know the logistics of that i would happily figure out a way though i would dedicate my entire life to it or i would just move i mean that's the easiest thing i would just move to a different country that didn't have a dictatorship essentially but i have the means to do that not everyone has the means to do that you might just be screwed you just can't know what strawberry flavor tastes like um okay the supreme court won't do its job i have a lot of faith in the supreme court to be honest it's not a perfect system for sure but i do have faith in its uh i'm not that i'm not i'm not that i'm not uh i have more worry about like lower courts and how lower courts would rule on something like that than the supreme court sort of ruling on supreme court usually gets things pretty right maybe after some time but for the most part i have more faith in that than anything else in the justice system come to the uk wayne you know every day that goes by i think more and more about that for sure every day that goes by all right just order 2 liters cnt and watermelon hell yeah baby cesaro round of applause four boxes of samoas and some other ones are my brother all i care about are the most samoans right isn't that how you say sumo wins all right you need to live in a state where a governor tells the feds to stuff it yeah true that is true i don't have faith in governors though i mean pa is not too bad but we'll see you know when the when [ __ ] starts to hit the fan we'll see if they really care you say no samoas yeah but is it aren't multiple samoas samoans i don't know what i'm talking about florida should i come to florida it's too hot i lived in florida for a year i did enjoy my time in florida do you remember when that guy ate that dude's face on the uh highway uh that guy ate he was on basalt and ate that dude's face i lived right there that's where i lived in lantana florida right next to palm beach i did enjoy it florida was pretty cool but i don't know if i could live live live there it's a little wild all right well let's start mixing while we keep talking about florida and eating faces all right let's do the banan let's do the dolce de leche cheesecake first here it's from a new victim pro b420 okay looks good to me i don't see anything wrong with what i'm seeing here saying a 14 day steep okay not off to a good start we're not off to a good start but hey man i am uh i am alone on in my thoughts about steeping it doesn't seem like anyone else agrees what's going on with this all right sorry about that all right is that probie no we get the wrong bottle here i went and i labeled bottles for you guys today all right so we can see what we're doing alrighty then here we go here we go got governor cuomo here he's trustworthy oh yeah very nice i wish you all the best in your endeavors yeah it's a shame kind of how new new york is a beautiful state if you guys have never been to new york it's got great hiking it's got great like seasonal weather like if you like the seasons um you know upstate new york gets pretty cold but overall it's like a it's a great state that's just completely destroyed i hate to break it to you but like the constituents you know a lot of the people that live in new york just vote against their ins their their interests maybe it's new york city that does it um but for the most part it's like you know the governor's there the law is there it's such a nanny state it's a shame really you know pa is kind of a lot like new york except just a little i would say like a little bit more southern in its law making and it's uh you know it's a little bit redder of a state which is kind of what you want you want a more balanced approach to your legislatures and your laws in your state you know you don't want to you don't want you don't want either too far right or too far left it's policies you kind of want to smack in the middle there seems to be this anti-centrist movement going on also which i don't understand so he's using tfa sweetener i'm just gonna go a half a percent of super sweet normally i would do exactly the type of sweetener you tell me but here i just don't feel like digging it out i don't really use tfa sweeter i don't recommend tfa sweetener uh where's my base where did i put my piece what the [ __ ] yeah this cnt stuff has been uh sitting room temperature opened uh almost i mean pretty much daily i open and close this bottle you know multiple times a day and it's still spot on and i've had that for a few months now maybe maybe a year now maybe over a year it's still good like this stuff lasts pretty good if you just make sure you're closing it you're storing it away from any sort of light or heat don't have to worry too much about temperature i believe states need to have an electoral college most big cities rule the rest of the state yeah for sure for sure you know at least here in pa you know the laws that philadelphia imposes don't necessarily attract with the rest of the laws the state imposes you know you do have some sort of municipality separation but i don't know how that goes for other states and other cities like you can see like at least in the case of new york new york city definitely influences a lot of the rest of the state but i don't know like the ins and outs of new york law so don't quote me on that they said the city smell bad new york city come to philly it's all fake news it's phony stuff it didn't happen you're not alone on steeping sure i mag stir for a bit but after that i never see a difference in stuffing a bottle away for 50 years i believe uh all right i read that one all right dolce the cheesecake here here we go dolce de no that's not correct milk is leche dulce dulce dulce a sweet food or drinks it just means sweet what does it mean sweet sweet cheesecake does it mean like caramel or something i don't know it's got a good smell to it it definitely smells cheese cakey which is not you know not a obviously a bad thing it is sweet let's give it a rip not a lot of depth from the hand test pretty good not too bad i can see why you want to steep it for two weeks steeping would actually help in this situation i'm not gonna lie sleeping would help a little bit here um all right let's get to some points here your cheesecake is a a little coconutty and that's really just a product of the cheesecake that you're using the tfa cheesecake and new york cheesecake it's a little coconutty like you get a little bit of that coconut note i don't think it works very well in cheesecake it's hard to get around because it's so prominent in tfa cheesecake steeping does help that and that's why i really think you know this would benefit from a steep it doesn't get rid of it but it helps it a little bit four percent and then you have three and a half of cheesecake two i use cheesecake one i don't have cheesecake too they're not very different um and the dolce de leche gives it a kind of like a nice sort of nuttiness it gives a little bit of depth but that's kind of where i think this is really lacking the depth of the flavor we're not talking about volume here we're not talking about um you know uh width we're not talking about like uh flavor stage or anything like that just simple depth of flavor i pick up cheesecake pick up a little dairy and then i pick up like a touch of nuttiness sweetness and that's really it there's really not much to it i'm not really getting a big graham cracker note maybe a touch of it maybe a touch of it but i would like to see that improved in some way um tfa graham cracker might not be your best answer for that it seems to only accentuate the coconut note but it's not bad and i think you have a pretty good base here if you just continue working on it i think you can have something really good my tips would be figure out a way [Music] to um [Music] figure out a way to get your cheesecake a little bit more cheesy but i don't mean that in the way of like a yogurty cheese i mean it more in the way of like almost like texture try to get some sort of fluffiness going on here because that's really just going to kind of broaden your flavor stage a little bit and then maybe you can add a little bit more accent to the to your recipe to give it a little bit more depth so whether it's a little bit of caramel butterscotch um maybe it's another vanilla maybe you go brighter and you go with another vanilla it also help kind of separate out your graham cracker it's just not too much here to really get excited about you know what i mean like it tastes fine but it's not a very exciting mix which i'm assuming why you sent it in you want tips to how do i make this better how do i get this to that next level right white sweetener instead of tfa sure yeah flavor west sweetener at like .25.5 um tfa is not the best sweetener to use but that's not really the issue i don't think it's more so just the flavor really am i roboting oh no [Music] what the [ __ ] man are you kidding this is getting annoying if i'm robotic i have to literally reset my computer it stopped if it robots again it's gonna do it again i feel like aaron bieber [ __ ] man it's just so annoying it's been doing it the whole time on and off uh we'll just have to be quick then we'll just be quick [ __ ] no it's windows windows [ __ ] sucks some driver's messed up and when my computer goes to sleep and i don't reset it my drivers get roboty sometimes all right look we're just gonna have to be quick i apologize all right um i just have to remember to restart or just not use windows anymore um okay so going back to this going back to this not a very exciting recipe just off your score we're gonna give you a two and a half this is very average i think of being uh a little bit generous here with the two and a half out of five you caught me on a good day i kind of want to give it a 2 2.25 um i want to see more from it is really what i want to see i want to see i want to see this added with some added depth so try to figure out maybe accentuate some of the nuttiness that's going on with your recipe maybe try to add different accents such as like another caramel um another butterscotch something else you know what i mean throw something else in there like that try to figure out something to really kind of take this to the next level and then try to fluff up your cheesecake a bit you know what i'm saying try to get a little bit more fluffiness going on you could do that with you could try it with yogurts you could try it with like some sort of whipped cream some sort of fresh cream you could try it with different types of creams you could try with a different cheesecake maybe try mullenberry's panna cotta i've been having a lot of fun with that ingredient you could try there's a lot of different ways you can go down that route because what's that going to do it's going to give you a little separation it's going to allow you to infuse another accent or two in there and it's going to just give you a little bit it's going to be a little bit more forgiving um and yeah there's a little bit of like that coconut off note but overall i think it will steep out i don't think it's that much of an issue it's not bad though like i don't want to say it's a bad recipe it's got a good taste good flavor to it it's just not very exciting it's not something that excites there's no excitement to it you know if this was the first ever cheesecake maybe but it's not this is you know the millionth cheesecake here someone says hanks in italian cream yeah yeah you can go like that route you can go the vanilla pudding route you have a good base layer just need to figure out what to do with it okay two and a half out of five well i'll give you the average you're like again you're lucky you cut me on a good day i want to get to give it a two 2.25 but we'll keep it there for now all right let's do the banana milkshake another very simple mix here simple straightforward just how i like it i'm saying let's mix this up here so this includes fresh cream and a half let me adapt this before i make 70 mls of it oh yeah baby okay fresh cream half a percent just a touch just a drop not a lot what's that from is it from art class when you were in school anyone ever say that to you just a drop not a lot one percent creamy vanilla by mullenberry this skill seems better days hey i use my skills i put the work in on these scales all right if you see a clean scale don't trust a mixer with a clean scale that's what i say we got one and a half of flavor arts milk classic flavor art milk dap bonanza and the three percent soft banana by mullenberry which is possibly one of the best banana ingredients you can get very good stuff and a touch of sweet you know i saw a post on reddit that said is sweetener necessary they were talking about hey i see wayne when he mixes he uses a lot of sweetener well he uses sweetener in every recipe basically this is a conversation that comes up a lot but the the the let me put it this way if you are acclimated to commercial e-liquid then it's a good idea to get it it's a good idea to get it and use it at a half a percent super sweet um of course you know sucralose based sweetener but it's really what it does is that it increases it it cuts out a lot of development time it increases your presence of your recipe by like 10 times you know not even like 10 like 10 times increases the presence without having to need to go through that extreme amount of development time to replicate it without sweetener cause like you can do all of this stuff without sweetener it's just gonna take you a really long time to develop it and it's gonna you know you're gonna leave out a lot of profiles that you wouldn't otherwise be able to make as saturated so it's like a cheat code it is like a cheat code it can quickly become a crutch and that's something you have to watch out for but um you know if you want something that's very present very saturated very vivid sweetener just helps you get there without worrying about that extremely long development cycle so like some of my best work has been made without sweeteners it can be done it just you know those recipes took months to make for no real benefit other than like do you want a vape sweetener or not you know do you do you want to inhale sucralose or not that's really the that's really the uh where the contention comes into play so here's the recipe sorry also when you go sweetener it's very difficult to go back that's the other thing too so if you don't if you can vape and you're completely fine without sweetener just know when you start using sweetener it's hard to go back nothing is going to taste as saturated or as potent or i shouldn't say nothing but most recipes aren't because no one really that that mixes without sweetener takes the time to develop as if they're trying to replicate something with sweetener usually a mixer who mixes without sweetener mixes with that like they vape without sweetener they they want it less sweet they want it less present you know what i mean but there are some occasions where you know someone who can post up a recipe and it's vivid and bright and saturated without the sweetener included because they took the time to develop it that way just going back to the nicotine i would freeze the nick i think carolina extracts information is wrong i had in the freezer for five years just what i think i don't know if it's wrong i wouldn't say it's wrong it's just i think it's a i think they're being a little bit more overly cautious is what is how i read it they're basically saying like we don't know what type of freezer you're using if you're in that freeze thaw threshold a lot with your crappy home freezer then you know you could be ruining your product so they just say look there's really no detriment to putting it somewhere that maintains the same temperature obviously you don't want it in a hot environment but they were they were like you know a refrigerator is a better option because you're not getting to that freeze throt freeze thaw area so most freezers i would say probably can maintain a good freeze temperature but it really isn't about that it's really more so just oxygen heat and light you know oxygen heat and light is what's going to degrade your nicotine um not you know keeping it frozen slows that process down but ultimately if any of those attributes were added to the equation it's still going to the grade does that make sense did i say that in a way that made sense all right i use sweeter and all my mixes but i am concerned about diabetes you don't have to be uh i was in contact with someone with diabetes and they were concerned about sweetener and they said not an issue for them yeah so like going back to the nicotine that's why i'm going with this method with the wine refrigerator essentially um i don't have to worry about the freeze thaw cycle at all you know what i mean i could just pop out a bottle of nicotine let it sit and it's not going to go through a defrost it's going to just you know slightly come up to warm temperature which is only 10 20 degrees from whatever temperature i'm going to set it at and it's going to keep just as long you'll see you'll see once we put it in there you can certainly freeze it don't get me wrong you can absolutely freeze it but it does it does bring up more points of failure than not um you know i have multiple bottles that have just been sitting because i don't have room for them in my freezer that have just been sitting in my closet you know all right here we go homemade banana milk i'm very excited for this one i haven't had a banana milkshake flavor in a long long time smells good tastes a little runty on the hand okay not bad it's a little disappointing unfortunately i hate to break it to you let's read your notes here very simple profile it tastes like you put a banana and milk in a blender nothing artificial depending on how green you like your banana you can add some mb soft banana at four percent it's quite green at five percent it's mostly peel interesting testing haku vena okay thank you for your testing notes a round of applause for anyone who has their testing notes of course yeah let's just let let's sit on this person let's sit on this for a second oh slushy critique yes send in you submit your recipes man submit submit i'm roboting this is so annoying i didn't know it started to do it to my microphones okay well someone said robot alrighty then okay okay okay i have i have a few of your recipes slushie well i have like a mint chocolate chip one or something there might be another one too all right this is good this is simple that you you do say you wanted a very simple profile this is simple but it to me i'm going to be a stickler here to me it tastes as if it tastes like you just didn't the simplicity is missed in the profile your your flavorings that are are added are simple but the taste of it in my opinion the execution didn't quite work it's a it to me it tastes more like a banana cream with cream if that makes sense i'm not getting like a banana milkshake you're not really hitting that very simple profile um just because you developed it in a simple way doesn't mean it's a simple flavor right you know what i'm saying there it just kind of comes through like uh um just a bit lacking kind of like the last one a little bit lacking like the idea of simplicity shouldn't be about you making a simple recipe that the flavor itself could be simple you know yeah i apologize we're just gonna have to run through this i i'm gonna i would have to shut the whole [ __ ] thing down and restart we'll just go right through it whatever the last episode doesn't matter it won't happen again i'll just remember to reset every time i go live you do have a good base here the soft banana is a smart move three percent i think it works as well um i would like to see a little bit more of like a natural banana flavor to me there is a little bit of like a banana runt flavor like a candy banana banana cream flavor that could be worked out you know where it could be a little bit more natural maybe include some sort of like baked more baked banana flavor in there and i would really just like to see more of an emphasis on the milkshake part um i think that's where you could really let this recipe shine it just to me it's not shaky enough it's a little bit more like creamy less so milk shaky like i want something to kind of add some again like some sort of volume being included maybe a cheesecake in here for instance that that to really kind of give it some density some weight um maybe some sort of like richer cream you know all the creams that we were talking about in the cheesecake would apply here as well you know try to mess around with that to really see where you think this profile can go to meet that milkshake idea yeah i i i apologize it's pleasant you got a pleasant flavor here for sure it is pleasant i love banana i love but like my my the the flavor that got me into vaping was a banana it was epic vanilla which was a banana vanilla flavor very similar to this so there is some sort of like an underlying bias here yeah i i think we're gonna give you a three out of five a little above average here three out of five a little above average a little above average oh i see that's that explosion is probably louder than this explosion isn't it yeah see i got to change the volume on those things as well three out of five um i'm giving you a little above average mainly because i do think you have a nice sort of base layer going on like you've got a good start here but it's still kind of falling into the same trap as the other one where i just want to see a little bit more depth to it it does you don't have to make it more intricate you don't have to add more notes to it but give me something to hold on to something to bring my interest some sort of intrigue to the recipe whether that's making that milkshake super accurate that's the thing with simple profiles guys when you're doing something simple it doesn't just mean like a sim like they're simple in two ways you can make a simple recipe where it's just a couple ingredients or you can make a simple profile which is what this person which is what mpa is saying here right he wants a simple profile banana milkshake right well that doesn't mean your recipe has to also be simple okay um so like i said give me something to hold on to when you're doing something simple a simple profile you really want to sell it you really want to sell that through so strawberry you're just doing a strawberry make it the best [ __ ] shrubbery you've ever had that's what's really going to bring people to it don't just go okay this is a simple strawberry and it tastes like every other [ __ ] strawberry that we mixed up you know what i mean in this case you're on your way there but it does taste very very sort of like this is a banana cream with another cream added to it and they're not doing anything really new and you're not bringing any interest to the profile and i'm more partial to this because i do love like i said banana flavors so yeah um that's my big critique for you there you need to kind of think about where you want to take it do you want a better banana flavor do you want something to really bring that banana in or do you want to work more on like that milkshake base do you really want to make like a super accurate milkshake to bring people in that way you could try to do both um yeah that's it that's basically it so that there's my big sort of uh there's my big sort of uh lesson for the day simple when you do a simple profile not a simple recipe simple recipe is different a simple profile really try to sell it really really try to sell that thing make it the best blank that you could possibly do because it's only going to really further that idea like wow i love you know i have someone who really loves blueberry flavors like blow their mind right when you're making them a blueberry recipe or you're going down that simple route make it the best make it so vibrant or so accurate or so you know what i mean bring bring something to it bring something to it don't don't just say i'm making a simple blueberry and then you just give me flavor west blueberry because that's like okay well this is simple in the fact that like you didn't really work hard on it you know you mean you didn't really develop it you just said it's as simple because you just used one ingredient that's that that's a simple recipe that's a different story okay there's my big uh lesson for the day and it goes for both of those recipes it goes through both of those recipes the dulce de cheesecake and uh the homemade banana milkshake both are simple but they're like simple in the sense that it's like boring you know you submitted a different recipe all right from russia with love um you can send it to my email if you're not using twitch you could send through discord send it here oh just know that if you send it through twitch you're uh more likely to be on sooner i should say okay yeah we're gonna start opening them up a little bit more as it seems like i have to force you guys to send recipes all right cherry cheesecake i'm sorry cherry sprite cherry cheesecake cherry sprite cherry sprite very nice okay anywhere cherries one and a half i can't afford to pay for sending in recipes you don't have to pay you don't have to pay do you mean like the amount of watch time needed yeah i don't know maybe it's not calculating the points correctly maybe that's what's going on let's see how many points you have type in let me see how many points you have days for glory cherry extract at one and a half oh you have enough points what do you mean fizzy sherbet by vape train two percent so um the way you do it make sure you sign into your twitch name on stream elements so go to that link and make sure you're signed into your twitch name three percent lemon lime and then you do critique recipe which is a thousand points polar blast nws23 okay polar blast nws23 oh actually i don't know if i haven't i don't have any uh i don't have any we're gonna have to pretend like i use some [ __ ] i thought i totally forgot about it well let's see let's if it if if i feel like it's not good then we'll postpone this damn dude i don't have any ws23 i need to go to flavor jungle the lucy mint do i have to watch on twitch to get points yes but you can just submit through email if you want recipe straight from canada all right okay okay if you want seven up verse sprite check out this cherry up very similar to this kind of i'm waiting on a pie crust for your recipe one-on-one pie crust the one that you submitted i don't have any ws anything i have culada that's it it's okay it's whatever there's a little bit of a caveat here you know what's also really nice about soft banana it doesn't stick to your coil like other bananas you can drip on top of it and the banana goes away like like lorenz banana cream some other bananas too like like flavor art banana they do not leave your coil man all right here's cherry sprite by morency morrissey recently picked up a bunch of flavors i was really wanting a good cherry recipe i took the base from iutenti's one two three uh cranberry spring replaced the flavor cranberry with a combination of vinegar cherries and cherry extract didn't really know where to start with them so i kind of guessed this result is my cherry sprite recipe good shaking vape but after a couple days seeping it really shines doesn't have that medicinal cherry taste the cherries are definitely the forefront but the spread is there just enough in the background to give it a subtly uh fizzy lemon lime taste in the excellent i also added some polar blast at 3s23 to give it a chilled cool feel so it seems like the the coolant isn't really uh that necessary to the recipe test it on the citadel thank you for your testing notes 28 dads super fun what's that a bad bad bad that's dad here we go fantastic fantastic fantastic jello see ice that would involve me digging out my delusion i just have no i have no interest in doing so graham is such a delosie shill i need another i need a bigger shelf that's the thing i only bought a six a six six block shelf and i threw away my eight block shelf or no i threw away my uh i have a nine block shelf i threw it with my 16 block shelf which was a bad move the one that i had in my out my old office that might have been a 12 block show nonetheless i'm i'm out of blocks and i need more this tastes excellent this tastes like cherry sprite man this tastes excellent it's definitely um it's definitely like more along the lines of like a um how do you put it the pull the blast works actually really well i really i i really like it i really [ __ ] like it to me it's definitely like it keeps the vibe of sprite more than the cherry like to me like cherry sprite i don't even know if is cherry spread a thing there's a bottle here i don't know if i've ever had it but it definitely has like a sprite like a really good sprite vibe to it with like a nice sort of ride out on cherry i was a little afraid your uh cherry extract wasn't gonna bring much to the table but it seems like it does i don't know if it's really the anywhere cherries that's pulling that along every time i've used cherry extract i've been kind of not impressed by it it's kind of thin and light but i mean i'm getting a really good cherry note here but real i'm really impressed by is like that lime and lemon fizzy sherbet lemon lime and fizzy sugar i mean that's sprite that's [ __ ] sprite it's a very nice sprite flavor this is a fun vape too someone rated you three stars let's see why citadel rda uh one week light cherry comes first then astringent lemon quite thin with the predominance top notes that's interesting um might be good for your mouth something and that's interesting i actually think the opposite i actually think the opposite i think this works really well i think this works really well i don't get an astringent lemon maybe their lemon lime is bad or something or maybe too much fizzy sherbet we're gonna go 4 out of 5. [Applause] [Music] i just see my where i'm talking and then i see the red when i press that button i see the red bar just burn [Laughter] yeah vape train fizzy sherbet it's pretty [ __ ] good with the cap lemon lime really sells the sprite flavor i'm trying to give you some critiques here my critique is that i can't give you too much critiques i didn't do with the ws23 but my critique would be that when i think of like a cherry soda like that cherry is really prominent and like like it's like really a main aspect like it it's really there you know what i mean like the cherry is like all cherry this definitely seems more sprite flavored with like a nice cherry right out i don't know what cherry sprite tastes like but all the other cherry sodas i've had like that cherry is like the main thing and that's not here in this recipe to me the the winner is the sprite base and then you kind of color it in with a little bit of cherry on the finish you definitely get cherry in the top but it's i get that when you when you exhale you get that whole sort of note and that's where it really is nice but i wouldn't call this like a super like cherry recipe it's more like a cherry accent it's good though like that i like that um but that's my critique is if if uh if making this more cherried would make this closer to cherry sprite then maybe work on that maybe try to figure out a way to get a deeper cherry note in there i like wild cherry by mullenberry um who's saying uh rin is saying ssa juicy cherry yeah juicy cherry is great mainly mullenberry cherries are the best ones uh the inner cherries taste great maybe the cherry extract maybe it's not necessary maybe increase anywhere i don't know or maybe maybe i don't know maybe the cherry extract is doing a lot anytime i've used it i've not been impressed by cherry extract okay there is a little soapiness going on there is a touch of medicinal quality or chemical quality and i'm assuming that's from the fizzy sherbet every time i've mixed this up it's kind of had this weird sort of like artificial vitamin note um yeah that's definitely where it's coming from i can just smell it on there maybe that steeps out i'm not sure now it's definitely the fizzy sherbet so maybe try to work out that off note it's slightly there if you know if if you're someone with a less refined palette you might not pick it up sweetener will just cover it up anyway but i can i can pick it up you know that's something to knock points off right there um everything else is pretty good though everything else is pretty [ __ ] good good time to ask sent email chemnivatic fizzy ad or new fizzy ad version two what do you know i know i know about neither i don't know anything about fizzy ad or fizzy ad too i know nothing about them bob says indian mango liquid barns vanilla ice cream and fizzy sherbet amazing recipe just mix it without ws23 as well and it's indeed true to spite sprite beverage i like it and the cherry is there pro probably more cherry would kill the sprite yeah it's good thanks i love when you guys mix with me especially i know screwdriver you've been mixing with me a lot it's great to see when i get some sort of like outside reference to what i'm saying thank you for that um yeah that's the thing right if that's the thing that i mean that's kind of i i haven't tried a cherry sprite so i don't know but i know you know exactly what i'm talking about other cherry sodas the cherry is like such a deep part of the recipe so if you're looking for that then maybe try to figure out a better cherry a better way to add the cherry in here um you probably would kill the sprite but that's really where the the creativity or the you know the crafting would come into play try to how to how to figure out how to work that out and then i do get a touch of like that fizzy sherbet medicinal vitamin note that could be worked out overall though i think it is really nice i think it tastes great now when i look at sam's where is it i don't see it anymore where'd it go oh when i look at sam sent over his cherry sprite which kind of has the same base i can see this being a little bit more of like that deeper cherry flavor just because you're using the red cherry going a little crazy with the moscato and the sour lemon you are using a lemon lime soda instead of capella's lemon lime which might work i mean i don't see why that wouldn't work but you got the inner wear cherries with the fizzy sherbet yeah i'm curious as to i don't know about i don't know about the moscato but it seems like you're not trying to go for cherry spray well you're saying akin to 7up is a pretty finicky ingredient it's very vibrant cherry seven up is delicious cherry on top of the first sip and then it just kind of disappears that's kind of what you get with this recipe it's kind of what you get here the cherry is more of an accent the the sprite base is really where i think it and like with just the polar blast is good you know the ws-23 is just going to add a little bit more fizziness to the mix but just the polar blast works as well it cools it down and it adds a touch of fizz to it for sure that's stripping cherries with lemon lime you already know what it tastes like you already know what it tastes like mostly oh true yeah yeah yeah i forgot about that recipe yeah you could probably go cranberry you can probably go cranberry you could probably go with like a little bit of some sort of like boozy flavor if you wanted to do like a cranberry vodka sort of thing cranberry vodka soda maybe black tea tfa black tea for that vodka note i mean that's it you're the winner here morency is the winner let's give morenzy a round of applause [Applause] am 100 let's see yes he is 3 000. see once you start uh winning then you start to snowball your points you guys can give points to each other's by the way if you want if someone new wants to send the recipe they don't have enough points feel free to give them some points

where you at bye bye [Music] so [Music] so [Music] do [Music] mmm [Music]", "YwmemYVLehg": "real life I'm doing it's not okay unless you feel right everybody can hear me okay never done this before so just gotta get the tangle that's okay how's it been doing so this recipe is pretty pretty easy all you need is your strawberries and you want them dry and the nice firm berries you don't want the ones with the marks and stuff like that cuz they'll go mushy if you're gonna eat them lick right away the softer berries are okay but the recommend harder berries let me grab the wrong path and look through them so where's everybody from everybody can hear me okay so what we want to do is turn up the heat to medium so it's about four on my Abu and today you're going to need sugar just granulated sugar light corn syrup maybe it's a little too bright it's not better it's a better Tucson we want the light on or off office more better are we okay so anyways I don't have any long wooden dowels you should probably use those but I'm just gonna use some of the harder to fix these guys got like a bit of a thicker end on them I'm going to just jab the very you just want to take off the end here you want to leave on the the the whole thing and just take off the green bits and then I'll stab oh into there and then when your syrup is hot enough you'll be able to pour it and twirl it let's go as we go and we must get cracking on that because it takes a minute to get up to temp it sir these things are very handy to have their candy thermometers or deep fryer you can deep fryer with them to whatnot but very handy to have but if you don't have him candy thermometer if it takes about 20 minutes that medium to maybe just a little bit higher than medium heat and when the syrup is ready if you pour it into cold a cup of cold water and it supplies and it's cracky then I easily make dog if you pour it in the water into the cold water and it turns hard that's called the hard crack stage so you should be good alright so we want two cups of sugar you with a leftover sugar I'm going to make same banana cream flavor at hard candies because this is going to be way more than to cover these strawberries here all right so two cups of sugar you need 2/3 a cup of corn light corn syrup or in there it's pretty simple to make hard candy it's just a little bit of time and you got to be super in the safe department and then you want a third quarter cup of water I like using hot water because it kind of makes the melting process a little bit faster all right so that's going to take a few minutes to get going get the corn syrup off you just want to leave that be Charlie is doing some editing right now he's gonna taste the teeth it snaps once we're done here you're just being here bothering me anyway so just leave me be thanks for joining in everybody everybody's having to give me some fodder can you consult it we'll just start boiling away you don't need to turn a tournament or anything like that or stir it turn it stir it it will just do what it needs to do yeah he's on the couch jerking I meet some cauliflower soup today you're gonna get that finished up are you in CNF okay take a salt and who's on here and even smart dude over here he's got a new video right now making his brother sick themselves oh hey what did you be enough to diddle you speak a little money it's like the coronavirus is a good excuse for you to never have to come back in what anybody yeah whoa what's everybody teaching on right now 2:30 in the afternoon it's kickety-kick it appears kids get you it's really hard to focus on what you're trying to do and also focus on a chat to talk I don't know if you can see a thought better we've got a boil so Brett just over 100 Celsius and that will be 225 ish Fahrenheit for those folks and we're looking to try to get up to 300 Fahrenheit 150 Celsius everybody getting stuff done around the house since you're trapped there just everybody having right domestic with their partners everybody's just loving to do it all miss a little stink monkey what's everybody's favorite edible DEET is it cookie or muffin or is everybody has anybody like to cook savory foods with their medicinals does anybody have any good recipes it was like 28 questions coming at ya do seven domestics with you solve it just not putting things away you having to tell yourself twice in the eye CVD lozenges there a good burger or something some like nothing CBD or THC and the burger no meat itself or maybe make some type of something that goes on the burger that has the hash parts into it yellow cat maybe like a cheese sauce or something like that he could probably work the hash and you please root is he hopefully everybody let's these cooking shows but maybe give some more room get some ideas on what we might want to try and my favorite are the hard cinnamon candies that's probably not just a few to try and then I'm gonna make the hard candies with the rest everybody could still salt put this up it's a little bit over the way and higher just don't want it in the Chooch I'll get a stern talking-to terrible pretty soon does anybody cheat while they cook no at whenever Chris will bring me in a joint while I'm cooking or something I always feel like pinky Bundy you know and you see it in the beginning or she like drops her ashes into the hammock or something and stuff and just zero [ __ ] are given like that just reminds me of that so I try usually not to teach and cook too much food so just be careful one time my cousin she's wear fake nails and she made this lasagna and lost a nail but didn't know a fishy lost her nail in the lasagna or where she may have lost it right and she brought this lasagna to a family function and people I ate list is long yeah and she didn't tell people until afterwards that was disgusting I was very happy I didn't eat that lasagna so we're just waiting it's about like I said around in the 20 minute mark well it won't be able to see kinda how long the chat is but I figured you know instead of jumping the the candy making process I just show you up you know in full so you can decide if that's something you want to do for yourself or whatnot I'm pretty excited so yeah you just put your little guy on a skewer and when it's ready you just twirl it into the sugar you don't want like a super thick layer though just a nice thin crackly layer yeah do a little dance make a little image something get after net yes it can take a song while we're waitin everybody can hear me right I don't have the microphone plugged in I didn't want too much stuff around baby Jim burly there he is so if you seen puck ones Facebook we're changing the freezer shed into a chicken coop I'm gonna have chicken friends that's gonna lay egg ease for us I'm pretty excited I've already decided one of the chickens names is going to be Mable and I also enjoy the name Matilda need a little uh music maker in here play Jim Burley songs for friend seats make sure you go check out Jim burly's uh I should name one Kyle should night haha that's just chasing things though Jim really put your link up Jim burlap oh we're getting their checks for friggin ever all the frickin time making candies are so good they just take forever these are the candies I mean yesterday little uh marble sized ones it's well I have to get one of them you know salt these uh it's a fruit punch flavor these ones they're not bad at all don't teach the hash at all oh and when we're done they in the mix in just about three grams of rosin into the mixer pretty exciting I've got my two little monk meets on the show when I was a kid I got my ass kicked by a rooster we were playing by the pond and this thing decided it wanted to chase us and I'm not very good at like running and laughing and having a moment so I had to like stop and just scream and hope that the chicken would be more scared of me than I was a bit because like I just couldn't and it was getting me so that was my like defense mechanism it's like I'm an animal and scream at it and then it just left me alone then the next time it it got me and my tactic didn't work the second time because it came and got me and pecked me right on the shin bone big time hurt oh it's my friend of a time decided she was gonna like run - but then lock me out of the truck because that was our like safety thing that you know the rooster couldn't get in there but no no she just saved herself and I got [ __ ] over how are you doing full sand I'm pretty excited we're getting up there I might crank her up just a little bit to make things go a little bit faster but these candy thermometers are mucho good I watched that Jimmy sent me a video today and it was pretty friggin funny let me just socked if I could find it here real quick because it was a goodie you made me dunk my corn that was so friggin funny yeah don't be a [ __ ] I hope mine are nice to me because it will like really hurt my feeling it or not if you haven't paid attention over the years I'm a little bit sensitive in the animal department yeah we're doing it nothing with dipper word all of the sugars just gonna K forever I don't want to be attacked no I want them to be my friend I've been bidding lot binge-watching chicken raising videos and stuff and a little how much for something treats you can give them and different things and hopefully they'll have a good little life and you know as the years go on will improve and probably get more we're just going to get a couple three maybe up to five chickens and see how it goes comma comma comma comma come on sherry boil so what do we think we should try next on the THC well no not free-range so much like they're gonna have an area and stuff to be but I'm not ready for freer and jet I don't think my anxiety could handle it and I just got to see how things go and stuff but like the neighbor's dog gets out and runs over here and the cats get out and come over here and I just want to make sure that they're safe and stuff like that because like I'm not a kind of the kind of farmer that's gonna be like oh that's that's life you know like that's the way of fireman animals get got but it's preventable and you know I just need to do it the way and you give you up for a minute hmm but eventually you know maybe we get rid of some more stuff and make more room in the art and this or not and blah blah blah we could possibly have them free-range you know we have to get a fence yet and all that yeah when we do get the chip in them they fired out the chicken nuggets well I'll definitely cook with them and try to show everybody wall over at just about 250 right now we've got a few degrees go but see how long the process takes in actuality and like mucho danger like hospital up if you get burnt with that so you know don't do a bunch of dabs and carry on before you do you do this like make this a safety first priority not safety third come along to luck one puts the squawking chickens Jimmy Choo bad cuz they're gonna be on the other side of the yard so Jimmy Choo bad and it's not like we're having like a giant flock of them so and I mean it's no different than the dogs the neighbor's dog barked and belligerent but I'd find you know chickens probably less noisy than that well yeah that's exactly we got to like fix the holes in the fence that Rick cut before we could have chickens running around thanks Rick if anybody's in the area of in woods and has like chicken type of stuff or like extra chain-link fence or things like that but maybe they'd like to donate to the chicken kid just get a hold of me how you doing for Massachusetts I'd love to have a little a little piggy to but when we went and seen them and saved them and stuff that you know you got to have a lot of room and a lot of space for a piggy and like there there's no actual little piggies they get great big and they stink and they poop and they carry on and they need like appropriate spots you know mud to Rudin and different things and you know one day I would love to have like if we ever won lots of money or something ever happened in the favor of us being able to start an animal sanctuary or something I would love that big time we're getting there getting there slowly climbing up to the 300 mark we got a hundred and two people watching thank you everybody let's tuning in I'm kind of you know all over the place and you know once I kind of settle in on my nerves and getting things in order on how I want to show you and cook and stuff because it's kind of nerve-wracking but maybe you know each show will get better and we'll we'll learn as we go now you better settle down mr. Baker did you stick yourself I don't know we're not gonna kill the chickens they're our friends they're gonna be dirty scissors hopefully Gertie isn't a dick but she probably is cuz she doesn't see too many different things so she'll probably just stay in the house when I have to mine the chickens yeah give me a big thumbs up thanks bar we're getting there oh we're there all right so we can take out the thermometer shut off the thingy my hash he's gonna pop it off the heat my hash if you put it in the freezer first it comes off really easily and they're going to be a little bit of a mix can you still see all right yeah it's really for often gonna set the phone down function like a normal human being here for a second smells very in the Hashi alright so we shall start everybody's still saw I'm gonna take a bit of the mixture pour it over the strawberry and just like that well Elaine brown put it on a cold surface you also want to start with a cold strawberry sorry I gotta think what I'm doing here because I certainly don't want to burn myself we'll need all kinds of super chops hugging will be just be pissed right off because of burnt my sandwich makers but I mean it's a pretty simple process right please Shepard and if you find your mixture is getting a little bit thick oh good thing get a spoon there you can just pop it back on the heat okay this would just be a better process for me here there we go a ladle little dip it in give it a swirl there we go see you you figure it out as you go I'm uh I like to cook more than I like to bake because you don't have to follow the recipe so much you can kind of create your own how much for something and that's what I like to do to the best if anybody has any homemade recipes that they'd like to share with me give me a little message on my Instagram some always liking to learn and try new tasty helmet routes on things it's probably not a good spot for my phone do we have any artistes in watching right now my instagram is one pub life like the post things that make me happy on there and my how much for some things and of course all my pictures of a being great sees alright so there we go tasty here let's give it go you don't [ __ ] delicious alright so let the rest of it I'm going to pour in they've been a enough leave your breathe we're trying teach the strawberries how you done okay so now I got those on the go I just put my banana flavoring in and a little bit of green so we can make it a yellow color smells exactly like amoxicillin you might be like absolutely yelling now at my head right by the whatsit so I just got my silicone rubber mold totally it's like extra super braided just seemed like the program is that more better man I gotta get another one of these into myself yeah I wish there was people here and I can be like here try this their friend electus I'm gonna go get Charlie thumb just through your [ __ ] them we'll be right back see the only bad thing with these you got to eat them but oh alright so I'm going to pour my I can't eat a little bit still I kind of see what I'm doing a little bit so I'm still trying to come up with a way that I can pour each of these candies without it being like a complete mess I tried a stainless steel turkey baster but that doesn't work so I got the old knife and ladle but it kind of makes a little bit of a match so very nice a very holy I'm gonna be dead I still have to meet supper all right man these are [ __ ] tasty you got to try this at least once definitely like a little fun party thing yeah just making messes sorry I'm not being overly chatty but Jackson like yourself for a second definitely have to make a different type of the fruit - I saw that you can do mandarin oranges like that seems like something I might love making like a little not Sicilian candies right now they used to get wound when my mom would give me a mock Susilo know those like sick as [ __ ] as a kid like terrible stomach problems and other health issues and stuff though but anyways that's not wrong but my mom would give me like a mock Sicilian and it was like my go-go juice is like totally a placebo you know obviously was making me feel better but like it was like an instant feel better because it was delicious tasty little medicine and then the one time they gave my mom the strawberry kind and was not impressed about that get the other mold here finish this up thanks for tuning in with me everybody and I'm glad that it they turned out oh it's open they're tasty big-time you don't taste the hash at all I'm not a big fan of like super Hoshi edibles like no thanks I want it to taste good and you know like I can't I don't know how people do like the [ __ ] bazillion milligram edibles that just absolutely taste like kite I'd rather have a couple candies and maybe equal out to that much if I was if I wanted that much so I in my own baby bird so at least you know with this recipe you can get a bunch of candies made out of it and the little fresh candy tree all right not such but also would thoroughly enjoy evil - where was it going that oh yeah already can't remember we'll have to come back to me anyways let's do a little quick read-through yep Tiff's already dinked yep mama how terrible Brooklyn they are tasty as frig I'm gonna have to put them in little dish or something see you a couple or I'll be better if I cut a little bit of the great that way if they do melt a little bit we're not just gonna like completely on all the way but probably good if you have like a silicone mat and then you can just put it on there and then you won't have any of the breakage but there we go 509 big time so here are the gummies Ehrlich gummies the hard candies they're good pick your note okay I've got a little bit of moss on him but I was going fast the best works so then you better know it's like light up there that's good well everybody I think I'm unicolor quits I just want to say thank you big time for tuning in and I'll just show you the shades of the candy you know it's gonna take a few minutes for those ones to pardon but here's the shape of the candy good size case good so yeah if you have send me messages on maybe what you'd like to see and we'll try this again and meet something else how much for something thanks everybody bye for now how do you turn this off you sucked out of me you", "uep6FKZWRsY": "they come in different colors different shapes and sizes in flavors ranging from fruity to minty from tart to tangy pretty much everyone enjoy sucking on a hard candy from time to time for children and adults alike these sweet treats are just irresistible our love of sweets goes back to the caveman who delighted in eating honey from beehives in ancient times people indulged in treats made of honey covered fruit and nuts in the Middle Ages Europeans made candy from boiled sugar but the high cost of imported cane sugar restricted this delicacy to the wealthy candy finally became affordable for the masses in the 1800s with the discovery of a new and domestic source of sugar the sugar beet these hard candies aren't mass-produced confections their gourmet candies custom-made and crafted by hand the candy maker starts by bringing a pot of sugar and water to a boil then he adds glucose a thick syrup made from starch he heats the mixture to a specific temperature depending on what type of candy he's making and lets it cook for about a half hour then he stirs in liquid flavoring once the mixture is evenly blended He pours it onto a cooling table the candy maker has several flavorings at his disposal from eucalyptus oil to fruit flavors he also chooses from a wide range of food colorings this candy will have a strawberry design in the middle so he and his assistants are working with three colors green for the leaves red for the berry and yellow for the background to enhance the flavor they add citric acid then they keep blending until the candy has cooled down and hardened enough to be malleable they separate the pieces by color and put each piece on a heated table to slow the hardening process so that the candy will remain pliable now they create the design they form various shapes and sizes and like a puzzle put the pieces together to make a jumbo version of the candy design once they've assembled the red berry and green leaves and yellow background they roll on more yellow background then a layer of red for the outside trim all that's left is to reduce this giant wad of candy into a bite-sized version to do that the candy maker pinches one end and stretches it out to form a long uniform strand called a rod he cuts the ride into pieces almost 2 feet long but he has to keep rolling them until they cool and Harden or else they'll go flat when the rod is just the right diameter the design is in perfect proportion all they have to do now is cut candy sized pieces they use the same technique to make Kiwi candy pink grapefruit candy and banana candy to name just a few varieties want to order up some candy with a personalized message here's an al I know a V Andy oh why oh and you again they create a yellow background and red trim then it's more pinching pulling rolling and cutting until the rods are down to just the right size if you look at the back end of each rod you'll see the lettering is in Reverse that'll be the underside of the candy when the wrong candy comes off the cooling table is transparent to make it opaque or light in the color they'll pull it on a hook here they intertwine two colors and feed the rod through a special machine that forms bands of pillow shaped candies after cooling they simply break them apart by hand it's your new sucker for hard candies no problem they can also twist rods into lollipops if you have any comments about the show or if you'd like to suggest topics for future shows drop us a line at Science Channel com /how it's made", "RlqiUGDO8aY": "hey guys welcome back to my channel today I'm gonna show you how I can ease your arteries I'm gonna talk through this three or four times but today I'm gonna show you had mastered let's get to the video so the first thing you're gonna need will be when hot on your rear element then you want a cup of sugar that you're gonna pour into your pot the next thing you're going to do is you're going to take 1/2 a cup of water and pour that in you're going to turn your oven on to the medium-high you're gonna take a wooden spoon you're gonna mix it carefully mix until dissolved [Music] you can see I've been mixing it till the salt you want to put your oven on high let it boil until golden brown and make sure not to stir take fresh whole strawberries stick with the stands on take a toothpick and stick it in the top of your strawberries make it to make it easier to dip once it's golden brown take it off the element and let go and up the bubble set up you want to take out a cutting board and if it's a parchment paper take one of your fresh strawberries and you want to dip yours you want to like full bring your sugar to the end of the pan but make sure it doesn't fall out and you want to evenly twirl your strawberry so it does not have a plate at the bottom and you want to sit it at the bottom of your paper as you can see the strawberries have set and they're ready to eat again your hard this is oh my gosh okay sometimes it'll be a little bit sticky because they just got out of the fridge laughter I am asked the rim also giving I showed up to the kids in my class and one youtuber

was like these strawberry [Music] [Music] [Applause] it's are just specific and nostalgic okay making this video no last name and before that though and so I had turned down the game all the way in the volume to about halfway which there's all fine [Applause] all the way up anyway so I forgot when I switched the game I'll need the volume was always even when the gain and volume are all the way up I've always increased the volume on my editing platform and even with it all the way up like adding the full blast volume on the editing the software is still so quiet about exporting like keep doing until I could get the volume to where it one if that makes sense but my computer Oh weird about it it's like you know I just barely do it it's fine everything is turned up these look like cough drops but they taste so nostalgic my music teacher from my kindergarten until gosh maybe fourth grade she taught the lower level kids her name was mrs. talent miss Khaled miss Khaled and she was so cute she was an old lady lady and she she played piano she felt like your grandma's she was so cute and she would always have snacks and goodies out on the table if you like performed honestly if you did anything you didn't even have to but she always had these and like that butter spot our candy does anybody know what I'm talking about hot Oreos but they're like vanilla or Hills but they weren't the Wario brand they're like the vanilla version of Oreos any one time like the way later in life not like a later I school we were at this cheerleading retreat no that wasn't me we are at my friend's lake house all the girls and this sweet-ass paint'll ever she went to my grade school she was a year older the worst thing she ever did and she stole a piece of candy from gallon I don't know why it's not funny but it's just like you know her it wouldn't make it better but she would have the candy is laid out on little tissues and you would pick it up but we always sang the same song over and over in that glass there was one that was like and there are all these instruments you got to choose from so she doesn't read them stick there were somewhat like a ridges there you better rub them in they would be like like that or just some almost like drum stick together like a [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] couple days ago I just wanted to do something fresh today just ramble about my old music actually a lot of different types of art Andy and some new types of recently I'm very excited it's a weird combo with this hard candy but whatever works so tomorrow I will be talk sitting my brother's cutest little golden retriever her name is Wendy Bell I would show you a photo but I am using my phone to record so maybe all things are once I get here she's about a year and a half old now and she's so precious I love her so much but she requires a lot of attention which is okay it's so adorable she always one step touch you or around you she loves to play so much energy you have no idea but just the cutest sweetest little face I've ever seen I just love her so much it won't be for a while but it will be really fun it will be like the first wedding and my immediate family but not certainly not my extended family because I've mentioned before but my dad has 10 sisters and two brothers Catholic problems and I've been too late pretty much all of their weddings and then I like a billion dozens do of my cousins once a year younger than me and one is do younger than me we're both engaged so I guess we haven't had a family wedding in a while like and lastly of our dads because the youngest brother Dubois they have plasma we have it too and she took her husband's last name which [Music] [Applause] over [Music] around Christmas maybe a little longer [Music] [Music] it's so funny when you but then again like Maestri it's pretty random you don't always know because when I do this sounds like up like interruptions or like cars driving by something like that always sounds so much louder in the headphones and then I go to edit and it's like not as loud at all it's super straight sorry I feel like all of that info is sort of unnecessary but it is just always very humble after all but I hope you're doing well it's Jake save and enjoy your life as much as you can right now [Applause] do appreciate yourself and I just wanna let you know that I love you I'm proud of you I am proud of

today I'll be making a small batch of hard candy using Lauren's super strength oils if you're new to our channel would like to see more recipes please like subscribe and don't forget to click the notification button [Music] I'm specifically highlighting Loran oils because I tend to get the most compliments when I use their flavors it's very important to set everything up in advance on the stovetop I keep a cup with warm or hot water to keep my brush in and it'll be where I place my thermometer when I remove it you'll need a brush or a tool to remove sugar crystals from your pot we purchase these cute silicone bear molds which will provide a link to in the description however if you don't have a mold you can use a small lightly oiled sheet pan for your candy on medium heat add your sugar corn syrup and water and stir until it comes to a small boil [Music] periodically you want to take your brush and remove the crystals that form around your pot now that your mixture is boiling stop stirring but continue to brush the sugar crystals that form around your pot your candy will be ready when it reaches the hard crack line on your candy thermometer as you get closer to 300 you want to make sure that your oil and food coloring if you're using it are ready because once you reach hard crack stage your candy mixture becomes time sensitive now that your mixture is reached hard crack stage remove your thermometer add your food coloring if you're using it and your one dream of Lorien oils stirring continuously some oils because they're super strength have strong scents so be sure to keep your oven or your stove fan on after you remove your mixture from the heat quickly but carefully because it's very hot transfer into your molds or onto a sheet pan my husband isn't a professional videographer and I'm not a professional candy maker so this shot is a little shaky and a little sloppy however this little tool I'm using is perfect to fix my mistake so we'll be sure to add a link to this silicone spatula below whether using molds or a sheet pan let your candy cool completely before removing once your candy is cooled if you're using a sheet pan gently break your candy into bite-sized pieces and you can also sift powdered sugar over them I personally prefer molds because they don't have as many sharp edges and as you can see even with arthritic hands they easily pop out [Music] sometimes I accidentally have fill some of the molds and we end up with a bowl full of accidents which my husband is happy to dispose of there are many recipes for hard candy as you can see I have a variation including rock candy but for more candy ideas we'll put a link to Lauren's website in the description this is a great homemade gift for any occasion or any season please

okay welcome I can see comments so if you are watching let me know who let me know where you're and I can't read the comments that way haha trying to type left okay so if you are watching go ahead and let me know oh where you're watching from so we can get started so candied strawberries I'm not quite sure where they originated but I do know that there is a Hong Kong dessert that has like strawberries all on a skewer dipped in candy so there's that but I'm not sure if they started there I really don't know is trying to do some research on it and there was a lot of mixed mixed comments on where candied strawberries originated so candied strawberries are just like candied apples so or toffee apples you can call them so I guess you could call these toffee strawberries so basically it's just a we're gonna make suckers we're making a thin sugar coating on on the outside of these strawberries and you can actually do it with pretty much anything like I said traditionally they started with candied apples candied strawberries but I've also seen candied Kiwi candy grapes candied mandarin oranges and I have a couple different fruits that we're gonna try that I've never tried before so figures crusts that they work so okay I can I can see comments oh now that's good I know it's working there's always that moment before you see anybody that you're not sure if everything is working out okay alright so has anybody ever made their own suckers before this is sugar water and corn syrup and you cook it using a candy thermometer Oh to the right temperature now I want to talk about temperature really fast because this candy making is really dependent on your altitude and oh something's calling me decline I should probably put it on like airplane mode or something so I don't get phone calls well this is going on great now I can't see comments anymore okay airplane mode and see if I can still watch okay I can't make it so much and I can still see comments so we are good um anyway and maybe I can still see comments okay there we go back it's okay to thermometer most recipes are and should be written for sea level is that way wherever you live you know that you can adjust for that no I know some blockers aren't always aware of high altitude adjustments so they create their recipes for where they live I happen a little bit of really high altitude but I try to write all my recipes for sea level making the adjustments backwards for you guys based on what I have created but candy thermometer the best way to really do this there's all sorts of rules that you can follow there's a lot of guidelines I'm working on a guideline for my site right now about high altitude adjustments for baking and candy making but really at the end of the day you should test your own equipment because if I followed the rule that they have for where I live about 5,000 feet above sea level I would actually still be off and I don't know if it's because my thermometer is off or there's just some fluke where I happen to live but that's the thing it's such a personalized thing you should test it so the best way to test what you should make your adjustments for is to do the water test so water boils at 212 degrees Fahrenheit and so what you want to do is you want to stick you the thermometer that you're gonna be using in a pot of water and bring it to a boil and as soon as it comes to a boil mark where that is and then that's the adjustment that you need to make for any recipes so like this recipe today we're going for like three hundred and 320 degrees Fahrenheit is what we're trying to get to 320 degrees if you look on here is just above hard crack 300 degrees is hard to crack Oh 310 degrees I don't know why is that 20 that's why I'm like that seems really high between 300 and 310 degrees Fahrenheit is hard crack that is what we're going for for this sugar today but I know because of the testing that I've done that I need to take off 20 degrees so I'm only going to go to 282 to 290 degrees before well so any hopefully that makes sense there's a little bit of math involved but it's worth doing and all of a sudden all these recipes that you were messing up on or like caramel x' and marshmallows and stuff you're having troubles with all those troubles will magically hopefully go away if you know what the adjustments that you need to correctly make for where you live now if you live at sea-level that you know for everybody you can just follow our recipe lucky you although I will say you should probably still test your equipment just to see if your thermometer is actually accurate now the thermometers are so it's still worth testing your equipment like I test oh I have an oven thermometer that I always test as well just to make sure cuz if it says 350 on my oven that doesn't necessarily mean it's 350 degrees inside my oven so that's why thermometers are like my platform they're those things that I tell everybody they should kit but any time somebody asks you for a kitchen tip they're like what's the one kitchen tip you would tell somebody it's always have good thermometers make sure you have an oven thermometer and make sure you have a candy thermometer so that's enough on my platform so let's get started for this so what our boys 212 degrees C level yep and like I said I you can look it up but I would still test it yourself because every thermometer and every location is a little bit different okay so to make our candy we are going to start with all right we are gonna start with sugar and this is just regular granulated sugar and water and we're also going to be using a corn syrup hold on there we go all right now I get a lot of questions about corn syrup and there's a lot of like stories and articles that are freaking people out talking about corn syrup but where they're talking about in the news is actually a like high fructose corn syrup those articles that you're reading about and they're in a lot of our processed foods and our granola bars and stuff like that corn syrup that you can get at the store that you use for home baking is not the same thing is it more sugar yes yes it is but it has its place and I highly recommend you use it I get a lot of questions about if you can leave it off you can basically it's just a sugar syrup which you're making with your sugar and your water the reason that I also include corn syrup is it actually as a stabilizer it helps keep your mixture from getting granulated and so it keeps because sugar can get greenie right we've all made a batch of caramel or hot fudge or or suckers like we're doing now and toffee and it gets all grainy and nasty corn syrup helps to solve that problem it also gives you a better shine it gives you a better texture for making something like nougats or marshmallows it's just it's like a like house salt and vanilla our flavor enhancers and I recommend using them corn syrup is like an enhancer for our candy making and I really recommend that you not skip over it so now we're going to bring this to a boil so I have the temperature on and I'm going to start stirring it and I'm trying not to go up the sides too much because if you get a lot of sugar up here that's where you can get a little grain egde I just don't want my sugar to burn to the bottom so it's doing a quick little movement of this to kind of get it going and then we'll leave it and let it boil right working on my other lot of stuff over here so I had a rough morning and I actually woke up super super sick and I have spent all day in bed and I'm feeling a little feverish so if I look a little flushed to you I apologize I'm really glad that today was an easy live video because I am already feeling a little woozy so while we are bringing this up to temperature and make sure that I've got my candy thermometer on the pot now usually I like to use a pretty deep pot for candy making and stuff like this because if you can take a look at this the thermometer is not very deep into our syrup so we're actually gonna have to be doing a lot of tilting to chests to check the temperature while we're making this but for but to be able to dip skewers of strawberries and candy and stuff like that I wanted a wider pan so kind of personal preference if you're only gonna be dipping like one strawberry at a time or one fruit at a time then you can go with a deeper panned it actually I believe helps overall but if you want to be dipping full skewers in fact this isn't even a full sphere I cut like three inches off of this make sure this is a bit inside the pot but if you want to be doing dipping skewers then you need to be going for a wider face so while we were ringing that up to boil we are going to prepare some of the fruits that we're going to use now I thought I ordered grapes from grocery delivery but apparently they were out because I didn't get any so we are going to be working with a couple of fruits to move this off to the side and bring in some fruit so we're gonna be working with [Music] all right so I always do strawberries that's what this is all about right candied strawberries but I'm also going to do some Kiwis and some mandarin oranges and we're going to be working on that so I'm gonna cut up some more Kiwis now you want to now these Kiwis for some reason that I got aren't really super ripe so when I try to cut off the end and use a spoon to scoop out the center which is the easiest way to get the center out it actually didn't then pop out I don't know this batch it gets for a little bit early and in Kiwi season in strawberry season so what I ended up doing earlier today when I was preparing some of these is I actually was just using my knife to cut the skin off so if you guys have better tricks for me I just could not get my spoon to easily get the skin off today for some reason I don't know why kind of a weird day I guess okay and now this once you cut it it's all like shiny and a little goopy so what you want to do is place it on paper towel because we want this to be dry when we place it inside the sugar so I've already rinsed my strawberries and I've let them drain for our orange kind of the same thing the mandarin oranges or my family calls of meat cons because that's what you call them in Japan so hope you feel better soon thank you so much Michelle and Kristina I appreciate that nothing there's nothing fun about being sick right so and I we call these me cons because that's what they call them in Japan I know that here in the United States they call a mandarin oranges or cuties I would love to hear what you guys call these so Kiwis strawberries mandarin oranges or cuties I don't know what else they call them everywhere else in the world talking itself one of the things that I want to do to prepare these is actually it's little time-consuming but I want to try to get off all the extra little like nasty stuff because I thought about you but I prefer these are gonna be dipped in sugar and then eaten right away I don't want to be eating this and have some like stringy maths just kind of make it an unpleasant experience so personal preference and again then we're gonna stick them on a paper towel and make sure that they are completely dry before we put them in the sugar so fruit prep is an important part of this all right so it looks like our sugar mixture is starting to boil and again we don't want to stir this too much because if you get a lot of sugar on the outside of the bowl and then you keep stirring it and scraping it in that will actually cause problems so I just makes me a little paranoid just to completely leave it so I just usually do just a little swirl not like a full scrape just to keep some movement going oh okay I'm gonna catch up on some comments really fast hello from upstate New York hello what am I making candied strawberries Texas and Michigan Indiana Wow UK Peru nice hammer Malaysia first time watching me live well welcome Kathy Arkansas Iowa Kansas Oklahoma we've got people from everywhere hello Debbie needs to see you Emily [Music] pila from upstate New York Indiana the better soon thank you thank you Leslie that is how you end up doing it the Kiwi Thank You Leslie I'm glad I'm not alone it's yeah we don't have anybody over on YouTube today that is crazy I love watching mixtures boil it's there's just something so pretty about it okay so we're all ready I'm going to tilt this I can see my temperature we're already up to 170 now I will say one of the things when it comes to candy making to be aware of is don't walk away it goes really slow at the beginning and you'll be standing here going one head 111 112 like you'll just be going oh this is taking forever and the second you leave is the second act like jumps up and all of a sudden its way over temperature so definitely stay close it's a little slow going but it gets really really fast as it gets closer to the temperature that you're trying to hit so be aware of that all right so while this is boiling I'm going to now put some of the few fruit on individual skewers we're just going to do like one piece at a time and then I'm going to put some of the fruit on multiple fruits on one skewers make like a little cutoff and the reason that we're making sure to do all of this I was as as soon as the sugar is up to temperature you got to work quickly because it will either open a little sugar for the fan on as soon as it hits the correct temperature you want to work right away so you want to have everything completely ready to go wash dry on the skewers ready for dipping because the moment it hits the right temperature we work quickly because if if you turn off the temperature as you you know you don't want it to go over a temperature then it's going to immediately start cooling down and getting thick and getting difficult to work with if you keep the stove cook top on then it's going to overcook and it's going to kind of change colors and and it's then going to also get thick and difficult to work with and and so really there's kind of a timeframe now if you have I guess if you were doing this on like a if you were making this for a living like on a street cart you would have a way to maintain the perfect temperature so you were going over or under temperature so you could dip for longer but for us home chefs who don't have access to stuff like that it's kind of tricky so one thing that I've seen some people do is they get it to temperature and then they immediately put it in like an ice bath to stop the cooking and that's a great way to go to stop the cooking but it also cools down the sugar syrup so quickly that then you're working with a much thicker sugar syrup which you don't really want to be doing so I don't really do that I've tried it and I haven't been happy with the results they've just gets so thick so fat so usually what I do is I actually start the dipping process just a little bit before the sugar syrup is ready and I turn it off but then after a couple seconds I turn it that owns not a couple seconds but it's kind of hard to explain because looking some sure as I'm dipping and it starts to get a little thick then I turn it on too low to try to to try to keep it closer to that temperature so it's not cooling down too fast so it's kind of a game the other boarder Borneo alligators I get a lot of questions this is one of my most popular blog posts and they get a lot of questions on it on tendecy made like the day ahead because they're looking they're looking to make this and decorate something later no I'm sorry I mean on apples on candied apples you totally can make it the day ahead because the skin of the Apple actually protects the Apple and so it keeps it longer but for these two fresher fruits that don't really have that protection the strawberries immediately get warm and then they shrink and they get juicy and then after a while you have this sugar that's the shape of the old strawberry and then you have this smaller juicy goopy strawberry that's inside it so these are actually one of those things that you serve right away which is one of the reasons that make a great street food in Korea because you immediately dip them hand them over the sugar cools and you can eat them right away but this is not one of those things you can make a day ahead of time this is one less thing you make mmm I would say at the tops and our ahead of time so I have a cake that I like to decorate with these strawberries make it berry cake where I use a mixture of these sugared strawberries are these candied strawberries and sugared fruits and sorry I'm just checking the temperature and even they're like after the photo shoot was done for the cake the strawberries are already really starting to shrink within the shell so this is super fun but it's not necessarily super practical for a lot of other uses this is one of the things that my kids really enjoy because it will do it like I don't know once a month in the summer and we'll set up oh and I never make a big batch of this so usually a big batch person because I like leftovers but for this I never make a super huge batch to make some we dip some and we immediately eat them and enjoy them and and that's kind of it and are they safety later they totally are they're just not quite the same experience once the fruit has started to shrink and the sugars are reacting to the sugar coating it's like that so hopefully I answered all those questions can you add food cut into it cam that is a great question yes you can totally add food coloring to this in fact you can also add flavoring now what you don't want to do is add water based flavor or oil bit you want a candy flavoring there's a lot of different options out there for flavoring make sure you're using one that is specifically made for candy flavoring so that it reacts correctly when I do my candied apples for Halloween I always add black food dye to that to this but again I use candy coloring also there's there's regular food coloring and there's gel food coloring and then there's can be food coloring and I use the gel candy good coloring for that because it is water-based you can use you can use regular food gel but candy gel is just made to react a little better so I use that but when you're working with something like chocolate you have to use like the candy coloring because you don't want to risk the chocolate beeping all right so we are all right we are getting there slow going but it is coming along I'm gonna give it another swirl you guys take a look at this now so you can see now the sugar is completely dissolved and it's totally clear now so now it's really just a matter of bring it up to temperature and if you can see over here on the sides you can see that the like sugar has kind of come up on the side a little bit and Oh hot little bubble pop they got me and you can see over here there's kind of a build up if I would just use my spatula and scrape all of that back into the sugar it would actually ruin the candy coating because this is now cooled and set up and crystallized and if you added back in any you just want to do that so um like I said I swirled this but I never scraped the sides you get super involved with this all right now is a good time to answer some more questions um let's see so can you add flavoring coloring asking a flavoring yes from Kiwi Hillary hi you guys are really quiet today usually we have a ton of questions and comments going on first time watcher Barbara hi welcome Kathy love your hair Thank You Dennis this is expensive nope so to make this coating it is sugar water corn syrup and then whatever fruit you want to dip it in and you can use toothpicks so I like to use the skewers so I'm gonna put this off to the side for a second and we're gonna create our skewers now so one of the other things that I have prepped and ready to go for this because there go ahead once the sugar gets to the right temperature we're gonna work quickly so when everything else prep so the cookie sheet with a Silpat mat inside of it I'm ready to immediately put the fruit down on you can also use parchment paper but I like the Silpat mat better I think it's easier to peel the sugar off on them later so really quickly how long oh okay I am missing something and going on to the comment so I'm just going to know so um kabobs haha sorry brainfart got distracted sorry sugar is up to 220 degrees and like I said we are trying to hit the hard crack stage which is just around 300 degrees Fahrenheit on a sea level but because I am at a high altitude I'm actually going to take it off before that about three about to 85 so what I'm going to take mine off that about 60 more degrees to go so I'm watching that and now we're going to make our skewers so like I said I'm gonna do a couple that are just the fruit themselves just to give it a try I've never actually tried Kiwi before so this will be a fun experiment and again I'm patting both sides of this dry because you want this completely dry to depth and so we're going to do couple solo strawberries now when I'm doing the strawberries by themselves I will actually leave the strawberry with the Leafs on it but if I'm going to skewer the strawberries with some other fruit then I'm going to cut the ends off of it couple ends off of these smaller strawberries to make some kabobs see how that goes and again I have never tried the mandarin oranges too I've done the candy strawberries for years and years and years and years so this will be a fun experiment so we start with the Kiwi start the Kiwi and a strawberry and add a mandarin orange so we're gonna try that as a kebab and see how that does not prepare a couple of those as well okay do the same thing again so let's see we've already answered can you add food coloring yes we can answered flavouring up so if you're going to use flavoring again try to think of the fruits that you're using and what is gonna taste good with them personally I usually just leave it as a plain simple candy coating syrup my personal preference I have used with the strawberries I have used like a lemon or a lime flavored before and I have like that so just kind of your own personal preference and now I'm gonna create there we go I'm going to create a couple of and oranges kabobs just by themselves to see how they do I haven't tried those before so this will be a fun experiment and I think the kids are gonna love these do some more strawberries alright so whoa we are at children three degrees so are there any other questions while I am preparing this looks like we got some hammers which is always fun see I don't know how to get rid of them while I'm filming so you guys are more than welcome to block them or report them yourself you like my hair color thank you so much hello watching from Nova Scotia Canada first time I charged is expensive no hay you love my videos are very informative thank you so much Polly and I appreciate that comment this is gonna be fun going through all these comments later and blocking and reporting alright so we have a couple kebabs we have a couple just fruits by themselves I will say the Kiwi is things though I have it pretty thick it's starting to split on these skewers so you might want to consider toothpicks or thinner skewers if you are going to try this at home alright we are up to the softball stage so we are getting close one more and an orange then we're going to go back through everything and Pat it dry one more time with the with some paper towels yes you definitely don't want these to be in any way wet when you get started oh man I am exhausted I don't know why being sick takes so much out of you but it does an orange you're sure okay so now we have everything that we are going to be trying and I have them all ready to go so that as soon as the sugar is the right time we can get started so now I'm going to take paper towel and make sure that everything because once we put a skewer through this obviously these got a little juicy you should make sure your these are as dry as possible we'll be surprised in just how much liquid can actually be on these just from adding them to these kabobs especially the Kiwis all right have you ever dipped sliced apples I usually I just do whole apples I have done sliced apples again you want to make sure that you you get them completely dry before you try them and that can be a little bit tricky so like if you done have you ever seen those like a little mini Apple bites where you scoop a little bit of Apple out and try to dip it in caramel it's it tends to like just strip right off the Apple kind of the same thing with these so I think the oranges are going to work just fine I think I know the strawberries are gonna work because I've done that many many times the Kiwis are the only ones that I'm a little bit concerned of and weary up I've seen them done which is why I decided to try them i think grapes obviously would be perfect because they also have the skin the Kiwis are going to be the trickiest ones out of this whole bunch and sliced apples would be the same way because of that raw open fruit that you're then putting in the sugar um it's going to cause the sugar to react a little bit that we're the sugar syrup that we're working on and it's also going to I'm not necessarily stick to the skin the same way okay we are getting close you're at 260 about 20 more degrees um reported Thank You nicoleff videos nice okay oops all right so does anybody have any other questions because we are all prepped we have all of our we have all of our fruit and our kabobs ready to go we have everything patted dry we have the sugar coming up to temperature and you never know how long it's going to take this is one of those recipes that I can't really say oh this is only going to take you 15 minutes because honestly it really depends on a lot of factors one your altitude like we've talked about at the beginning of the video but also the weather that where you're like right now when the barometer pressure changes that can cut wreak havoc on candy-making and when I lived in Arizona I never had trouble candy-making one because at sea levels all the recipes were great and too because it's so dry and there's never any storms and the barometer practically never changes like it is great for candy making I thought oh I didn't this is before I had done a lot of research and knew a lot about what I was doing when I lived there and I'm like Bing I just became the world's best candy maker in caramel maker I'm a rock star and then and then I moved again no sudden I moved someplace that had changes in weather and was a higher altitude and all of a sudden all my like I have a thank you candy maker went out the window and that's when I really started to do research and learn about what was causing the problem some so Utah has been a really hard but he's still there for candy making especially you taught in the spring because the weather changes so fast on North Carolina was another hard place because even though it was closer to sea level you constantly be getting storms and no storms and sunny and rainy and changes the barometer are really a so there's a lot of factors that go into this so you can't just say you can't do make this and create this on a specific timeline and give yourself a super super strict deadline that's why this is one of those things that's super fun to make with my kids as an after-school snack when we get a batch of strawberries my other favorite way to eat strawberries oh we're getting close sore 270 my other favorite way to eat strawberries is actually with sour cream and brown sugar that's my kids other favorite so um so I how do you guys like to eat strawberries I also have a toffee dip on the blog that I love for apples and strawberries as well it's cream cheese and brown sugar and toffee bits and it is so good so anyway oh it looks like you're having I see the problem that we're having with YouTube video for some reason it has gone private which is not supposed to be you gotta love that see if we can fix that I could not figure out why nobody was watching okay so and we are at temperature so like I said you want to work really quickly so I'm gonna bring my sugar back over and okay so I'm turning off the temperature because we have hit the temperature that we are looking for so the first thing that I'm going to do is I'm going to tilt this over a little bit so I get a little bit more depth over here and I'm going to immediately dip my strawberry in and then let it drip off a little bit and kind of turn it around and immediately place it over on myself hat match something let's do that again kind of tilt it so I get a little bit of depth right here throw my sugar in it and shake it out I'm gonna try the mandarin oranges I'm gonna dip it seem to get that last one there we go shake it off shake it on both sides put it on this help out Matt so this again there we go like I said we want to work quickly all right now let's try one of the Kiwis so dipped inside let's see how this goes it looks like it's sticking to it pretty good but as you can see how the strings are getting thicker that's because this is starting to pull off so I'm going to [Music] give it another minute and I'm going to turn it down to low Oh same thing again okay all right so now we're gonna try the bigger kebabs now this is gonna be a little bit trickier so again I make I used the wider pan so I could do this a little bit better and stick the whole kebab down in it that actually worked pretty good and I didn't burn my fingers so that's a win-win the paper around the Silpat mat okay I'm having a hard time getting this Kiwi completely covered because well I burned myself Oh myself okay I'll run my finger under some cold water uh fast I'm gonna have a blister on that fingertip okay last skewer give this one a try it again okay a little bit more careful oh and I'm actually going to get out a spoon because I'm having a hard time getting this last one covered I'm gonna take a spoon and pour some sugar on this see if that will help get this last one a little bit more covered and you can see why you want to have everything pre-prepped to get started with this all right and shake it off yeah put on this up Batman okay oh now I have stringy sugar everywhere I'm that pretty nice trigger string okay aside unplug this and bring the self confidence you can see everything alright so we did two strawberries to minotaur just yours three Kiwis skewers and then a couple of these so now if I immediately rip these off the the Silpat mats the sugar this was the very first one that I did and you can see it actually came off really good you can see the texture from the mat right there and can you hear this let's turn this off turn the fan off now we don't have heat anymore so it's a nice hard shell this is the first thing that we did so it's actually a nice thin shell - those are always the best ones that early ones um let's see if one of these ready whoops I put these little too close together on the mats and now they're stuck together um yeah I'm gonna be able to break that here we go alright this one is still warm I would let this set up just a little bit longer but it is hard already okay so then the next ones that we did were these Kiwis so let's oh that does not want to come off alright like I thought this one is because of the juice from the Kiwi can you see that hold on let's try this other angle it's hard not quite as hard the top is completely hard has a nice crunch to it but it's definitely already gooping on the inside I could see how the fruit is already can you see that dripping and pulling away let's see this one right here I actually made the mistake of trying to lift up and readjust while it was setting and so you can see the sugar on this one totally already came off but so the Kiwis like I assumed you can I don't know if you can see that this is already has like little juice running all around it the Kiwis are definitely the least they're gonna hold on the least and this is one that I did closer to the end so you can see that this had a lot of extra sugar on it because the sugar was starting to cool and get thick so those earlier ones are best this is one that's nice to do with the reason that I like to do this with all my kids is because I'll quickly make the sure syrup and then we'll all dip our sugars at the same two hours just our strawberry the same time so we can actually get quite a few done this is one of those things that's nice to have helping hands are okay so let's try our skewers now see how they did here is the hoop they're kind of stuck together I'm having a harder time getting there we go okay so it's actually turned out pretty good because this Kiwi was the strawberry lifted up the Kiwi so I think this would work better when you like instead of putting on a Silpat mat if you like had something you're putting it in like this like the street vendors do because then the sugar would just drip down this way you don't have to either so this one where I had the strawberry at the bottom so the Kiwi at the bottom actually worked out really well because then the whole thing was actually fairly flat so the whole Kiwi is covered really nicely but you can see the Kiwis already dripping dripping juice out this is one that we spoon stuff onto it and again it had a flatter surface down here so that's nice so if you are going to put this on a parchment paper make sure that this is a little bit on the flatter side you'll have an easier time with this don't get this big huge gap like we did on this one all right so candied strawberry the classic the one that I make all the time it's beautiful its shiny this is strawberry season beginning now so this is a great way to do this but it's definitely fun to change it up I think my kids are really gonna enjoy this I think grape sort of worked out really really well and so did this man oranges Luke come on focus there we go these are actually turned out really well under quite pretty like thanks a lot all right so the longer you wait the longer it takes the thicker your candy coating is gonna be you can see how thick this one is versus how thin this first one is that we got come on so we got first this is actually nice and thin so that's why I usually stick with the strawberries I usually have like 30 on skewers all at once and then as soon as the sugar is ready my kids and I we all dip and and do this with our personal paper they're actually like a strawberry sucker lollipop because there's the sugar coating but it's real strawberry in sizes so my kids like to eat them so now I get to try them mm-hmm lumps a little bit warm I don't think I burn my tongue okay so you can see the candy coating shouldn't be too thick here's a chunk of it so it's just like making and eating a sucker I would stay away from strawberry flavoring and let the strawberry itself be the flavor for this um a big bite um but a complimentary flavor like lemon or citrus I'm like that would be really nice but I've never bothered I've always just done a plain and let the strawberry is stuff speak for itself so all right let's try one of the mandarin oranges now I haven't done this one before no but now I have a mouthful of sugar again alright I'm also probably enough sugar for me when I'm not feeling well anyway um oh yeah okay so I that is that is it that's how easy they are to make like I said it's a really fun after-school activity with me and my kids that we like to do in the spring and early summer you can see that there's a lot of endless possibilities like I said I would probably stay away from the fruits that are sliced just because it's gonna be a lot trickier and this is already because of the timing and the speed and the temperature it's dirty just tricky enough that I would stick with things that have skins like the strawberries minded oranges and grapes just especially when you're working with kids just for the ease of the lack of frustration for adults oh look at this one we're already getting super goopy on this for adults I think the key would be would be really really fun um but I don't know if you really want to deal with something that is going to go juicy and goopy that quickly but anyway that is it next week what I'm gonna go next thing I'm going to be doing my almond poppy seed bundt cake and the week after that I'm much are going to be on vacation for spring break so I'm going to try to go live making my peanut butter cookies with my kids at the beach house that we're staying at somebody can't promise anything but I'm going to try to go live so again next Tuesday at 4:30 p.m. mountain time 3:30 Pacific 6:30 Eastern and I'm gonna stay on for just a couple minutes and finish answering questions so thanks for watching and don't forget to like the page or subscribe on youtube so that you don't miss anything in the future so alright really quickly thank you this is easy to do they don't keep long though I know they really don't they're gorgeous to look at they're really fun to eat but they don't keep long so this is definitely one of those things that's like I said it's great for a snack the at the time you're making it try smokiness cures before using them if I if I'm gonna be grilling my skewers I do soak them but for this the skewers don't get in the hot syrup so I don't bother soaking but you totally can but I wouldn't want them to be in any way slippery because of my fingers and grabbing him stuff like that cakepop standard be good Nicola that's exactly what I was trying to say you are definite right this is so much so much sights so much fan comments it's hard to see the real ones this week you like to dip your strawberries and cream cheese and marshmallow cream for shopper tipping that sounds really good Cynthia insulted karma Oh Nicolo you speak my language called caramel anything is pretty much my love language alright I think I think I caught up with all the actual legit questions I'm gonna go get on my computer right now and block all the spammers thanks for being patient through that that's when it would be nice to have like somebody behind the scenes here to do that but this was a quick one I hope you enjoyed it candied strawberries like I said are one of the top blog posts on my blog everybody loves them they're just so pretty and so fun to make and I hope you give them a try and if you do let me know what you think so yeah that's it this is my short video this week so thank you so much for joining me thanks for watching and have a great week", "s6wv6AtOTbo": "Hello and welcome to lofty pursuits in\npublic displays the confection in Tallahassee Florida Greg is doing the narration and Jake is doing the subtitles. The candy I'm going to be making today is  sugar free Sour cherry. As I pour the hot candy onto the table let me tell you how unbelievably hot it is. This is hotter than sugar by 25 degrees F (4C). It does not seem like a lot , but ti is. \n The candy is been flavored with a natural cherry oil. Unlike most cherry candy, this does not taste like cough syrup. Also it is a great flavor for masking the flavor of the sugar free part of  the candy. I thought there would be two parts of The flavor to cover.The front of mouth taste, and that I covered with the cherry oil Then the back of mount flavor I thought I could cover mostly with a good sour. To do that I added this citric acid. It's trickier to add acid to isomalt because everything is hotter. And this citric acid while harder to add  gives this candy a crisp sour tart flavor just like you'd\nexpect from a sour cherry. Sour Cherry isan American tradition it's the most common cherry here in North America and it's known for being made into\ncherry pies and things like that but its history is ancient it was first discovered by Roman soldiers when they were on duty near the Black Sea. They  found this cherry\ngrowing in towns along the Black Sea and they brought it back\nto Rome and eventually the cherry was called the Montmorency cherry. It was  named\nafter a region of France even though it didn't come from that region in France. It was just the flavor I was going for and I'm happy how it came out. This candy is sugar-free, and as such it's not made of sugar it's\nmade of isomalt. Isomalt is a substitute a type of sugar alcohol and is a sugar substitue used primarily for its sugar like properties it has little or no impact on\nblood sugar levels and it does not stimulate the release of insulin so\npeople who aren't supposed to eat high levels of sugar this candy is good for\nisomalt is also about 1/2 the sweetness of sugar so to tweak the sweetness up a\nbit to match what we expect a hard candy to taste like we had a little bit of\nsucralose and we don't need to add much sucralose because sucralose is between\n300 and 1000 times as sweet as sugar. Since I only needed a tiny amount I used a very accurate scientific scale to get the proportions rights. So we build on the sweetness of the isomalt with the sucralose and we count on the isomalt to behave like what you expect hard candy to behave like. Neither of these mate rials promote tooth decay or effects insulin levels. I heard from so many of you that you wanted to try our candy by could not. iI's a little different to work\nwith than regular sugar it's a lot hotter when I pour it and it also sort\nof behaves more like plastic than clay so I have to get the temperature just\nright now that it's adjusted we're gonna cut off pieces and we're gonna feed it\nthrough our drop roller this little machine was made in the late 1870s and\nthis particular machine was owned by the A Cincinnati candy company. Greg\nwas able to acquire this piece of equipment because of a Kickstarter\ncampaign we did and you our fans allowed us to get it.  I want to thank all of you\nfor the support you've given us over the years this has been an amazing to get to do what we love, and have a lot of fun. All this equipment is on display and our store and is used in our store in almost a daily basis if you ever make it to tell a see Florida\nplease come on by we're located right off i-10 on the Thomasville Road exit\nand you can come and see us we open at 7:00 a.m. when we start serving\nbreakfast and we start serving ice cream at about noon and we go til 10:00 p.m.\nmost nights so you can come in we're usually open we're not making candy all\nthe time but sometimes we are and we love it when fans can catch us and can\nsee us make candy now all that's left to do is to split up\nthese sheets of candy into individual pieces and we do that by making the\ncandy live up to its name what's its name you ask fruit drops and that's what\nwe're gonna do you know it's more fun than popping bubble wrap if you want to\ntry this candy for yourself just go over to our website www.PD.net thank you very much for watching and\nthank you for letting us do what we love to do because you know candy always\ntastes better when made with a little love", "6fC-r0BE9f0": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you you [Music]", "95RzByjout4": "right now if you saw my white chocolate but that video there was like a week when I watched that video like every if you well I think that's gonna be it for this video make sure comment let me know what you'd like to see upcoming next thank you make sure to subscribe", "Z2-64BHNNIc": "Hey guys, it's Ro, welcome to another Nerdy Nummies I got so many requests from you guys to make another recipe from the Nerdy Nummies cookbook So that's exactly what we're gonna be doing today Gems and stones can be found in so many different video games including one of my favorite games, Zelda You collect a little rupees, so today we are gonna be making rupee hard candies The recipe is a simple hard candy recipe, which you can dye to be different colors And we're gonna be using the mold from my baking line We're gonna be using this shape this gem shape is a hexagon which means it has six sides And it's the most similar looking to a rupie. I just love this gem mold It's so cute And it has shapes that I have been wanting for a really long time. And side note, you guys our swirl silicone mold was trending number one on Amazon for molds. If you want to help this mold become number one mold on Amazon, I'll put a link down below because if this becomes number one then the poo mold becomes number two. (laughing) In the book, I dyed the rupies red blue and green because I felt those were the most iconic But I really love this recipe because you can make them any color you want. Today, we're gonna be making the same hard candies with the same colors, but I'm gonna be using different flavors Let's get started! The things you'll need to make these hard candies will be: a mold I'm using the mold from my baking line And I'm only gonna be using the hexagon shapes. For the recipe, you'll need three cups of sugar 3/4 cup water, 1 cup of light corn syrup, 1 teaspoon of blueberry oil. 1 drop a blue dye 1 teaspoon of strawberry oil, one drop of red dye, one teaspoon of green apple oil, and one drop of green dye now. Let's put it all together! The ingredients in front of me is enough to make 3 different colors I like to make mine one at a time because when you're working with hot candy I don't like to separate it and move it around too much because it's just so hot the first thing that we're gonna do is Take 1/3 of our sugar water and corn syrup and pour them into a pot. Pour our sugar, that means we'll need 1 cup then. We'll need a quarter cup of water and a third cup of corn syrup Woah! (laughing) There we go! Then we add the one drop of food coloring I'm gonna start with green because I'm wearing a green shirt and the flavoring that we're using is apple And I just love apple hard candy so start with the good stuff. It's all good, but this is just like my favorite Use a toothpick to scoop, it in mix together until all the sugar is wet now We'll take this sauce pot over to the stove. Place your pot onto the stove turn the heat to medium and allow the sugar to completely dissolve. Once dissolved, place the candy thermometer into your pot and cook the candy until it reaches 275 degrees. Then, turn off the stove heat and take your candy syrup back to the baking station. Once you take your hard candy off the stove, pour immediately into a heat safe container with a pour spout at the end. And before we pour the candy into the mold add your Flavoring I'm using green apple! Whisk together work that flavoring in there. Oh yeah! Now pour your hot candy syrup into your mold and be careful because it's very hot I'm only filling them about 2/3 because I want them to be a little bit more bite-sized. Once you've poured the candy, let them sit for 45 minutes to harden. While this sits, I'm gonna make a couple more batches using our other colors. You can do it this way if you have multiple molds otherwise just wait till they've hardened and repeat I've given the candies plenty of time to harden. Pop them out, it's super easy This is one of the reasons why I love Silicone molds because they're bendy! Tug this way, tug, tug, tug, stretch it out, and the other way, then flip it upside down and pop 'em out! These look amazing! Oh my gosh you guys! Now do this for the rest of your candy Tada! There you have it here are the rupee hard candies that we made today. The recipe is from the Nerdy Nummies cookbook But, we switched the flavorings. We made green apple flavored, blueberry, and strawberry. One of the things that I love about hard candy recipes, is it's very customizable. You can make your hard candies any colors you'd like and any flavor. growing up one of my favorite candies were Jolly Ranchers So I love making a homemade hard candy recipe. Easy-peasy bite-sized and delicious! omnomnomnomnom I'll be taking lots of pictures and posting the recipe on rosannapansino.com Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter, so you can check it out there, and if you guys make these little hard candies Please take a picture and send it to me. I love seeing your baking creations. It just makes me happy! It makes my day! And if you have any other ideas for any other Nerdy Nummies please let me know leave me a comment down below, and I will do my best to make it happen! Alright thanks again, you guys, bye-bye and now I have a candy for me! I'm gonna have a green apple one. Growing up, my favorite Jolly Ranchers were green apple and watermelon. Let me know in the comments below what your favorite Jolly Rancher flavor is", "yWvNBBq1Av4": "hi everybody its flower child and I'm coming to you tonight to show you how I make my hard candies with cannabutter so in the pot here nonstick pot I have a quarter cup of cata butter it's probably medium strength medium to strong kinda sorta depending on your preference I like the stronger that way you don't need so many candies anyway I'm getting ahead of myself so here we go quarter cup of can of butter in the pot and melting yay so we wait for that to go down then you have half a cup of corn syrup I use be high so there's half a cup of corn syrup 3/4 cup of white sugar here are my molds that I will be using and I pour my hard candy mixture in here and plop it into the mold you'll see that as well so I'm just gonna show you again you will need a quarter cup of butter 1/2 a cup of beehive corn syrup or whatever corn syrup you're gonna use I prefer The Beehive you can use your cheaper brine it really doesn't matter and then 3/4 cup of white sugar so I'm gonna go ahead and pour in the corn syrup I wish I had an extra hand but I don't so do the corn syrup I'll scrape that out in a second and you're putting your 3/4 cup and I like to just sprinkle it over I don't like to plop it all in in one little flop like I just did so you stir it all in it looks so good smells yummy too nice and sweet so you stir that around make sure it's all mixed up and there's no clumps or anything it will melt down with the heat regardless anyway do that and we need a thermometer a candy thermometer we go up to 300 degrees and this thermometer which takes about 15 minutes on the stove I like to have my temperature at 4 degrees you don't want to have it the stove too hot cause you will burn it and I have done that before which it's a total waste of ingredients but anyway sorry the boys heard a noise and like all boys do they mouth off so anyway again you will need 1/2 a cup of corn syrup 3/4 cup of white sugar and you will need 1/4 cup of cannabutter so the all the mixture is in there the stove is on I'm gonna put in my thermometer my candy thermometer and we're gonna wait for that to go up to 300 degrees which is perfect for hard candy so I'm gonna pause it and let it go anyway this goes for anywhere 12 to 15 minutes and it'll be at 300 degrees and tonight we are going to make root beer yummy so I'm gonna pause it now ok friends see you soon hi I just want to show you how it's cooking and it does bubble a fair bit but you just let that go be careful again that it is on a low temperature that you are not going to burn your ingredients you do not want to do that you want to cook it slowly but at a high enough temperature that it is going to boil like this so your eyes just above 250 sorry I had to look at it if my glasses I need better glasses so anyway it's up to 50 you're gonna pause it again - you're almost ready to pull out the thermometer and shut the oven or the stove and at that moment I put in a teaspoon full teaspoon of the root beer flavoring I am NOT going to show you myself doing that I'm the only one doing this and this stuff is quite hot so I will show you once the mixture is ready I put in a tablespoon or teaspoon sorry of the root beer flavoring in the pot stir it around then I pour all the mixture into my funnel and then I drop little by little obviously to make sure I get it in there enough and not too much in forgive the left side of the sink I have a few dishes in there I did not finish yet but I figured once I'm done all this I'll have to finish the dishes anyway so we're going to do that I am going to pause it and do the mixture and put it in the final so that I can put it into the mold okay so I have put them all in the moles if you are a little overflowed but I'm not gonna test them I'm just gonna leave them the way they are so there we go usually they do if I write on my measurements out I normally fill them all out but I was a little generous and the other ones so it doesn't matter but now I stick them in the fridge for about um you know about 15 minutes 15 20 minutes and they should be all solidified and hard and ready to be bagged up and put in the freezer so there you have it and they look good can't wait to have any but I hope you enjoyed this little instruction instructional video on how I make my canna heart candies so enjoy your day folks hope you enjoyed the video take care love and honey's flower child signing off have a great day stay true and stay unique bye Mase hope you enjoyed the video my friend", "0gUS_AFxV-w": "Welcome back guys. Today we're bringing you another lovely animal, the most requested design from our last video's comments. An Akita Dog. Now we add the colour. At this stage, the candy is still extremely hot. You can see when we put the colour in, it steams out the water right away. Now we're pouring it onto the cooling table, so it cools down to a temperature for us to work with. As you can see now, the candy is super soft, that means it is still very hot. So we need to spread it out on the table once in a while, so that it cools down evenly, and fast. Now we're going to add in the citric acid. Today's flavour is tangerine, which requires quite a bit of acid. From the previous videos, people ask us where does the acid come from? It comes from a well known fruit, lemon. So now we're cooling it off on the granite table. This table serves to cool it off evenly. While it cools off we have to spread it out and fold it nonstop so that is cools down evenly. Many people ask us from previous videos, do the colours have the same flavours or different flavours? The answer to that question is, each batch has the same flavour - however, All the candies in the shop have different flavours. Here we go! Right now I'm stretching this big piece of candy. We have to stretch it until it's white. In order to do that we have to stretch this 120 times, sometimes 200 times! By doing this, we fold little air bubbles into the candy. What the air bubbles do is allow the light to reflect and make the candy more opaque and white. It also adds a great texture to the candy. It makes it easy to chew and crunchy. That's why our hard candies are chewable. How I will put this piece of candy on the hot table, where we shape the candy and maintain its temperature. Look how white it is now! One,\ntwo, three! This is a much smaller piece than earlier, none the less, we still have to stretch it 120 times. For smaller sizes like these, we don't need to do it on the hook. We will do it by hand on the table. We will start off today by making the eye of the dog. The upper part of the dog is orange coloured. Now we're putting on water. Water is like super glue for candies. That's what we use to stick one piece to another. As you know, the Akita dogs, it looks like they have a little eyebrow on top of their eyes. So, this is what I'm going to make right now. So from one eye, we stretch it really really long, then cut it in the middle. That gives us two identical eyes, so we don't have to make the eye twice. Now we're going to assemble the two eyes together. We got to make sure we put them together with the right orientation. You don't want one eye up, and one eye down! So now, we're making the nose! So now that we have the nose, we will attach a mouth underneither it. Now we're going to put the mouth and the eye piece together. We will now wrap around the entire face. These triangles are going to be used for the ears of the dog. Excellent! Good! Perfect! Now this is where the magic happens. How we make this giant piece into smaller candies. Now we have to chop the candies one by one. Thank you for watching. If you like the video, give us a thumbs up! To thank you for all the support you gave us during the year, we would like to choose ten lucky winners for the candy we just made today. To find out how to win, visit our facebook and instagram page. Thank you guys for watching.

away oh ggs", "NEwLhK5bh3A": "heyo this is John trying to make a batch of hard candy and I still take a video of it again this is uh my attempt at a floral designs a traditional Japanese style of Kintaro on me I hope I said that right I don't really know for sure but basically it's a floral design inside a clear wrap so it gets a bit of three dimensionality to it and hopefully it look nice these are small batch card candies that I'm making meaning that the whole size of the batch is four cups of sugar one and a third cups of glucose and one cup of water so it's pretty small it makes this extra challenging for these complicated designs the candy gets cold really fast I think it's hot really fast so it makes it difficult to maintain temperature that you can do more easily when you have a big large batch anyway nevertheless we'll see how it turns out I hope it turns out okay and we'll walk through it right now I'm just adding the color as the candy cools trying to a boil off water in the dye or in the coloring and then also to try to maintain an even temperature by pulling the cool edges into the hot center once that's complete we can start working on pulling it which is what I'm doing now which throughout the mix obviously I'm gonna skip that for the clear because I want that to try to be transparent and the candy I'm just for I tried this a color pattern as a white petal with a purple perimeter and a yellow Center and hopefully that looks okay and we'll see what it turns out it turns out you'll see me manipulating quite a bit of the hot plate here which is just a pancake griddle that I use and I'll you let me take the candy off and on as it gets too hot or too cool but the idea is to try to maintain sort of that playdough type consistency so I can do some molding right now I'm put any little white to the purple color I thought it was a little bit too dark it's hard to judge sometimes with these paste dyes to get the color just right nevertheless here we go now I'm gonna start making the petals so I think I picked six to try to make a six petal flower and each one will be actually white with a full perimeter on the outside and so that's kind of what I'm working on now so first I'm gonna try to make the purple white our combination and then I'll cut it up into six units that I can use to make each one of the petals I also see me rotate the candy every once in a while that's just because it's obably hot on one side and cool on the other I do have a heat lamp this time which sort of helps maintain temperature from above and below but still pretty challenging and I'm gonna try and make each one of these a triangle shape to reflect what a petal might look like so four petals do not overlap with each other um get up to already make the the first here I'll put a bit of clear color in between each one I'll be that well define the edges of the petal in the candy obviously you've notice I've sped this up quite a bit just to try to make the vehicle by faster I'll slow it down a little bit when we get to the final candies to see what they look like but like I said this is my first time I have hopefully have a high hopes but we'll see how it turns out if that by if you're curious and so this is a raspberry flavor it's a flavor I had on hand and this is sort of a trial batch so hopefully it'll taste okay that's a particular mixture it's not it's pretty popular now I'm making the center of the flower I decided to take use yellow and I just wrapped it in a bit of purple so it'd have a purple edge around it now and I'm assembling now the layers of the petals around that yellow core this is the hardest thing to judge size-wise to say do I have enough tell us to cover the entire perimeter and now I'm gonna stretch out the clear and that'll be the wrap for the whole structure as long as I work hot everything sticks together nicely if it cools a little bit sometimes you could put a little water in between the edges and help sort of glue it together didn't have to here so now I've got my chorus cylinder and this one I'll use to stretch out and actually make the small candies which is what I'm doing now is just trying to maintain the cylinder and start stretching it out to pull ropes out essentially if I can then cool down and cut into candies I usually get about six of these out of our exercise [Applause] see I turn light up the light off above because I'd now be trying to cool things down so I don't need the extra heat all right now I'm gonna spend about 10 minutes rolling this candy back and forth to try to maintain its shape as it cools down and then once it gets cool enough I could start breaking up into small bite-sized games I guess you don't technically bite them but you know small candies [Applause] I'm just getting set up here I'm going to turn the camera around here in just a minute so you can kind of see that last piece but really for me having some phases to wait for this to cool that chop them up it's one of the hardest thing factors product pull these a little too early they're a little bit a little softer to cut but they still worked okay I'll see what they look like not bad for my first first try at this I do literally like to clear rap because it gives a lot of dimension and it's hard to see with the camera but you kind of see the edge of how the design is it the middle of the candy which is kind of cool there's just a couple or picked up to show you what they looked like", "VY8q0hN6KwA": "so I'm rich are tell on professor faculty member here at the University of Wisconsin huge candy signs so we make some heart candy today this is a mixture of granulated sugar you can see the white stuff here we have corn syrup in here as well and then we have water to help dissolve the sugar we're just gonna dissolve all the sugar and make sure that there are no sugar crystals in here because eventually we're gonna make heart candy which is a sugar glass so we don't want crystals so we've reached the boiling point now and so essentially we're gonna follow the boiling point elevation curve up so in making hard candy we're going to boil up to what's called the hard crack stage where temperatures are on the order of 300 degrees Fahrenheit and water contents are down around 2 or 3 percent so we're now at the 233 degrees fahrenheit range and and this is where we have the thread state and what that means is the viscosity is high higher that high enough that when you pour this into cold water it forms threads as it falls through there but the viscosity is still low enough that those threads dissolve fairly quickly so we're now at about 240 degrees and this is according to the candy thermometer where we find the firm ball state and so we boiled enough water that that when you pour this into when you drop it into cold water it forms a coherent mass that you can take out and form it into a ball that can still be manipulated so it's plastic enough to be malleable but it's still a firm ball I can hold its shape okay and we're at about 298 now and and so I'm going to stop it and take it off the heat so we're now going to take this over to the cold table and pour it out and start the next stage of the process so at this point we've poured it onto the cold table and it's starting to cool you can see that as it cools it becomes more plastic more firm we have some color granules and we'll add those in here some flavor so we're gonna add a little bit of lemon flavoring to this and then we're gonna add a little bit of acid as well so right now we're in the stage where it's becoming a plastic mass and we're just trying to get it into a shape that it will go through the rollers it still has enough heat in it and the viscosity is low enough that it starts to flow so far to form it now it would form but then it would quickly deform just like it's doing here so this is just about at the point where where we can form it it's viscous enough that it's not flowing very quickly yet it's still plastic if it enough that we're going to be able to get it through the the rollers and and turn it into a nice candy [Music] so as you can see we're sending this plastic mass through these drop rollers they fill into the shapes and make the drop shaped candy so now our lemon drops have solidified enough to reach room temperature where now they're in the form of a sugar glass so this is just like window glass except it's made of sugar molecules not of silica but now because it's in a sugar glass I can drop this onto the tray and it's going to shatter it'll shatter along the webbing here or leaving behind some intact lemon drops so at this point we have lemon drops but they have all these sharp edges on them still so the next step in the process would be to put them into some kind of tumbling drum to smooth out the edges [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "Kl1OdIVjsyg": "shut some or two and a half doing the cuddle because there's a lot of orange yeah otherwise it would go off onto the table then you got an orange marbled team chase it around with the candy cheese or something a whole thing yeah I just don't think an orange peel it's good day hmm yeah okay take your stick out noise for all the red-green fans yeah that's think kind of far away you don't inhale orange into your lungs it's true yeah and you got that much anyway yeah oh it's not so bad when you splat down yeah but you wish you could swash on that no huh Kaddi yeah was your date coming down yes she should be coming down any minute yeah my little update he for Cheerios real funny happy are you married I'm married okay I thought you're Steve okay ready oh he's hoping you'd ask there we go orange you glad orange you glad that nice it's all frothy mm-hmm can you say frothy frothy the Stockman roughly the folds fold in [Music] who's playing the foosball today Miami and Pittsburgh oh it's a college town yeah it's a college game City College games all afternoon and night and one tonight or a couple time here we call Terry no I guess here we go it's an intercom ready to get the hard job as a supervisor huh somebody has to be in are you writing down dad what time is what time is it no no you did it didn't you see how many badges left doing orange shots oh we can make up one more batch those all air bubbles it's actually oil bubbles suppose from das orange they've already been added the Flavor Flav now the neat thing about this is I don't have to change the flavor all over the table he don't have to be a flavor saver literally a favorite shape itself that's what I call my mustache meet the flavor savor gosh did you save any flavor yesterday yeah what you save baby baby baby for later mmm-hmm one o'clock so there's tomorrow flavors be easily be done with this by I think you a330 hmm cuz then I can pack some up and put it on the shelf I just wish I knew somebody with a camera that could take a picture of that pile when it's all mixed up with a pretty cool shot and every batch is different so this won't be yeah and that the batch we're doing today will be different from the one we did we're like what two weeks ago one week ago this and usually yeah usually you guys only do one one day of hard job yeah and then it sold out in like what two weeks maybe less is the interweb people the interweb people I liked a lot but if you could take us still yeah that would be swell cuz you're the guy how'd you know I have a camera looking right at me see you had to take things are not moving pictures you take still pictures no I can't stand still for you well be accurate representational like all ours well you did that a purpose on purpose fishing for compliments we better try really hard then hey Brad to the bone I'm gonna take my stride how do you feel that I just cleaned these petals off to the tune of jingle bells okay let's see how much color I can get on the table this time choppers got month did this duck yeah you're right it will hmm I didn't wrong this time I hope so okay if I need any tech support did you get left and right sock on today I got check my feet first [Music] you're good good things don't get sugar good thing boy boy thank you didn't get away from you and every done I mean it all hard candy yes no chocolate we mean it oh yeah except for Saturday yeah that's already been oh yeah and then maybe like another day next but then that's it oh yeah are you guys still doing more peanut brittle okay then the only reason we didn't do more recently is because we don't have anyone to put it hmm don't have any room to put those big cases so we're gonna pack that up because basically we made three batches we solved that already huh so make three more but we knew we had to make more don't don't see chocolate-covered peanut brittle because then that's all they're gonna want cuz that's like the best thing ever it's true but don't talk about it cuz some think you should take it hopefully by the time you see this vid it'll be made yeah they're gonna want that for sure mm-hmm I bet last year normally we do like a half a batch covering chocolates to say 17 pounds ish this year we measure just do a full batch not mess around cuz if Craig does a video about it actually if you are out of town I'll just do an iPhone video yeah and what do I put that in the drop box sure email to me video will drive I think can hold up to 10 to 15 gigabytes and I think email isn't gonna handle that much well I think if you try to email it'll automatically sent to Google Drive if you try to do it through your Gmail account okay so Senate through G that makes sense because I already be on my iPhone anyway yeah yep until you do it and then I'll be able to edit it on my new laptop that's coming in today yep and when I'm out of town I can still work on the youtubes I love my job well I think you probably love your boss the best yeah you're the best boss you ever had mm-hmm you really get you yeah I really do and I don't mean to get all sappy but thank you thank you guys for watching all my ads and whatnot because if it wasn't for them I wouldn't be able to do what I do that's true you'd have to go to work where you wear pants yeah you know hey I'm wearing pants cause it's cold it's only because I have to shoot a video and I'm just adding and why I'm not going anywhere today yeah that is a big strength you can make a two-tone snap that was plenty joke I don't think dad got it what he's ignoring it's kids busy working wasn't hearing was listening I wasn't listening for what I was hearing the size of this one is that supposed to go in the hookers the other one beside whatever Oh try to take it easy and you Steve do you make anything out of it any shapes I'm gonna try to do one live never done before squid start yes Wow the leg Patrick yeah that's a good thumbnail it could be a turtle - what do you say a ghost to be a ghost yes yes alright where I put them hmm that's fine I just wish I figure out you're gonna be on the hook yeah that's all Bolger wasn't ready yet you never gonna be on the hook all right so I'll go downstairs to make sure the none shall pass hey we're on the hook right now so once we get off the hook you guys can go pass the stairs oh you guys can come down here and look at it oh yeah we just we just can't go pass through here cuz the candy is very hot we don't want to burn you guys and we don't want to mess with the candy oh yeah we're shooting a video for the youtubes do you guys mind be annihilated and I'm 1 in 9 States oh my god so you do that by my hand I see a lot of they do it would like machines right here crisscross and stuff wow that's cool go at em machine the thing is what you're thinking of right yeah yeah we wish we had one yeah sure dad does especially right now right you got teleplay Brutus I'm gonna face cinnamon sniff the air oh yeah boy check the flavors in there yeah their most recent one yeah can you dance sentiment or some sort of spice but we did do a bunch of spices before this one this is a fruit flavor it's it's a flavor really okay I'll let you near the tablet orange cream maybe at orange yeah Ranjha - do you need a tap there Steve yes okay I guess I can take it off all right you guys are free to leave the stairs Stryper cute oh you guys some walk over here to whatever whatever angle you guys want to see from my gesture I just need a space to go on here just those things that doesn't carried away a little bit yeah thank you really he can't handle it anyway so you put one of them on the side and one of them kind of like on the point yeah though you always do know what you want Hey they do what they want yeah he's an adult allegedly very orange and getting the candy canes would be made the same way and said of a chopper you just use those scissors to chop it off and then you have somebody over here just make a hook I'm just gonna put it in to exit all that stopping it doesn't matter if they got mixed in with the other ones and try one in a minute it's a little bit hot you guys think would be more high-tech than this upstairs with like oh they're making candy downstairs Brenda go soon yeah you guys ever been down here before I have when I was like you guys come pick up school tours I'm sort of the school tour yeah didn't you say when you were little you would comment school tours I convinced my one of my teachers in ninth grade different actually came those for a food nutrition class I came to my house for a field I did like almost every year in elementary school okay I started going there in 2010 is right after you left okay I had a couple friends kinesiology okay so the safe to say and he hasn't changed for a while hey if it's not broke don't fix it oh yeah yeah I just broke it like the last couple of videos this might turn this on yeah you got like 10 things anybody hey put some gloves on you guys want trying on no yeah it's ready these are still warm warm yeah not gonna it's not hot but it's still very good never had warm hard candy before [Music] all right thanks a line that's come down yeah that was fun thank you holiday thank you there are like adults in a candy store all funny the last time these blades were sure they don't need to be okay yeah the guy who does it with cart candy the last the last of the batch that will hurt yeah Brad Ross over there first and strike I don't have a strike good work guys trackers [Music]", "pS-gXHAAUjA": "hey y'all welcome back to my channel so today I will be showing you how to make candy strawberries and grapes first things first you want to get you a pop and I haven't turned the heat on yet so first thing first you want to add 2 cups of sugar you want to add what is a 1/4 cup of concert hopefully I'll come back it's kind of hard when you working with the camera with one hand and they want to pour 1/3 cup of water so now I'm gonna stir it up it's horrible when he's on me yeah I tried making this yesterday epic fail so I'm gonna break all heart rocks or sugars up in that way so once your ingredients come to a boil it starts to look like these and I advise you to not let kids do this because it's really hot it gets hot and yeah I think you take about 7 to 10 minutes before you dip the strawberries and grapes into it like I said this is my second attempt yesterday was an epic fail so hopefully today I could do the video right so far so good you're looking good but it looked like you did yesterday all thing different is today I use concert and the subject I use it got vanilla vanilla flavor any already I'm going to show you guys it's the start that I use so you're gonna let this come to a ball and I bet so all you need is your strawberries and your grapes you need water you need concert and you need sugar okay now that is the cooking I'm gonna get one of the strawberries and dip it and once again is kind of hard when you're trying to uh record and cook at the same time so I'm gonna dip it dip it all up and I'll be back to show you how to finish results okay after you finish dipping it they should come out looking like this they should be all shiny and pretty and hard you gotta make sure they hard see hit it yeah yeah I did it yeah I'll tell ya I'm so happy I got this right I just can't wait to sit down or cool and finish Oh starry know so yeah here you go the final loop so I just want to try one to make sure they came out right so he got my test try right here let's see [Music] waiter so yeah but it's hot in my teeth it could have been a little harder how it could be a little harder but it's a better than it did yesterday nothing gets it like coming and subscribe and share my videos and I'll see y'all on my next video bye [Music] so I just want to show y'all how the candid look after you pardonez of looks like this it's pretty good in these um steaks I found these Peaks it was a Walmart I think I found them in Walmart or a dollar was it Walmart I think it was Walmart I don't know I if I didn't pay a dollar party I paid two dollars and biggest thing I know it was no it was no more than three dollars I know I know and yesterday I went to Walmart right and the first one more I went to describe it was three dollars and some change and those was the ones that I tried to do to be to your own yesterday and I screwed a video up so today I wanted to I went to another Walmart and I got the strawberries for two dollars in a teen scene I was so mad I hate when I see bargains birthday I could have saved me an extra dollar yesterday but anyways after making this video all how to make the candy fruit I realized it wasn't long enough so I was like let me get back on here and try to think of something must have sad to try to make the video longer enough so this what I came oh we should have put them bananas in here huh got some bananas so I probably should have tried but they probably been all mushy and stuff or maybe maybe I should just try the bananas one day I doubt it but I might who knows you know we did you two stuff we throw everything together we come up we always come up with something who knows it might be a brilliant idea but all together I pay too long with the 18 stands for the strawberries I paid $2 and something for the concert and I think the vanilla flavor and it gives it you know an extra kick so it was pretty good I saw where some people put the flavour in there already so it came with you so you know I didn't have to buy nothing action so the strawberry was 218 the sticks are more than three dollars in the camera so concert was two dollars and some change and I already hate this this is this thing what is less than $10 or you can run it off to $10 but yeah it's cheap and then you can make enough food you can make enough for about 4 people 4 or 5 people see I still got some probably we left I think when the kids come home from school I'm just going on I'm gonna make them song I got to did I had over from the video did I um did I recorded Mina you say they're also later so yeah I got nothing to make another batch so when the kids get home I'm just not making some yeah yeah I just want to get on here and say there and yeah I see y'all my next video peace out", "hkQQdyqYPdU": "Hi guys, I'm Missy Missy. Today we will make candied strawberry. In case you don't have common sense, use fresh and nice strawberries Wash them properly. Use the good ones. For the rotten ones, throw them to Pewdiepie (No offence, I actually like him :P) **DUDE PERFECT** Rinse it and thoroughly dry the strawberries with a kitchen towel. If there\u2019s water on the skin the sugar syrup won\u2019t stick to it. Remove the green leaves but don't cut off the stem. Otherwise it will be hard to be held by a stick.  I tried before and the strawberries kept falling down :( Don't look at the cute orange catty car! Insert sticks into the stem end of each strawberry. They should be held firmly. To make the syrup, we will need 2 cup of sugar and 1 cup of water. (sugar:water = 2:1) BTW do you like my measuring cup? Just bought it online during this lockdown period. Was a bit worried after the purchase as I discovered the shop has many bad comments in their facebook page... (1 cup of water) It arrived in good condition anyway so sort of lucky :) What are you doing during the lockdown? Bring it to boil in medium heat. Do not stir the mixture as it needs to reach the temperature The mixture will start out cloudy.Boil until the sugar are dissolved. It takes about 10 mins. So do some stretching and exercise unless you want to get fat. ^O^ Then you should see the sugar syrup is clear, all of the sugar is dissolved and you have simple syrup.Be careful as the syrup is getting real hot now Switch to low heat and boil for about 10 mins. After 10 mins the mixture should start turning light brown. Unless you have eyesight problems, you should    be able to recognise the change. It's easier to use a white spoon to check the colour Switch off the heat immediately otherwise the syrup will get burnt easily Drop a small spoonful of sugar syrup into a bowl of cold water.  If it is Al Denta, you will hear some funny sounds like this. That means the candy syrup has reached its hard-crack stage and ready for coating! At this stage, the syrup forms brittle threads that can be easily cracked and snapped. Be careful though as it can be real shape and hurt your beautiful hands. If not, boil the syrup for another few mins and try again until it reaches the hard-crack stage. Quickly & carefully dip the strawberries into the syrup & twist to make sure it\u2019s completely covered.  Let any excess syrup drip off . Just be VERY careful not to touch it by hands as the sugar syrup is REAL HOT. If you want them to look perfect all around, insert the sticks upright. Otherwise set the m on a piece of baking paper to cool and harden. It takes about 3-5 mins to harden. Enjoy them with 2 hrs. Strawberries contain a lot of moisture and will begin to soften and weep as they sit. Good candied strawberry would not stick on each other. When you hit them the candied shell will break. To wash the pan and utensils. Simply add some water into the pan and boil them. Remove the water after and they should be all clean. gu........gu........gu.......gu...... gulugulugulugulugulugulugulugulugulu The crunchy candy shell goes prefect with the fresh and juicy strawberry. It's literally heavenly. OMG...OMG...OMG... Hey guys, this is my first video & I have ZERO subscriber...From zero to hero. Subscribe my channel & I  will love you forever Xxxxxx or I'll have my dog bite you!", "kiyU7x_H1YY": "[Music] hi guys I'm Jen John's welcome back to the channel today I have another episode of my amazing homemade candies for you now this is probably the one that was absolutely most requested out of all of the homemade candies that I've been receiving and it is homemade Jolly Ranchers I'm gonna be showing you how to make homemade Jolly Ranchers there the little rectangle ones you can also do them square if you prefer and I'm then I'm going to be showing you how to do them in lollipop form so kind of like two videos here and you know like at Christmastime when you have gifts that you have to give to people that are like not always on your list but you want to come off as like this really cool person that gives gifts to like everybody but you don't have a lot of money and you kind of want to be cheap with your gift or is that just me but anyways I think that making these homemade lollipops and giving them away to gifts for Christmas time to like anybody that you meet is a brilliant idea so let's get started on this tutorial to make our homemade Jolly Rancher candies we're going to be using one and a half cups of granulated sugar we need 3/4 of a cup of clear corn syrup you can use dark corn syrup if that's all you have but it will affect the color and it may affect the flavor of slightly we need 1/2 a cup of water and then the secret to Jolly Ranchers is in the citric acid we're going to be using 1/4 of a teaspoon to a half of a teaspoon you can even add more if you want to now citric acid is a natural occurring fruit acid and what we use it for is to enhance the flavor of the candy we're going to use a gel paste to add a bit of color to the candies you don't have to but if you want that traditional Jolly Rancher look you do need to add a little bit of color to it and for the flavoring that your original flavors are watermelon grape raspberry apple and cherry my favorite is a blue raspberry so I'm going to be showing you guys how to make the blue raspberry but all of the flavors you would follow the exact same procedure that I'm going to show you up next and if you're looking for the candy flavoring I find mine at bulk barn in Canada and you can also get them at different times of craft stores or cake decorating stores and I'll also put a link in the description box to everything that you need here so I've got my sugar here in a saucepan on top my element I'm going to put it on to around a medium heat and I'm going to add in my water and the corn syrup and these are the only ingredients that we put in at this point so what I'm going to do is just stir it until the sugar actually dissolves and once the sugars dissolved I can put my candy thermometer in to the pot and then we're going to heat it to what's known as hard crack which is around 300 to 310 degrees Fahrenheit once your candy has come to temperature we're going to add in our other ingredients so I'm putting in my coloring and it's going to bubble and hiss for on us here and I'm putting in a 1 and a half of these little gems of the color of the flavoring you can do that adjust it to your flavor to your desire whatever you want it to taste like I just found that one wasn't quite enough to get that real Jolly Rancher flavor so while it's still nice and hot here I'm going to add in half of a teaspoon of the citric acid so again if you actually like when I was testing this recipe I kind of I had a real jolly rancher went you know what it's way tartar then I remember it being so you could even put more of that citric acid in if you so choose so I've got this nice blue color here you just want to keep stirring it until most of those bubbles are kind of gone it's kind of working them out here if you leave the bubbles in it's really no big deal it just gives a little bit of texture to the candy and you might want it to be a little bit more smooth you can see it happens quite quickly now I'm going to pour it into I've just got a bread pan here with a parchment paper lined in here I'm just going to let it cool in here now I'm going to let it cool for about 20 minutes or until I'm able to start cutting it and then I will show you how to score it after we've let it cool for a bit once the Jolly Rancher mixture has cooled we can remove it from what we're going to do now is for it so I'm just taking a sharp knife that I've got I've sprayed it with some nonstick spray and I'm just making the places where I want the candy to be able to break or cut once it's cooled completely so you want to do this while it's still relatively warm because that's the only time once it gets really hard you aren't able to manipulate it like this it will just crack on you so if you wait too long it doesn't work but if you do it too soon you actually will find that it's really difficult to cut and that your cut lines will disappear and that it will just melt back together so what I'm doing is I'm just starting at the center and then I'm working my way towards the outside here and once your knife starts to get a little bit sticky you can reapply the nonstick spray or vegetable oil whatever you've got handy so once I've got it going that direction I'm going to turn the other way and I'm starting in the middle both times because what I found is like when I'm working it does press the Jolly Rancher little area here it changes the shape of it and I just found that working from the middle and outwards towards the outside had the least impact on the shape it still does change it as you can see but it's kind of the easiest rather than starting at one side once the Jolly Ranchers slab has cooled you can start you can either break it with your hands here or you can use the knife or something to to actually cut it in half it's quite easy to break into these little pieces so I just kind of prefer to do that and if they just have they end up like together like that you can take a sharp knife and then just help it along like that so I'm just going to finish breaking these all up and then you can wrap them up in like little pieces of plastic if you want to and you could put them in a little jar and give them to your friends makes a cool little gift so I'm going to show you how to do the lollipops next so to make the lollipops what I'm going to do is use this sphere mold it's just got nice little round domes on the other side now you're going to take the lollipop or the Jolly Rancher pieces that either you didn't like or you just have extras if you want to and you want to really squish them into the mold it's going to miss shape the mold to start with but what you want is that to have enough inside of it when it goes to melt it fills up the whole thing or you'll end up with like kind of a weird wonky looking a little like sucker there so I'm going to pop these into the oven it's preheated at 375 degrees and I'm gonna put it in for about 15 to 18 minutes I want to make sure that all of the Jolly Ranchers have melted completely so once the Jolly Ranchers have melted in the little mold all you have to do is take a lollipop stick and insert it into the center there just pressing down to the bottom and it will be a little bit wobbly if you try to do it while they're still super super hot so you can let them cool briefly before trying to put the sticks in so you can see that a start kind of starts to tilt over but I've got some ones over here that I have already finished and I'm just going to pop them out you just have to like play with the mold and cuz you have them like shoved in here quite hard you got to pop them out so there we go a little Jolly Rancher lollipop so there you go everybody how to make homemade Jolly Rancher candies it's a totally easy and I hope you guys thought so too don't go easy on the citric acid because that is definitely what makes it a true Jolly Rancher or you just made yourself a plain old lollipop now you know that I love the blue raspberry like I told you guys and the watermelon though mm-hmm it's delicious too totally amazing if you liked the video please give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and leave me a comment about what homemade candy you want to see me make next and I might just pick yours and thank you so much to everybody who suggested Jolly Ranchers because this was a delicious tutorial see you guys all again next time bye", "m0LDXpbNKGo": "good morning you guys hope you're having a great day so far today I am making candied strawberries and I think this is going to be a really easy and fun way to jazz up some healthy fruit no better way to jazz up some healthy fruit than with sugar right so that is what we're doing we are just simply going to add 1 cup of sugar with a 1/2 cup of water over medium heat until it turns a golden color and we are just going to stick some strawberries in it and then dry them off on some wax paper so I think it's going to be really simple and hopefully delicious when you get back I will have already blended together the sugar which will turn into like a caramel brittle I guess and we will get to candying these strawberries so I will see you back here in just a couple of minutes all righty so I got the sugar - a golden caramel e color and right now I am just dipping each strawberry into the sugar I've taken it off the heat and we are candying them up they look and smell delicious already I cannot wait to try them so when we get back we will give them a taste just setting them on to some wax paper to cool off and we will see how this turns out see in a minute take a look at these glossy brittle blade sugary strawberries these are the easiest most impressive little treats I haven't tasted one yet I was saving that for you guys so I am assuming these are going to be super crunchy so if that bothers you go ahead and mute your volume because here we go look at that here we go mmm oh my gosh I can't even explain them it's the lightest crispiest sugary crunch with that hint of burnt sugar flavor that we love in creme brulee with this juicy succulent strawberry underneath that just burst your mouth they are to die for I think I'm going to try this method with some thinly sliced citrus like maybe oranges or lemons so you could do this with anything what a way to kick up some fruit well it's healthy so looks like I have my breakfast we're all ready for me I will see you guys next time give them a try and let me know what you think bye", "aB_7ybNekGU": "as you know I'm an old man I'm getting up there in years you sir there's a lot of gray up here and in here not quite 60 yep I'm close but it occurred to me the other day that there are a lot of things that I've never done before and and one of them was make candy so that changes today well hello there old man Kelly you're Jeff to my friends in Utah me Jeff um let me tell you something about myself I don't cook I don't even barbecue I know take my man card away this guy doesn't barbecue men are supposed to barbecue so in an effort to broaden my horizons I thought what's something I've never done before and that's meat candy now was thing I was thinking back to when I was a kid we used to have these these flat hard candies that were about I don't know four or five inches by an inch and I'm really thin they were covered with plastic and you peel the plastic off they were delicious there was a cinnamon one that I used to always get at our local well it was a pharmacy that right down the road that sold candy and I'd get him there and they thought you've got to be able to make those at home right so I went on the internet I found four or five maybe six people who showed how they make rock-hard candy and I thought I could do that so I took these recipes from different people and sort of combined them and everybody had their own slight different way of doing it though it's all pretty much the same thing and so right now I'm gonna go through how I made some cinnamon rock-hard candy you need sugar I use two cups of sugar for this recipe light corn syrup you're gonna need about two thirds cup about 3/4 cup water is necessary and the flavoring I'm using the cinnamon oil that my wife got from somewhere and doing the powdered sugar for the very end a few other things you might need is a candy thermometer and parchment paper don't use wax paper the wax might melt parchment paper is better okay in my saucepan first I'll add the corn syrup that very thick sticky corn syrup follow that by the sugar that's 2 cups sure and the water with a food coloring just for style turn on to a high heat initially you want a high heat to really get this boiling quick but you have to keep stirring till everything's dissolved you don't want to stop stirring because you don't want it to start burning to the bottom of the pan remember you're a high heat once you get it to a good boil then you're ready to turn down the temperature of Bin's come out to a medium heat and now we're gonna let it simmer for about 30 to 40 minutes and this point we want to use our candy thermometer and now the goal or what we have to do here is get this concoction up to about 300 degrees that's called the hard crack temperature or something like that it's just a little over 300 degrees you can see our temperature's rising quickly but reality this took almost 40 minutes to get to the right temperature and of course a little coffee while we're waiting and our temperature continues to climb to get that's hard crack temperature and I'm not sure if you're supposed to but I kept stirring because I was afraid it would stick and burn and all that stuff and it didn't seem to hurt it we're almost there you can see it hard crack has been reached [Music] okay so we immediately removed from heat we can take up the thermometer this is where we add our flavoring my cinnamon oil I'm gonna add the whole bottle to this and almost immediately the whole house is filled with that cinnamon flavor you can smell it everywhere and you've got to stir it quick because this stuff gets thick and hard next we'll take a baking sheet covered with our parchment paper and we're gonna dump it right on there this thick gooey mess don't get any on you kids have your parents do this that kids don't try this at all because this is very dangerous very hot sticky mess 300 degrees and is too bright to your skin and burn you pretty bad if you're not careful and that's it now we've got to wait for hours before we can break this up and put the powdered sugar on and so we're done it's been four hours since I poured the concoction onto my pan and the nice part is it'll peel right up now look at this it's almost like a clear piece of glass right every so this you should just break it into chunks and look at that broke up nice and now what they say you have to do is cover baking powder because it's still sticky and though I actually like it like that the candy and remember it wasn't covered in baking powder but that had that plastic the plastic over it so I'll cover it with baking powder baking powder add some sweetness so I don't think it needs it and it'll get rid of the stickiness right and so you end up with chunks and all different shapes and sizes and now [Music] pretty tasty does remind me of those fire sticks I you see it as a kid and cinnamon always goes well with coffee so [Music] but it does plastic containers save it for later thank you for watching I hope you appreciated this I tried something new today and I sure enjoyed doing this maybe I'll do candy again in the future find another handy recipe if you've got a candy recipe you think I should try it let me know let's see if we can do it otherwise this is jeff saying so long okay [Music]", "HmClCY2OJS0": "hey Pennsylvania patience it's me again medical Mary and I thought today since I have to go to the hospital later in the week that we can make a nice edible to take with me I've decided for this edible on using a Cresco RSO a nice sativa blend you know can't go wrong has some cbgc BC THC so what's next what do we do with it after trying lots of different ways to try to make different edibles and doing baking I really wanted to make some hard candies I don't want to get a candy thermometer I don't want to boil sugar and corn syrup so I found something about melting down Jolly Ranchers and then just pouring them into a mold and doesn't that kind of sound fantastic if it works hooey you already kind of know it works as I showed you so you want to see how we did it we just bought Samara so and I have a ton of Jolly Ranchers 22 and we're gonna try to make some melted down Jolly Ranchers and add the RSO and these levels this is gonna be real time-consuming taking them all apart separating them crushing them up and then hopefully make it easier to melt the fam well it's we're gonna use strawberry and pineapple watch this like now let's crush it up [Music] so we're probably going to double triple quadruple bag these ranchers before we smash it off with a hammer [Music] I don't have any three years of thanks are being so quiet she's terrible [Music] empty out we're emptying the contents of the crushed-up Jolly Ranchers into a pot and we're gonna put out on the stove yeah she looks all innocent this girl's been Barkin the whole time I'm gonna make sure some little butter in there just to give the heart so something to stick to so look a little sour - hey Zeus all this butter over here jacked up with candy on it just keep stirring just keep stirring [Music] it's kind of the consistency of like previously chewed bubblegum yeah accurate it looks like that too yeah it's five minutes away from giving in and becoming a liquid and you how long do you think we've been like stirring this on low oh my gosh at least 10 15 minutes okay not there yet it wasn't really doing much so we turn the heat up just a little bit it's like number two or three right in between there like a little past three but now it's really starting to melt down and I think we're almost ready to squeeze the RSO in there we have to heat up a tower so a little bit we're gonna fit the RSO in there for a couple minutes let it soften up so it doesn't break that click container so and we're gonna squeeze about half of this into that mixture if you could only smell this right now remember it was pink mmm no it's dank I'm gonna just pour it into the mold but it's to meet you hard to film that so I'll show you the aftermath here's the aftermath the pan came pretty clean only burned a couple fingers definitely a whole bunch of edibles I'm working on cheeping my own it's a little edible to be [Music] yeah I was just told that people don't keep confectioners sugar in the fridge comment below and know where do you keep it [Music] yellow like it was definitely worth making him this way but it seems like definitely a team effort yeah if I was alone I would have been really stressed out there's a audibles calculator online if you go to how to add a bowls calm and you type in the amount of product you use and the amount of THC that's in that product so you can use or so you can use distillates you can use your own can of butter and it tells you how much each of your edibles is when you divide it by the amount of edibles you make out of it so I'm not a math person it makes me real stress to even think about it the how-to edibles calculator is a lightsaber doing the math on our half gram of our so that we added and and we made oh I forget how many pieces but we had done the math the other day so the larger pieces that we made around 14 to 15 milligrams and the smaller heart pieces that we made were around 7 so I'm not mad at it I tried on the other day it was good it didn't last as long as people claim that their edibles last but if I get a couple hours of relief it's worth it for me and you know just keep eating them like you would a gummy bear so it's nice to have like a hard sucker so medical Mary approved", "KbQ085Xw1rw": "Hello Everyone! Welcome to our Youtube Channel \u201cEveryday Life\u201d. Again we are here, with a new interesting information is on  how fruits are being preserved with Dehydration, Candied and Freeze dried processes.  Here, we have dehydrated strawberries, candied starawberries and freeze dried strawberries.  Here, we are demonstration entire food preservation technique with example of strawberry. Mostly all the fruits can be preserved with all three processes.  Even sometimes, vegetable too preserved with these processes.  These are just processes to preserve fruits and vegetables for longer duaration. Even fruits are also preserved for the demands of the recipe. First we have dehydrated strawberry. Dehydration is one of the oldest process. This process has been used for ages.  In this process, fruits are cut into pieces and then sun dried.  Initially sun dried method has been used. But, now big dehydrators and dryers are being used to dry moisture of the fruits. Just like this, in front for you, is dehydrated strawberry.  As moisture has been removed that is why this is turned into darker colour.  This process make them lighter than original weight. Dehydration is based on principle that fruits content moisture and removing that make them last long.  This has long shelf life. This can last upto 6 months to a year. This can be consumed as breakfast cereal, as it is, or use it to decorate cake or cookies. Second process is candied process in which fruits are cooked with sugar and then dried after removing excess sugar.  Then this is converted as candied form. This kind of candied fruit  (candied strawberry) is taken as candy. This is quite popular among children  because it has sweetness and sourness of fruits along with extra sweetness of sugar.  This is shorter shelf-life .  These should be consumed within 3-4 weeks.  This is also used in the baking of cake and cookies.  Candied fruits is also a old method for preserving the fruits similar to Indian Murabba. Third process is freeze dried process.  Here, this is freeze dried strawberry. There are small pieces of strawberry. This is one of the latest method to preserve the fruits. This increases the shelf life extensively.  This process can not be done at home. This needs specialised machine that eliminates the moisture of the fruit (Strawberry) with freezing.  This process consumes a lot of time. Even machine could take 24 hours to freeze dried the fruits. The freeze dried method reduces the weight, it becomes very light. Freeze dried method increases the shelf-life.  Some says you can even store freeze dried products upto 30 years.  This can also see them in high-end gourmet sugar.  Those sugar are made with this kind of freeze dried fruits. This freeze dried method eliminates the moisture content and makes the fruit very light. These freeze dried fruits are very expensive in the market. With almost no moisture it is very easy to grind such freeze dried fruits. The perfect example of these are inside the Cup of Noodles that has vegetables are in freeze dried form. And when you add boiling water it  regains its shape. In these 3 method of preserving fruits- Dehydrated, Candied and Freeze Dried. Freeze dried method is the healthiest method. Because this contents all its natural flavour and nutrients  of the fruit.  This doesn\u2019t have any additional sugar and no moisture at all. Candied method has additional sugar as it has been preserved in sugar. Hence, often health-conscious people tend to avoid it. Dehydrated also has little more sugar content as it becomes concentrated form of sugar due to this process.   The process reduces water content keeping fibre and nutrients, but also increases concentration of sugar content.  These all three are easily available in the market. Dehydrated fruits are easily available in the grocery stores. Candied fruits are easily available at the confectionery stores. These freeze dried is available in the high-end departmental stores and online stores. Today we have shared the information that when fresh strawberry is not available in the market .  Then you can enjoy strawberry in its dehydrated, candied and freeze dried form throughout the year. And we hope our today\u2019s information will be useful in your Everyday Life. Thanks for watching and keep exploring your Everyday Life.", "CorD0w_uYoI": "[Music] are you laughing it thought of a funny joke oh yeah yeah I'll tell you later okay dunes 20 [Music] we keep careful [Music] we go alright two more you playing golf or the next one's gonna be a close call bad let's see how much we can do it we can do it maybe you know shouldn't have filled them up so high believe in yourself I didn't I do some do some tricksters we strive the tricksters broad trickster table is cooler you know what's that 95 down here 102 over here because I was down there with the red the original or the red and the red got called fast so I moved it around what's the middle okay we're here we got 101 but right here hmm okay that's a consensus altogether now 98 no I actually picked on Craig who's Craig just said okay Tunnel was our new roles yeah and then every day you get a new it's great some candy kettle right some light blanket like a real good white yeah that's a great color you know you think it's from stuffing it uh Joey instead of three dentures I know I bet it's nothing to throw away because it's no use clicking I thought I saw the first of all they didn't have oh well but maybe that was why it was so late oh I'm so yeah that's why I'm trying to turn it off with 308 because it keeps cooking is still hot sure it does anyway boys you're next yes doesn't work anything yeah so Jos gonna invent some you know how you have your cell phones you have the cell phone yeah you have a TV if you haven't got he's gonna invent it so you can just stretch it so you won't need all these job means you can hit yourself on stretch into a TV it's called theory it's gonna be called an aspect but stretchy screen so developer yeah cuz he has to work too hard to get all that in Bartek Steve quick Steve click thought Oh Phil every bad no actually the last one don't think you know knock you filmed it but I didn't do it in the last one I will just say that I didn't somebody recently commented saying that they it was the first time watching one of these videos with headphones in and they really liked the sound of the food coloring getting mixed in so you've never tried it and you like a some iron you know what max I think we could've use a tiny bit more blue in the last one okay should it came out kind of green it looks blue B yeah you gotta figure the candy starts out your hair so it's gonna turn it green losers scissors losers where are you uh we were using over there no we're doing three colors plus we're gonna do a little bit of white like you did before so we'll start right here if it makes you know what you cut the last one and I pulled it apart so let me do that same thing again cuz it worked out pretty well no though I'm the last videos people said I was snappish with you yeah I'm gonna be super nice to like my feelings oh okay No well no no I mean the original Oh original video and the last match we did I think Craig stopped filming because of these difficult we're like all crying and Santa running high yeah but we do not throw any candy across your own milk Andy was hurt where's Danny hardly any candy right totally right that the writers of American slang yes it's the red is awful smaller which doesn't help things hey you know the last match the colors came out fantastic but it was kind of a tough process he's going to touch what game we were trying a new technique through the last time he's a juvenile happy what Greg did Debbie did six layers of colors and then just kind of smushed together and pulled that out this time around what we did was we did stripes side by side so he did three on the bottom and that's two on top and then one on top of that although Greg we've been doing the texting machine he says he keeps a little little blob of white so you can pull the white into a color if you want to make a colored dark I mean the lighter Dylan's head pops up so we're also doing a little bit of white but you're gonna pull in celsa can use to get the beautiful pastel colors that we're after yeah that's what Steve's doing right there he's mixing in the white mix that y/10 Steve no we don't want any white stain in your gloves good job Steve good job watch I have the candy pulp who's that - well you pulled that you want that true what you say my candy hug you wanted it to five you want a - oh you guys are really showing that can while there's something I'm tired max gonna hammer himself I don't think I'll need to such a small batch Steve actually - that last batch yeah I'll believe it when I see it you know what what if I took a piece of this here yellow and I mix it into that red that you got going on there but we didn't fold it up I take the piece before you pull the off I'm just gonna take a piece off of this to mix it in for one yeah I said go ahead and pull that but I'll see how that works out how's the blue feeling is that so pretty liquidy you tell me yeah let's give a shot do you wanna do the same same with the blue it's like a nice deep blue right now oh good let's just try to just one thing snow I'm just saying now I don't think I'm gonna be able to pull this was it - that's pretty warm so terrified yeah I can't even get it to like to the sideways one that's not ever mutual so this is really hardest because by the time you loop it over it's already looped again oh it's yeah that part's fine I'm trying to keep it from getting stuck too though yeah and this is like so small that you if you feel getting stuck you can just kind of wheel it yeah you kind of do that with most of them as long as you keep it keep wiggling it see like now it's getting less and less that was even closer to the hook means you're gonna pull this just pull that after degrees on from the heater now that red one that you put there yeah but what else nothing right now okay we should talk again after that one too yeah so tiny thing alright I'll take a little piece of this is going to go for our purple yes this is this yellow is enough right that looks great who's gonna take it off them yeah the Greens gonna be yellow I'm working on purple here you finally get to do purple oh I didn't realize always being deprived okay you reeled me off a piece of it you got the yellow so you're gonna do the green okay this too much well just try it and see what happens this feels so much better I mean this is itself already looks tight I think we could just pull this out be like hey look at that yeah we just look at that great baby like Platt now sometimes people have said hey how come you know just color it purple why are you doing it this way it's because the reason for that is we're going to color them individually and then pull them individually we'd have tiny tiny little pieces and you can't pull tiny pieces they would just get cold so that's why we don't color it purple because you need that little bit of the bulk yeah are the candy to keep itself I saw that problem last time with try it like Max is trying to pull the smaller batches and they were just like yeah like yeah it's just you're too hot or too cold and they just really look mmm it's ready to go you can have it it's purple it's okay these aren't like totally mixed in cuz hey we can start building our pyramid let's think cuz it's gonna be wait I like one two three four times to the gravity I got incoming green till we have to decide where we want to put the white I'm just agreeing I was gonna so we got a coke let's cut the blue in half to them because we need either six one two three four five six seven eight nine all right look at one person thing here we got enough right now don't cut any more happen okay okay four collars on the bottom pick your 494 we should do this on the table though because we're gonna be putting water down right how about those four the right together all right these four it is so you wanna put it on the table right there do it on the table so that we can get the color or the water so that it's not all over the campaign okay okay so can you guys so then after this we gotta pick three oh I'm going to put the water between them all right here you go and then pick three more colors to go on top of that green-orange perfect oh well he was keeping the orange away from their head oh yeah yeah yeah put the green in the middle I saw you're saying their necks - yeah but then I didn't realize the orange in the red how's that go bad - yeah just shoot no it's good that's right nice because we're trying to do four three and then two on top the white stripe is pretty big when we put three on top I don't want to cut the white in half because it's too huge just do white any white there's a Susan so do a little my daddy's so like you know we're doing it like you saw in your dream so you know we just wanted to like kind of be like a triangle shape so you know should be four and then three and then two right here so training it will be a night you throw the whole thing right yeah that would be neat I bet you can cut you can Steve you're right don't you be afraid it would kind of twist go too much no no I was just showing a ridiculous this is like a su color send that over to sue calm for a few seconds put as the banner you gonna bring it over in front of the heat yeah [Music] yeah way softer it's it's not super soft didn't I shape to it it's a soft the big was easier to shape you want to do it oh yeah all right I can do it I really don't you think what do you want me just get in there all right find Ellen's trying to get my hands dirty oh darn I heard the condom yeah hit only have like knives okay inside your dingus and use a different word I'm turning the fan on all right whatever you want to switch right there [Music] my race I think the guys touchid you I'm not like this anymore I'll have the same problem all righty now like done just as you can see all the colors already some that have a lot of white some have a lot of blue some I have one orange you haven't see this what bags can't hold you you can't say that to you know mixin you uh reenact what it was like last batch when you're trying to cut them no I had to like I was my toes were starting to hurt because I was hold the bottom of the table and make yourself heavier yeah Nike yellow coming through a yellowish green alright I'm saying it for sure now I'm going on record

trying to uh sit or no max just aged about 20 years right once we start twisting it doesn't look so much like that [Music] yeah we had some early I just won't go away yeah unfortunately when they will quit I'm telling you man next year the dumb burger come back and have another undefeated season yeah I'm telling you man it's you look at the past couple years the bills in the playoffs the Browns are one of the most promising teams in the NFL this year yeah well I guess the Cowboys it's like the upside down [Music] [Music] a pink it's a cool paint I do like women who's creepy [Music] which one was Green and start yeah she might say like eighty Solo cups oh my gosh like foodcourt small soda cups yep how does it look I just want to see I know the colors are clashing or what snapped yeah figure that out yes Steve is came in and slam some canyons down yeah like he dug slime in gym [Music] [Music] books Bugs Bunny is gonna come and see us oh no no wait I'll play the best Boys Noize guy I'll give him a couple carrots wait a minute fraction Albuquerque yeah he just needs direction which we act when I do that crystal just saw that so stinky stinky son wait I know where that's properly should I just keep doing it you'll get it yeah Ron Swanson yeah it's some people can hear you so funny to see the show how different his character was I could recently that like people when Parks and Rec first came out thought that Leslie was too much like Michael Scott and I'm like and I don't know I they were saying that like the producers or the director of the office thought that Michael Scott was mean in the first season - and he's not me some people did get I mean when I first started watching it it kind of and it's definitely after my girlfriend didn't it I know she almost didn't wanna launch it past season when I said no trust me and then after that season one's got some of the best stuff yeah but I think it's just honestly I think it was just the tone and I think they fix the terrible how it was either cut together the pacing and then after that it was like it all made sense I like shows after the guy's a character it takes a couple seasons yeah where they really fine there yeah you don't like I think that about both yeah I can say I think the best example is that Kevin alone where like the first season and then I like both bird season he's talking like yes that she's really good yeah I feel like he makes that point a lot so he gets to practice our main characters okay how do I become somebody else but only in my head yeah I mean Rhetta Carson wreck she wasn't even a character but because she was so funny in her life they decided to start including her she basically just plays a more exuberant version of herself to Mike Morgan I mean like 10% more exuberant she's she's about that in real life because I met her alright I'm kind of a bindi and rather go back yep I hear our applause is the same way where they were like all this grow such a freak we just have to create a spot for other people of the office school of the options and party track they're gonna love this so these three colors remind you for one episode of Parks and Rec I don't know how many people would like the sound of the candy being chopped though cuz that's like not exactly ASMR do you have any two cents on this Candyman alright I can't sing the song I'm gonna try malcolm in the middle' they sing the song Candyman oh really like the light falling she took up yes I got a lightbulb sticker for your sake but you want to see what it would feel like she I remember asking her about it she was like yeah you know I was like I know I could get hurt but it can't be that bad yeah she's still alive and mostly the same mostly which brings a lot of her hair just always sticks up her fingers are all black but do you see your skeleton cartoon logic during thunder she gets a little jittery all of my people progressive twisting I think I untwisted it I think like when I go to twist it there's always a spot ahead that's like resisting that resisting the twist Oh [Music] No we're sparked is like when you get a nice twist going and then you go to stretch it out and stretching it out takes the choice left I could smell like refresh my head let's see both nocebo effect what is it called oh it's that I feel like it would be that effect I've been talking about it where it's like you remember something as it was but it really wasn't that way like fruit like fruity loops or something like that and loops we're dancing bears yeah something like that cool ranch Dorito mendel I don't know if it's the same thing it's probably not but I'm just trying to list all these it's not real I know it's crazy crazy concept definitely every time and so does everybody else I've heard somebody used the Mandela effect to like justify that in 2012 like our timeline ended and we're really living in an alternate universe yeah yeah we can't be living in an alternate universe if there's okay well I'm like if we're living in an alternate what well see every logic makes no sense man okay some really heavy conversations being thrown around at Handy whoa you said twist it up don't be too long yeah honking ready to taste test time kam JC first first second third a kind of like a better cooled down yeah the head of one for mojo a new kind of physical Piniella ish I was gonna say I taste bunker roots what the doctor wrote delicious is so yeah in frosting basically oh sorry frosty thanks oh yeah I had no complaints out of it yeah a little frost it is delicious yeah pink and blue and white yeah and they made me wait a half an hour to try this my throat was a little dry and I wanted to piece it dilaloo a drug like my hand said no I want that taste hasn't been video no could I screw it up last time yeah don't let the diva just chewed up some overall consensus hey beautiful honestly if you told me with Concannon than a bit okay it is a kind of candy otherwise I'd say like maybe vanilla frosting or something yeah hey hey no matter why it's amazing orientation because right it's super good it's good AF it's good and fun yeah Joey's you all night [Music]", "B5Cpw3_ROFA": "what's good bass draw militia in today's video we're going to be doing a candy strawberry recipe called tonkulu let's go ahead and get into it let's do way [Music] all right guys before we get into this video i gotta let you know that today's video is being sponsored by magicalbutter.com use base drop keys to get 20 percent off your order on magicalbutter.com i want to thank them for sponsoring me in general but also sponsoring today's video 20 off magicalbutter.com all right guys so let's go ahead and get into it we're not wasting any time today without any further ado i bring you tongkulu here we go all right guys so we got our sugar inside of our saucepan we're putting the heat on low we're gonna go ahead and add our water in and we're adding in our honey for flavor and to help medicate this up if you want to see the full ingredient list and get all the directions and everything goodies420.com click the link that's in the description it'll take you over where you'll get the full recipe and ingredient list all right so what we're going to do is we're not going to stir that around we don't want that sugar to crystallize some people think that if you if you have the honey in there that it won't crystallize but i've still seen it happen before so we're going to be very careful with it so that the sugar don't crystallize and so we're going to we have this on the low temperature we're going to keep this at a low temperature until our sugar and the water and the honey and everything mixes well and the sugar dissolves once the sugar dissolves fully we'll go ahead and put it on medium and then we'll go from there so let's go ahead and give it a couple of minutes here and let's let this sugar fully dissolve on low all right guys so we're starting to get some action inside of the saucepan now we want all that sugar to start dissolving and then what we're going to do is we're going to put our thermometer in here and we're going to want this to hit 300 degrees fahrenheit or 150 celsius the hard crack it says hard crack on a thermometer that's what we wanted to to hit on a thermometer we're doing this without corn syrup a lot of the recipes use corn syrup we're not going to use corn syrup in ours all right so we basically got the sugar dissolved now and so basically we have it at a medium temperature and so we're going to cook this for about 8 to 10 minutes until it hits 300 degrees fahrenheit or 150 celsius right there where it says hard crack on the thermometer so yeah let's go ahead and do it all right guys so we hit the right temperature now we're going to go ahead and turn off turn the flame off and so now what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and add our one or two drops of red food coloring in [Music] we're going to add in our tincture [Music] stir it up here [Music] we go now we're going to go ahead and start coating [Music] our strawberries [Music] [Music] all right guys so i just showed you how to make tonkulu the great thing about this is you can make this with any fruit that you choose you don't have to pick strawberries you can pick any fruit that you want to do so i really appreciate

approximately 20 minutes very low simmer till it's just barely juicy this is sat it's a little bit dry use a pot scraper to get it out candy trays lightly sprayed with Pam small packet of jell-o ready put some in the sugar as it's boiling not all of it just some pock scraper is very effective especially in the stride out state do not lose the pot scraper I have a rata added the first amount of tincture that I showed you the other amount is waiting just gonna do some bubbling and boiling you don't have to stir it constantly but it's a good idea to stir it regularly already at 2:26 this candy thermometer has a cover that has a guide on it candy on the right hard crack 302 Fahrenheit I was previously only going to 250 275 which got you somewhere between fall and soft crack the fall is going to be chewier the hard crack is going to be just like a hard candy it'll start looking a little bit frothy that's alright it's normal just keep doing the stirring a little bit we're already at 236 within a couple of minutes try to scrape the edges every once in a while to keep it all incorporated it's going to get a little bit thicker keep going we're almost 300 first put the teacher in still won't but it'll break down with stirring it turn down a little bit we got a little too hot out of jell-o try not to fling it around in the pot that's pretty much what you put on the sides you're not going to get off keep it on the heat you can lower the heat a little bit keep it on the heat so that you can keep stirring the jello in just be in the pot looks like like super sure to get all the edges and top bottom so you know you got all your jello and your team's you're mixing okay scoot over you did hurry to try and get as much of it out of the pot as you can before it starts doing the stringing crap nothing but once it's in the tray let it cool a little bit where you start spreading it other ways you get that so it's best to try and pour it across this mold as best you can so you don't have to mess with it a lot still a little warm spreading that as it gets cold or cooler it's easier to just push around where you want places where it slowly I'm just kind of try to get rid of the lines these are it's not a big deal for your personal use but if you're gonna sell it these are harder to deal with it's not square it's harder to make them all level just don't look as nice but if you're starting with this tray you will probably get closer to looking nicer like that rather than the partial pour where you don't really know how much fill of your mold you just on a poori so these are a little bit thick and sloppy looking you try and mash them down but as they get cooler they're just gonna snap off Chrome's like that", "uOT7bG5hwi0": "welcome to the sugar Test Kitchen guys we're an all natural vegan candy company based in our bure to Canada this is our new YouTube channel to show you guys how we make our candies here at sugar today we're making mango passion fruit hard candies that are colored with turmeric and flavored with natural oils at this stage the sugar has already been colored and flavored now that I've tested the sugar for heat and consistency I'm adding a mixture of citric and malic acid with our acid candies tastes like nothing it would just be like eating a lump of sugar and nobody wants to do that if you're gonna eat candy you want it to taste amazing now I'm incorporating the acid into the candies by folding it and kneading it like bread this is the process to make every candy taste the same so you don't have a lump of acid in one that makes it really sour and not in another [Music] now that the acids been incorporated it's time to split the sugar into two [Music] because we don't use any titanium dioxide in our candies which would make them white and opaque we have to pull the sugar this process aerates the candy trapping air bubbles inside which reflect light this causes the candy to appear lighter and more opaque the pulling of the sugar also gives the finished candies a better mouthfeel [Music] see the difference pulling can make to the same sugar [Music] now I'm gonna roll each piece of sugar into a log and cut it into three pieces of varying sizes this is going to help me create this concentric circle design later on [Music] time to flatten each piece [Music] now for the fun part creating the pattern that will go into the candies because mango passionfruit is a more grown-up flavor I chose a subtle concentric circle design for these candies don't worry the crazy patterns are coming soon each piece of sugar is wrapped in a slightly larger piece of sugar of the alternating color to create this design [Music] the design is finished and now I have to keep the candy round until it reaches the perfect temperature so I can pull it and make it into smaller rods [Music] as you can see here I'm tapering down the end of this big blob of sugar so I can pull it into rods that will eventually become individual candies [Music] these rods have to be rolled pretty much continuously until they Harden and cooled down otherwise they're gonna go flat and misshapen and a little stick together [Music] this is where I get to see if all my hard works paid off I get to see if the design of the candies worked sometimes it goes really wrong and it gets to try the candy and see if it tastes good which also sometimes can go really wrong you guys don't get to try those ones but that's the fun of the Test Kitchen I also get to play with a really big knife and a really heavy envel so yeah this is one of my favorite parts of the can't be making process [Music] these candies turned out exactly how I wanted them they tasted amazing the pattern was really subtle and caulis a success I think these are definitely going to be made in the commercial kitchen and ready to sell to you guys make sure to check our web store it's updated every Sunday with our new candies and will be coming up with new videos very often and very soon this was really fun bye guys", "YD6u-fMCybo": "hi hi it's Felicia and Jacob so what are we doing today bring on your flash plus machine so we bought a cotton candy

Kingston for me yes take your book scraps so the cotton candy that we made out of the Jolly Ranchers of course it was delicious but it's not one that I would make again it made a lot of crystals

hey y'all get ready to make some candy grapes alright the first thing you'll need is a bag of Jolly Ranchers I got the bag that was I think 248 at Walmart and first thing you gonna toss up I wrapped with the Jolly Ranchers and I'm using my blender to chop them up and I end up pressing post and it chopped it up to fine some people that have this like what kind of bigger pieces in my I was like powder kinda alright and right here you can see that how fine I made it the only thing with a jolly wrench day it's gonna get back you get hard so I end up putting it back in a blender later on alright next you're gonna need 2 cups of sugar I can get another cup of sugar [Music] there's a second cup of shirt alright next is a half a cup of water and then a half a cup of the Cairo sir when you put all of it into your partner and I just use a small pot because it's not gonna make them rich all right and this thing make sure you mix it up pretty good before you get ready to put it on the stove so you don't try to mix it up while it's cooking and with the heat on the stove this temperature saying I put it between four or five or so [Music] alright next one get ready to cook it alright you have to let the temperature reach between two hundred and eighty degrees and two hundred and ninety degrees under cooking thermometer so make sure you watching it cuz you don't want to burn it and be careful you don't want to burn yourself all right this is parchment paper not wax paper make sure you use parchment paper alright then I have my bowl of grits I've washed and dried those all right and then I have two pieces if you have any longer sticks you want to use you can use those because to me it's the kind of dangerous because you can burn yourself with it so small do not put the soup in the hole that's our baton the great with the grapes tin came from you make your own hole on the opposite cuz it'll stick better the hole on the other side is kind of big already I'll have my line that already [Music] all right it's cooking here makes you glad to get it two hundred and eighty degrees all right here's I just took it off the stove this is outlook right with it also all right next thing is you gonna need some flavor and the flavoring I use is the Lawrence flavor I use cheering and it's the bottle synthesizes a dream I only use half a bottle since I didn't make that much and it's gonna turn it red that's in the brain in it all right Mitchell see me add in another drop of the flavor just get a little flavor but after that you weigh if you have the liquid white food coloring in the jail that's when you add that you don't see me use it because I went to last minute trying to find some but using the liquid white learn it would give your stuff a brighter color so I want to be see through my stuff you'll see it's let me see - have a seat - color eye whatever but I didn't care cuz kids I know they was still eating but so give it that deep coloring you need the white liquid gel color and then we use your color that you wanted to be but now you're gonna see me and then I have just regular gel food cuz I'm using the colored seal and again it's gonna be basically almost air clear when I put it on the grades because I didn't have the whitener so again make sure if you want the bright colors that you see everybody else using use the white liquid gel color the whitener and then you're gonna use like a few drops to everything I didn't you see me just scooping some till your food coloring my Chi mix it up that my sister she started dipping already and you gotta make sure you working fastest and starting heart and hard and fast and I still ting to pot to the side so I can make sure lit all around to the side all right you start dipping it but then you see my candy and hey got heart the Jolly Rancher candy and I end up later on putting it back inside the blender to chop it up again good say the thing with the Jolly Rancher is it says for some reason because it's so sticky I know hardest but you go ahead and just make sure you working fast cuz the candy that you made will get hard fast and the Jolly Rancher soon so just dip it and I don't want to do have I didn't some people that I dip the whole thing I only did half of it great and we end up doing strawberry so we didn't record record ourselves on the strawberries and when you dip it just hurry up and sprinkle a pot on before it gets hard and they're just laid on a parchment paper all right here you can kind of see it better what a good grapes doesn't see just really missing again you see my stuff is fired it's pretty fine like a little powder some people have bigger chunks with Jolly Ranchers than theirs but it all stays the same all right this is finished product it came out pretty good for the first time if you want to see my kids do the taste test check out her Channel say whatcha Larry thanks for watching", "2iYlduidc54": "[Music] my i",

the syrup just right make sure you just can't see you guys we're gonna put a link in the description where you can purchase this candy thermometer already then let's get into the video hey guys we're back and I'm gonna show you how we make the candy for the strawberries so you will need two cups of sugar 1/3 of a cup of corn syrup the heat right now is not on I'm going to mix everything together first and then I will turn the heat on and a quarter of a cup of water 1/4 of a cup for you guys I don't know and I am going to mix it around until it's evenly distributed you guys this recipe is really easy I do not recommend you doing this with children as this stuff gets really hot and will burn them but it really is a few simple steps as I've told you guys all right so I'll see the syrup it's supposed to look something like this that means it's ready to go okay let me taste it really yeah you wouldn't want to just eat that this it's nice and sugary so now you guys I'm gonna turn the fire on and I'm going to throw my candy thermometer in it now about the wait until the syrup gets to 150 degrees and then it's done so pretty much you are just I have it on like medium high you can turn it on high whatever you do just watch it you know so wait until you see it's already starting to bubble a little bit you can't see it too much but it's already starting to bubble make sure the thermometer is 150 Celsius and not Fahrenheit all right you guys now I'm let's turn it off with the stuff and let her compare the strawberries and maybe a couple of grapes all right okay hey guys I'm back so we're gonna show you what's going on with the syrup we've had it in for about eight minutes so check it out after eight minutes we're a little over 130 big figure yeah it's about 130 whoa sorry you guys okay so got a little bit more time for that so law that's finishing we're going to go ahead and prepare the strawberries so what I've done already I've already taken the leaf off the top so I'm gonna chop a flat surface on all of them now this will help you to stand them up on the skewers so I'm gonna put two skewers per I mean I'm sorry gonna put some strawberries parts fewer and then BAM because you have that black stuff or say gonna stand right up isn't that word beautiful it's I don't care what they say chocolate all I care about is eating it alright alright and now as you guys can see we're also gonna be doing rates today so let me do a flat surface you really just need to do it on the bottom one so stand up the rest of them can be rounded ok so last one I'm getting really anxious cuz I can't wait to taste these I almost stabbed myself Stefan you killed your skewer no well these are perfect a little bout a nicely they're standing up alright guys so yeah just a few more minutes until our syrup is ready we'll be back when it is alright guys we're back so as you can see the syrup is now at 150 degrees and we're ready to make our candy strawberries just take us

take care take care [Music] [Applause]", "rvn0xep-EsY": "hey guys Shayna here so today I'm a bit of a different video I'm going to teach you how to make homemade hard candy I'm gonna making watermelon flavored umm I've tried this recipe or a similar recipe once before and I accidentally burnt it so I'm hoping this is going to turn out a bit better I got a candy thermometer for Christmas I love candy so I'm gonna try to make some and I'll show you how to do it for your ingredients you will need two cups of granulated sugar 1 cup of water 2/3 of a cup of light corn syrup you'll need one teaspoon or just one small container of candy oil I am using watermelon flavor you can use whatever you'd like and if you'd like I'm going to put a touch of red food coloring in it you're also going to need a saucepan a cookie sheet with parchment paper on it and a candy thermometer so we're going to start off by mixing in the water the sugar and the corn syrup you are going to put it on a medium heat in the saucepan once the sugar is completely stirred in and dissolve into the water then you're just going to let it sit no stirring and boil until it hits between 300 and 310 degrees Fahrenheit also make sure that you can zoom over to does not touch the bottom of the pan it has to be taking the temperature of the candy not the pan the mixture is just starting to boil but about 100 degrees to go make sure that you don't have it on too high of a temperature because you don't want to burn the sugar one thing with candy making is that you have to be quite patient it takes a while to boil if you have a gas stove that is better it's best to have constant heat on it it works on your ways but it does take a bit longer be patient we're now getting quite close to 300 degrees if your guys can do oil to make it flavored when you put it in be sure to keep your head away from the pan because it will send up some steam and it is a very very strong okay you have to be quite quick when you stir it together and make sure you take it off heat first that smells delicious drops are red that looks so good once everything is all mixed in you're going to have to pour it very carefully onto here you want it to be fairly thin you can also use lollipop molds if you have them I'm just going to make hard candy that we can snap later let's hope this works crazy color okay we are just going to let this sit now make sure it sits at room temperature you don't want put it in your fridge and afterwards we are going to break it apart and taste it looks like it looks so good and smells delicious well cuz stringy it is I don't know if you can see that what's quite hot still I've got such a nice flavor can't wait till that's hard one quick tip while this is cooling make sure your candy thermometer you clean it off completely so there's no like little chunks left because otherwise next time you make candy there's chunks you're going to get stuck and the candy will get stuck to the chunks it just it won't work properly so make sure you clean this very well hot water works good okay so the candy is hard now so you're going to peel it off and just break it to pieces and make sure you put it in a continuous a good seal on it comes off so nicely there you have it this is a very simple recipe maybe a bit finicky and it takes a while but how to make just an old-fashioned kind of standard hard candy uh I will leave the link down below where I found this recipe if you'd like to try to make it and yeah I will see you guys sometime soon thanks for watching watermelon I love candy you can replace sleep with exercise so his suggestion was sleep for six hours instead of eight and use those two hours to go for a run or bike ride get some exercise", "kQuwgg6DNLU": "how to make awesome homemade lollipops hello everyone today I'm going to show you how to make lollipops at home using three different methods store-bought candy molds free form on a cookie sheet covered with a silicone mat or parchment paper or how to make your own mold using cornstarch making your own cornstarch mold is actually pretty easy all you need is a shallow container I'm using a baking dish that's kind of small but I was only making a few lollipops in there put in the cornstarch you're going to smooth off the top using a spoon or maybe something like a like a popsicle stick just drag it across the top to smooth it out you don't want the cornstarch to be compacted because you're going to be using a some kind of object in this case I'm using I'm going to use a juice bottle cap I'm going to press that into the cornstarch to make the mold cavities now I made a mistake here I dumped the cornstarch in what I should have done was sifted the cornstarch into the container and it would have been kind of light and fluffy and I wouldn't have the problem I'm having here when I was pressing the bottle cap into the cornstarch I had to press pretty hard it was sticking to the cap and made the bottom of my cavities uneven so sift the cornstarch smooth it out gently and then press in whatever object you want to make as your candy these are hard candy lollipop molds I bought these online because I couldn't find any locally I'll put a link in the description box if you're interested to prepare these you'll need to spray them a little bit with some cooking spray just so that the candy releases well now these are specially made to withstand high temperatures and are for hard candy making you could also make chocolate lollipops with these as well but do not try to make hard candy lollipops with molds the clear ones that are designed for candy melts or just for chocolate because they will melt nd I bought two kinds I bought just the plain round ones and I bought flower ones but there's a whole pile of different ones available okay so here we go on to the actual candy making in a large saucepan place two cups of white granulated sugar a quarter cup of water and two thirds of a cup of light corn syrup you can also use the golden corn syrup as well it'll just affect the final color of your candy if you can't find corn syrup where you live you may be able to find a candy recipe that doesn't use it you just might have to look around a little bit now to flavor this candy I'm using some orange extract I put in one at teaspoon they actually sales specially made candy oils for candy making you only have to use a little bit and if they have intense flavors I didn't have any in the house at the time so I just used the orange extract now you're going to begin to heat this mixture over high heat at the beginning you're going to have to stir continuously because you don't want it to scorch or stick to the bottom and at this point you can also add some food coloring if you want to change the color now I wanted to match the orange extract so I added some yellow and some red to make a nice bright orange color I'm using paste food color but you can use the liquid food coloring as well now you're going to need to stir this continuously until it begins to boil once it begins to boil you can stop stirring now I've seen some candy recipes that ask you to add in the coloring and the flavoring after you're done boiling the candy either at the beginning instead of the end and it still worked out okay so I don't think it matters so I'm a mixture has come to a boil now you can stop stirring and you need to continue to boil this until the temperature of the mixture reaches 310 degrees Fahrenheit now in order to be able to tell you've reached the right temperature there's a couple things you can do you can use a candy thermometer these are relatively inexpensive if you're going to make candy often go and buy one because they're really really useful if you don't have a candy thermometer or don't want to go buy one you need to heat your candy until it reaches the hard crack candy stage I'll put a link in the description box that shows you what that means now I turn the heat down just a touch from high to medium high I just made sure that the candy continued to boil until it reached 310 degrees once it reached the right temperature I transferred it into another container that had a spout on it just so that it would be easier to pour once you're done pouring the candy out of the pot into the other container do not scrape down the sides of the pot or the bottom just leave the residue in there and I'll show you how to clean that pot out in a minute now at the beginning you'll notice that your candy mixture will be very runny and I'm going to fill the hard candy molds up first with it you just pour enough in to fill the mold and try not to add so much as if they leak out into the handle or where the lollipop stick is going to go the lollipop sticks I'm using are actually paper and I purchase them at the bulk barn but you can also buy them at candy-making supply stores or baking supply stores so I just push them into the candy and there was a bubble there so I just burst it and push the candy onto the stick now I'm going to fill the cornstarch mold cavities with the mixture same thing just gently pour it in there now I'm very intrigued with this cornstarch method and I think I'm going to try maybe another video and try to make different shapes and this time I'm going to sift the cornstarch in to see if it makes a big difference but you can imagine how much fun you can have with this so I filled in all of the mold cavities and then I added the sucker stick or the lollipop stick I just put it in there gave it a little bit of a turn and then just gently press down on it to sink it into the cornstarch so that it was in the center of the lollipop now another variation that I actually saw on Martha Stewart website was it you can add sprinkles and decorations to these while the candy is still hot these are little fall leaves sprinkles different little maple leaves different colors and while the Candy's hot just sprinkle it on and just gently press it into the candy and let it harden and you've got these little decorated pops you can decorate for absolutely any occasion as you can imagine I had these little pumpkin sprinkles as well so I press some of those now for the freeform lollipops if you're making them freeform without a mold I suggest that you allow your candy to cool a little bit when it cools it won't be as runny and if it's not as runny it'll be easier for you to control the flow and to make nice little round lollipop shapes if the candy is really hot and are really runny it may leak all over the place and you'll get very very thin lollipops the Martha Stewart website actually suggests that if you're making them free freehand like I'm doing here you take your pot when you're done boiling it put the pot into an ice water bath to cool it down a little bit more quickly but since I filled all those other molds first by the time I got to the freeform method it had cooled down quite a bit so as you can see it's a bit harder to get the same size of same shape but it's the same idea you pour it on and then you add in your lollipop stick and you can see here just by looking when I was pressing in these sticks that they had it had cooled significantly and you can even add candies in this case I'm pressing in some candy corns because it was near Halloween time that I was making these and the cool candy had cooled quite a bit so I had to press them in but it still worked quite nicely now as far as cleanup goes when you're done with the pot put it immediately in the sink and fill it with hot water and just the hot water sitting in the pot will dissolve any of the candy that's in there the same thing goes with the rest of your utensils like the this measuring cup that had some candy left in it and any measuring tools you have like a spoon or maybe your candy thermometer put it in let it sit in the hot water and the candy will dissolve all on its own or you can even take the pot and put it back on the stove filled with water and just let the water simmer and you'll simmer away all the candy as well so you can see it's sat there for about an hour a lot of the candy has gone out of the measuring cup and all the candy has disappeared out of the pot as well so it's nice and clean so cleanup is not a nightmare if you just are patient and let it sit in some hot water so I refill but measuring cup with hot water and let it sit and give it a stir every once in a while and the candy will just dissolve right off your container so you're going to let those candy molds cool completely and then you're just going to pop them out of the mold and they should come out quite easily I did spray these a little bit of cooking spray first and they popped right out and they are just gorgeous I was very impressed with this first attempt using these candy molds so there are some flowers the candy stick is cold white adhered to the can you don't have to worry about it falling off and here are some of the ones with the little sprinkles on them and the lollipops are nice and clear so you can see them from this angle which kind of looks like they're floating in the ambi or you can look at it from this side as well pretty cool these are the ones I did free form and they should come right off the silicon mat you'll have a little bit of an imprint from the silicon mat on the back of the lollipops and here are this cornstarch lollipops just take them out tap off the excess and then you can wipe them down with a clean dry towel to get rid of more of the cornstarch and the core starts in the container you can reuse that for baking put it back in the container or you can use it for more lollipop making as well it's completely reusable now here are some of the completed lollipops it made about two dozen of them and they tasted great they tasted just like orange now these this is one of the cornstarch ones and you can see the back of it is not smooth and it actually looks a little like the surface of the Moon it actually holds details quite well which is kind of interesting here's another cool recipe it is for candy apple chips this video will be going live on November 4th 2013 so if you're watching this video after that date please go ahead and click right on your screen or see the link in the description box and if you're watching it before stay tuned for this great recipe thanks for watching", "VeH8zfDrt9k": "[Music] hi welcome to infuse these the cooking show where everything is infused especially me today we're making lollipops this episode is brought to you by the body fast herbal infuse er you can save money on my favorite herbal infusion machine with the cove ruff house at the urban futurecom here's what you need to make infused lollipops you need 1 cup of granulated white sugar I have a cup of light corn syrup or a quarter cup of water and 2 to 3 tablespoons of infused tincture you can use alcohol or glycerin tinctures 2 teaspoons of flavored extract such as orange lemon mint or whatever flavor you like 6 to 8 drops of food coloring which is optional you'll also need some lollipop molds and a candy thermometer the first step is going to be to make your tincture if you don't have one already and you can use a vegetable glycerin or an alcohol tincture either way though you're going to need to deke are you for 250 degrees Fahrenheit for 25 minutes then put them in the hopper of the mighty fast if you're using that machine and then you're going to add in about a liter of 151 proof alcohol you don't want to go to the hundred ninety or any stronger with the herb oil infuser machine it will burn it up and then you choose the mighty long cycle that'll give you the right temperature so that four hours later you have a nice tincture just like this then you just need to strain it through the provided hemp cloth or whatever cheesecloth however you want to strain it out put it in a jar and then you have your your infused tincture that you can use for any kind of recipes such as this here now we're gonna proceed along now with the rest of the recipe we're gonna take our two sugars our that's both the corn syrup and the white sugar or put those into a very small saucepan I'm gonna put that over a medium to medium-high heat and just let it start melting and you also want ahead and add your water and at this point what we're doing is we're just making all this syrup turn into sort of a simple syrup and then we're gonna bring it up to a boil it won't be long all of yours Sugar's will be cooked together it'll turn real clear and start boiling and at that point you want to start monitoring the temperature make sure you have a candy different a candy thermometer that will go up to over 300 degrees because that's we're gonna do we're gonna boil this it'll take a little while but watch it very carefully because it can get hot really fast once it starts getting hot but as soon as it hits 300 degrees exactly we're gonna take that off of the heat [Music] and then that part we're gonna let it start cooling down now you're going to also monitor the cooling process because when eight hits to 250 degrees Fahrenheit that's where we want to start adding in the rest of the ingredients so I'm adding I'm using orange because I want to orange flavored lollipops here so magadh about two teaspoons of the orange flavoring then I'm also I'm heading in some yellow food coloring a little bit of red food coloring to make the orange lollipops and now I'm adding in the tincture you can use two to three tablespoons here I'm adding two I don't want to be too strong but you can add in two to three and you can evaporate it down if you want to first but it's gonna be okay but you can see now when I start mixing anything together it's still 250 degrees so it's going to start evaporating and bubbling out the remaining water for you already we're just going to continue mixing that down by hand very carefully it's still very hot until you see it'll all incorporate together and become very sort of translucent and sort of unified in color and you need to move pretty quickly here because you don't want to the candy to harden up which it does pretty quickly so you can put the lollipop sticks into the molds in advance and you won't have to be rushing through it like we did there but then we're going to pour that carefully pour the candy into the molds until you cover up the sticks of the lollipops and then after you have all your molds filled up you're gonna let that chill best in the refrigerator or freezer for one to two hours till they get fully hardened [Music] and once they're fully hardened you can pop them out of the shells really easy you can use these silicone molds that I used here they're perfect for this this recipe had filled up three of the molds that came with four in the pack but just filled up three of them came with the sticks if you like that

studios thanks for watching [Music] you", "JUHxpsohsrI": "[Music] welcome to my channel I thank you for watching now let's make some candy grapes so let's go over the ingredients for the candy grades now I am gonna give you three recipes they're gonna be in the description box so just check that out one recipe is for a small really tiny badge and that's the one I'm gonna be doing now and then I'll give you two other recipes that are for like a little bit more grapes and one for a lot of grapes so the first thing you are going to need of course grapes I like to use the green grapes you don't have to use green you can use the red grace if you want but me personally I go with green grapes so I just picked these off in the grocery store I have some water back here and this bowl some light corn syrup I have some granulated sugar vanilla and here is a bottle of watermelon flavoring you can use a flavoring if you want to but you do not have to you can just use a vanilla only I have some blue Wilton full coloring this is a gel colors there is some white food coloring any kind of white food coloring that you have if you don't want your candy to be a certain color then you can just go ahead and dip them in clear candy meaning you will not use the white you will not use the blue but if you absolutely want a certain color you want your colors to pop you are gonna have to make sure you use the white and make sure you use the colored food coloring the next thing that I have is I'm gonna be making Jolly Rancher flavored candy grapes I'm also gonna be making some a warhead flavored if you do not want the warhead you can use whatever you want like the fun dip you don't have to use any candy at all so if you want to make your own sour flavoring and then that way you can control how sour it is you can always just purchase some citric acid from Amazon and then you will just mix that citric acid with a little sanding sugar this is just a red Betty Crocker sugar it's just colored red and then you will just take pour some of this in a cup or a bowl and then you will add a little bit of the citric acid to that that's another option you can put nerds on here just do whatever you want so that's it for the ingredients right here as far as food now we're gonna go over the supplies you are gonna need a blender and that's my ninja blender if you are going to be using like the hard candy you need to use a blender and just make sure that your blender is dry your blender is not completely dry your Candy's gonna stick and then that will just cause another problem so just let your blender dry out completely before you chop up this candy the next thing you're gonna need are the sticks now for me I like to use these long sticks I got these sticks from the Dollar Tree you don't have to use those long sticks you can purchase you some regular old toothpicks toothpicks are fine I would suggest if this is like your first time you should get two picks that are at least six inches long that way that would give you some room to stay away from that heat and the reason why I use these long sticks is I was in the fire so I really don't like to get too close to that heat so even though I do make candy apples and stuff and I know everything is hot I still try my best to stay away from getting burned again so the next thing besides the sticks you are going to need a spatula that's my spatula their candy thermometer you can purchase this candy thermometer at Walmart they have different kinds or you can purchase this on Amazon this one in particular I ordered from Amazon but I have actually seen it at Walmart so this is the candy thermometer the same one you're using for your candy apples and then you are gonna need just any kind of pot to cook it and it doesn't have to be any special products and then you are going to need something to place the grapes on when you dip them so here I have a silicone baking mat if you don't have one that's fine you can just use some parchment paper I would suggest spray your parchment paper down with a little bit of cooking spray but you do not have to do that either okay do whatever you feel comfortable doing this is what I always tell you guys so the first thing you are gonna do is you're gonna take your grapes and just take each one off of the vine put it into your bowl and just don't use the ones that are broken like the ones that might have a slit in them just check your grapes and make sure you don't get any of those and you slimy ones and you are gonna clean your grapes the same way you've been cleaning your grapes for years he's just gonna run them under some water if you have some Veggie wash you can just use that veggie wash whatever way you've been cleaning your grapes just keep doing it like that so once you rinse these great all you are gonna use either like a colander or a strainer to just flush out all of that dirt that are on the grates and then leave your grapes sitting you're gonna pour your grapes onto a pay a plate lined with paper towels you're gonna need something that will help you drain all of that water out because the object is to get all the water off as much water as possible so at least let your grapes sit for two hours before you start and I know you might think that's a lot of time so maybe you can go one hour even just don't start dipping your grapes immediately please don't you don't want to have cold grapes don't dip your grapes straight out the fridge don't dip your grapes straight from being washed let them dry and let them become room temperature so that the candy will stick and also you will have less juices drooping out after you make them if it's not so cold and so wet okay so let's say these have been sitting out for two hours so now we are gonna put the sticks onto the grapes so of course it's pretty simple just take your stick place your stick into the side that's smooth you'll see that little tiny dot now you are gonna chop up your candy I am gonna chop up the Jolly Ranchers first so I just got a couple mixed flavors go right into the blender and just chop them up whatever way you like to chop them up there is no wrong or right way some people like I'm very fine almost like a powder and some people like them to be have little bits showing so just do it whichever way you prefer it to be and again like I said make sure your blender is not wet at all you're gonna give it a couple pulses and then I'm gonna check it so right now it's looking like that I'm gonna put them back in a couple more I don't like my finely diced up I like my - order like this it looks so pretty to me so I'm gonna be leaving mine like that and then of course at the bottom you are gonna have a lot of more finer shredded Jolly Ranchers done let's get these warheads so here is the warheads are done I got some green blue and yellow in here I'm just gonna dump this right into so the candy is all finished and I also have two packs of some colossal sour warheads that so I'm gonna be whatever leftover grapes I'll use this for but I only had two packs so I just went ahead and crushed it up using my mallet inside the package now let's get started making this candy this recipe right here is only gonna give you about 35 grapes so if you want to make way more than 35 you're gonna use the second recipe that I posted in the description box if you want to make about 80 or 90 you are gonna want to use like 90 to 100 you're gonna use the third recipe in the description box so first thing you are gonna put in is 1/2 cup of sugar just dump that right in there this just pot didn't have anything in it so just the sugar and then 1/4 cup of corn syrup and 1/4 cup of water then you're gonna start that um I normally like to start mine on medium and I have an electric stove so medium for me is about seven B twenty seven and eight I'll go eight just to speed it up a little more so once you add those three ingredients you just wanna mix it really fast it doesn't have to be fully mixed together just give it a couple of stir it'll mix itself not the bubble start going now for me I normally don't add my thermometer right now I add my thermometer once I hear the bubbles slowing down a little but if this is your first time I do suggest you add the thermometer right away just so that you'll be able to keep a better eye on it and make sure you don't go over the temperature which is 285 degrees Fahrenheit so that's what you're going for so here those bubbles that's the fast bubbles that's not what you're listening for you're listening for the slower about this when they're popping so quick like that that means it definitely is not ready yet you know you hear the bubbles they are slowing down and right now we are at about 200 won seats 110 degrees Fahrenheit and like I say we're going for it to 85 you notice how slow those bubbles are and that's how you know we are at 280 almost to 85 and it's time to take the candy off of the ice so you're gonna turn it off and take it completely off the ice once you take that off of the eye you are gonna add at your full coloring and I like to add just a few drops of white like I said if you aren't gonna be making this special color you can just go ahead and dip this clear do not have to add the white if you want your candy to be clear but if you don't want it to have that translucent candy you absolutely are going to need the white so that's my wife food coloring and now I'm going to add some of this blue here and I use popsicle sticks to get the food coloring out just dip it in there and then you're gonna put that right into our candy mixture and just make everything turn boo now we're gonna add the flavoring and normally I just add vanilla but you can add whatever flavor you want so if you have some flavoring oil you can use the pineapple watermelon they have pina colada they got tutti frutti strawberry whichever they have cotton candy to whatever flavor you would like your grapes to be I am NOT going to be using this today but if you are I suggest you use just a few drops of this are you gonna take and I drop her a brand new eyedropper and you're gonna put in or you can even use a medicine dropper put in about five or six drops of flavoring oil but I'm just gonna be using the vanilla now for the flavoring I'm just adding a few drops of vanilla just right on into my gut and just mix it up and be careful because those vanilla does make it pop a little so just watch your hands and just stir that up now if you are gonna be using vanilla you want a certain specific color you are gonna have to use clear vanilla extract like certain colors you can't use that brown vanilla extract because it will alter the color that you are going for candy is already too dupe so let's get started with this dipping yeah you're gonna take your grape on the stick and just drop it in pull it out and just let it drip for a couple of seconds let that extra candy drip off and then you want to twirl it a little that way you will get rid of that extra ring yeah then you're just gonna take your candy mixture I got my Jolly Ranchers right here and just drop it in there now you can have way coded how some people do it or you can fully code it I like to fully coat mine and as much candy as possible so we got one great here we're gonna keep on going so again I'm gonna take another grape and I am going to cover this one with Jolly Ranchers again like I said let that excess candy drip off and then you're just gonna turn it you'll get it off we're gonna take our Jolly Rancher mix here and just dip and place it on your silicon mat so we're just gonna move right along here nothing just keep it going you move this spatula out the way and get to different if it falls off of your stick because every once in a while you will get a great that falls off the stick just hurry up and grab it out of there it's okay it's no big deal just grab it out of there and I'm just alternating and then I will real quick do some in the powdered water head mixture like I said sometimes that's gonna happen but it's no big deal make sure you fully culture grape all the way to the end of the stick get that extra candy off and then this is going to be the powdered warhead mixture it's gonna be that yeah if for any reason your candy starts to get a little thick on you and starts hardening just pop it right back onto the stove and let it warm up for about 30 seconds however long it takes for your oven or your stove to get it back to this runny liquid farm just be careful and keep an eye on it because you do not want it to start burning if you leave it on too long just keep an eye on it and you might have to rerun your candy a bunch of times but there's no problem with that you can even save this candy and use it a few weeks later you don't have to use it all at once you can pour it onto your parchment paper or you can pour it onto your silicone baking mat and then break it up into pieces once it becomes hard put it in a ziplock baggie and just store it in your cabin until it's time to when you're ready to use it again see like now starting to get a little thick and that's what I'm gonna pop this back onto the stove you see that thickness I put it right back on to the eye just for a few seconds my daughters are gonna eat these grapes for sure by tomorrow afternoon they'll be all gone so on that we all warmed up and ready to start dipping again comes off the stick get it right back on there so that's pretty much it you guys if you have any questions you can always just let me know and I will for sure get back to you guys so that's it y'all and once they are done you're gonna let them try for a few minutes and then they should just fall right off the stick they should pop right off the stick just like that but that that candy match my nails I just know this thing yeah but they'll pop right off the stick and then you can just put these in a container and put them in the refrigerator until you're ready to eat them like I said they're gonna last that long but they should last 24 hours going into two days at the most and these are the grapes now and if you guys have any questions just leave them right in the comment section and I will get back to you thank you guys so much for watching and I'll see you next time", "Xd5r_fFM6d8": "[Music] do [Music] do [Music] all right so one person to take thermometer out one person supervised and one person to record it one more tap otherwise it doesn't happen oh it turns out too many oh no all right it goes nothing oh what is it really it's not nothing flavored right yeah there's no label oh wow yeah nothing smells like flavor i'm doing green apple for the first time so i'm going based on the recommendation that is very green wow very green that looks like ecto cooler the high c oh yeah can you see it on the camera yeah it's very green very green how green is it oh so green berry it's too much green oh yeah that smells like green apple oh yep all right well we kind of had a little we need to put a ton of coffee and coffee oh yeah wow that is really reacting look we should have seen the coffee let's go crazy this looks like very halloween-ish is it all too smoky yes i am getting spooked well your mom should come in here scared she'll make you feel better okay so you can protect me from the boogie man yeah are you saying that because it's green and sort of boogies no my mom just always like uh whenever we were talking about some being scared or something she always said just boogie man it was just like the uh kids she's like yeah just don't worry uh don't get eaten by the boogie man don't get taken by the boogie man don't get attacked by the boogeyman you know don't get sued by the boogeyman yeah exactly stuff like that it's just her go-to now it's mine because you know i was raised by her yeah i guess you can use it she'll watch it no that's pretty lucky yeah those are what is i'm gonna stick the boogie nobody's blown away yet but you guys aren't you're not shooting it down right away which is good i'm just letting everybody taste it first oh okay it tastes like wood it tastes like like it tastes like light green yeah it doesn't taste super green no it's very faintly green yeah i think it needs more two more plus if you imagine for sure it's like eating a little bit yeah we could probably get another at least two more shots yeah oh they really the fun shops so the green apple's gonna go in the same bag as apple pie flavor right yep very happily oh yeah people who eat this will live happily ever after keep the doctor away for sure i mean that's true for candy too apple flavored things [Music] all right you ready to hand out spoons sir oh you know it corn man don't your wife get jealous all right this is going to be the one right correct knew it i knew it you sure did those of you tasting green apple at home be sure you wash your candy before you eat it it's a free-range flavor you don't know where it's been man this is gonna be a fun one to scrape out of the kettle yeah it seems like it's pretty sticking pretty hard oh yeah what was that the first one was pumpkin right yep uh there was like a quarter inch layer in the whole kind of just got you guys just have to throw out the kettle yeah yeah we went down to the 100 year old kettle store got another one it's getting there you might as well put the rest of it in cool oh man that's really struck my tooth mine too because it's still warm yeah that keeps happening to me too that was for me biting it with my teeth i don't know if you can see yeah there's the string yeah that's still fun so stuck to my tooth that's why i don't find it i just like kind of i feel like a lollipop that's when i get the wood flavor so i tried to just like get a little nibble up and wrong with that that's natural yeah you vegans are into that it's natural like grandma used to make at one time [Music] you better do another half shot whatever yeah it's like 10 my third third feels like i tried raspberry and it wasn't but i mean it's still give it a little bit of tartness if it puts them in i think that would be good a couple of tablespoons or something and we'll taste it afterwards yeah and cool that so we'll make it like kind of like the orange is that six and there's an 18 pound batch now it's like two three four tablespoons so yeah i think i think six teaspoons in that one you want to be like that you want to be more like a lime which is a little tarter yeah let's go for tartar okay because we already have the apple pie which this tastes nothing like which is good they're very different but yeah let's go for tartar okay tartar sauce that we're probably not really the best uh hard candy flavor yeah i don't think so i mean it sounds weird but it could be fantastic just like chocolate conversation if that sounds weird that's great yeah oh boy this one might be more like a 15-pound batch i'm not scraping it yeah really good luck throwing it yeah oh my god maurice is not sticking to the cuddle yeah we got that going for us or anything else making a lollipop right now max you're so strong yeah that's what they tell me have you found so some of the other flavors have also stuck to the kettle well it's from the taste test you know it just gets colder and colder because when we added the 10 shots to the coffee because it's the coffee isn't it yep yeah that one took a while to doing that yeah all right i'll go get steve after this i'm scraping it like with the the back end of the scraper i need to specially modify a scraper that can stand up to this yes flexible but still rigid all right you can barely even tell there's any candy in there yeah good job [Music] oh yeah see it bouncing yeah two five only four fighter oh what are we doing what are we doing uh wait for the color yeah full green's fine full grain perfect yeah it's already colored just be hard to unless you're gonna do like light green and dark i was like maybe like pull a scrape out or something yeah oh yeah yeah this table's worked out pretty good i know there's a lot of nostalgia behind the the old marble one this one offers a lot less headaches i think that's all we're getting shards of candies you got the rusty thing with a scraper oh it might go flying everywhere that's not too good charging dust that's about it yeah it's cooling down pretty good fill a little bit before you want the hook just a little minute all the candy out of there looks like a brand new old kettle that's exactly what it is did you grace the hook yeah all right wait that hook oh no i did the one on the counter oh it'll be fine so no no not this time too early i guess it's still a little green huh oh thanks for the real laugh yeah it was real totally yeah that was a real fun x well we saved half of it that's cool is your foot okay you just put it on my foot's fine yeah you're looking at your shoe well it's all good dude we got six flavors so it fell off that happens to fall off the hook don't do that don't worry it's gonna come out of carrots paycheck yeah for real sarah bad news i don't know if you're going to be eating this week well she could eat the spare candy yeah yeah yeah let's take it out of the garbage come on it's like a thousand calories right there's dinner it all tastes good that's honestly still like a pretty decent amount of candy yeah that's like most of it yeah i mean we're only doing 18 pound batches yeah and we're going to mix it in though yeah this is a custom badge all right i i gotta get the next match going too though yeah all right yeah at least got to get the water in there and turn that on you want me to put a tripod on and do the thing down there or if you want to if you think that'd be good for the video but um if you're more comfortable doing that i got this this is this is still pretty pretty yeah i mean i think it'd be interesting to see someone do both i don't think i've ever seen that before okay yeah all right why not it's still wicked soft though i don't know i might even get back on the hook for that yeah dad you seem you seem pretty upset with your mustache i can tell yeah that's a nice about the little dude i don't go throw that on the floor again italian christmas donkey something about the walking through the alps of italy or something yeah yeah i think that this probably just cooled off the rest of the way while i was switching gloves oh let's yeah though that's a nice color though yeah yeah there's plenty plenty of color in that uh food coloring i mean if you told me that was 18 pounds i believe whatever it is yeah yeah really yeah it's a little more easy to manage now isn't it yeah way easier well it's like a lot colder now too you think i just went on the hook a little too early uh that could be part of it um i'm not saying this to be nice though like really like the past few times i've had to like try to pull it out differently to get it to like go uniform because i've been getting like real lumpy bits and then like you know the thin spots on the hook and like it really wants to fall off and the lumber parts on its way to the ground that looks like an apple right yeah every week every week every batch that only a beer will solve well it's almost five me too oops my bad i'm almost wondering too because like they remember i was saying on the pumpkin how it almost felt like a bike tire like it felt like inflated i wonder if there is like a different water content in these uh flavors you know that's why it's bubbling up when we put them in there yeah definitely seem to have marble reactions i was trying to see if it's water-based or glycol or what but i don't think there's even ingredients on the bottom it's something soft yeah were you thinking the same thing you're just looking at it does it feel like yeah yeah i like has the candy felt like this all day i think so oh yeah a little softer huh yeah i mean you had 10 shots to it like [Applause] snake green apple do you remember the green snake that was at the zoo and it was always coiled up on the tree branch there was that one in the big yellow one i remember one time i was at the zoo and i was talking a snake and then my my husband was really like pressed up against the glass and then the glass just disappeared boy the snake came out and started chasing him and then and then my uh aunt and uncle they made me go back to my bedroom under the stairs and i was grounded for a week man that sounds like magic or something i don't know man i just unexplained got yourself in a pretty hairy situation huh you know i never i never put that together but what's the only other dudley you've ever heard of no one definitely do right right like do right you've never heard of the new ray i don't even know i just know i've heard that oh maybe he's from the old cartoons or something does he do right yeah hannah barbera remember the episode of the office where ryan starts telling the story about uh the lion king and saying that heaven is like my cousin mufasa how does kevin ruin it what's he say is that like sticking into there a lot more too yep oh wow you seem like good flavor warm candies sticky uh you want to finish this one this one up yeah a little bit for the camera and stuff oh come on you got your cap shoes on and everything those are my orthopedic shoes oh well they're very stylish what were those do you remember those shoes they were supposed to like make your butt round you don't remember those they're like really round yeah they're like this big too where are they sketchers oh they look like i forgot about them remember dad remember when you guys got his moon shoes for christmas do you just like stuff your feet and they're just giant rubber bands i wonder if it made you jump any higher because like it also kind of weighed you down yeah although it did it did make everything springier but that makes you heavier it was like there wasn't enough resistance yeah in the vans where like you would just kind of sink all the time yeah just made you think more yeah yeah helmets yeah yeah really what were the sock'em poppers is that what the ones that went on your hands were called just like the blow off things yeah they're great [Music] i'm trying very gently with those i'm sure a lot of fights got started and finished with those plus but nobody i knew ever had two pairs so it was always like okay you get the left one just a perfect amount well that's a sad little batch any difference i don't think so oh no there's flex in there it's like totally evaporated so we're just gonna smell [Music] yeah you could definitely see beans in there but i don't know if there's enough in this one shot here oh i just made enough of the beans it it smells pretty strong so i want to taste it before we you know especially since it's extract not flavoring it does smell really good all right um you guess what i mean it kind of smells like it's going back to just like plain candy smell now yeah go right there i mean a lot of the aroma does evaporate that's true that's kind of chicken now are you going to put some of the powder in first you should i just want to see where we're at yeah i mean it's probably nothing but if i just i just wanna i just wanna make sure okay where are we going pizza man that's delivery as soon as your pizzas are baked can you deliver them to karen please yeah i'll bring them out in a minute that'd eight uh but that's that's in a full batch and this is essentially a half match of that so hopefully we'll be able to get away a little more um what do you want to do with this i mean a tablespoon or a teaspoon i don't think a tablespoon we could try and see what happens um this is just like crushed vanilla beans yeah there's special kind though i can't remember my favorite one of those items was eighty dollars thirty dollars yeah vanilla is expensive it's so it was so good vanilla bean it was a while ago so i can't really remember but it was crazy expensive for the size of the bottle yeah i'm thinking a little powdered one was 30 bucks see how this comes out of here maybe i won't do it over there just in case yeah [Music] really smell good and then again it smells a little better i think i think it kind of smells like that the high lull or whatever you're supposed to say that i'm not gonna like it reminds me like a candlestick all right i mean again at the end of that it kind of all went away but you guys want to taste this anyway very nice put in a couple of shots of vanilla you know why you're gonna eat it this is the other stuff it does yeah it smells good i just didn't it just didn't taste much okay two two [Music] can always get you another one if you need it oh [Music] [Applause] that's all i got get down for this one too uh sure use as much feedback as we can yeah take it around i can run [Music] okay i'm getting good at reading the faces after these this kind of tastes like candy sweet don't no taste like much no vanilla there now another tough one it's tough to get it strong enough i tell you what what i already told you keep on two shots of vanilla so that's ten of these two of the other ones let's go for an even fifteen [Music] see what i don't know what you're even talking about we don't make mistakes here no nobody does oh no maybe [Laughter] [Music] 82 degrees you better hurry oh man that's pretty warm in here yeah no i it's like pushing it through corn syrup again i'm gonna make fun scraping it out again oh you know it i'm almost thinking about turning the kettle back on that's the funnest part right i like it but you know what i've been hugging all the fun i'll let joe do it this time i'll watch both of your heads safety first man see how cold that is that's doing better than the last batch yeah just kind of crazy because it was in there for a long time gotta get my finger strength up is it hurting your arms haven't to you know resist all the force that i'm putting on a cutter looking nicer very nice yeah probably feels like my wrist is gonna break [Music] oh yeah there's no candy in there at all thank goodness for sinks huh yeah because i mean it's probably pretty cold coming out of the kettle and i got to do all this stuff yeah yeah all right let's go take a look it's the last kettle though at least so what are we doing stripes all white i'm pretty sure just pulling the whole thing calling it you got voices are supposed to be the color there you go no problem okay joe good work joseph try some soup we're all counting on you we're all counting on you to try that soup potato thing yeah it's cool a mashed potato soup no it's smashing no there's not mashed potatoes is there something it is okay potatoes like sausage or something like that and and kale all cooked and maybe spinach i'm not sure there's other stuff in there about i don't know what it it's good though yeah yeah i haven't tried it yet max's mind always makes us a bunch of food yeah the e-best vegan she sure is nice okay yeah i just want to say good work dad thanks we're all counting on you i know can you just hammer this it's hammer time oh thanks oh yeah you can see the flex in there the vanilla so see how it makes it smoother it's the canvas that's the secret canvas gloves probably helped too yeah it's only touching canvas it makes it shiny showing it up look at that you're doing good dad oh boy let me just turn the fan on there goes sounds like an airplane taken off okay all clear your clearance clearance i'll do roger oh that's one of the tribeca there's one more clearance you ever been to a turkish prison i said that one time someone who didn't get the joke that i've never seen an airplane they were like what yeah oh yeah who doesn't go there right you haven't seen the travel mags that turkish prisons are all the rage all the influencers on instagram are here you got pictures with the prisoners yeah i can go back i go sit down on the real you know i heard there's a growler in the fridge so yeah it's not gonna drink itself you know no no well you didn't spring for the new fancy self-driving drivers so [Music] hmm [Music] good it's pretty soft man a little it's kind of cold too long so well that's what we were saying maybe it's from putting all the flavoring in i mean this you want to guess how many shots are in this one six uh nope nope nope really more more oh won't be using this again that costs too much oh yeah this is this is like this is it it's like at least 100 pounds this is like around equivalent to like what 15 shots or so 15 shots yeah yeah plus the crushed uh specialty beam whatever that is uh one of the easiest flavors and it was a one a very strong one well even when i first started like that's when we still have the two fold i think of us and you can put like two or three shots in it yep yeah i mean all the shots if you look for the queen book they all used to be like like two shots at the most you know and now it's like at least three shots how'd it feel to be pulling out a batch again like riding a boy you guys want to see how long we can not talk to it won't last yeah i know no jake oh yeah do you really have to say it every time kevin it's really good it's like one of the best needs like as he's unwrapping it the whole office starts to look at him like yo put it down kevin don't feel like there's sales people too and they're like no no phone calls what are you looking at checking the time it's time for you to work max still two o'clock you got time to look for the clock when you you got too much time if you got time to look you've got time to work yeah work cody i'm not paying you to look at the clock you know some places at work that's a legitimate statement i'm not kidding you're a dalton i might want to keep the camera back yeah hurry up dad what am i paying you for um beer i i don't know what are you paying me for wait you're paying me uh no oh that's a first i meant you're paying me yeah what are you paying me for european european european if you're american when you go in the bathroom like just one of them these are really sticky yeah i noticed that they've been really sticking to the uh the metal cutterizer yeah yeah the metal smacky thing we even know all the technical terms of hercules yeah you lost me with all the technicalities uh sorry so we got so many different flavors that i figured we'd just do like a round table of each one so you guys want to start blue raspberry so this is the blue one blue raspberry i just got the slow motion video of this i didn't get actual videos appreciate the color good job max it does look very cotton candy it's kind of like the like we did the cream video with this that's this is actually gonna be the um the cotton candy replacement for now tastes just like a dum-dum mm-hmm it's not nice it's just like a smart smart that's really good though i really i feel like that flavor is nailed yeah well bananas now they got it all right so while we're doing vibrant flavors we'll do cranberry next so this is what the cranberry one looks like hey craig fyi we've done cranberry before so you don't have to do this one if you don't want to no uh we haven't done it whatever well like taste for sure okay yeah i dropped it so we're not doing this no we're doing [Music] that's really good it's pink it tastes more sweet than because i feel like usually cranberry juice is like kind of tart let's just taste sweet oh you guys eat it without me yeah no i can't eat it it's news you lose should we add citric acid do you think to the cranberry yeah oh craig said the juice tends to be tart depends what you want i think it tastes good yeah that's pretty good that's very cranberry this is like the biggest pizza arcane i've ever heard in my mouth so far so far [Music] no cigar green apple coming up you've been asking for this one for a while huh yeah yeah you know we finally got to it ready ready oh no are we doing that oh it's a tiny bit sour like i wouldn't describe it sour but oh yeah i got a little i got a little tart there it's not exactly a warhead but yeah just taste way more green apple than when we tasted it on the stick i think we got it reminds you a little of sour straws there's no sausage they could even be more sour how many citric acids did you use three three three three three three six three teaspoons or three tablespoons yep that's pretty good though i like that one nailed it didn't know it at the time so this one you can kind of see like a little flecks of vanilla i don't know if you can really see it on camera but in person and if you were to order it it's kind of hard to see yeah where would it be really close let me see this is going to be part of the um what do they call it oh it's going to be festive a taste of fallout name okay taste the fruit flavors fall unfriendly um the vanilla will be in there um we probably won't make this again because unless we do it separately it took about nine hundred dollars for the flavor it's seriously the most flavor we've ever finished there's something max and i wouldn't want to try a long time remember we tried the cherry vanilla once yeah and the vanilla wasn't very vanilla this this it didn't know when we tasted it on the stick it wasn't very vanilla-y do you have it in your mouth yeah like this it is now there are 15 out of here so now it is so i think that's gonna be awesome i really like this one are you more of a chocolate person craig no i think it's just like it's tough to get the flavor because like you saw like it tasted really weak now it tastes really strong are you a vanilla guy in general i think so usually yeah i'm still getting hard candy it tastes a little to me it tastes a little strong for vanilla i'm tasting the vanilla now but i think it's just right i like it is it good yeah it's good maybe if we did all extract instead of the extract and the flavoring like you know how we did the maple with the canadian maple and the regular maple and it kind of you know we kind of lost a little bit of the maple-ness and we did that with in a cream mm-hmm okay then we never had a maple pear candy hmm that would have been a good flavor well the reason we did is because it's so hard to get things mapley enough and to me it tastes more mapley because of the walnuts that we sprinkle on top yeah that brings out the maple otherwise it's not very maple you know you could put a whole bottle in there and it still wouldn't be very meat fully i believe this is coffee um cover up your face this one's coffee there we go pumpkin pumpkin coffee's got the street that's coffee the hat's like in real life does everybody here like coffee no poor crack that's coming through pretty good for someone who doesn't really like coffee though i kind of like this for me it's not like super overpowering or like it's not very bitter maybe that's why because there's a lot of sugar i don't remember caffeine yeah coffee with sugar kind of reminds me of the peanut butter molasses it kind of reminds me of like mocha flavored ice cream yeah i could drop one of these in your coffee well that's yeah right yeah coffee flavored coffee that would never work double coffee all right so the last one is pumpkin pumpkin saved the best food pumpkin pie pumpkin spice yes this is this is the best one and this is the that's the biggest piece of hard candy i'm ever going to have yeah it's a big that's a hawker mine's got diamonds huh why don't you special i can tell you're apparently is that what i always sounded like to you you could just see your legs [Music] and then you did the dance that's really good and this one even has a little texture to it because what you had we added actual pumpkin spice so you can get some little little granules of uh rice yeah i kind of like it i do do you grab something really good everybody's gonna like these this is good these are all good this is the best one really good that's a good slogan dad everyone's gonna like these it's good but this is the best horny stuff you should put that on a shirt you should put it on the building um what does that say yeah i like the pumpkin i mean i like them all but i'm glad we stopped for the pumpkin we did flavor i would eat pie crust pie i totally would i love pie crust wonder bread hard candy oh boy gravy okay i've been saying gravy like not ironically for a long time if we could fill ribbon candy with gravy what about gravy cream it'd be so good gravy cream yeah wrapped in turkey okay interesting i'd have a short shelf life yeah two hours really we can do mashed potato instead and it's then it's vegan if we use the vegetable shortly greg did honey baked ham and a bunch of thanksgiving yeah right i think he did cornbread he deserves stuffing wow the ham tasted just like him can't go wrong with pecan pie i'm pretty sure i saw um maybe brock's the company makes a candy corn i think they were doing some thanksgiving flavored stuff so they must have got the idea from greg yeah from lofty pursuits if you're wondering who we're talking about that is a lot of person soups it is ham flavored candy actually that one is pretty good just yeah the ham i like the stuffing one didn't really do it for me yeah but the ham i mean it could be sweet salty savory that all works i wonder if he's doing it again this year no probably i don't know i don't think he likes to repeat himself too much we love to review that all the time that's all we do yeah basically because people keep asking for it so we can make the people happy or not make the people happy it does seem to be a good business model to make the people happy maybe you should write that down you can sell it on a t-shirt i'll do that right now yeah all right good work guys okay hey guys littlejoe here reminding you to like the videos and subscribe [Music] paper", "fZwPhSCIlLI": "today I'm going to be making cinnamon rock candy it's actually a pretty easy thing to do except it takes a long time to do it about an hour but it doesn't have very many ingredients as long as you can babysit it for a while you're good to go it's actually a pretty easy thing to do so I have 3 and 3/4 cup sugar 1 more 1 and 1/4 cup of corn syrup 1 cup of water and you'll need a teaspoon of red food coloring and a teaspoon of cinnamon oil and you can get the cinnamon oil at a cake food store they don't normally sell it or you can buy it online now you're gonna dump your sugar in the corn syrup the water you'll do a teaspoon the red food coloring turn it on to medium-high heat and what you're going to do stir it in all together will start to melt together here but this will become very syrupy you're going to let this boil on medium high heat stirring occasionally and this process takes about 15 minutes to do to get it to boil ok so when it comes to a boil then I have to take a lid and stick that on there for three minutes okay so now my sugar crystals are all dissolved so I'm going to take the lid off and mature my fan on now and it's going to be nice so then I'm going to take now I'm going to take my candy thermometer stick it right on the edge just like that I'm gonna go up I need it to get to 300 degrees before I can call it good here so it'll just go up a little bit and this will process will probably take about 20 to 25 minutes depending on how high your so yours going to leave it you don't stir it you just let it go and you'll let it boil and come check it often okay so well that's just cooking we're going to prepare for our next part of this and you want to get like an ax I think this is 11 by 16 just a piece of tinfoil so it's got a wall on each side because you don't want your candy sticking to the pan at all for touching the pan so once you get that done you're gonna take either butter or margarine something doesn't matter and what I do I stick it on a napkin I know this is weird but I'm give it a good heavy coat because it is hard to get the candy off of this if it is not buttered it's just about done I'm going to dump a teaspoon of cinnamon oil in that and then I'm going to take it over here and I know this is a crazy setup but it really does work I've set a fan I'm going to open my window and all the steam from the sin roll because it's very potent is going to go out the window and not in my house and I'm going to dump it on my tray here that we've got buttered okay this is ready to go so I'm going to take this down I'm going to be very careful and you should too nuts you don't want to burn the inside of your nose and so I'm going to shut my heat off dump that in I'm going to turn my fountain it's not going to do anything until I stir it and then it's going to go crazy let me get out of the way make sure it's good and stir it in they're going down here is not open here we go now we're going to do this select your cow don't try to scoop it out or just whatever's in there they kind of rock it back a core just to make sure it's to the corners and there's your tray of silicon okay so once it's hardened for about 45 minutes I will go ahead and put a piece of wax paper over the top of it to keep it from getting stuff on it and so it's nice for you and you can keep it like this for overnight if you need to so next thing I'm going to do I'm going to leave this on here while I crack it so I've washed at the end of a hammer and I'm just going to take it and that's it so I got to do okay so the next part after you have hammered it you're going to flip it over and so the wax paper is now on the bottom and I've already peeled off all of the tinfoil so you just peel it off and put that aside so this is kind of what it looks like any next you're going to take some powdered sugar and I have a sifter and you can sprinkle it on but I feel like this does a pretty good job and what I do is just sift it over the candy and then once you're done you call it good then what you do you can get little gift bags like this I like to get them after Christmas every year because then they're super cheap not that they're already cheap but they're now they're super cheap and then you just take your little scooper here up with the bait down so you can see and I'm guessing I can do about ten ten bags worth per batch that I do but I don't seal them up until I know for sure that I have enough in each bag so that's it and what I'll do is just take a little tie tie it around and sometimes I'll even so there's your little cute bag of candy it's really fun sometimes they'll take ribbon and put it around - and tied someone's name on it but that's how you make cinnamon candy from start to finish um thanks for listening", "iOkqiDqfCPY": "right now you go on so is it this is the 20 pound bench

people won't complain I'll give people some time to file until don't miss anything Hey that's all right now [Music] you [Music]", "VEiE_EhsW6Y": "a warning from police in Westchester County tonight about cannabis candy they discovered some during a bust last week and now one police chief wants to warn parents that these marijuana infused treats could easily be confused by kids for the real thing Marcus solace has a story police admit it wasn't the arrest of the century an alleged low-level marijuana dealer busted in Tarrytown this week but it's more than buds that were seized there's THC in liquid form attachments for e-cigarettes and what's most troubling for the police chief edibles in the form of gummy candy I feel very strong that there is no need to put it in the form of something that's very attractive all to young children Chief John barber Len says the issue isn't whether recreational use of marijuana should be legal in New York as it is in several states and most recently in Canada his concern is the marketing of certain products containing THC there's two issues here hey is it an attraction to younger people that really shouldn't be making that decision and B what is the possibility of accidental exposure the chief points to a Journal of the American Medical Association study that found in Colorado the number of children hospitalized due to accidental exposure jumped 34% so could the sugary stuff be mistaken for something harder the similarities are striking down to the same shape and coloring of the products so if I was to put this on my counter with my ten-year-old daughter home what's to say she's not gonna pick it up and he didn't think it's a gummy worm from CBS who was to say the difference a difference he says parents should be aware of", "7u9fkP3_bFI": "all right well we're back uh for some reason when i i was doing that last night from my cutout i think just because of the wi-fi um it was just still live and i had to delete the other

deal but for us it's a big deal and then saturdays usually we leave at four o'clock though which is nice we've got everything more under control than when we first moved in here everybody's trained now how to make candy so that's made a big difference and then finally getting the second rover to really be up and running yeah we figured out how to use it better someone wants to know how long does it take for the bills sorry sorry um someone asked asked about the like the buffalo bills and somebody asked also how long did it take to make a batch and i kind of mixed up both of those things how long was the time to make the bills yeah now how long did it take to make one of the bathrooms like from uh pouring it uh pulling it all out i think an hour and a half and then nem said sundays are for footballs how about them builds oh yeah that's great they're playing for great ball somebody else had strawberry cheesecake candy canes and mom has actually been looking into getting uh yeah

is anybody asking about candy canes and if we sell them and stuff uh no i don't think people asked about that actually so you guys tell them well um because the the store is still close to foot traffic we're going to try selling them online like we do with ribbon candy with the warning that they might break they might not be able to hang on your tree you know they're broken enough but we're gonna try it out we'll bubble pack the heck out of them and uh give it a shot and i'm sure people will let us know how it works out all right that's all i have to say about that all right i'm gonna go

you're like that's like the perfect size for me but i just got a great trick stick with the skinny one in between too how many paints are the more lines we can get actually are you doing shipping now

found a solution yeah look at the order crazy huh do you think it'll work oh i don't know uh yeah i think people are commenting about the what the store looks like right now because now this is just like storage out here well not only that we're actually having um led lights installed so everything's called virgin plastic because they're almost done but they're going to come back on monday and finish the job so you've got new leds in your office yep and those three on the end out here yeah i think they did some of them down there you can tell they're looking at them yeah yeah some of them look kind of different um yeah like these ones look really nice and then there's like well that one definitely oh ava thank you for the super chat you're not gonna focus on the credit card i can't i can't see that from here it's probably like 720p you know just want to be sure about that craig thought you dyed your hair hairnet oh yeah all right uh let me know when you're doing shipping all right i thought it was going to be fine i'm getting a little chilly you know because you're cold heart because of the fans not not even these ones knee slapper huh someone said what is this blurry pixel screen i think if you go to settings and then you click on higher quality you're funny yeah yeah this is what i look like guys either that or maybe reset your wi-fi well that's what i was thinking for half a second like you know how like on the the old youtube videos you could send it to like 2 40. yeah i was like you did you accidentally hit like a keybind or something i think uh it just goes to auto and then it just depends on the person's wifi at home well that stinks yeah what are they gonna have like perfect wifi do you think we'll ever get there no well cara said it it's all over nope hayden says are you brothers yeah kara and i are brothers but um nothing can hit him i know he's lighting my gloves on i can't hit him right now uh later i'll hit him right chris and aids if you got a tattoo i mean it's kind of it's kind of cliche but i like the uh what do they call the ovarus's or whatever the snake eating its own tail i don't know i like the idea of yeah maybe i'll just get that one yeah just get um a smurf on your arm so i love that i think eating its own tail max is a north mythology thing yeah but it just it bites with my whole world tyler i feel like you would be good at trivia i am i know a bunch of useless things that you should never know but you never came with us not that i would know when did you invite them i don't know like at least once those elder scrolls awesome well max me tyler and what are you doing this whole time for trying to walk around we've all played many many many hours of skyrim i don't know i mean we're probably average like 3 000 000-ish hours i mean it's not that much it's over 15 years and oblivion yeah and i've played a little bit of morrowind can you play john guard too or john sir no no i just uh yeah just those three it was mostly oblivion and skyrim i mostly collect cones of duncar yeah i'll be doing this your thing that's okay well we're gonna have to stay somewhat away from um so we don't see people's personal information but i figured this would be something kind of interesting to see it's written in between batches okay so basically we take the order here you go you can take a look if you want okay and if you're watching you know it's yours right i'll tell you where it's from it's from dallas texas okay so if you're from dallas texas and you ordered some hard candy this is your order and your name's emily i've said too much yeah they're going to be able to hunt her down and take her candy away so we just have these little boxes that we collect our goodies in and we just go around and collect the goodies so you want to be very careful to check your skew this skew is zero zero eight oh five make sure it's the same spew that's on the order because we have a lot of different types of hard candy like taste of fall hard candy looks kind of similar to the fruit and friendly or karen calls the taste of fall fruits of the forest i don't know where that came from but that's she's calling it so who am i to argue but yeah you want to check your skews you can't lose if you check your skews and we're getting very close to being out of the spice hard candy to think that this is a hard candy that started it all yeah this that's all we used to make with spice that was it you guys just made used to make it one bag out of the year yes and we were scaling back and scaling back to just 63 pound batches because we just weren't selling as much as we used to 63 pound batches well 63 pounds all together in one day it was it was 64. seven nine pound batches because we're selling so little bit we're like you know what let's just not do it anymore yeah but you know we then i think it started selling when you started the youtube channel at hemon street so then i was like you know what when we move over to the new place i want to make something called fruit and friendly because we do the fruit and from the we did it for ribbon candy and people really liked that so i was like i want to try that but then it just snowballed into oh my goodness we make a lot of hard candy with different flavors and we keep coming up with new ones and we can't stop ourselves and now you guys even have like single batches of like watermelon strawberry lemonade that's what i'm talking about is just never thought that would be such a big thing but it is i mean that's basically what greg does that um lofty pursuits he does i mean he does do some assorted but he also does lots of single flavors and it works for him and guess what it works for us too yeah people like the hard candy no yeah charlotte said you're a hard candy shop now okay now um i just pulled the wrong stuff somehow because you're talking to me yeah i've got two tropical medley and one spike oh i know you know what this box the tropical medley this is all we have left is the tropical medley oh yeah i'm sure people watching are like no you took the wrong box yeah this box belongs here and this is the one where i pulled the stuff and checked the skews because it's like hey that just doesn't match yeah i'm sure anybody watching picked up on that but yeah when you're narrating and stuff mistakes happen it sure does this is emily's first order so she gets a catalog and a pen and a magnet but yeah this is the guys are really happy with the how the colors came out super vibrant and even the the uh taste of fall with the pumpkin spice and the coffee and whatnot yeah so yeah we've had a lot of fun yeah looks good and it tastes even more good more glitter or even mm-hmm that's for sure you know because greg at lofty pursuits was it last year the year before he did thanksgiving flavored he had like stuffing flavor and uh great do you have gravy oh i don't i didn't actually try any of them i don't think i was i was here when you guys tried the honey baked ham was like it was good yeah it's like kind of sweet and salty and savory because you don't really think savory and hard candy goes that one's pretty oh and there was like a cornbread oh yeah who doesn't like cornbread yeah uh heather sent a 5 canadian super chat says hi from canada it's nice to finally catch a live stream you guys should do strawberry rhubarb cream candy strawberry rhubarb cream i know that makes a good pie i don't know if i've seen a rhubarb flavor did you strawberry though yes we have a strawberry uh tina sent me five dollar super chat i have severe anxiety and depression and watching you guys helps ease that for me well that's good we've heard that a lot yeah we never saw that coming but apparently we ease a lot of minds let's put it that way yeah well apparently whatever ails you will fix you up yeah just by watching someone make some candy well lots of people like to watch us from the hospital if they're trapped there because of the covet or something else um and then they get their nurses in on it oh really people said that yeah yeah that's funny so our craig johnson said gobble gobble gobble gobble there back at you uh oh someone also granted uh thanksgiving candy as well right here yeah oh we did okay see i'm too i don't have time to even look at our own channel so unfortunately i can't look at greg's either yeah oh a d says i see you nurse here can confirm exactly uh someone said oh someone else just said where's everyone else from uh try cranberry oh we've done cranberry hard candy recently yeah actually that's in the fall um the taste of fall assortment and an occasion we'll put it in the um fruit and friendly because the fruit and friendly that that changes all the time oh yeah because we just have so many and we'll do anywhere from seven to nine flavors for per batch so you guys usually like to have mostly fruit and like what water is usually friendly yes butterscotch well we don't eat butterscotch as much as because that's now a single flavor oh okay but root beer butterscotch we could do coffee i don't know i i i'm a little reluctant because not everybody likes coffee and children don't like coffee yeah so let's say we've got in our fall assortment but we'll see if people want to at some point we'll do uh a separate coffee flavor oh someone said all grape i haven't had too many requests for that but that is sometimes um one of the choices in the fruit and friendly and it's also one of our pbj choices so usually you'll do an all bag of one type of candy if there's a lot of requests for it basically exactly not enough requests like the lemonade the strawberry lemonade butterscotch is this for the same disney new order oh it was a different order yep butterscotch and so for a lot of this stuff that does need a cold pack you guys will pretty much just fill like everything except for the cold pack and just leave it to do that on monday that is correct and we don't ever ship anything that has a cold pack we do not ship it over a weekend today is going to be my first fedex home delivery pickup on a saturday we will be doing that for a little while until the end until christmas but um i don't think it speeds up the process at all it doesn't seem to get there any faster but it just clears it out of here so today we don't really have a ton to send them but yeah very soon we will so yeah because usually this would be open house day instead it's closed house day and yeah in livestream day uh linda sent a five dollar super chat i wish i could get ribbon candy shipped to california sad face it's uh linda ballard do you know her but you can have any of the filled ribbon candies obviously the thin stuff will bust but any of the filled ones are fine we ship it all the time and we get mixed reviews some people say it was perfect some people say it was smash some people say they get one of each so there's not a lot of rhyme or reason to it but we have had pretty good luck with it uh catalina 75.00 thank you for all the videos and happy thanksgiving thank you catalina and happy thanksgiving to you uh it's definitely an 8.99 new zealand out of super chat hi from new zealand i wish it wasn't so expensive to send candy here i can offer max new zealand citizenship better than a canadian one while them is fighting words oh boy yeah we kind of want to keep max yeah why was he is he jumping ship uh yeah i should go tell him that now he's got a new zealand offer oh okay well i i would offer to keep him here too okay yeah just tell him all right uh five dollar chat from jc hi from south australia hope sticky oz apologizes to you guys that was funny that was a funny live stream um what uh oh yeah so max you've got an offer for a new zealand citizenship oh look at you've just been involved yeah and they had some fighting whereas they said that it's even better than canadian citizenship listen i love both i've always wanted to go to new zealand oh yeah i love flight of the concords which i'm sure that everybody from new zealand is sick of hearing lord of the rings it's beautiful some of the coolest hops are grown in new zealand uh the last homely houses he says kate here craig i just want to say how much i'm loving the intros uh some of the recent videos so good hello to you all my favorite family oh well thank you super chat and uh thank you guys i'm glad you've been enjoying the uh the intros i gotta say i've really been enjoying the kids right i am dylan yeah yeah it's been a lot of a lot of work on dylan's part pretty much almost exclusively i'll just give him some input but he does like all the editing for them most of them uh gene says terry if y'all could package coffee and cream hard candies separately i would buy over a dozen bags please coffee and cream do we have cream hard candy or what i guess i don't know exactly what you mean by that i know you made my coffee maybe like the flavors like toffee cream like do that though when will we be selling candy canes on the website i think later tonight oh he's already having flavor orange orange glad oh this is tyler's favorite yeah i can definitely smell this one yeah this is one of my favorites too this doesn't burn much milder yeah that hardly ever makes you cry still stronger but it's milder yeah and these are 21 pound badges so i guess i think you get over 300 candy canes per batch or so no one said we do lives now omg yeah we've been doing live streams actually since uh in the basement um just not a lot yeah but uh yeah when the when the wi-fi uh allows we do yeah you can't always count on it i think maybe if we start resetting the live stream or we resetting the wi-fi right before live streams maybe that will help because mom reset the wi-fi like earlier when it uh cut out how do we should i go open the door no we want to shut up oh we do want to shut up yeah when we're adding the flavor so it doesn't go out there and get on the chocolate okay and then when do you want it to be open again uh afterwards we've been following the candy out for a little while cinnamon cheese sandwiches our super chat says you're dead resembles helga love your camera no way how was the wife man in the basement you look like a girl steve no it's because of your long luscious locks yeah my hair is getting long though uh leslie johnson 75 dollar super chat says thank you steve for being awesome you are officially my second place wow that doesn't even make any sense oh yeah death monkey has a good question says why didn't the time slow down when you poured the candy on the table we're trying to keep things speedy today you know don't know that's a good question uh you're still waiting for your your shout to recharge right your shot bar yeah um ready set also jane was just saying uh yes a coffee and cream combo flavor oh so she was basically saying a flavor that we don't make just yet but you're saying if we do make it should order a dozen bags you know like i said we've got so many players i don't remember them all but i know mom was saying um that she would like to one day use like the cream that we use like for assorted chocolates for the filling and that would be probably good with the coffee the most ambitious crossover ever name a better duo i'll wait but cookies and cream are coffee and cream cookies definitely yeah oh i don't like coffee though right no i don't easy so i'm not buying it i like cookies and cream i like coffee and cream i like everything you like everything except for blueberries and mangoes and avocados so all the good fruit he doesn't even know he just had a blueberry bagel what let's see what what did i remember when we we first uh it was probably like a year into us all being vegan and then dad ate something he's like there's no tofu in here is there oh and then he found out that there was and then later he ended up coming back for seconds because he liked it anyway uh casey clinton said a five dollar super chat i need to do my laundry i need your best dad motivational speech you don't want to wear this stuff again do you you know your room's

solid year wow i remember my favorite thing i could sell it again my favorite thing was that you and your family would eat dinner really late so i could eat dinner at my house and they'd be like hey max what's up what are you doing oh we're having dinner oh i mean i guess i haven't eaten yet oh yeah uh i mean i am not complaining because i like to eat for five people which definitely cooks for

usually eat could sound weird but taco dip yeah okay like thanksgiving is a it's a very special thing in our family like when our whole family gets together and like so we're eating like all day i wake up at eight o'clock and start eating oh it's such a strange tradition i've never heard of that one thanksgiving like i'm not talking about like breakfast dude i mean like you wake up and you like

over and over and over again you're just gonna i mean no matter what it's about i'm gonna need a longer stick for that dude says i'm up late too i'm in cali i've been up for 24 hours what the heck dude why the heck have you been up so late yeah it's it's time for some sleep buddy i'm not setting the standard here i had to stay up for 72 hours once oh i think 39 is my record you kind of stopped doing it after a while yeah you did you got a second win yeah yeah you're staying up until this time yeah yeah it is orange candy canes look amazing my name is pronounced like the rose green 8 p.m here is every time you say five euro i think you're saying they just sent a five-year-old super chat like what [Music] they've held up in customs for a while huh maybe oh man i was i was moving around the racks yesterday and got to like the gingerbread one and like even though i'm not really a good fan of sweets and baked goods and stuff oh incredible like when you put that phone down probably go lift up the rack back and get a whiff that gingerbread the chocolate gingerbread man from trader joe's onion says that they have not slept since wednesday wow that's a long time you got to be careful with that i think they might be fibbing yeah i bring up an airtight argument right so i just give her the rest of this oh someone said anyone get their hands on ps5 or xbox i think we're all just happy with our xbox one i've had an xbox for years yeah like since like 2003. i have a ps10 yeah wow time travel and cara over here all right i thought you just took two ps5 so you put one on top of the other no you're mistaken the only thing is you can't play any games yeah she brought them back from the future oh wow sherry has a fighting question right now but she said what is the best console xbox or playstation n64 gamecube's pretty sweet i never had a game i think probably the snes is my favorite of all consoles okay i think they were taking care of seriously it says what games do you play um harry potter so basically the games that you play spyro spyro like in harry potter yeah growing up we carol and i had the nes and then i got a game boy a game with pocket and then let's see then we got a playstation original and then i got an xbox and then a 360 and then xbox one is what i have now and i also have a pc that's closing that guitar hero in high school oh guitar hero was great if i were to calculate the average hours a week i played video games it'd probably be on average it would probably be like 60 yeah i don't know maybe this is just me but like at a certain point it was like these are all the same game with like different rats you just play spider-man i watched you play spider-man yeah growing up i played a lot of uh oh yeah if anyone wants to lose a cpr i will race it's not even a joke he will beat you and you won't even see him in the whole i oh that's cool i wonder how many people we know are in uh yeah i don't know but i just swore that one time we were actually talking about it and like you would beat me all the time so i was like well let me play you guys you know i swore but couldn't be the first thing i missed remember remember that's my brother like the dragon ball z game we would unplug it and set it to like oh that's fine what little brothers are for memory [Music] game like just continue it on any concert that was fun huh do you remember doing that with the 360s when they first came out and you could like transfer your your profile or whatever oh yeah that was cool too yeah like it's like they went backwards with that technology you can't do that anyone remember that mac games from like 2000 it was like one of the first games i had on max yeah oh man those were look up bug dumb on youtube [Applause] [Music] i still need to watch that movie oh i thought you did no i didn't if anyone is interested in really really cheesy awful movies i've only seen the trailer but i really want to see it it's called velocipaster the budget for the movie was 30 000 so you know it's good yeah it's crazy to think that that's a laughable budget when it's like dude that's like that's a lot of money that's a good amount yeah i don't know i think i heard that you know what i wouldn't be surprised remember those jumpstart jumpstart computer games jumpstart first grade jumpstart math blasters yeah oh my god cool man [Music] what was the name of the website like the only website you're allowed to use in the library in the library wikipedia anybody can edit wikipedia so you know you're getting the best information because if somebody put something right up there they're gonna fix it yeah but yeah that's the whole point of open source wow someone said they have the original nintendo in about 40 games for it i mean all you really need though is mario we had a really good donkey car although you remember the the teenage mutant ninja turtle game that we played sort of i found that game at an arcade it's like the same thing but an arcade it was not that fun [Music] video game like a nintendo video game is laying on the ground and we brought it home and it was kind of like mario but with like snails and you're like in the jungle really weird call we weren't a guy jumping over like drawing holes in the ground and there was like jaguars chasing you but i don't know anything about snails mike says uh he's on two trooper test said what is your guys favorite all-time video game that's a good question star fox 64. what star fox was a game that i played all the time like i mean i keep going back to skyrim i mean i know people are probably going to be mad at me for saying this but i'm over skyrim no i mean it's it's very repetitive but i feel like he does have a lot of respectability but um i don't know crash team racing is probably like my favorite multiplayer game is good at it i really like uh call of duty black ops like the original one better halo 3 was also a really really and it was cool because like everybody played in like you know it was cool yeah like really great only friends are much better than you you sit in there and just keep losing all over and over it's a good time yeah yeah what about you kara uh yeah halo is the reason halo was the reason that i got an xbox xbox live st can i turn the next one on should i wait a little longer no no no yeah so like how small before we turn around oh someone else said fallout okay oh it's good yeah also inside the new black ops is that i got black ops 4. i i really just like the original black ops the most honestly assassin's creed odyssey that i played last year was really really good though yeah oh nice for the old republic that might be my favorite i can't believe we forgot it that's my favorite nice of the old republicans that's the best game ever there we go no more arguments although i never got to play star wars galaxies and i heard that that was pretty cool too oh yeah so uh mike says twist the medal with the car remember that i i heard people love that i never had a playstation so wonderful [Music] yeah i remember like having i was working at panera then having co-workers that were like trying to catch pokemon while we were by the time i finally got a phone that could have that game on it it was over yeah people still play for me oh i have a smartphone now not a dumb one come on mom did i eat enough lima beans oh yeah have i tried streaming on twitch i have but i actually really didn't like it because i just felt more stressed while i was playing video games and then the second i turned it off i was like okay i feel a lot less stressed i'm just i'm just gonna never do that again that was awful is it just like managing a feed while you're like doing it yeah just like when you're trying to do something kind of relaxing i just feel like more stressed like okay entertaining gotta be entertaining and then i'm just like when i play video games i just wanna shut my brain off and like kill dragons or something i think it'd be cool to like play horror games on yeah okay that's kind of fun because then like you just gotta focus on being scared i wanted to know how to do it i think we talked about them two parts corn syrup one part sugar all the way around two so one part corn syrup two part sugars wait that's what i said the other way two breads um half as much corn syrup for sugar okay uh and then a little bit of cream of tartar and some water that's it something like that we put two quarts in like a 21 pound batch so yeah yeah honestly you can just google it probably like we're saying earlier it'll probably come up put it off water until it looks like apple sauce so yeah need to make a hardcore candy game like a yeah it could be called candyland what if we did a live stream one time about just playing candyland yeah okay that'd be kind of fun right that's my favorite board game this kid this is a riveting competition oh i know it so did you play a lot of candy land i remember in high school though i really got a risk with a much like yeah risk was great yeah did you ever play stratego did you ever play stratego that's fun too it just takes 30 hours to play yeah and you might you lose a friend or two depending on your tactics [Music] yeah yeah you're saying that we're kind of early you guys getting back to uh chocolate on tuesday i guess you don't know that's kind of a hard question what's the next flavor you guys are playing or playing what's the next flavor we're playing we're playing wintergreen all right we were talking about video games like the last 15 20 minutes so what's your favorite video game uh i like college football you have a specific one and madden football i like all the sports games the nba games do you have a specific

real favorite boondock saints yeah it thinks it's good but it's it's not like i'd say slc punk's probably really my favorite but mighty python is you know come on dad i like the jurassic park movie i don't know okay like all movies i don't know you gotta have a favorite i probably do i just can't thank you that barney movie where he goes into the woods and he sees the bear it's a good one mcgregor yeah that's everyone's favorite movie everyone's favorite movie they've never heard of it's really hard once you've seen mcgruber it's like that is top five it's hard to go back to any other movie every other movie but if you're like less than like 16 don't watch it well okay so if you're less than 16 you probably shouldn't watch it but if you're over 16 you probably won't like it it's a tough democrat no no that movie is great it's uh yeah i would say it's not super family friendly i guess like if you're if you're not a little kid very family friendly yeah it's up there with seven oh yeah that's good uh tamara h720 super chat steve you're my favorite who takes over when you and terry retire i think you're just closing the doors right these guys there you go we're gonna we're gonna sell

it's an old video is anybody really live wow tyler with the metaphysical questions let's get a little heavy for me uh alexander said what is the hardest candymaking skill to learn pulling out hard candy's really hard but so is like hand hand doing chocolate and pouring i'd say being rovers are the easiest [Music] yeah i mean you either got to learn how to do a funnel you got to learn how to like pull candy out or do the the hand uh taz cat says have you seen the sonic the hedgehog live action movie no but i have seen the frickening which is probably just as good if not better yeah if not much better they should have had him in the movie dude i mean it's about time really it's about time they learn [Applause] i can go higher uh so yeah people are asking about hercules mask i did actually have a hercules nest available for a little bit and then i ordered one for myself and the quality was terrible so i stopped being so i stopped selling those um and i'm i'm still trying to find a good quality um place where you can buy quality uh man it would be funny to get like ones that were mouths but like with chocolate all over them swear you don't like those i think they're funny someone said tell her to start sewing that i think you'd have to learn how to start starting first i don't know how to sell them your mom's pretty sure i guess maybe he's saying you could do that on the side to make up for all the mistakes that we made i'm not sewing that's not happening well if you do that or they gotta stop making mistakes and i don't think that's happened i'll come on do you

become an adult usually when it comes come time for christmas you don't necessarily really want anything because when you're an adult you have money and you're like oh if i want something i'll just buy it yeah and that's what i do throughout the year and then when christmas comes around i don't really want it yeah i'm not waiting i really what i want for christmas is to find the perfect present for like my family which is impossible uh mom of four sent a five dollar super test says don't tell my granddaughter carmody i'm sending her candy canes from hercules all right so whatever you gotta do don't hotel harmony oh i just got the notification on my phone that i have five percent battery left all right you can do the last two all right and then i guess we're gonna have to get out of here uh no i like it it's a baby all right well we're gonna leave so thanks for tuning in everybody and we'll see you next time bye", "sOPTCsoAPXw": "what's up everybody today we're going to be making cannabis hard candy using canned butter and kennel oil so let's get into it all right guys so before we get into the video i just wanted to give you guys some information so so in this video i'm going to make a large batch of heart candy but what i'm going to do is divide the ingredients into two different pots however since i'm not actually accurately measuring the ingredient one pot is going to have more than the other one so it's not going to be equally divided so when i add my jello at first it didn't turn out right but overall it did so just for my beginners use this recipe for only one type of method don't do it the way i did it so i just wanted to let you guys know that but let's get into the video so the ingredients to make my cannabis hard candy would be lecithin so we will need the lecithin to help bind all the ingredients together so i'm using one teaspoon per recipe next we're gonna be using two third cups of light corn syrup two cups of sugar i'm gonna be using one pack of jello i'm gonna be using blueberry jello and raspberry jello next we will need our water we're going to be using one cup of water also you will need a candy thermometer so we're going to be using a quarter cup of peanut butter for one batch of our hard candy and i'm going to be using a quarter cup of can oil for the second batch of hard candy make sure your candle butter is at room temperature before making your hurricane but let's get into it all right guys so now what we're going to do is measure out our can of butter [Music] now i'm just going to add this to my container so now i'm going to measure out our kennel oil [Music] so this can of oil was made with 14 grams of blue drink all right guys so once you have all of your ingredients the next step would be to turn your stove on now the temperature that i'm going to be using is like medium heat i'm not going to turn it on high so i have two parts on my stove and that's on purpose so i'm going to be using one pot to make the hard candy but once i finish making a hard candy i'm going to add some of that mix into this pot here so i can add my kennel oil so you don't have to add your peanut butter or your kindle oil mix it after your ingredients reach the 300 mark so just keep that in mind let's get into it all right guys turn your stove on medium so that's high right there i'm not going to do that i'm going to do like right here so like medium to high heat so add your sugar then the water [Music] and then your syrup while you're mixing your ingredients just look on the side sometimes there's going to be sugar crystals that's going to form on the side of your pan just remember to brush the sugar crystal that may form on the side of your pot now it's boiling so i'm not going to miss it anymore now i'm going to add my thermometer all right guys so my temperature is getting closer to 260 degrees which is perfect so at any point now it's going to shoot up to 300 degrees hopefully i can get this on camera but we'll see all right guys so we're getting close to it so this way was perfect so this time didn't shoot up like it would usually do i guess because of the temperature that i got it on once it gets to about like three or five i'm gonna turn off the stove and add a portion of my mix to the other pot it's over 300 degrees so now i'm going to turn off my stove and add a portion of the ingredients to the other pot let's go ahead and turn off our stove [Music] now we add our jello to the mix [Music] now i'm going to add our kennel oil [Music] and our peanut butter [Music] now i'm going to add lecithin [Music] so [Music] all right guys so i had to put this back on the stove to mail the ingredients so what happened is when i split the ingredients from one pot to the other obviously i didn't split it

peace [Music] you", "dO7VuHMBPhI": "[Music] what's up everybody my name is sarah b and welcome back to the haze today we're going to be doing another edible review we are going to be reviewing the very well known but new to me wild edibles so let's talk a little bit about wild in general they are a portland-based edible company and they specialize in using things that remind them of the pacific northwest and what makes it special and using those ingredients and those fruits and other items found in nature to make these awesome little gummies now in this box there is a hundred milligrams and there are ten small gummies i also want to just talk about real quick how the packaging is it is so cool so you open it like this and out comes this little pocket super easy to open you just squeeze on the side like this bam pop open and you will find these small little sugar coated gummies these gummies are made all with natural flavoring i absolutely loved these edibles they are not overly sugary at all which is fantastic they taste like a natural gummy something that you will find like in a trader joe's or something like that i started out with 40 milligrams and it hit it hit good too i loved it i wasn't overly i didn't feel dumb which some edibles can make someone feel dumb i didn't feel dumb i didn't feel like falling asleep was just so awesome i've been finding too many edibles lately that make you just want to pass out and these guys kept me up kept me going and once the high kind of wear it off and the after effects kind of left i still was able to have a great functioning day which is really nice i love the artwork that will did i love these little huckleberry flowers you'll see all over it and i believe every box looks a little different it goes with whatever the flavoring is which is really awesome on the inside it gives a little message and i'll read that for you the edible contains hybrid perfect for preparing for life's adventure it's a little like the perfect balance of wearing pajamas to work i just really appreciate the the thought process that went into the packaging and making of these edibles now i believe these guys are the number one selling edible in all of oregon and it makes sense they're based in portland but i found them also all over california they are a little bit more expensive than your normal edible but they are extremely consistent some edibles are really great one bag and they can taste great they'll be just like mind-blowing you can give a bag to your friend next thing you know they say it never hits them i don't believe this will be a problem with these guys i'd say if you if you were going to be hanging out at the house like all of us are right now but you're going to be studying maybe doing something for work i'd say eat one of these little guys and you're going to be chilling you'll be chilling you'll be chilling hard yeah so if you guys see these little edibles anywhere i would say pick it up you will not be making a mistake i promise you all right guys so that will be it for my small little review again my name is sarah b thank you guys so much for tuning back into the haze if you like this

Liz and this is the first time you're joining and if you're a regular welcome back so today I am going to show you how to make these awesome Jolly Rancher gummies from actual Jolly Ranchers that's right so I make these with canister up you can also do them with the can of sugar if you want to know how to make those I do have videos they're made from textures there is a specific one can of sugar and then the other one for the can of syrup is can of flour powdered sugar and syrup not well show you how to make the syrup if you'd like so from the actual gummy art from Jolly Ranchers I've made these gummies and I'm going to show you just how to do that so it's usually I'm going to jump right into those ingredients and what we need to put that together and get it all put together for you so you can make these awesome candies well one thing I did I want to tell you so in the recipe I used three and a half tablespoons of unflavored gelatin I would recommend using four tablespoons of unflavored gelatin to the same three quarter cups of liquid so I I will put the correction in the ingredients in the comments I do sorry I'm they turned it a little bit softer than probably what I like so I would go with four tablespoons of the unflavored gelatin all right so now we'll jump into those ingredients and get right to her alrighty so for our Jolly Rancher gummies what we're going to need is about twenty of your preferred flavour of Jolly Ranchers so I'm going to use the blue raspberry and peeled of course take off graphics you're going to need a quarter cup of can of syrup that we're going to mix with this then for our candy syrup we are going to need one cup of white sugar regular sugar and 1/4 cup of can of syrup and a quarter cup of regular light corn syrup 1/2 a teaspoon of citric acid and a quarter cup of water for syrup then we're going to need three and sorry three and a half tablespoons to four so if you've got the packages of the gelatin you can just use the four packets they got a little bit off one you'll be good and 3/4 of a cup of water for your gelatin cold it needs to be very cold and then for our equipment we are going to need a candy thermometer a double boiler if you don't have a double boiler just use a pot where another heat safe Bowl will fit on top and that will suffice another pot for your candy syrup a couple of spatulas and then your bottles if you've got the bottles for dispensing your syrup if you don't have these guys these are great things if not you just use your eye droppers you've got those and of course your molds and that's everything we need to get started so let's jump right in and get it going alright so our very first step we want to do is bloom our gelatin so you are going to take your three and a half tablespoons and you're going to sprinkle it over your liquid you want to kind of get it all mixed around and then you're gonna get that you're gonna mix this in your gelatin into your liquid so you don't have any lumps and while you're mixing this this is a good yet to know whether your gelatin is a good strength or that it's not too old while you're mixing this it should already start to gel and while you're mixing it it should how to get turns to about the consistency of applesauce and that's how you know your gelatin is good and then we're going to just put that aside to bloom or total ready to loot till we need it now we are going to melt our our Jolly Ranchers and our corn syrup so we are going to melt our Jolly Ranchers and a quarter cup of our corn syrup all on our double boil just don't forget to put water in your bottom of your double boiler I've done it how come I plug it in hold on alright so we're gonna turn our heat on to medium medium or medium-high and we're gonna get our candy put your Jolly Ranchers into the pot mine got a little stuck in the bowl here got a lot of humidity too don't want to give it up gotcha and we're gonna put in our quarter cup of corn syrup our can of corn syrup and that eats up everything will begin to melt the Jolly Ranchers will start to melt you just want to try and get the candies covered and covered in the syrup just start getting things moving around but just going to continue to stir and this until the until your candies though the Jolly Ranchers are completely melted so it does take a while for the candies for the Jolly Ranchers to melt just be patient it does get kind of goofy and glumpy don't you can see that but just be patient it will all nose what I do is I let it sit for about a minute or so let it get heated up and then I stir it around breaking trying to break it up mush it down you just don't want to really overwork it does that just continue to do that your lumpy mess will turn into a nice syrup will see very shortly all right so now my candy start my Jolly Ranchers are all melted so you can see that a little better so we're just gonna set this off to the side for about five minutes to let that cool down before we add in our gelatin because if we add in our gelatin now it'll be too hot and it can break through gelatin that's a lot of problems that happens with with it so the next stage I'm just gonna let that cool down and we'll add in our gelatin and get that melted in and then we'll make that by the candy syrup and get it all put together so now that my syrup is cooled down it's time to add in the gelatin and I like to just do this and cut it up into smaller pieces and then we'll just plop we're all in and get that melting now you'll find if it's not melting you can turn your heat on to low put it back on the double boiler auctioneers probably enough heat from the water still from the double boiler to to melt the gelatin if it's not hot enough right still Cece was started melting because we have the cold temperature and the warm you can kind of have a separation here but once everything comes to the same temperatures and everything will mix together so you may find that your candy is kind of is starting to solidify getting a little clumpy well the gelatin is not really is not fully melting if that's the case then turn your heat on to low or just want to gently heat the reheat that up you just have to be patient with this because it is gonna take a few about five or five minutes or so for everything to come together properly you might think oh no it's not working but don't worry be patient so you're going to continue to gently stir this over the low heat until everything your Jolly Ranchers and your gelatin of all melts together in one even uniform syrup and there's nothing sticking to the bottom of the pot yeah once everything is melted together and everything's one uniform texture and color and there's nothing sticking to the bottom and now if you find here you may want to add a little bit of additional food coloring because the blue with the green it's gonna muddle that blue a little bit so if you do want that with more intense blue like your Jolly Rancher go ahead and add a little bit more blue food coloring it's just exactly what I'm gonna do here so you took the one out of much just one drop will make one to two drops at the mouth you can see the difference there with one drop me get that mixed in so that's a much nicer blue how well you can see that so I skip it too much then it's gonna I'm gonna spill it and not like we haven't seen me see me do that before so we want to see what the color is gonna look like you just drop it onto something white there and I'll just see what it looks like so I'm happy with that color goody-goody I'm just gonna set this off to the side and we'll get our candy syrup started alright so for our candy syrup part portion we're gonna pour in our 1 cup of sugar our quarter cup of cannister up our quarter cup of light corn syrup and our quarter cup of our sorry our half a teaspoon of citric acid and our quarter cup of water and we're gonna get stirred together so you just want to get it mixed together so the water and Evert the sugar in the syrups are all incorporated and then we're going to turn our heat on to medium high forever this pillar so we're going to continue to stir this until until it begins to boil then if you have any duty sugar sugar sugar sugar crystals are so acceptance I just want to scrape that off or get a pastry brush and hot water and just wash down the stop then as soon as your syrup begins to boil you're going to stop stirring and we're going to watch your candy thermometer and we're going to cook the syrup to 260 degrees Fahrenheit and that's it just the letter go now periodically don't forget about your jelly the gelatin and your candy syrup you want to go around and stir that because it we can do start to solidify around the edges if it's like to pull off too much solid once once go around and just make sure that it's all still doing good but don't worry it'll get remelted once it gets out we added into the hot candy syrup whose life my candy almost up to temperature once you hit 260 you want to remove it from your meat immediately keep the candy thermometer attached because you want to wait until the syrup comes down to about 240 before we add in our other mixture the best is that you have a stone or marble surface to put it on is the best thing it draws the heat out quickly and and it doesn't get the surface doesn't get hot at all if not just put it off to the side burner and wait until your heat comes down to 240 all right so now my temperatures come down remove your candy thermometer grab your can you stir up your gelatin and your Jolly Rancher syrup and now we're going to gently pour it into our candy pot candy syrup here it'll probably bubble up a little bit and then you want to gently mix this and and continue stirring until it's all combined and you want to try to stir it gently to incorporate as little air MIDI as little air bubbles as you can but we need to make sure everything gets stirred there we go and once you're all good with air we're gonna get this poured into our bottles or you're just gonna use your dispensers your little eye droppers so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to pour it through a little strainer this isn't necessary if you've got one great if not don't worry about it so because it gets so hot these gelatin may break a little bit you get that little bit of whiteness I can't really turn the pot that way for you but if you do you can run it through a strainer just so that doesn't get in and if not no worries it'll all kind of go up to the top I'm just gonna pour this in I don't want any left in here now one thing you can do is you can fill up if you want to know if your gelatin it's gonna set correctly is you can just set up one or two cavities in your in your candy mold put it in the fridge and it should start to solidify very fairly quickly within about five minutes or so it should start to set so you'll know if it's still really gooey and tacky then you may have difficult study let it leave it for twenty if after twenty minutes it's still not setting then the gelatin has gotten too hot or it is not it's not some notch Ellington's are all the same strength so it may not be strong enough you can remelt you can add that back into the pot and add in about another half a tablespoon more of gelatin so this way it saves you a lot of time and this has got to cool down anyway because it the bottles are too hot to handle even if I use the oven mitt you don't want to do it when it's super hot because what will happen is it'll warp your bottle and it'll screw them up so one of those will end up leaking on you so you don't want to do that so while my bottles are all that while I'm waiting for my syrup to call I threw a couple into the fridge so I'm gonna see how they're gonna set up now I wasn't setting you may find your bottles because the bubbles will start to come to the top and instead if any gelatinous broke them out White's gonna come to the top as well so what you can just do is get a little spoon and just scrape that tops kind of skin right off of there oh yeah that way it's not gonna end up into your candy and make it muddled want to have a nice clearer looking syrup all right so I did check my candies they are starting to set up nicely because the syrup is hotter it's taking them longer and I don't want to leave this get too cold so yeah so the velocity is really you just distribute it into the molds if it's still a little hot for your hands full you can use paper towels on it which is exactly what I'm gonna do cuz that's too small just hold up some paper towel to put around it I thought I don't go with the oven mitts because I find that they're heavy and clunky and that's it just disperse it into your molds and put them in the fridge for about two hours for them to fully set and I'll come back we'll pop these out to see what these bad boys looked and chase like I tasted the syrup and oh my god it's so good it tastes just like a jolly rancher now if you find that your candies don't set you put them in the fridge for two hours they come out and they're still sticky you can't get them out of the mold don't panic put them into the freezer let them freeze up for a couple of hours let me get good and frozen and then pop them out so I don't you have to do one mold at a time take them out one at a time pop them into a double boiler remelt it add another half a tablespoon to a tablespoon will be good enough bloom gelatin and that will fix that problem and the same thing if you you've gone you've made them set them up and they're just way too jelly they're very very jelly to sick you can still you remem and add in a little bit about a quarter of a cup of liquid and that should take care of that all right so I will be back when these are set and we'll pop them out and see how pretty they look all right so welcome back here so my gummies I have them sitting in the fridge just over two hours and now we're gonna take them out so as you see first it looks like they're gonna be sticky but you just got to pull around the sides and we'll start to pull away as long as they're doing that and you can pull them out you're good you're gonna slay them on your parchment paper or stand them up if you can some of your candies molds are able to stand up others won't so I bought these guys on their sides and then also when it's warm especially it's warm I only take out one or two molds at a time to take them out and leave the rest of the fridge so that they don't warm up too much if I don't have a hard time getting them out of the molds and then I'm just gonna let these little guys dry for 24 to 48 hours and they'll be good to go yeah if there is still a little bit sticky once you've dried them you can toss them in a little bit of cornstarch so you don't want to do too much usually what I'll do just coat my hands in them and then run my coat my hands and cornstarch and then just run my hands through the candy and just kind of get a very light coating on them the other thing is you could do the same thing with oil so if you want to just take some cooking water olive oil coat your hands to them rub it in and then just gently go over your candies look at a little bit of an oil that will help them to stop from sticking as well and there you've got it Jolly Rancher canna gummies look at that baby and these guys taste so good oh I tried one earlier I don't know if I'm gonna get these to drying time get them fully dried they're so good but anyway guys that's it for that tutorial I'll be back to say goodbye and yeah that's about it oh one thing is gonna tell you so if you tried taking them out of the molds and they weren't coming out they're too sticky as I said don't panic put them in the freezer let them freeze up for a couple of hours pop them out put them into a double boiler let them melt down again and then bloom a quarter or sorry a half a tablespoon of unflavored gelatin to a quarter cup of liquid blue matte add that in and that will take care of that problem recast them and you should be good that's awesome thing we working with gelatin and the either if there is a mistake you can usually fix it as long as you haven't burnt it oh and remember that this version of the recipe is just for playing gummies we are not going to sugar or citric acid these if you do they're going to melt I will do another version of the Jolly Ranchers of the sour version for you okay so don't add your sugar and citric acid to this they will melt so that is my tutorial on a can of Jolly Rancher gummies I hope you enjoyed that and if you have any questions as always please don't hesitate to put them in the comments and as I said in the beginning of the video in case you just skipped right over it use four tablespoons of gelatin versus three and a half it'll make that little bit of difference or a little bit softer than I probably would have liked but if you like a softer gummy go the screen 1/2 but if you want that more firm gummy go with the four and you'll be good to go check out that baby's its see-through ish it's got that clear candy looking it tastes just like a jolly rancher it's so good so please let me know if you give this a try I'd love to hear from you on which flavor you prefer and once again thanks so much for watching you have an awesome rest of your day [Music]", "BhOM39nn0Wk": "dude this is me by the flames were a candy company this is the same people that made the toast eight minutes this could be super happy [Music] you're like my resident candy guy thank you I like candy I know you do that's why you're here yeah so today we're going to be trying some ghost pepper heart candies I know absolutely nothing about them at all okay that could be incredibly underwhelming they could be incredibly spicy who are the really go means go ahead go you know look like I I think it's the same candy oh dude this is me by the flamethrower candy company this is the same people that made the toe of Satan made this this could be super hot Shh yeah let's give you really hot I don't know God used I swear you trick me to get into this seat myself into this boy it's actually a very good extract two more on that later oh so this is me both playing freakin a company that's a field event Oh Satan which is incredibly incredibly crabby spicy um sea greens ingredients are quiet by the way we have two flavors is blue raspberry and wild cherry they're both ghost pepper I don't know like the red might be hotter because it's red I don't know um okay sugar corn syrup water artificial flavors citric acid ghost pepper blue number one in sodium benzoate so it's just a ghost pepper this goes it's the exact same ingredients on both of those they should be equally hot which one do you want to try first you want the raspberry it's oddly shaped to like I'm like picking up with the leg I feel like it just it was like one piece both bags feel like that oh that's adorable and they're all stuck together smells like  one off oh you can see like the peppers yeah yeah look it look it I see oh there we go you hold up the light I can see he right through it I feel like a man like a Jurassic butt yeah okay judging by the inside of this I don't think it's gonna be that hot it's stuck to your lip oh yeah you ready you're doing it this candy a little heat all right I'm just sucking on mine me too but do you get a little low heat action there's something very slightly I don't trust my mouth anymore though your mouth is probably broken Mike really is do you have taste buds still I mean I do I say the whole time my mouth is very leveled up my stomach holy schnikeys was it good there's like a juice or some of them really you bit it uh-huh it just like came out the side of it argues yeah like huh gelatin gelatinous going in it was just some weird chunk hanging it's got some spice um I feel like Emma could handle this mm-hmm I feel like rod you could handle this we should warn people uh-oh warning choking hazard yeah um not a heat hazard choking hazard so the more that I'm like I'm Michael by the way so I'm gonna I'm gonna get into the wallet area I don't buy this let's see if it's gonna be any different great hotter why those these are holy either truck the other that was scary dude I got to bite into it kept absorbing into my teeth and not breaking and then I try to release this duck I will say okay the wild cherry one are made better so like you can actually see like the pepper you know a shape of a pepper mm you know I'm working on this - this one has got like I'm not seeing it I mean the pepper is red generally speaking so you might not be able to see it as much in here all right do these are good good flavor mmm good flavor and I'm actually trying to think what this compares to like candy wash so behind on like eating candies we do this is like it's a jolly rancher there you go it's a jolly rancher it's a spicy joy hmm it's exactly what it is it's okay so talking about the heat is it an enjoyable money heat is not enough is it too much no it's not it's not to my level like I'm completely cool like I'm not on fire but it's like you do sense the heat mm-hmm what's enjoyable I agree um I mean for you on my scale it's like a 1 right n about point 5 out of 10 or anything like that I give it oh there's absolutely detectable heat mmm and I like it like most candies when you're to see like a spicy can hear something like that one you're probably talking about cinnamon and - you're talking about this like super artificial flavor but he comes from right this is not that no like I believe there's actually goes pepper in this and I truly believe that what I represent the heat that I'm getting from this although it's mild it's a it's a quality that makes me I always forget this do you like those pepper other idea that's the one yeah the point the one super hot I like scrappy flavors a little bit too but ghosts numbers like the one super hot that I actually do enjoy the flavor okay um so that's why this works well yeah that's good so um super into these um I mean I don't need a lot of candy but this would be I wouldn't say that this is like a challenge like this is definitely like appropriate for like the look it up like Emma your daughter could have it right and could probably have the easily but yeah this look good want to eat you're like 10 of them what um maybe a little overkill there I'm starting to get a little sweat I don't know you got sweat building up oh yeah I'm like your nose and there's Samson your cheeks right there who's that accumulative yeah is it definitely definitely working where do you get a rack me next video tune in for

teaspoon of freshly grated ginger root and 1 gram of cannabis rosin pressed wax or one to two grams of Keef I do not recommend using eh-oh or butane extracted hash oils for this or any other recipe because making hard candy can be a very time-sensitive endeavor you do need to make sure that you have all your ingredients ready to go so the first thing that we're going to do is go ahead and squeeze out our two tablespoons of fresh lemon juice make sure you strain out all the seeds and pulp and have that ready to go and also you want to go ahead and prepare your ginger again we're using fresh ginger and if you get organic that's even better but you want to go ahead and make sure that you peel off the skin and then use a grater and we're gonna grate finely grate about a teaspoon of the fresh ginger root and then it'll also be very helpful if you go ahead and pre measure out your half a cup of honey again I said you could use raw honey here or you can use just regular store-bought honey such as we're using here but you need a half a cup of honey and you have all your ingredients ready to go before we move on to the next step which is to put a small saucepan over medium-high heat and then we're going to combine in all of the honey as well as the lemon juice and the ginger and we're gonna bring that up over medium to medium-high heat and the first thing that we're going to do is we're going to sort of boil out the water and some of the other impurities and cook down the ginger so after we've combined all of our ingredients in our pan you want to go ahead and give that a little bit of a mix and let them combine together and then as the heat comes up we're also going to make sure that we have our candy thermometer available okay as the heat brings up a little bit you'll the honey will melt and you'll be able to come coorporate those ingredients together make sure that you have your candy thermometer ready and a candy thermometer you need to make sure that it's the kind of thermometer that goes up well over 300 degrees but you're going to want to make sure that you carefully monitor because what's gonna happen is and once you get up to about 212 degrees or boiling for water we're gonna start boiling out the water from the honey and there's also a water and the lemon juice that's going to boil it out and condense down the honey then honey and the lemon flavors both but what's what happens is a lot of foam occurs when this happens you need to be right beside it and make sure that you have a pan that has tall enough sides to accommodate at least triple um the depth and foam and then as the foam gets to the top of your pan you need to pull it off the heat and let the foam subside it just takes a few seconds for the phone to subside and then you can put it back on the heat but like I said just be there with it because this is going to occur several times but over time as the water boils out it's going to foam less and less and then you can bring your heat up to high and go to 295 degrees Fahrenheit and you would be very precise about that temperature leaving a little bit room there if it gets up to 300 degrees you're fine don't go over 300 degrees but 2 and 95 or 300 degrees Fahrenheit should be perfect if you don't have a candy thermometer you can also do this by having a cup of ice water available and take some of the candy when you think it's getting close and drop it in and let it harden and the high water if it hardens into a brittle hard candy then you've reached the right temperature and we're getting real close you can see it's really darkening till you don't want to go so far also that you earn and get a really better flavor so you want to be really careful you monitor your temperature and when it gets to 300 degrees or 295 degrees Fahrenheit pull it off the heat and immediately it's gonna start to cool once it's pulled off the heat so we're going to act fast make sure you still monitor the temperature when it gets to 250 degrees Fahrenheit we're gonna add in our rosin or our Keef what we're doing here is we're we're using that temperature so the one it'll melt into there and be easy to mix but also because we're decarboxylated are still activating the cannabis rosin pressed does use heat and pressure so it may possibly be decarboxylated but what we're using this heat just to make sure that we've activated our cannabis and if you're using Keef then that's gonna be necessary also to activate the cannabis so starting at 250 degrees and then as it cools over the next couple of hours we'll be decarboxylated them remaining cannabis well once you've added in and mixed in your cannabis you're going to now pour your candy into the candy molds the video always slows us down a little bit and so the candy is a little thicker than I would like for it to Bend when it poured in the molds here it would have poured a little more evenly if I had used it a little bit hotter but when I pour it into the molds but that's okay and those little drops that I put on parchment paper would also have kind of out a little bit more circular and nice so just make sure that you move fast enough when you're doing your candies but after about two hours and you don't need to put this in the fridge or anything just let this cool on the counter after about two hours your candy will harden into a hard rigid candy you'll be able to pop those out of the molds with no problem and this candy can be really sticky so you might want to coat it in powdered sugar which will help prevent them from sticking together and whatever storage container you put them in and if you don't have powdered sugar you can also use crystal sugar or you may want to anyway because it gives it a nice kind of a cool looking coating there and also adds some sweetness to the candy which can be a little bit better because of the lemon and the ginger but these are really good and they're the flavor of these is not so much like a sweet candy so much as more as like a lozenge and you get the the lingering numbness from the gingers are really good this episode is brought to you by the Rafah studio smoke shop

chocolate I'm making my own favorite chocolate which is chocolate nougat these candies are a first time for me as well so join me I'll be using a Barney got chocolate and this chocolate is fresh from the fridge so it's really really stiff you can hear that but I won't be using it as is I'll be taking advantage of the fact that still summer around here and I'll take advantage of that and allow them my chocolate to warm to room temperature around 35 degrees Celsius you can see what it did to it it's really really good in candy making because you want your canned ingredients to be warm otherwise they will steal too much heat from the candy which means in this case your candy will be hardened too fast so let's make some candies and see how it goes our candy has reached the right temperature of a 150 degree Celsius 300 degrees Fahrenheit nice and clear I'll are the chocolate new books mixer and quite curious to see how it works yep think it's ready that's for my call chocolates is getting hard really fast yep it's hard already and use that nice Oh got most of it let's cut it before it's too late [Music] according to the aroma here the flavor should be really really intense so I cut this into small squares let's see how they do I let it cool off I'll see you in a minute okay our candies is cool this is definitely rigid or a bit but still not too hot to hold [Music] well that's it

there's just some little one two three four five six butterscotch candies on the front and i'm really excited to dig into them so i have a couple right in front of me to use throughout the video and i didn't really think about what i was going to say i have no idea what i'm going to talk about but i think that makes it more exciting so let's open this a little farther away from the mic i don't want it to be too loud okay so we just got this little butterscotch candy okay delicious so i think the last video i did like this i was talking about my new year's resolutions and um i don't know what i want to talk about i will say um i'm really excited about this year because i want to take more time to go camping and stuff and just spend more time outside than i did last year i'm gonna move the camera a little bit um i was inside all year like literally all year i went outside to go running sometimes but that was when no one when i went outside and then everyone started running and going on trails and my city closed off all the trails because they were getting really busy which makes sense you know and then i was just kind of back inside again and my little dog um i've showed him before in my channel but he's just a little tiny he's like a york game on these and he actually has cancer he's like 11 years old and he pulled a muscle in his knee and he actually got surgery in the middle of last year like in the middle of quarantine and so we've been kind of taking it easy with him he's got arthritis he's like a trooper okay but he doesn't act like he has any of those things he's like an old guy in a teenager's body or something i swear and um my boyfriend and i are staying at my parents house while they're gone and so we're like watching the dog in the house and everything and they left us one of their cars and we've been using it to take my dog on little adventures um so we recently just went to i went on a camping trip we just got back um we went on like a five mile hike the second day that we were there and that's like the longest walk that my dog has been on in like a long time because it's been like i guess like six months now that he's gotten out of his surgery for his knee and um you know we were only allowed to take him on like five minutes at a time and so now he's like in the clear for months now but we didn't know how he was gonna do and he was making us look bad because he was more in shape than like we were which you know made me really happy not for my physical fitness but for my dog he's doing so good and he's so happy and i think it was like really invigorating and exciting for him to be in a new environment and not go on this team you know routine walk as he's gone on for years you know because we have a few trails over here but they've been closed and so we kind of just go around the neighborhood in different areas but he has everything memorized he knows where everything is it's not um as exciting for him you know what i mean and so one part that made me really nervous on this hike was there was a sign that warned that for the next mile and a half it was gonna be very steep and i was thinking oh no you know one because i'm out of shape but do because my dog like is too scared to go up and down the stairs by himself so i didn't really know how he was gonna fare going up a mile and a half on a steep cliff that he's never seen before so i was getting really nervous and then um this little guy we reached the very beginning okay and um it's literally like you cannot see the top it's just so steep and like a little mountain goat this tiny 12-pound dog just goes like up the top of this thing and we're just standing at the bottom like what what this 11 year old dog i just got out of knee surgery has arthritis as lymphoma and like hasn't gone up the stairs in years just went up this cliff like it was nothing and i'm like he's going so much faster than me that i'm actually holding him back because i'm holding the leash and i have to speed up this ill clever rocky thing and i'm like holding him back but anyways we were stunned like we did not see that coming at all you know so we're really excited because we like going backpacking and we haven't gone um in a really long time i think it's been a few months now and we have the car for a couple months so we're thinking of going on more camping and backpacking trips but we also were watching the dog and we didn't want him to do like anything that he was not you know like anything out of his comfort zone and so when we got back from our camping trip we thought that he was just gonna be like sore and tired and just like completely you know just no energy tired for the rest of the day and um he was doing that thing where he was whimpering at the door and at his leash so that we could take him out again and ever since we've been like going on walks after that he's been more adventurous and like jumping up on these rocks because he's very tiny so he can't really see and um one of the areas that we walk by has a bunch of rocks lining the sidewalk um and there's like trees on the other side and so there's a bunch of squirrels running around there and usually he stops at the rocks because he can't see past them and so if a squirrel runs across and goes up the tree it doesn't even bother right but now he jumps on the rocks and jumps over the rocks and is like running up to the trees and like i don't know we're just so much more excited about everything um and it makes me happy that he's so excited but it makes me sad that i didn't do this for him earlier you know what i mean but um i didn't know that he was going to be so good um or like so energetic and athletic um but yeah so i'm just really excited that he's gonna be going with us on outdoorsy things um and the fact that he was so ready to do it like everything all over again the next day and day after the day after we're probably going to take him like primitive camping with us so you know like backpacking um but we're still going to do a few like car camping where you like drive up to the side and pitch it in and you don't like hike to your spot or anything um just for a while to get him used to everything um plus i want to groom him because his hair is really long right now and um you know he gets those little like stickers and things stuck in his fur and they get matted up so i want to kind of get his hair cut a little bit so that um it won't get like matted in his hair and stuff when we go um i'm going to start hiking to our spot so so yeah i'll put another candy wow i just ranted about my dog for like 13 minutes it's so hard not to he's so cute and he's kind of at that age where he has really weird eating habits so he'll only eat if you tell him not to it's weird we've tried to figure out other ways to get him to eat but it's like a game for him um and you know you have his food in his bowl and he'll actually go up to his bowl and whimper and whimper and he will not eat it until you say no no no and then he'll start like his tail will start whacking and he starts you know doing a little bit of growling and then i'll start eating it and then i'll look up at you and kind of have that expecting look on his face and then you say no and then i'll growl and it'll start eating if anyone knows why he does that and like if it's a game or if your dog does that but it's like fun for him because he'll whimper until you do it i don't know or um if i set food out on the floor and like a trail and i like leave a trail of his food like around in a circle i'll just start he won't start until you tell him no and then he'll start eating it and then go around and eat the trail of food that you left i have no idea but he's a little goofy but he's very adorable and i guess it's just going to be a video about me talking about my dog but when i was in high school i went on this camping trip and i got really bad mosquito bites like everywhere and there was one in the middle of my back that i couldn't reach and i taught my dog how to scratch my back i'm not even kidding so i just held a treat behind me like this and i kept saying scratch scratch and so he would go and he knows back so if you go like this i'll do this you know um so i kind of it was kind of that same idea but i just had him do it until he went like this and scratched my back so i'd be like a scratch and he knows to do this but now i don't really have him scratch my back you know i actually never have him scratch my back but do any of you also have like a sequence of tricks that you um do with your dog if you have one um like you do them in a certain order because we do sit pop which is like shake down roll over and then bag and then scratch but we'll have them like scratch our leg or something um and then speak and oh this is another thing that i taught my dog um so we got him when i have no idea what grade i was in but i took french in middle school and um my professor my professor my teacher would always say like just like listen and repeat i don't know why i did this but i would tell my dog like echo day and i would also treat up and that means like i'm about to throw it like a fetch but i don't know like echo day i know the treat up and he get ready he's going oh my gosh she's gonna throw it and then everybody eat it and throw it and then you like oh i try to catch it but i don't know why i did that so it's really funny now watching people do it because i was just a dumbass and i was like echo day day and now it's like a thing and we tell him to scratch i i don't i don't know why i did any of that but it's really funny like watching my boyfriend do it because he's like echo day every day and my dog is like ready and then i don't know it's just so funny watching people do it because like like what was i thinking and then i also um so before i would go to school um like i wrote the bus in like middle school and high school and it always made me really sad that my dog would be like home alone while we were gone um so i liked to hide a treat in his bed i would give him one i would hide a treat in his bed and then i would go up to him and he would always wait by the window for me and i would give him the treat and then i would be really excited for him to find the treat later on because he would eventually get bored at the window and just go lay down in his bed and so now whenever i give him a treat he goes in his bed to find the other one because he eventually learned that there will always be a treat in his bed so now i always have to give him another treat and my sister finds it really annoying because she's like oh i forgot to put the treat in his bed like i hate that you taught him that i'm like sorry but yeah that's pretty much it um i hope that you all enjoyed this random dog talk but i love you all very much and i hope you have a great night so good night good night good night", "mGd171zIDQA": "okay so

review for you people today it's a special one um the ninja's been out and about and um she's managed to get me one of these um i did take one of these on one of my earlier reviews it wasn't like this it was somebody's homemade one that they did um it didn't look like this at all the one i had was flat so obviously let me just show you a bit closer so this is obviously uh the millions rope or rope s milligrams okay so it's quite a high dosage um it's certainly the highest dosage i've had in a sweet up till now there's warnings all over it which is really good so you know the packaging is fantastic it is just like a normal commercial suite you'd have to be careful with this obviously if you had children in the ace or anything like that you'd have to make sure this was really really away from them it does say 18 plus on it it is quite clear that there's cannabis in it let me just read it for you so you know so for um medicinal use only or medical use only keep out a reach of children and and animals so yeah if you've got a dog or a cat they might eat it so yeah it says tear and share uk net weight 52 grams um this is the strawberry flavor so very very nice ingredients organic cane sugar corn syrup gelatin citric acid calories extract full strength that's what i was looking for um color red yellow yellow white beeswax and vegetable oil so yeah there's nothing in there which really sort of alarms me to be fair see all seems pretty kosher um g magic sweet so there you go guys if you've seen them well you must have seen them because at the minute um we get sort of offered more sweets than anything um it's obviously overtaking the market quite a bit at the minute and i would say looking at these products now would tell you that you are getting really really really close to legalization now just look at it look at how it's packaged like say you would not know that or distinguish that from a normal suite right you just wouldn't right so that to me tells me that the cogs are moving they're in movement right first of all i think we're better on [ __ ] bombs right so cheers people one laugh um i'm gonna be obviously making this video which will be the eating video the taste test we'll call it so we'll do the taste test on this video and then obviously after about 60 minutes it says 60 minutes on there which i know that's about right um obviously we'll have a look at the effects and see what it does so um it says there's eight there's eight um servings there um obviously i've got quite a high tolerance so i'm going to take about six servings all in one day all right cheers which would literally be the most of my i've taken in a suite although i took the fifo the other day which is fight a thousand milligrams that's a different catch [Music] [Music] still on the cheese don't judge me for it it's the only flavor i can get in a minute we have had a bit of star dog as well so um but yeah it is it's going a little bit scarce in a minute let's say we're getting more sweets than anything so which is good i'm fine with that give the lungs a little break for a little while right then we'll pop that out for a minute but as you guys know cheers right i think it's about time to uh crack this sweet open that okay so 800 milligrams here we go let's have a look at it first what's it look like can you get it out just [Music] i assume the millions aren't medicated oh rocky now look so basically in a nutshell it's just squishy obviously what's medicated is the jelly in the middle by the look of it so yeah well then let's just stop [ __ ] about josh let's just get it down here it says it's strawberry but it's green [Music] but you can taste the cannabis huh [Music] oh my god we really taste the calorie [Music] stuff i didn't get that taste from the other it's strawberry because there's millions yeah if you see millions if a strawberry but the strawberry's masking oh i can taste it now [Music] you know when you get cannabis in your mouth like fecal or calories oil it burns your mind for a little bit you know i'm getting that almost at the back of my mouth [Music] i mean i wonder if there is an accurate dose [Music] cheers [ __ ] struggling this is breakfast [Music] [Music] [Music] a little bit [Music] i mean what i like about it more than anything is a lot of these sweets they actually mask the taste of the cannabis so it's like has it got anything in it hasn't it got anything i know damn well this has got something in it because i could taste it it's very very strong [Music] oh mate [Music] you're not having it's mine [Music] people [Applause] we'll see how strong this really is i mean i think the peach rings that i did a review on i think they were 400 milligrams and the other edible ones like the the um sour bright crawlers they were 300 milligrams in a packet so 600 milligrams i should really if i had a whole one i think i'd probably be on my back but maybe i'll do a whole one next time we'll see well 600 milligrams [Music] oh dear it's very very strong tasting i did not expect it to taste um as strong as it does in cannabis and it's um it's really really overpowering like i say the other one i had did not i can taste the fika or whatever it is cannabis oil in this it's right in the back of my mouth and it's overpowering but that's good because i know that it's [ __ ] loaded it knows it's loaded [Music] that much a little bit [Music] [Music] wow [Music] that's the only thing with these reviews [Music] looked completely different than the last one i had well the last one i was more flat out it was more like a belt it was more like a belt basically whereas that was like a rope um well it is like a rope you can see it quite clearly it's like a rope so but yeah six doses in one go [ __ ] hardcore you know me and i say if i get a good effect off here i'll get a whole one i'll do a hole in one go one night and see what that's like so oh really it's burning it's burning i know that's not a good advertisement for it but it just it has to if it's got cannabis in it it's gonna have some sort of effect when you eat it you've got to be able to taste it like that it's very very strong what's in that so i would say just i know you can't go by it but just by the taste alone i would say that that was probably a pretty accurate dose either that or they've got some serious cannabis [ __ ] flavoring put into it to make it taste like that which i doubt very very very much so i mean it says it takes um 60 minutes on there we know that edibles can take anywhere from like you know i mean 45 minutes to hour and after it's for the effect so the time is now five past 11 of the so we'll call it 11 o'clock as i started eating it probably five minutes ago because i was chewing it like [ __ ] as you saw um so yeah we'll go from there really we'll see what happens at five past twelve and see what i'm like i'll probably be hunting burgers down by that type well yeah let's get another pipe on the go people so yeah i hope you're all well hope everyone's in a good positive mood love the lovers [ __ ] the haters people yes yes one love here we go [ __ ] cheers fun time please join me smoke up choke up roll up you know where we go from here no mess of the bay we just smoke weed and we get [ __ ] higher yes yes let's do it cheers nice nice people nice nice chest [Music] [Music] hey cheers people peace one love to all of you and have a fantastic day you'll see me really soon anyway because i'll be making another video in an hour's time so um yeah i'll see you really really soon i hope you get a good [ __ ] giggle out of what's going to be coming next because i do tend to go off a little bit while i've added some edibles so peace of my love guys see you really really soon one love cheers for watching", "BQX3yflCKGU": "[Music] [Music] you should other than the back another video in today's video i'm gonna be showing you guys how to make candy grips or as y'all say Craig great Sadiq um I have anyways let's get right back to the video you know using email [Music] [Music] the toothpick on this side with alcohol so you can create your own hole on the other side and don't put

making it and i am going to try a new recipe\u00a0\u00a0 i want to try to make the butter toffee so i\u00a0\nhave butter sugar corn syrup i have flavorings\u00a0\u00a0 and the tart and sour and food coloring and let\u00a0\nme show you the molds that i'll be using i have a\u00a0\u00a0 thermometer it's not a candy thermometer\u00a0\nit's a meat to my thermometer but it works\u00a0\u00a0 well and we have the lollipop and the lip\u00a0\nlollipop molds and just regular candy molds now what i'm going to do with my\u00a0\nflavors i'm going to go ahead and mix my\u00a0\u00a0 sugar corn syrup and butter and let it start\u00a0\nto boil up and then what i do is mix my\u00a0\u00a0 flavorings and food colorings in these\u00a0\nlittle cups here and i pour them in at once\u00a0\u00a0 all together once it reaches the 300 degree which\u00a0\nis crack candy stage and then i just um stir it\u00a0\u00a0 and it's done i don't know if i'm able to\u00a0\nshow you all that on here but let me try\u00a0\u00a0 this particular recipe i'm gonna use one whole\u00a0\nstick of butter two cups of sugar and maybe a half\u00a0\u00a0 a cup of corn syrup and see how that turns out the\u00a0\nmain thing is to get it into the crack candy phase\u00a0\u00a0 the first time i made myself call myself making\u00a0\nalcohol lollipops and i put too much alcohol they\u00a0\u00a0 turned out good and they did the job they actually\u00a0\ngot me tipsy but they were soft like toffee okay the butter's melting i'm gonna\u00a0\ngo ahead and pour my corn syrup\u00a0\u00a0 that i have measured out already\u00a0\nhalf a cup and then the sugar um\u00a0\u00a0 i am using a stainless steel sauce pan i got it\u00a0\nfrom walmart for like 12 they say the best one to\u00a0\u00a0 use is aluminum and then the second best is copper\u00a0\nbut this one worked just as fine it worked perfect go ahead and put the sugar up and i'll\u00a0\nshow you when it comes the butter is\u00a0\u00a0 boiling let me get the sugar in\u00a0\nand then i'll show you that boil so you also must use a metal spoon go ahead and\u00a0\ngive that a stir real quick just because i want to\u00a0\u00a0 get that sugar dissolved so it can start boiling\u00a0\nup and then i'm going to check the temperature\u00a0\u00a0 i put the top on i'm gonna let it get the boil\u00a0\ngoing and um then we'll put the thermometer in\u00a0\u00a0 the digital thermometer and i'm gonna go ahead\u00a0\nand get my flavoring and food colorings ready\u00a0\u00a0 i want to make two different color\u00a0\ncandies so i'm gonna after i get\u00a0\u00a0 this to a certain temperature\u00a0\nbefore i pour my flavoring in\u00a0\u00a0 i'm gonna actually pour half of this into\u00a0\nhere so that i can um you know get two flavors while that's some boiling up we'll go ahead\u00a0\nand put our sticks in this i'm gonna have to\u00a0\u00a0 use the smaller sticks i'm glad i got some oh\u00a0\nmaybe i need the smaller sticks for holidays\u00a0\u00a0 yeah let me get my small sticks one more got the\u00a0\nsticks in and on these i think i'm gonna put the\u00a0\u00a0 candy in first and then the stick as it starts\u00a0\nto harden these does not require stick let's go\u00a0\u00a0 check on the um boiling mixture so it's boiling\u00a0\nup and what you do is you don't stir it you just\u00a0\u00a0 let it boil but let's go ahead and um see what the\u00a0\ntemperature is i have to get it to at least 300. let's see how fast it's going to change\u00a0\nit's going fast it's 144 158 170 already 180\u00a0\u00a0 89 always getting on up there okay i'm gonna\u00a0\nlet it get to 300 and then i'm gonna separate\u00a0\u00a0 it let me get my flavors ready i didn't do that\u00a0\nyet but i'm about to but this is moving fast\u00a0\u00a0 okay someone made this with strawberry and the\u00a0\nsour tart and we're gonna put a little red in that\u00a0\u00a0 make some red candy i hope that's enough\u00a0\nand this we're gonna put a little green and at once once this reach let's check this again saying 95 let's check it see how fast it moves up and i wanted to burn you got to get\u00a0\nto about 300 that's going pretty fast let me turn the stove down a\u00a0\nlittle bit once that's all 247 when i get it with 300 guys because i'm\u00a0\nusing one hand oh it's getting up there\u00a0\u00a0 and i'll show you what on\u00a0\nhow i put these flavors in but anyway you get the idea let me get that stirred and i'll be back\u00a0\nand then we got to pour it in and the molds okay guys it definitely got the correct\u00a0\nstage um perfection it started like\u00a0\u00a0 like setting like hardening up\u00a0\nreally quick let me show you\u00a0\u00a0 first time i made it in get the heart cracks\u00a0\ncandy i can tell it did not because it has\u00a0\u00a0 all these little pieces that is hard and\u00a0\nstringy so i'm excited about this the flavor show you the end results before i show the\u00a0\nresults i just want to show you i'm gonna have\u00a0\u00a0 to figure out but these look pretty good these\u00a0\ncircles but i'm gonna have to figure out a way\u00a0\u00a0 to get this stuff in here smooth so i can have\u00a0\nmy proper shape i noticed that it works better\u00a0\u00a0 than the silicone mold i just tasted like\u00a0\npieces from the end guys and this is a very\u00a0\u00a0 very good flavor so if you want to ramp up\u00a0\nyour flavor and your hard candies add butter\u00a0\u00a0 along with flavors and sweet and tart otherwise\u00a0\nit'll just taste like sugar it'll be pretty\u00a0\u00a0 with different colors but it'll\u00a0\njust take like sugar and water so these are the final results and they\u00a0\ncame out really good as far as the texture\u00a0\u00a0 and the flavor came out amazing these are\u00a0\nthe first ones that i made with the alcohol\u00a0\u00a0 they didn't come out so pretty but they were\u00a0\nperfectly flavor i put them in a refrigerator\u00a0\u00a0 and they're a little bit harder but they still\u00a0\nend up being a toffee like texture before you\u00a0\u00a0 finish eating it but it's delicious and\u00a0\nyou can actually feel the alcohol in it\u00a0\u00a0 these definitely got to um crack\u00a0\ncandy stage the green is really good\u00a0\u00a0 but the um red i put a little bit too much flavor\u00a0\nin it that flavoring is really concentrated so you\u00a0\u00a0 have to be very very careful and light-handed\u00a0\nwith the flavorings but that tart sour that\u00a0\u00a0 you can be heavy-handed with it i really like the\u00a0\nflavor of the green but i'm getting better at it thank you all for watching please\u00a0\nlike share and subscribe and have\u00a0\u00a0 a wonderful day night evening morning\u00a0\nwhatever time you're in at the moment", "L2EvOegVsN8": "hey guys welcome back today I'll be showing you how to make peach ring gummies I am including a recipe in this video but you can use any recipe you like

flavoring oil 1 tablespoon of Tincher 1/4 cup of sugar 1/4 cup corn syrup 1/2 a tablespoon lecithin white food coloring and yellow and orange food coloring the first step is to bloom your gelatin so just pour your gelatin over your dish of water as well as your citric acid your potassium sorbate mixture your flavoring oil and the lecithin no need to stir this just leave it to bloom for about 5 minutes now pour your sugar and your quan syrup into a saucepan and heat that up once that begin to melt you can add in half of your gelatin mixture and then stir that in you're going to add in a candy thermometer and you want to keep stirring and heating up this mixture until it reaches between 200 to 210 degrees once it's heated up to that temperature you can add in your remaining gelatin mixture and stir that in then turn off the heat now I'm just going to pour in my tincture and stir that in and then because I'm going to be doing three different colors I'm going to separate this into different dishes I'm going to be coloring one yellow one orange and this one here is white and yellow I filled up a pyrex dish with very hot water to keep my mixtures warm while I'm not using them and then I'm going to pour my first one into a plastic bag that I have sprayed with cooking spray so it doesn't stick and then I'm going to fill up the first half of my molds alright so you can clearly see I'm having a lot of issues pouring the mixture into the molds it's too sticky it's making a mess and not coming out smoothly so I try to warm it up again and that is not working so I am just going to have to figure out how to fix these and what I decided to do was to take them all out and remelt them with some more water and a little bit of gelatin so I added a couple tablespoons of water a few for the microwave for about 30 seconds and then now I'm going to add in half a teaspoon of gelatin and just mix that in I decided instead of a plastic bag I'm going to put it into a squeeze bottle so I'll have better control of how much is coming out and you can see how amazingly it's coming out it's absolutely perfect I was very happy I also added a little bit of water to each of my yellow and orange but not extra gelatin as there wasn't a large enough amount for it to matter I wanted to try and see if I could put the yellow and orange directly on top obviously I couldn't so that means I needed to leave it in a freezer to cool down for a bit and then after all of that work I realized something very unfortunate and that is that I did everything in the wrong order so the curved part of this mold is on the bottom meaning that I needed to have the orange and the yellow on the bottom and the yellowy white color so once again I am pulling them out and going to warm them up and remould them and then I just threw it in the microwave and poured it back into my little squeeze bottle and everything looks like it's gonna be perfect third time's the charm right let's hope so well after this was done I put them in the freezer for about half an hour and they were good to come oh they look beautiful well after all this hard work I am happy to say they came out very nice they have a beautiful texture they look wonderful hopefully if any of you guys try this out some of my mistakes will help you guys not make them and then I want something to have sugar on them so I'm just gonna throw the ones that have a little bit of imperfections into a container of sugar shake them up and then lay them out to dry and just a reminder that before you cover your gummies in sugar you need to make sure you have let them sit out for at least 24 hours so any excess moisture evaporates otherwise they will become watery thank you guys very much for watching this video if you enjoyed it please leave a comment give us a thumbs up and subscribe also let me know do you guys prefer shorter videos that I don't include any troubleshooting or errors or you prefer videos like this where I kind of talk about things that can go wrong and how you can fix them let me know in the comments below", "bBsBNrWbTzg": "welcome to spiced candies well in the previous video we did some chocolate spread candies and the guys that were complaining that this is not a specific brand they like well the brand they lack is a very known well famous brand of chocolate spread and see the logo over there and since I promised here is my new candy making from this specific spread as you can see it's very similar to the last one so if you have friends and family members kids you like to make some candies that's the way to go let's get started oh can use reached the right temperature this is on 50 degrees Celsius or in I think we're ready to pour [Music] and that's it let's cut it and since these are so thick you better cut them small now the Roma in the kitchen now is quite amazing I can assure you Oh our lollipops isn't farewell they're not fully cured because this is so thick I should have used larger lollipops for these even worse of this one it's missing half a wing it's sort of a well Nemo butterfly lollipop okay I'll let this cool off and we'll get cracking as soon as this is cold enough to touch our candy has cooled and we can break it well our lollipops is not fair well now there are 3d actually so I'll try that next on off-camera of course in general you don't want to pour lollipops are too thick right so just break it [Applause] [Music] right so these are candies so that's all there is to it hope you enjoy this in case you've been wondering this is just like the original you can feel on taste the original flavor of the spread and this chocolate is really nice even as a hard candy hope you enjoyed this have a sweet day and I'll see you soon", "eSw1S_tEOLo": "what's up YouTube it's a boy stuff we preview Channel Denver coming back at you with another weed review we review number 10 today I'm doing something a little bit different we're going to do an edible review it is Incredibles indica Fruit Chews it's a hundred milligrams each one of these is ten milligrams and there's ten of them in there so each one of these right here is ten milligrams so I'm gonna go ahead and give those a try I'm gonna pause the video wait till I start feeling the effects and then I'll start the video back up again and we'll see where we go from there are these it's been about 20 minutes and yeah they're pretty effective you can feel it right off the bat I'm sure as time goes on as time progresses they get stronger and stronger but about 20-25 minutes in boom you can definitely feel that they're definitely there it's you know I mean it's definitely very very very effective no indica I don't know how you're going to feel the difference between indica and sativa when you're eating when you're eating edibles I don't know because it affects your body so much I don't know how you would be able to feel the difference between an indica and a sativa but these are in different shoes so yeah I don't know you know I'll be able to tell but um yeah these are pretty effective the price point for these ten of these gummies which equals a little over a hundred milligrams cost $17 they were on special for $17 I think they were normally like $19 or $18 so they weren't special for $70 I think it's well worth it for seventeen dollars you get blasted out in your brain basically 100 milligrams is pretty good thousand milligrams is insane so yeah we just keep trucking with that once again it's your boy Seth we would do Channel Denver coming to you with another weed review and a mouthpiece you", "DiLc2xUQxWA": "[Music]", "U3IdxTpVE04": "hey guys today I have something a little bit different how about some old-fashioned hard candy not only made the old-fashioned way but with chili peppers hey guys how's it going to spill more back again with another hot and spicy product to review for you guys know today I have something a little bit different just like I said in the intro I have some old-fashioned hard candy made the old-fashioned way and made with chili peppers these were sent to me I've got three of them to review today these were sent to me from the chess pros handmade confections I believe I'm seeing that right chess Bros handmade confections are located I'm not too far up the road from where I live in Thomasville North Carolina let me go ahead and read what it says on their website it says we trace our candy making routes all the way back to the Davis candy company located in 1910 in Springfield Missouri the business has changed hands and names several times over the years but one thing remains constant our commitment to making quality products for our customers I thought this was really cool it says we still use most of the original candy making equipment today copper pots gas stoves wooden paddles and vintage turn-of-the-century candy making equipment you can taste the difference that quality makes now you can check them out at chess bros confections dot-com I'll put that link down in the description and they've got a fantastic website guys they not only have these old-fashioned hot candies I'll be reviewing they're three spicy ones they've got other flavors as well they've got soft candies they've got Brittles which look amazing fudge dip mixes desert mixes snack mixes gift items they've got fruit slices just a some awesome looking products so let's go ahead and get into these guys this one's the first one I'm not gonna sit here and eat these for you here on this video review but I've tried them several times they're mango habanero just look at that these come in four and a half ounce size packs but very large pieces of hard candy probably at least thirty in here this has a very very delicious mango habanero flavor it's the mildest of the three not much heat from this one at all but a really nice delicious fruity mango type flavors what you're getting from from this one I think this would be for everybody it's really not that spicy I'd probably put the heat on my one to ten scale at about a 1 out of 10 but very very delicious so this is their mango habanero if you like that combination if you especially if you love mango and fruit and you love hard candies I definitely recommend this one now this one is delicious guys this is moving up in the heat department a little bit this is their whoops their orange ghost chili hot candy look at that dragon on there and now this has a nice sweet and sour blood orange type base to it I think this is the favorite of three this has a little bit more heat coming from the Ghost Pepper so you definitely can tell that it's got more heat than the mango habanero it just kind of fills your mouth all over with with a very very to me low level ghost pepper type burn but super super delicious blood orange flavor to this one with a little more heat I'd probably put this one maybe at a 3 out of 10 oh my one to 10 scale it's kind of hard to give heat ratings for candies it's so subjective but I'm just trying to give you an example of how I would rate them for heat so maybe that will help you and then this one here guys this is their hottest one this is the one made with Carolina Reaper now if you love cinnamon type candy if you love Hot Tamales or if you love a those fireballs you're probably going to really love this one so it's got a nice cinnamon spicy flavor to it this is the hottest of the three and I think it's probably seems a lot hotter than maybe you what it is because of the cinnamon I think cinnamon candies sometimes come across as being a little bit more spicy but you could definitely tell that because of the Carolina Reapers it are in here this is spiced up probably to about a 5 out of 10 on my one to ten scale the longer you keep it in the mouth you got to give these time as you suck on them and keep them in your mouth you've got to let it dissolve a little bit and then you can start getting more of the flavor you could start getting feeling more of the heat to sum this one they may want to take this out of their mouth for a while and put it down and maybe get something to drink it may reach that level to some but it does you know heat the mouth up pretty good with that nice awesome fiery cinnamon flavor so about a five out of ten for heat on my window ten scale but great candies highly recommended once again this is the Carolina Reaper hot candy I think the favorite to want to really enjoy the most is this one this is the orange ghost chili hot candy I really loved that blood orange base and then the very mildest of all of them once again is the mango habanero hot candy so thank Texas Company out guys once again the chess pros confections calm link will be

"[Music] hi guys I'm Jen Johns welcome back to the channel today I'm going to be doing another homemade candy recipe I've been having lots of fun making homemade candy and this one is super fun to play with and eat now I'm going to be showing you how to make homemade saltwater taffy so what we're going to be making is a bubble gum this is the one I've got going on right now and we're also going to do birthday cake funfetti and we're going to do cotton candy so like I said I have lots of homemade candy ideas up I'll put the playlist in the description box for you for that now let's get started on this tutorial to make our taffy we're going to be using 1 tablespoon of butter we're going to use 1 tablespoon of cornstarch and we need 1/2 of a cup of water it can just be at room temperature we need 1 cup of granulated sugar we need 2/3 of a cup of corn syrup and we're going to need a quarter to half a teaspoon of sea salt so that's our taffy base now to make it bubblegum flavor we're going to be using a little bit of pink gel paste and one DRAM of bubble gum candy flavoring so I've got a pot here and I've got my corn syrup already in it so you just want to make sure you've got that a nice big pot because the candy will bubble up so I'm going to put all of my ingredients into the pot here and at any point you can turn your heat up to a medium high now when you're making candy probably the most important part is to make sure that you do get it to the proper temperature so I'm going to be using a candy thermometer to do so and what I'm going to be looking for is a temperature put around 255 degrees Fahrenheit so I'm just going to pop in some of my color now and a little bit of the I'm going to drop this whole DRAM in that's what one of these little things is called so I'm putting that all flavoring of that bubblegum in there turning my temperature up and then I'm going to a stir it while I've got it here on the pot and once I've got this all stirred and the butter has melted I'll put my can a thermometer in at that point so once the butter has melted and everything has been mixed together nicely you're going to take your candy thermometer and you just want to set it into the pot and we're going to wait until it gets to 255 degrees that's gonna make nice and chewy toffee and it will still be like like melts in your mouth pretty much you can do it a little bit heart hotter if you want to about 260 to 265 if you want it to be a little bit firmer when the toffee has come to temperature you can remove the thermometer and then down here beside my pot I have a buttered dish here and it's just a cake pan or like a bread pan I'm going to take my hot toffee and I'm going to pour it into my pan and then I'm going to let it cool until I'm able to handle it once the candy has cooled to a temperature that you can handle it just peel it out of your pan and it will should still be a little bit warm because you want to be able to work it and so I'm just gonna move that out of the way so we've got a nice big chunk of taffy here and you can see that the color is still just kind of like that clear look but what we're going to do is we're going to pull it so I'm just pulling it apart and putting it back together so just see we're gonna completely just keep pulling and pulling and pulling for about 15 minutes you get a lovely far forearm workout from this and what this is doing is putting some air into it so we're aerating the candy and the color is going to change and it's going to become a nice kind of like opaque pink so we're just going to pull and Bowl and Bowl until I've got to the it all pulled and you'll also know that when you've reached that kind of like the end that it will be that light color and it will be really difficult for you to pull at that point so when you're done pulling your taffy will be really stiff and it's going to be shiny and a nice light opaque you can see how the color completely changed and then what you want to do is just kind of pull it into a rope or just bite-size like kind of what you want to your bite-size pieces to be and then I'm going to take buttered scissors and I'm we're just going to cut pieces out into whatever size you can roll them up into a ball or whatever shape you want to do whenever you're doing with the taffy you want to make sure that everything is buttered like my gloves are buttered and the scissors are buttered I've just got a piece of wax paper here that I've rolled up and I'm just going to pinch the ends and roll the ends and then that's how you can serve your candy so to make our cotton candy taffy we're going to be using 1 tablespoon of butter we need 1 tablespoon of a corn starch and what I'm going to add in is some of the blue cotton candy and you can just probably go to a cup of it it's totally optional if you can't find it or you can make your own we need 1/2 a cup of water we need 1 cup of granulated sugar 2/3 of a cup of corn syrup and we're going to be using 1/2 of a teaspoon of sea salt and this is pretty much the same recipe as our taffy base from our bubblegum but to make it the cotton candy we're going to add a little bit of the blue and we're going to add some cotton candy flavoring so we've got a large pot again and I've got the corn syrup already in there and I'm going to take out just the blue you could put in the pink cotton candy as well if you really wanted to I just want to kind of stay with that color theme so I'm gonna pop a little bit of some blue gel paste you could also use regular food coloring if you want some cotton candy flavoring smells deliciously sweet and some of course more sugar what else is cotton candy than sugar and we've got our sea salt and some water and while I've got this mixing you'll see that it just disintegrates like that beautiful color turn up your heat to about medium-high and add everything else in as well and then I'm just going to mix everything together and then pop my candy thermometer in once my butter has melted and I'm going to heat it to 255 Fahrenheit once the candy has come to temperature you can remove the thermometer and I'm just popping it into like a hot water tall vase and then take the candy and you're going to pour it into a buttered bread pan or anything flat you want to make sure that it is heat proof though you don't want to put it into anything plastic because obviously the candy is extremely hot at this point and make sure you don't touch it either so I'm going to let this cool until we can pull it so I've buttered my gloves and I've let the candy cool so I can handle it just using a spatula or a spoon or something you can grab that taffy out of the pan and then all we're going to do again is just pull and stretch it till it comes a nice blue color and we're going to do that for about 15 to 20 minutes once we pulled the taffy completely we can take buttered scissors and cut off our pieces it's super satisfying to cut it the taffy has changed into a beautiful pastel color then you're going to take a piece of wax paper and just put the taffy into the center of it and then taking a small piece of cotton candy I'm using the pink cotton candy now because I want that different color and I'm just going to wrap it up and then serve it with this little piece of cotton candy it's going to add extra flavor and it adds that little extra pop of color as well so just twist the wax paper around and then your taffy is ready to serve so to make our third kind of taffy we're going to be doing funfetti so we're going to need one tablespoon of butter and we're using our standard recipe here for the taffy so we've got 1 cup of sugar 1/2 a cup of water and then I've got some wonderful colorful jimmies here you can use any kind of sprinkles that you want too I've got 2/3 of a cup of corn syrup and we're going to be using some clear vanilla extract if you want to make it vanilla birthday cake flavor that's what I'm going to be doing to make it that nice cool funfetti and we're going to need 1 tablespoon of cornstarch and we need some sea salt and I've got half a teaspoon so I've got my corn syrup here in my pot and I'm going to take 1 tablespoon of the vanilla extract and I'm going to pour that into there as well turn my temperature up to medium-high and just like with all the other recipes I'm going to add in my ingredients so I've got my sugar there and my sea salt and my water now you can add in coloring like we did for the other varieties if you want to this one I was going to leave with kind of like the vanilla coloring to it and pop in that butter and then just give it a stir and again we're heating it to 255 degrees Fahrenheit once our funfetti taffy has come to temperature I'm going to take my pot pour it into my buttered dish again so get all of that good stuff in there and then I'm going to take my sprinkles and I'm just going to sprinkle them gently on top and you want to do it before the taffy sets and you want to make sure that they're sprinkled on top of here and they'll just like kind of move around and then we're gonna wait again for it to solidify and be able to be handled once the funfetti toffee has cooled we can dig it out with a spatula and then we are going to pretty much mix the sprinkles in at this part at this point and then what we're going to do is it is going to aerate and is going to change color and we'll have a beautiful funfetti color to it we're going to pull it for about 15 minutes once we're finished pulling you'll see it's nice and light and you can see those awesome chunks of sprinkles in there I used the jimmies that I did just because I find that when I'm making cakes with the jimmies that these ones don't run in color and I really definitely didn't want the color to run here I wanted to make sure that we had a regular kind of white look to it so if you're going to wrap these ones up you don't have to wrap the saltwater taffy up but it does kind of add that authentic look to it and I'm just going to add a couple of extra sprinkles into the little package here and then just roll it up with the little wax paper and twist the ends and we've got our saltwater funfetti taffy so I'm gonna be back to tell you what I kind of thought general opinion of all three different flavors so there you go everybody how to make salt water taffy with three different flavors now the cotton candy one was definitely delicious with that additional cotton candy chunk that I put in and the funfetti was my favorite looking one at looks like a birthday cake how fun is that and the bubble gum one I could have taken her leaving it but the bubble gum is always everybody loves bubble gum flavor right so but I would have gone with the funfetti if I could only choose one let me know in the comments which one you think you would like the best and I also want to know which candy do you want me to try making next time I love making the homemade candies so give me a suggestion thanks so much for watching remember to subscribe to the channel and I will see you guys all again next time"}
