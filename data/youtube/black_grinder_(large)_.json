{"Y5oFCoRJqYk": "hey everyone welcome back today's video we're going to talk about Jeffrey stars 420 collection what I ordered from that there wasn't a whole lot to choose from I was gonna get I'll put a thing here if I can um his 4/20 hoodie with like the star pot leaf on the front that was like gold you know but I had already ordered well if you watched my last year first are like haul video I had ordered his onyx ice hoodie in size small in it being too small and giving it to my daughter and then reordered it the same one and a size medium so well match that's cool however no that one the black the onyx eyes um I feel like I can wear it everywhere like there's nothing on it other than jeffree star cosmetics if I can wear that everywhere that could possibly go you know now the 421 I didn't feel like I could wear it every single place I went and that considering I just bought his onyx ice one I just passed over that one I almost did I think the green and black looks really cool however I didn't want to spend $45 on another hoodie from him and again where I can't like wear it everywhere you know so only thing I ordered from him and I my last haul video again I ordered his 63 millimeter royal blue grinder it's right here actually I still haven't used it so I'm not sure the quality of his grinders is like I've never used any of his grinders I did order the 100 millimeter Big Daddy green grinder I'm super excited it came today I have opened the box yet so I'm gonna do that now we are going to open it look at it use it I'm going to grind up some herb of it and roll it up see how it rolls you notice it's ground up and all that so just keep watching cool thing I have next to me I'm just gonna use these to slice it open in my hoodie it should come tomorrow so I'm super excited for that the not so typical Geoffrey start issue what Lee is appointed okay that's cute though yeah this is the pot leaf star that was on the hoodie like I feel like first glance you don't really notice it but you kind of do you know you kind of do um I feel like I couldn't worry that every word that I could possibly want you know but this big and again this picture okay can we just talk about how hot Jeffery is for a second like girl okay I'm just thinking for the box size up a 6300 so okay let's see let's see let's stick on it this time don't work the box it's not what I want to do there we go now Green is my favorite color so when I saw he was coming out to green grinders oh my lord now black is an ultimate favorite shade but as far as colors go it's definitely green alright it's good the outside of this because I actually had a little scratch on the or the blue one I'm nice critius on this one my face out of there okay after church stuff my little table right here here's the first chamber where old uh Floop it's gonna fall I was actually hoping it'd be a bit deeper than that no I'm going to lie how big is this Keith area now I mean that's significant face out of there again significant I was just hoping that that would be a bit deeper but hey I can still grind up that much more at a time so that's a win and the edges again are not sharp so that's awesome okay here's the bottom here's a cute little spatula again okay I didn't check last time but there is a little star logo the actual imprint on each side like obviously be the same shape on each slide but yeah didn't print is still there I love this okay let's compare it next to the 63 yet no meter size let's do that yeah and as you can see I mean I suppose I could have cleaned it but you can see it's not used at all yeah let's compare typos but now that we have this packaged let's go grind and roll and see how she performs normally I pick it up and hold it when I grind it so I'll do that a little bit easier just trying to make it easier to see [Applause] [Music] a little bit on top it's not want to go through but that's okay camera strap sorry [Applause] [Applause] now I do this I like to fold a crease in there first like that and push that part down like this put it out on each end that way it's easier to light and then of course the other end it won't be you know sucking on the ends and get about a mouth and all that there we go all they have left that's ground up so I'm gonna do some more real quick I'm not gonna bother rolling another one though not right now and then just a bunch of crumbs is what I have left in my bed so another round oops the only thing I'm having trouble with is having to hold the bottom and keep the other sections from not rotating you can see maybe not sorry yeah that's the top section is like rotating on me my thumb can barely come up and hold it yeah it's getting stuck up on the edges maybe it's just cuz I'm putting so much in there at once but still it's still so much more convenient than having to you know reload them tiny ones over and over again to frying them up you know oh let's try to figure out the rattle was oops there's a little spatula in there huh her god I was like what is going on it's a loose part oh my god what just a spatula all right this sums up the video on this grinder I hope you enjoyed don't forget to click the flour in the lower corner to subscribe and I'll see my next video bye I'll sort of side note here's how much Keef I've collected just from grinding up what I did it's pretty cool",

this platform welcome back to my channel if you've been here already if you're new I don't know what you're doing you better subscribe so you can get some more content in your life I've been posting two to three videos a week keeping the streak going hope you guys are enjoying let me know in the comments if there's any videos you want to see I always think you guys suggestions and that's what this video is all about somebody on my snapchat messaged me and asked me if I would break down this little grinder on my YouTube there's a lot more to it than you think I picked this up and I've been showing it off haven't talked too much about it the company's called like cubis or quipus qub us this looks pretty [ __ ] cool they advertise it as like an airtight smell proof [ __ ] alien great quality grinder and I've been really liking it at first I had mixed opinions on it because it is not like your traditional grinder but it has enough unique qualities to it that made me keep coming back to it and it's actually cut my new daily grinder this is my old grinder I loved it it's done a lot of good but recently it has gotten pushed aside the Cubist's or kumis I'm gonna call out the Cubist because it's a cube it's literally the same size as a rubik's cube actually which is partially what caught my attention to it now if your typical four stage grinder what I really liked about this is the compartment that holds your flour that has the screen that goes into your cave catcher can actually be removed from the grinder so that you can have a three piece grinder you'll have a bigger compartment for your flour and then you also don't have to have to keep compartment now don't get me wrong I love Keef actually like a lot of Keef in my day it gives me a [ __ ] but honestly it's not totally worth it to me anymore ever since that came out because keith was like if I'm trying to get like super lit just looks at Keef now it's like I'm trying it super lit I take blob so the point of Keith has kind of been replaced in my eyes but I keep having all these grinders with screens in them and then all of a sudden I just have holy [ __ ] like why didn't I just keep that with all the lead and I could have just enjoyed the weed a little bit more because that Keith does come from somewhere look how much you keep I have in this guy it's literally built to the brim I have this key thing like half built I just started using this grinder like three months ago so the last three months I collected that much Keef that is insane that that much gave it's just been thrown away from my weed so I prefer to have a bigger compartment to hold my weed and then you also have the Keef actually staying inside the flower also today I have a sick woven blunt rolled by my looming toxic iris it was a pre-rolled he made for me it was totally empty and then I just filled it with my own flower and today I'm smoking on some llamosa I'm a big fan of mimosa it's a nice daytime eye and just keeps you going and it's nice like uplifting like conversational high there's some strains that has no clue man I just do not want to talk after I smoke them but mosa is not one of those it definitely keeps the conversation going not a big fan of blunts but I'm making an exception because this one's woven so that's pretty cool has the little checkered pattern on it love these what about tips nothing I'd like to say about this it just looks cool it's one of a novelty thing there's no reason to only smoke one of them once it does the same thing as normal one which is better that better how about great guy I always have them so I got this rounder for free I hit the company up and asked him if I could try it out and show it off and they said yeah but I didn't like this at first because of the two magnets on the top when I was going to grind it it just felt really Jackie because I just kept going over the magnetic connector but then when I realized you needed to do would you flip it around and then once you give it like a 90 degree turn so the magnetic connector isn't touching anymore you have like a full 180 degrees to turn the grinder and actually get a nice sufficient grind out of it even though I am liking the grinder still I do admit it does not grind wheat as fast as the grinder I had in the past I don't know if it's the fact that the holes are a little too small well it's just not enough teeth but it just does not grind it enough just takes an extra 30 seconds to grind up your weed and if that's a deal-breaker for you you're gonna do one you seeing these things retail for like eighty two hundred dollars which is like your typical high quality American grinder price if you're buying a grinder for like $30 it's just not made out of the same grade of quality metals the fact that they say it's smelter if it's nice if you're leading in the car but if it is truly airtight that means it's also watertight so that means that I can submerge the schooling in water and it shouldn't leak through which I'm gonna try out right now first thing you pump the weed out but look how much more weed you can store when you get rid of a little compartment this tiny little thing can hardly hold any weed so sacrificing the key compartment to store more weed is totally worth it in my eyes you can probably fit like five to seven grams in the bottom compartment if you don't have the third stage of the grinder in there all right let me try not [ __ ] this up I try give you guys a little bit angle if I can so we have our water we have our grinder and we are going to fully submerge it then I'm going to smoke this so it doesn't go out see a couple air bubbles that's concerning me salty little ones it's probably not a big deal alright alright rant try this [ __ ] off hill we will decide it is completely dry so water did get into the crevices where the magnets are but these o-rings that connect it are strong enough that it did not leak into the grinder at all so I can confidently say that this is airtight and watertight not gonna lie did not know how I was going to go I'm very excited that it passed the water test and followed the company on Instagram a little bit and the owners just seemed like genuinely cool people which is another reason why I wanted to make this video definitely has a lot of great qualities to it one complaint is doesn't grant me the fastest if there's one thing I could change about it it would have more teeth so everyone grabs me we done faster these things are fully customizable but you can make like the middle black orange you can do like red red white and blue you can do anything you want almost at the end imagine you're like [ __ ] kayaking down a river and you flip your kayak and you're like bag goes underwater and you're like no but we drew it but then you realize you have this grinder and you're like yes no it's fine like I wouldn't even be worried than iconic look alright guys my battery's dying so I guess that's time to wrap the video up I hope you guys enjoyed this video click like if you did make sure you subscribe if you haven't already got a lot more contact comment a lot of videos I'm pumping them

smart please", "QHBWzD4StT0": "good morning everybody you are here for this but also this so what are we gonna do today so we're gonna give you a quick rundown of just basic uh the the basics of the santa cruz shredder and then we are going to run it head to head with the raw and some very unscientific tests that are prone to human error i will get out with that in the first place but should give you a better idea of what you're looking at if you are interested in purchasing one of these fine grinders because believe me both of these are just fantastic it's really going to come down to personal preference so what we're looking at first with the santa cruz shredder so obviously legendary the machining on this is just top notch everything is everything is smooth all the edges are chamfered nicely the threads are are great they're not they're not too coarse but they're also not too fine to the problem where you know you'll you'll be misaligning this just by a fraction of an inch that's a big complaint of mine is people just kind of pay lip service to threads i think that they probably put some thought into this to make it as simple as possible there's your basics now we're going to get into more in-depth review of both of these together so the first thing we're going to look at is tooth design so obviously the santa cruz shredder has the the proprietary kind of square tooth design that's supposed to be an air quote and as you can see there's not it's not just the top profile of the teeth it is also further down on the post sorry i've been using this so it's kind of harder to see but you can see where this little uh i'm losing my words again but the the extra machining done on here to create extra surface area more cutting basically so you can jam this thing with bud and just stick it on here give it a couple twists back and forth and it's it's done for the most part i was expecting a whole lot of jamming right here um on the mouth of these teeth but they did a very good job of making these things self-clean you guys know my opinion on the raw life grinder i love this thing i love how it's completely modular couple complaints that i have these fall through holes they're not bad they're a good size and like i said my other video they do pretty good job of you know you don't you can just shake it back and forth and most of your stuff's going to fall through my major complaint about this is that i don't know if you guys can see that very well but this very edge of this hole here um there's not really a whole lot going on to push stuff back into these holes and so you wind up with a lot i guess a lot relatively you wind up with stuff stuck down in this corner here and don't get me wrong you're gonna get that too because of the way that the lid is designed but i feel like there was a little bit more thought put into the lid on the santa cruz because they have this nice bevel right here and i never get i don't say never but very rarely do i get anything jammed into this corner right here that i can't get out with just you know a wood poker whereas this guy likes to trap stuff in the corner here and you've gotta you know drop the bottom out to clean it again both great grinders both great at what they do but i think as far as the actual fall through for your flower after you grind it uh i'm gonna give the win to the santa cruz and the tooth design is all said to the santa cruz sorry um these teeth are you know they're good they're decent but they just don't have the same cutting capability as these square teeth on the santa cruz and all i will show you that in a minute here you can see lots of holes but where the santa cruz really shines is that it's got holes further out towards its edge relative to its size so basically what that's doing for you is there's more to push flower from this edge into this hole or get basically this holes close enough to the edge where most of your stuff's gonna go into this hole before it finds its way into this corner and gets trapped the life grinder is again great but it does get more flowers stuck in here than i would like down in the corner here so the next thing we have is we are going to be looking at basin in the bottom now i actually hand roll my joints and i am a big fan of this nice deep basin you can reach in here grab a good little bit spread it on your paper that and if i am outside i never really worry about this having the wind knock my flower out of it that is a concern with this one people who own this grinder are gonna say oh you could just take the screen part take that out and make a bigger basin the only problem with that is when you screw the top onto here or this other the other section to make a larger and you would then have exposed threads where trichomes and flower itself can get stuck so again getting getting nitpicky here but that's kind of what we do here if you haven't figured it out yet next we are going to compare our diameters which there's an obvious difference i thought when reading the the measurements i guess i made a mistake i thought this was going to be a lot closer in size to life grinder than it is but i will tell you that the size of this thing does not slow it down i am shocked by how much this thing can process all right super scientific forgive my my dirty tools this is a garage it's advertises two and an eighth and it is two in three thirty seconds point of this caliper again not the most scientific thing on the planet it's been beat up but should give you an approximation sorry guys i am not a ve all right and the raw is 2 and 17 30 seconds so obviously a little bit bigger on this end um when you take the screen out the raw life grinder is actually shorter than the santa cruz and again keep in mind this is just the medium they have a large one they believe dwarfs even this and even though i have you know big old monster paws i i thought i'd be more annoyed trying to manipulate this thing i like i like large grinders because i got big old mitts the grip on everything how everything is designed it's it's just so ergonomic and i hate to use that word for some reason but it just really is the moment you've all been waiting for today we have some purple punch and we are going to be grinding equal weights of these now this is half a gram each as measured by my scale which you guys can't read so you're gonna have to take my word for it and so what we're gonna do is we're just going to come over here and we are going to stick some bud in both of these and show you how they work and i just want to show you i am cramming this stuff into the santa cruz and hopefully it doesn't make an idiot out of me uh but i have been amazed at how well this thing can resist uh jamming and gumming up so hopefully i get to show that to you guys and same thing would just mash these guys in here and again both of these very easy to get your flower into lots of space surprising amount of space in between the teeth on the santa cruz for its size it's actually very similar to the life grinder and it works fantastic we have half a gram in each of these lids as you can tell it's a lot different relative to the size of the grinder so first we're going to do the life grinders come up here and so as you can see most of the flowers gone through we still have a little bit that's hanging out up top that should be no nope we're still here okay yeah all right a couple more twists and everything's pretty much falling through then we're gonna move over to the santa cruz here and the santa cruz is like i'm two twists in and look i mean just look at it would you just look at it it just it grinds so smoothly and i was expecting more resistance because it doesn't have you effectively have less of a lever here than you do here so i was expecting more jamming more more jerky operation all that fun stuff but i didn't get it luckily and so as you can see there's there's a little bit of trichomes and some flower in the corner there let's see and as you can see there's so there's a little tiny bit sorry see if we can get that to focus there's a little dusting along the edge and then there's some flowers stuck right here and some trichomes but see what i was talking about with the life grinders see just how much of the trichomes are are stuck in here and again nitpicking but when you get to this level i feel you kind of have to nitpick to really find the differences because both of these are well thought out well manufactured they're just pretty great it's the only way i can describe it so now we have these both ground down here's another big thing i want to show you guys so if you like bigger coarser grinds raw life grinder is going to be for you if you're like me and i'm i'm sorry raw but i i own everything else from you guys i mean how i got a freaking glass rolling trick i don't even know why i really like the consistency it's it's nice for picking up you can grab a good little pinch of it and then just spread it out nice and evenly across your papers before you roll up but some people are into the coarser grind and some folks like the coarser grind this is still very nice and fluffy there's nothing wrong with either one of these so what we are going to do we are going to weigh these again all right so now we are going to weigh the santa cruz we have .3 grams made it through uh from point five being ground initially and some of this is going to be you know trichome sticking to the walls flour sticking inside of here or stuff sticking to the teeth but again for the most part looks pretty damn good and i was expecting a lot more jams with these teeth when i started using them as you can see neither of these grinders are brand new clean because i want to give you guys the real world breakdown of how they work when they're dirty not when they're perfectly out of the box and then we're gonna weigh raw all right and point four made it through on the raw life grinder so again you're not going to notice this completely negligible difference final thoughts on this again both of these fantastic pieces of equipment well thought out well made continue to have iterations going to refine them and another thing that's exciting news for at least me and hopefully they'll just sell the grinder plates but i did see josh castleman the founder of raw making a video where he was talking about they're doing some prototyping with a new tooth design i believe he said something about a square tooth design so i'm going to keep my eyes peeled for that one and i'll let you guys know if i hear anything about it because if there's a square tooth that they're coming up with with maybe maybe a little bit better drop through a little bit at better edge cleaning very excited to see that and i will absolutely be reviewing it for you so that is basically it folks bra in santa cruz prefer for myself i prefer the santa cruz now again sorry bro i'm not getting rid of this this is still a great grinder i still use it every now and then but for for the most part i roll pinners you know one and a quarter pinners and the smaller grind works for me if you are rolling blunts or you you know you got a little bit more space to mess with the raw might be for you and again totally down to personal preference if you guys have any questions please let me know in the comments i got this video idea from somebody who viewed one of my videos and i cannot remember their name right now i'm sorry if you guys have ideas let me know i uh well i was for a load but i'm looking for a job so i got nothing but time and if i can get you guys some info then my day's not totally wasted so all right well thank you for joining me again any questions please drop them down the comments otherwise thanks for stopping by and have a good", "3b6Pfcvg_wQ": "hi YouTube I'm here to show you the quantum crush herb grinder it is a large 2.5 inch model so it's larger than some of the ones that I've had it came in this little bag like a little pouch to carry I had to wrestle this out of this pouch it took me a while I thought it was gonna have to cut the bay so I don't like the bank the bank is useless who wants the back anyways use it for something else so this is a grinder um it comes it's for peace and it comes with your brushes and scraper easy to use it crushes up your substance nice and then as expected nice quality sometimes you'll get them the grinders and they're a little rickety like the threadings a little off or hard it's pretty smooth which is nice because it's a nice quality and a large size and there you have it you can crush up a lot of stuff depends on what you wanna crush up some people use it for hurts people use it for tobacco and some people use it for other things it's your choice I don't care I just know that it's a good grinder", "aL6hwHw33hs": "hello Corky's welcome back I've mentioned it on the channel multiple times but a coffee grinder is the most important appliance you can have to really get a great home brewing experience with coffee but not a lot of people have a ton of money to put down on a coffee grinder so I'm bringing the you the shard or burr coffee electric grinder it's the cheapest one I could find on Amazon there's only a few others that compete in this price point I'm going to be showing you the features we're going to be testing it out and I'll be giving you my final thoughts so stay tuned [Music] hello everybody I'm Billy from Cork and java.com and we all know you're supposed to enjoy and get fascination from even the little things in life that most people take for granted so here at Cork and Java I'm here to expand and enrich your experience with all of your favorite beverages through wine and coffee reviews and how to's so if that sounds interesting to you consider hitting that subscribe button down below and the little Bell so you're notified when our future videos come out all right so we're reviewing the shard or electric burr grinder it's about $50 give or take on Amazon and I'll leave a link down in the description if the strikes your fancy after this review and you want to pick it up so let's get right down to unboxing shall we boom all right there we go unboxed and all ready to go so right off the bat it is a very nice compact machine it's pretty aesthetic I don't know I just I like the black and I like the styling they put on the knobs the kind of texture it it's made predominantly of plastic which you're going to get with any lower end burr grinder that you get and but it's all you know BPA free food grade plastic you got a nice clear plastic container so you can see how much grinds in there I know even some of the higher-end grinders they're not see-through so you kind of have trouble knowing when it might be getting to capacity and which could cause clogs and stuff like that so it's nice having the see-through container although one thing that I will be interested to see is what kind of static this thing produces because plastic is typically not good for static normally you'd want either a glass container or something that has some static proof miss to it I know Barossa they're plastic bins are a lot more static proof than the normal plastic would be so that's going to be something I'm looking for so the type of bird grinder this is there are several types of burglars out there you got the flat fur grinders which this is a variation of and you got conical burr grinders which are gravity-fed and have a rotating bird that it's kind of like it a screw that pulls the beams down into a conical shape if you've seen our review of the bottom here you you know what a conical burr grinder looks like or our bharata virtuoso an encore review those are also conical burr grinders this one is actually a block grinder it's got a blocker which is basically the same concept as a flat horizontal burr grinder has but it's a much smaller bird and it's got little blocks on it that it kind of helps get the beans started being chopped because a machine like this isn't gonna have a super high-powered motor in it they're trying to cut costs here so they got to do something and so the the birds need a little bit help to get the beans started in the grind process so they've got those little blocks that shop the bean a little bit before it actually hits the birds that start slicing it so I'm going to be looking for to see what kind of consistency loss we get with that kind of block fir compared to a normal conical burr grinder that I'm used to or even some like higher-end flat fir grinders button that's going to be standard for most in these price range so there's nothing knocking it so to adjust the coarseness there's a knob on the side and it says it goes all the way from espresso to drip to French press and I'm sure called brew in there too but besides maybe a few pressurized Porta filter espresso machines I wouldn't be too confident using this machine for anything espresso related I think this is going to be really in the market for people that are just getting into maybe pour over coffee maybe French press or you're just trying to upgrade your experience with your automatic drip machine at home maybe you're buying the pre-ground coffee at the store and you want to get something a little bit fresher this is going to be a huge step up for you in that arena as well as it's going to be a big step up from a blade grinder which is basically a blender that's chopping the beans it's heating up the beans and it's doing all sorts of inconsistency there so I'm sure this is going to be a huge step up from that type of grinder and especially if you're buying pre-ground coffee at the store so on the front here you've got kind of I guess it's their version of a timer it goes by cups and so that's not really a feature that I would use I typically pre weigh my coffee ahead of time and put in only one dose at a time but if you've got this dialed in for maybe your automatic drip machine and you can mess around with it and do some trial and error you can just do a set it forget it you can store your beans up in this hopper area and figure out what how many cups works for you in the machine you got and also what kind of grind setting gives you that kind of taste you want typically if you're getting kind of a weak sour taste you're going to want to go a little bit finer if you're getting a really bold bitter taste you want to go a little bit coarser so that's kind of how you determine what the grind size is gonna be and there's a bunch of different methods for like pour over well I do I show the four six method on my channel and that's what I would typically be using this type of grinder for I love to do pour over as my go-to everyday drink all right well let's stop talking about it and let's see how it works let's do a all the way coarse grind setting Oh turn it to the courses setting possible and then I'll do one setting with a fully course I'll do a medium and then I'll see how fine it can get and then we'll take a look and see how it does oh by the way it also comes with this cool little scoop thing and a little brush for doing maintenance clearing out any debris you got in there I'll run it forward a little bit in see how it does [Music] [Applause] a little bit of popcorn and that's when it's just bouncing around a lot it's not super loud which is kind of a convenient thing but I'm already smelling a lot of the coffee yeah and it's heated it up a little bit this this type of grinder isn't going to be the coolest so if you're really a nerd about that kind of thing this is not going to give you a super cool roast it's going to impart a little bit of heat into the beans all right let's pour this out yeah I'm not super loud I definitely is kind of on the average range I would say for volume if that's a factor for you and on this core sitting there wasn't really too many static issues which is great so I'm really happy about that actually all right now let's go to a medium setting I got the dial about halfway there it's a step dial instead of a continuous variability so you have to pick one of the steps there's 18 I believe all right let's grind it again let's see if there's any difference in sound on the medium compared to the more coarse grind [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] all right still fairly quiet so that's good to see yeah the way that they designed this container is pretty nice there's not too much spillage out the sides it's got a pretty good seal on there I'm gonna pour this out we do have a pretty massive collection of fines up here on the top which which isn't isn't ideal there but that's gonna happen with this style of block reinder there's nothing you can do to prevent that really and finally let's dial it down to what it calls the espresso setting all the way as close as we can get the bursts together and we'll see how fine this thing goes here goes nothing guys [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] already not too bad static wise you got a little bit of build up here on the top it's pretty fun or pretty uh of course for a espresso setting so if you're buying this for an espresso machine just beware that you're taking a little bit of a risk if you have like a pressurized Porta filter type espresso machine this this might be fine it's not going to be ideal but it could pass for a functional at least alright let me give you guys a close-up of the grinds that I just ground alright guys here is the coarsest setting that we ground to as you can see it's not super consistent there's a lot of fine still in here but overall this is way better than you would get from a normal plate grinder so this is definitely a step up from that and this will get you by on a French press it is not quite coarse enough in my opinion for cold brew but it should do French press just fine next up here is the medium grind this is actually the most consistent out of all three of them it still has a lot of fines mixed in but that is you cannot avoid that with a block burr it's just gonna happen but overall it's definitely consistent enough to be a great grind for an automatic drip machine if that's what you use and it will work just fine for pour over as well it'll get you by and here is their espresso grind it's a little bit clumpy it's not consistent and it's definitely not fine enough for most standard espresso machines it will maybe get you by with a like a cheaper like DeLonghi pressurize Porta filter setup it's not gonna be ideal but it might work it'll also be a lot better than the espresso pre-ground stuff that you would buy in the store if you're currently using that this is gonna top that I'm just saying it's not going to be as good as if you're investing for life that Bharata virtuoso or the Encore with the upgraded burr set up in that will get you really nice grinds for the entry-level espresso machines and if you're into very premium espresso setups you're gonna have to spend probably at least $400 for a grinder so that isn't even close to the market that this shard or is promoting and going to so it's not even fair to compete all right lastly I'm just gonna show you basically how to take it apart it's got a lock on the hopper here and this hopper comes right off we've got a double lock feature which keeps it extra safe so if that's not on it's not going to turn on by itself and also if this isn't and it won't turn on and this is where the burrs are now right there it's taking out the bur for if you're gonna clean this thing clean it and out that's where you go to clean it out all right so now my final thoughts on this thing so actually I am very impressed for a grinder in this price range to really do well with static and do fairly decent on the medium grind setting which is going to be typically what you're buying this for if you're in the market for up reading your automatic through drift machine at home from pre-ground coffee or you're just getting into pour over coffee maybe some chemic french press and you don't want to break the bank you want something that it's going to get you by it's gonna do the trick and it's gonna be way better than a blade grinder the sharp or is actually a really good choice I've seen I think Cuisinart brands in this price range that we're just very messy very loud and this this in my opinion beats that Cuisinart that I've I've actually used I say it's a Buy if you're in the market for an entry-level grinder that is just for your everyday pour overs or Griff machine I'm actually impressed leave a comment down below with your preferred coffee brewing style what do you typically do at home do you use an automatic drip machine which one do you use do you do a pour over I typically do a v60 pour over myself make sure you guys are checking us out on Facebook Pinterest and Twitter I'm looking forward to seeing you guys online so until next time bottoms up [Music]", "h23rF0xrhTE": "himalayan salt doesn't actually come from the himalayas it's mined 186 miles away in pakistan thanks to its pink hue and supposed health benefits the salt has exploded in popularity since the late 2000s today it's turned into lamps statues and of course table salt but extracting the coveted salt means descending into dark caves then blasting and carrying heavy rock i don't have we went inside the mine turning this mountain into 400 000 tons of pink salt each year the kayode salt mine here in the punjab region of pakistan is the second largest salt mine in the world the pink salt comes from remnants of ancient seabeds that crystallized 600 million years ago legend has it it was actually alexander the great's horse that first discovered these salt rocks when it stopped to take a lick then under british rule salt mining ramped up in the 1870s today it's a popular tourist destination and a working mine producing the majority of the world's pink salt all the mining starts here at the train station this train takes miners deep into the mountain here tunnels stretch for 25 miles and it's always 64 degrees fahrenheit 300 miners work these dark chambers they've used many of the same mining tools for over a century foreign only half of the mountain salt is actually mined the rest is used for structural support so the chambers don't collapse tractors haul the mine salt out of the mountain each day miners excavate over a thousand tons of salt or about the weight of 157 elephants outside they search for blocks with the best shape and coloring to send to manufacturers once picked the blocks are loaded up on trucks either by hand or crane and sent across pakistan historically pakistan couldn't process this raw pink salt so much of it was exported to india cheaply india would treat the salt label it as made in india and sell it at a premium pakistan saw little of the profits npr reported that a ton of salt sold to india for 40 could fetch 300 in europe in 2019 a social media campaign calling for the end of salt exports to india went viral that same year the pakistani government banned all assault exports to india the goal returning the profits to pakistan 23 percent but some pakistani salt exporters suffered they didn't speak english and couldn't meet europe's tough import standards only about a dozen exporters saw an opportunity to sell products under pakistani labels directly to europe muhammad was one of them every month he purchases 300 tons of salt from the mine for his company himalayan decor international [Music] most of the work is done by hand but drills and saws have sped up the process in recent years over in karachi rm salt pakistan 12 to 15 kg ranges basically blocks are fed into the grinder and broken down into smaller grains workers bag and weigh a thousand of these pouches of pink salt every hour like mohammed's factory rm salt also makes lamps and other specialty products after the raw material we get we convert it with a different shape as per our order like you can see in the cutting machine he is cutting different sizes on this saw water prevents dust from flying up but on the grinders it's not possible which is why muhammad's staff wore masks even before the pandemic over at rm salt as you can see this facility we have installed a vacuum through which we can absorb the dust this is the order of usa one of our clients we are making these goods for them the moon shape and the hardship as well double drill washing processes the lamps are then coated with the gel to prevent humidity from interacting with the salt and then they're shrink wrapped arm salt ships 30 containers of products every month muhammad exports about 80 of his products primarily to western countries like the us uk and spain where demand has spiked in the last decade because of the alleged health benefits however it's such a very small percentage of the salt it makes up these minerals you are highly unlikely to get any real benefit or any trace of them in your regular serving of salt itself but nutritionally it's pretty much similar to regular salt it's also pretty similar tasting to sea salt but others claim himalayan salt has healing powers whether inhaled used in spa treatments or in lamp form there's a lot of different homeopathic remedies that can seem very very appealing but actually they're not grounded in evidence and it's these false health claims that have driven the price up himalayan salt can cost up to 20 times the price of normal table salt normally your price is but that money doesn't always make it back to the miners they take home less than 1 500 rupees a day not much more than the cost of this bag of himalayan sea salt at walmart and those salaries have stayed the same even though pakistan has severed its salty relationship with india and the pink salt is seeing growing luckily the mountain won't run out of salt anytime soon it's estimated only about 220 million tons of salt have been excavated here nothing compared to the nearly 6.7

straight into this now start off only paid like $90 please whole box every single item except the AZ grinder is under $10 which is absolutely amazing and it's steel so let's open this up and have a look so first moment see they've got some bubble wrap because some royal stuff here's a little list of the things that I got I'll give you a little close-up just so you can see there you can see we got some wider as we got some rolling tools some grinders so the first thing we have right here is the classic roll loaded up and this is basically just a black little cone-shaped thing that they can fill up your phones with as you can see right there now I only paid six thousand thirty three cents for this now have a link down the scripts box below where you can get every single one of these

lighter and this lighter just back basically they see water and that's a whole wave like gadgets and little things on the side I don't review video on that after this video but yeah this was only like $9 990 it just adds like hyper scissors a week few little features okay now this is the king size for black wrong machine now this is a very good roller I actually have made a video after this on this already so I'll upload that after this but it's a very very good king sized roller okay what else do we have the other bottom of this box alright now this is a cool thing it's called the cyber blotter and basically what this is is a rechargeable water I paid 16 $16.95 for this but basically what this is is a lie that can recharge and it will keep making you a a light it's like a little a little taser light a little sappy bit and this will Kim light like your joins the cones as bit odd to light cones with it but it's good for like joins and cigarettes as you can see right there it's got a little USB charger and basically as charges on the wall and then you can basically lash it with it it's a very high quality and I have seen reviews on this and they do last a very long time like I'm talking a few years plus anyways what is the last thing you have down this box this is the easy grown-up head $43.99 for this which is a bit more than all the other ones here but it's a very good runner and very good gadget I will make a review video on this and it will be linked in description box where you can get this off Amazon for the best price on Internet so basically what this is is just an electric grinder and you put your body in there and you hold the button and it will grind up or you wait for you and then put it in your bowl etc yeah but it is very good electric gonna put in one of the best on the market yeah what is the last one happy and it is some weigh scales perfect so this is 0.001 scales so you can wear a pod and work very very well but anyways hope you enjoyed this video guys doubloons yeah description box below anyways class face out", "DNm9cgUiVfE": "hey everybody and welcome to Lexus world and in a bit of a fun-filled episode today we are gonna be showing off some different grinders and I'm gonna compare to you guys the difference between a really simple five to ten dollar grinder like this little plastic two-piece versus a about a 60 or 70 dollar grinder which is this 4 piece space case and we're gonna be showing off this hundred and fifty dollar roughly lift innovations grinder which is a four piece so let's compare and contrast them all and how well they grind and all that kind of thing and we'll start off with this little guy they are between five and ten dollars depending on where you get them and the good ones happen to have a little magnet in the middle and they also have a little hidden storage compartment right here but the problem is is that they rely on these plastic teeth and the plastic teeth are sharp on the onset but they actually wear down and then the grinder doesn't spin as well but you can see if I put some weed in there and turn because it's new it's turning quite well the grind is pretty quick and as you can see if grinded everything up pretty fine so no big complaints with this grinder but the problem is is as I said as it gets old and sticky it becomes a little bit tougher to spin and you need to put some torque behind it and yeah it will sooner or later break it is kind of flimsy so this is not a forever grinder this is a grinder that you can take to a party or camping and feel pretty good about losing or at least if you lose it it doesn't really matter you can always go out spend five bucks in another one the next grinder I'm gonna show you guys is this this is a four piece space case that my regular viewers would have seen and the reason I like the space case grinders because it's got all of the features that a really good grinder should have and it's not a super unreasonable price and what you have in it is a nice and powerful magnet that'll hold down the lid no matter how hard you shake it's got a bunch of sharp teeth it's got plenty of holes in the sifting area so that your material doesn't get stuck in the top compartment if you open it up the threading is nice and thick you're not gonna have any cross threading you have a really nice deep Bowl for the herb area and you also have at the bottom a little Keef collector there you go and as you guys can see everything's super clean because they clean this in the last episode and if you put a little bit of weed into it let's see how it functions I've actually it's been a while since I've had it this clean so this should be cool and this is completely effortless especially when the grinder is this clean but space cases are really good so even once they get old and full of stickiness they turn pretty easily and voila it also has absolutely no difficulty grinding up the herb really fine so let's clean this up voila and now we move on to this lift innovations grinder which I thought was very interesting it is canadian made and with all of the accessories which are quite numerous it actually runs about a hundred and fifty bucks so it actually comes with three different screens that'll determine how much key falls through the grinder as you guys can see I've been testing it out for the last couple of weeks it's got several sifting screens three to be precise and I put in the medium one into the bottom right here because I felt that this one was wouldn't cut up fine enough and this was a little too fine so I quickly switched it out to this and the reason I could switch it out so easily is that comes with the stool and you can actually remove the various rings really easily with this tool and that lets you get at the screens and the sifter is very easily tada super simple I thought that was kind of cool the other cool thing is that even though it comes with a relatively deep Bowl and a relatively deep Keef collector it actually comes with this bonus chamber and you can install at whichever way you want personally I would like to install it like this and get the herb collection area to be twice as deep here's the other feature of this grinder when you open it up you have this kind of blade that spins and it connects into the cover of the grinder up here this is probably the most interesting and unique thing about the design of this one because when you do it this way you create a lot of torque on the cover making it enormous ly easy to spin it even if it starts to get sticky so we'll just put a couple of pieces and again just to show you guys and it spins really really effortlessly tada and here's the one issue I found with this grinder they tried to create this super nice torquey design with a fancy blade but it sometimes means that even as you spin the herb doesn't come all the way down because it can't get caught on the blade so sometimes as a result you end up spinning for longer with this hundred and fifty dollar grinder but in the end as you can see everything works out and you get again very fine weed look at how huge that is with the extra compartment on there it's pretty crazy so overall final thoughts in these three grinders this one I have worked in a head shop and I can tell you that a larger amount of people buy something like this than anything else they just want a really simple grinder that's compact and doesn't cost a lot of money and this works for a bunch of people I have always found these to get a little bit sticky and I found them to not cut as well once they get a little bit used up now this space case I really love I've had it for a long time it's very compact by the way all of these are two and a bit inches so they're the same size you can actually stack them right on top of another and fits perfectly but in any case this grinder is a really good one and it's only 60 bucks and it'll last you a lifetime especially if you clean it out occasionally using the method I showed off in the last episode now this I found that it was very feature heavy and there's a lot that you can do with it as I demonstrated the blade weakness thing as I said is its biggest problem I would buy this grinder if I was a an old lady or somebody with wrist problems or somebody who wanted their grinder to be some kind of big brand statement when they bring it out for myself a grinder just to Grindr and I did not like this twice as much as I like this so for myself I can't justify the price but I can see how some people would want something fancy like this and go for it I will link to all these different grinders in the video description and if you enjoyed this little comparison be sure to subscribe and hit that like button we'll see you next time on Lexus world and stay let everybody", "AVYGxext8XI": "today we're going to look at some cheap cheap bur grinders some electric bur grinders that you can buy online right now for in the region of 50 pounds that was my kind of target budget here they're in and around there going from about 39.95 up to 53.95 but i suspect those prices change pretty often so the question i want to ask today is is it worth spending just a little bit of money in getting into the coffee grinding game or is in fact that a terrible waste of money and you should save your pennies and buy something a little bit better are these useful to have at home or are these just contributing to the endless e-waste that is sinking our planet further into the abyss let's find out we're not going to be doing the most exhaustive tests here we're going to be doing some pretty simple tests we're going to first just walk through each of these different grinders and have a look at the features how they're built how they feel then we'll pull some shots with them most of them have an espresso setting can this actually pull espresso shots is it in any way useful with an espresso machine then we'll brew as close to as possible identical filter coffee with each of them and i'll taste those blind against another benchmark of a really good grinder just to see how big the gap is is is it going to be disgusting in comparison to a good brew or is it going to be pretty close and then we'll come back at the end i'll tell you if there's really any one that's better than the other and we'll find out is it worth spending the money first off the grinders now this is the one i bought first it's from the liter it's called the molino and i saw it online and it was cheap and i was like i wonder how much does it suck is it good is it bad so it's had a bit more use than the other ones have here grind adjustment here on the side not a particularly enjoyable part of the process a little safety switch on the hopper there's a burr inside with all of these grinders actually it's pretty easy to remove the internal bear and that's this here we'll talk about the burs maybe towards the end they all look like cheap ceramic burs i don't know why they've got these extra screw holes in them here that's not really a good thing for a grinder like this collects a lot of dirt debris old coffee fines not what you want quick sound test sounds pretty awful sounds like a very cheap vacuum cleaner the cuisinart this is about 43 45 pounds uh it's been around a good long time i once bought one for someone for a friend i'm about to find out how bad i should feel about that but it was a long time ago big start button and then on here you've got a sort of cup quantity selector i presume that works by a time sound wise no not very good adjustment big chunky clicks doesn't feel particularly good how you feel about how these look is kind of up to you i don't think any of them are particularly beautiful and probably the least beautiful is this one here it's the delonghi very boxy funny little lid on this one i'm not sure how i feel about that yeah pretty pretty plasticky adjuster of grime there interestingly though this adjuster at the front which i presume is time very nice i couldn't use the same adjustment this again super cheap i think about 40 pounds i paid for it very much what you'd expect standard to sort of hop a bin and it sounds also very bad last one up slightly funny one here it's it's branded the andronicus world of coffee which used to be in harrods i don't think it's there anymore not a bad looking grinder power button in the sort of adjuster of cup quantity is stepless which i suppose is nice [Music] that one is the most hoover sounding and your grand adjustment on the side there now they all look like they've got pretty much identical burs but they sound like they have different motors we might get different groin profiles as a result i don't know how well each of them have seated their burrs how good their threading is which can use the decent for this we're just gonna pull some pretty standard sort of seven eight bar flat line shots maybe a small decline at the end a little bit of pre-infusion but not so much that they would need to grind very very fine and we'll see if we get anything vaguely approaching espresso out of any of these dosing from this little thing is is not the easiest thing in the world so about 18 grams i will say this does look pretty fine so we might get some sort of espresso i thought we were going to be okay for a second there and then shot's a bit quick oh no pretty fast not fine enough for espresso at its finest grind setting really difficult to get all the coffee out of this thing quite frustrating in that regard true of most ground settings there with this thing this is not a particularly good container and the static electricity on this thing is out of control let's move on now the cuisinart sounds completely awful but the static is something else there is kind of coffee all over the lid a huge amount up the top here and then some sort of scattered around it does look pretty fine if you think i'm drinking that you're probably right actually i'll give it a quick let's have a taste ah no next now i will say this one sounded better grinding than many of the others did same problem with an enormous amount of static here all of these grinders pretty much are designed i think to be run full and use the little cup button to decide how much coffee they grind each time just by a simple timer mechanism they sound better when they're full of coffee they probably run more consistently when they're full of coffee uh but i don't want to fill them with coffee that feels like a staggering waste for this particular video it's gonna be a fast chop i know you all enjoy watching me suffer so cheers to you yeah disgusting don't pull shots with this it can't do espresso trying to pour accurately from giant round things is not fun that was in the window of good espresso which is quite a surprise i'm a little bit impressed that this managed that but just on the cusp i would definitely want to be able to go finer than this if i was making espresso every day but this is by far the finest of any of them and the brew looked okay like uh didn't channel horribly wasn't any of that kind of mess got a bit of texture it's not beautifully extracted but it is reasonably extracted like that's not a great shot actually the finish isn't particularly good it's not a great grinder but it's just in this test i suppose this takes the win so the filter coffee test we've brewed a v60 with each of these and i spent some time with them dialing them in and that was very interesting very useful so they're all extracting in a very similar kind of percentage they're all about the same strength the end brews we use 20 in to 300 on a v60 and so on the end here we also have from the old lynn weber a kind of benchmark now that grinder costs more than 50 times what this grinder costs which is a lot and and we'll talk about that grinder another time but for now i just wanted a benchmark of what a really good grinder tasted like against these things here i could have done this as a blind test i guess but to be honest it's never going to be truly properly blind so we might as well have a little taste and see if there are any obvious differences like i said they've all been kind of benchmarked through uh extraction testing with a little refractometer it's uh it's sloping time now this is very interesting they've all cooled down a little bit which has made it easier for me to taste and if i'm truly truly honest with the exception of this cup here they are all very similar none of these taste particularly bad actually it tastes like good coffee and i think it was and it was good water and it was good technique so you can tell there's a missing piece of the puzzle though because they all have this kind of muddiness for one of a better word there's a sort of textual intensity and a slight powderiness to them and a sort of muddiness and a lack of clarity of flavor here with a much better grinder you've got a ton of clarity you've got more sweetness you've got less bitterness there's still nice mouth feel and texture that's what you're getting with a better grinder now i'd say of these particular brews i like this one the best and i like this one the least this one just tastes like had a lot more fines in it in terms of flavor they're nowhere near a high-end grinder in terms of enjoyment they all have more bitterness they all have more astringency they all have less sweetness even the better tasting one here so we need to just answer the most important question if you've got 50 pounds or you've got the equivalent in us dollars or whichever currency is your currency should you buy one of these grinders should you start grinding coffee at home if you don't grant coffee at home and that is a good question throughout my entire coffee career i have advocated for people grinding their own coffee at home the smell of coffee grinding is an absolute delight fresh coffee is better than pre-ground coffee so you'd think i would say yes to should you buy one of these grinders but buying something should improve your life it should be a net benefit and with these i'm not sure there's a net benefit there's an improvement it's going to taste better than say stale very very old pre-ground coffee you'll be able to adjust a grind for a brewing method for example there are some benefits but the downsides with these grinders are simply too large they sound awful i could not imagine being up at six in the morning waiting to have coffee listening to these things grind coffee it would ruin my morning before it had begun it's a very unpleasant sound and i know i'm running them empty sometimes which sounds way worse than running them full but i think a lot of people watching this channel would want to grind to order and not leave beans in hoppers for days or weeks on end for each and every one of these grinders for me the static issue is a deal breaker it's so annoying to try and get ground coffee out of these dosing bins with static being everywhere and it either means you have this accumulation of ground coffee inside the bins or you end up with static all over your counter or on yourself it's it's miserable again it's just not how i want to start my day and for that bump and improvement and it is better than pre-ground stale coffee but but at such a cost they're all maddening in unique and kind of interesting ways this little grinder as you grinding towards the end ground coffee is flying back out of the burst into the bean hopper which is messy and looks terrible and is a mess to clean this thing because the hopper is your grind adjuster if you have it adjusted like this it becomes asymmetrical and it just visually really bothers me dosing out of this round bin with any sort of accuracy was really quite frustrating and the hopper the fit was just wasn't a pleasure to use in any way it was ergonomically unpleasant none of them has a particularly good build quality none of them feel like they're made to last in any meaningful way and if it's going to be a sort of stepping stone for you i would just try and skip that step i would try and save your money and start with an entry level wilfer or baratza grinder or something of that kind if you're making filter coffee at home i just wouldn't necessarily pick one of these up because i don't think they're fun or enjoyable to use and i think that's really important i would say save your pennies i would say save your pennies for a grinder that is more enjoyable to use i don't think we should reward manufacturers for building grinders like this they are wasteful and unnecessary and i i don't think we should buy them gift them anything like that just save your money and buy something better and you will enjoy using it a lot more and you'll enjoy your coffee a lot more now despite my angriness i am grateful to my patreon supporters for giving me a budget to go and buy these things and test them and that way hopefully share some information with you usually i give away anything i review to my patreon audience but if they don't want these then keep an eye on my twitter or instagram and if they're going to a wider giveaway i'll be sure to let you know do you have one of these grinders have you had a very different experience to me are you leaving it full of beans and therefore it's not as annoying in a sort of auditory way what are you doing are you happy with these grinders did it feel like a good investment are you happy with the bump in quality i'd love to hear your thoughts down in the comments below but for now i'll say thank you so much for watching and i hope you have a great day", "l0MjFAbol1M":

a unique machine which won the 2013 award for best new consumer product by the FCA a which is the Specialty Coffee Association of America it's the barista Express by Breville this semi-automatic machine combines both brewing and grinding in one unit and has some technical features who are typically only going to find on higher level consumer or prosumer machines hi mark and Morgan here from whole lot sale of you know any think of countries that design espresso machines Italy usually comes to mind and while the Italians have a long tradition of thoughtful design and craftsmanship what we're looking at here is a thoroughly modern implementation of what it takes to make expresso and milk based drinks designed by Breville an Australian company known for innovative products so what we've got is a grinder an espresso machine in one unit and it turns out there's a lot to like here good design should be pleasing to look at but beyond aesthetics it needs to work well and be easy to use and we think the briefs Express has what it takes first out of the box it comes with everything you need except for some good coffee beans and milk to make espresso and on up to all your favourite milk based drinks including lattes and cappuccinos usually when you buy a semi-automatic espresso machine you either already have or will be buying a grinder and with this machine the grinders built right in and it's a pretty good one with stainless steel conical burrs and 16 grind settings yeah I like the hopper on this one you know it's not large but if the hopper really isn't the place to be storing beans anyway what's nice is one removed the doors close so the beans stay put this makes it easy to return beans to storage or change them out when switching between different types of coffee along with a 16 grind settings you have adjustable automatic dosing for single and double shots as well as manual dosing to select single or double and place the Porta filter in the holder press in once and release the grinder starts and then stops automatically the amount dose can be finally adjusted using the grind amount knob for manual dosing just press the Porta filter in and hole we'll continue to grind until you release now with a grinder dispensing above the drip tray you can't expect some spillage there but instead of having two areas to clean up like if you had a separate grinder all your mess is going to be contained in the one area to brew just lock the Porta filter into the group head and press either the single or double shot button these are preset to deliver about one in two ounces respectively these can be reprogrammed by pressing the programming button pressing a brew button to start and then pressing the brew button again when the desired volume is reached the machine comes with four filter baskets it's got a single and double pressurized basket and single and double non-pressurized basket with the pressurized baskets little or no tamping is needed with the non-pressurized baskets the machine comes with a tamper for compressing the coffee in the Porta filter a convenient design touch the tamper is magnetic and stores on the machine itself the 54 millimeter Porta filter is made of stainless steel but it is smaller than a standard 58 millimeter commercial size Porta filter we mentioned that this machine has some brewing features typically found on higher end machines the first is PID temperature control PID results in extremely accurate brew water temperature control this is an important element in producing consistent shots the preset brewing temperature is user adjustable up or down by 4 degrees Fahrenheit each way in 2 degree increments the second is what Breville refers to as the dry puck feature typically getting a drier dryer coffee puck requires the use of a specialized valve which releases the pressure used during brewing and excess water the result is a relatively dry coffee puck which is easy to knock out of the Porta filter after brewing the machine also has a brewing pressure gauge using this you will see the Machine go through a short pre infusion which wets the coffee briefly with low pressure water for a fuller extraction during pressure brewing the gauge lets you know if you're creating the right brewing pressure for a proper espresso extraction it's an aid that can help you dial in the proper combination of grind size coffee dose and tamping pressure in our tests and with the help of that gauge it took us about three attempts to dial in just the right grind dose and tamp for a very premier it's imperfect 25 second extraction another aid to brewing is the steam purge system so after steaming milk there's going to be accessed steam in the boiler now on most machines you need to manually cool down the boiler after steaming milk and before brewing more espresso with a purge system excess seam is automatically released internally to the drip tray so coffee is not burnt by residual steam in the boiler when espresso is brewed the next time when you're ready to steam some milk for a latte or cappuccino it takes a machine only about 30 seconds to come up the steam temperature the steam wand is mounted on a 360 degree swivel joint making it easy to position the included milk frothing pitcher the steam wand is a pro-style single hole giving the user complete control of the type of froth created the briefs Express has a 2 litre water tank and this can be filled at the machine or removed for filling at the sink and in the Breville tradition of the machine coming with everything you need it comes out of the box with a water filter next to the bean hopper is a cup warming surface for preheating cups the drip tray is large and has an area which separates excess grounds from liquids behind the drip tray is a hidden tool storage area to hold the assorted cleaning tools that come with a machine the drip tray has a pop up indicator which reads empty me and in the same vein is the clean me light which illuminates when a cleaning cycle is required using the included cleaning tablets the barista Express is wrapped in a brushed stainless steel finish and all food contact areas are certified bpa free for me the machine has a lot of features you would typically find on higher end consumer machines and you know I really like that built-in grinder it certainly makes for a machine grinder combo that takes up less counter space and you know this might sound a little bit trivial but for me something that stood out beyond the features and quality of the machine was the quality of the manual very clear concise and easy to understand that's the Breville barista Express I'm Marc and I'm Morgan from whole a sale of thanks for watching and don't

to the ritual channel my name is DOM and today we're are we talking about our favorite grinder on the ritual Channel so this is our favorite grinder it goes by the name of kozo grinders and there's also one called irony I'm not sure if I Rainey's a knockoff or whatever but the Iranian one does not have the label on it on the grinder at least and the kozo one has a grind has a label on the top which is actually very helpful because on this one you can't tell which side is is up or down because there's no labeling on it so maybe you want to put a sticker something like that if you get the IR anyone now I know you might ask why do you have six of the same grinders well that's gonna lead us to our first reason why we like this grinder so much is because it's is a great value and this one costs thirteen dollars this one the cozell one the branded one cost $19 and it's just a great value for $13 you just can't beat it there are places in the United States where you can't buy a pizza for $13 there are places where you can't go see a movie for $13 but for $13 you can get this shipped to your door and it should last you a lifetime because it's such a good value you can purchase multiple grinders and we like multiple grinders because for example if you have a sativa that you're smoking in the morning you want to grind it up and you still have some leftover you can just leave it in here and smoke it in the next morning and then you can have another grinder right here lunchtime weed nighttime weed so that's what we like having multiple grinders and because this kozo grinder is so economical it allows us to have multiple grinders without spending too much money the next reason why we like this renders so much is because it has a removable screen which can make it either a four piece grinder or a three piece grinder and those of you guys that watch the ritual channel know that we love three-piece grinders because honestly you know we just don't like saving the key for later we rather just smoke it right away however if you do like the screen and you like to sift your Keef then you can add the screen in there and now you have a four piece grinder just like that so we love the design for that aspect we also like the nubs although they're not the prettiest things they are very very functional also the grind quality that comes out of this grinder is very very very good it's got a very fluffy you know easy to burn type of quality it doesn't match up the weed or pulverize the weed which we really like so just a very clean and very very good consistent grind quality so pound for pound dollar for dollar this is our favorite grinder on the ritual Channel do you have a favorite binder please let us know down in the comments below we'd love to check it out on the ritual Channel thank you for watching we hope you enjoyed this episode subscribe if you already haven't and have a great day see you in the next one [Music] you [Music]", "55t5PXmQvxU": "hey guys in this video I want to talk to you about grinders grinders are a very important part of vaporizing they're a great cannabis gadget in general great for any use but it's super important to have a good grinder with your vaporizer every vaporizer has a different requirement for the grind and many different grinds grinders will give you different results they're not all the same and buying a cheap grinder may not end in a as a good investment in the top left-hand corner here you see the Compton grinder this is my newest grinder I just picked it up a couple of weeks ago and I'm really enjoying it it has a loading zone where you can put your herbs so that you're not crowding the center you're not risking flattening all of the herbs it has user replaceable screen using a special tool that keeps all of the parts out of the center so they don't get gunked-up with pollen and sticky substance and the compton grinders team is working on a lot of accessories for the grinder and a lot of their own products that really turning things out for example they have a great storage vault that screws directly onto your grinder so you can grind for a few different occasions for a few sessions and lock it into your storage vault and we'll show that off a little later in the top right we have the space case grinder this is the medium four-piece the compton grinders was a medium for piece as well space case is one of the oldest names and grinders they have extremely sharp diamond teeth they're thinner than most of the other Diamond teeth grinders which makes them slice really well and a lot of holes in the bottom of the grinding compartment the santa cruz redder in the bottom right hand corner is also a medium for piece but as you can see it's a little different in size from the Space Case in the Compton grinder it has a smaller diameter but it's taller so this is a taller grinder than the space case as you can see here it's got about that much honey overall I can't say a bad thing about the Santa Cruz redder one of my favorite grinders I love the concave rectangular teeth and the whole pattern design it's a it's a very high-quality grinder that lasts and lasts and lasts and has great twisting action great threads I've heard people complaining about some grinders have too many threads some grinders have too few all of these grinders have a different number of threads Santa Cruz shredder finds a happy medium in all the departments and it's a top quality grinder lastly and right next to it is the cosmic case grinder this is the medium for piece as well the cosmic case has lightning bolt shaped teeth which I like I've spent quite a bit of time with my cosmic case grinder and result very happy with it there isn't a reason I would not recommend it and as the prices for these grinders fluctuate during holidays and sale events they all come very close to each other on price let's look at the different Santa Cruz shredders I have three we have the Santa Cruz shredder medium for peace this is the santa cruz shredder jumbo for peace it's taller and significantly wider and the santa cruz shredder jumbo two-piece this is black black and gray or gunmetal the two-piece two-piece I don't like to use very much I what would you do I would have to dump it out onto the table or onto a piece of paper into a tray for my use I like having that third chamber so I will always recommend always recommend getting a four piece grinder or getting a grinder with an herb holding chamber or of course you can get the Compton grinder in the vault all sorts of options you always have options there's so many options with grinder this is the met Tanner the maintainer is a plastic grinder that also has a storage compartment maybe it's a plastic herb storage container that also has a grinder you decide this is the storage container in the maintainer this is the top half of the grinder teeth bottom half your herbs go in here grind grind grind he would then pour them into the container and when they locked and that Tanner is smell proof when I first saw the maintainer it was filled with coffee beans they were smelly coffee beans and when the maintainer was closed I couldn't smell them so it works this is an acrylic grinder acrylic is a type of plastic the specifically this is the volcano herb mill that comes with the volcano or can be purchased from Storz and Bickel you can purchase their crellick grinders from other vendors I don't really like to I've heard a lot of good things about this one and I'm very fond of it I get a cheap plastic smelly grinder and you can get such a fine acrylic rinder for not too expensive it's so difficult to get a grip on the Magic Flight nano grinder it's so when you have something in there and doing this motion this is tough this is not fun with the Magic Flight nano grinder Magic Flight finishing grinder this is more of a greater than a grinder and we will encounter a few of these it grates along the bottom using the ridges in the top fits perfectly onto a Magic Flight Launch Box great for any vaporizer that requires an ultrafine grind this is a grinder card I have a few of these that have come with different vaporizers or as freebies when I purchase the one was a business card I've never used the one I have never really felt the need to they're great for grading you can I really don't see this being a great solution ever and I've been in situations where I've had no brighter and even then I don't see the grinder card being a great solution ever hey guys don't forget to connect with me on Twitter

and aroma within one hour of being ground what's the best way to grind coffee we tested 16 models of coffee grinders to find out now coffee grinders basically come in two styles blade and burr blade grinders work like tiny food processors with a spinning blade that chops coffee into smaller and smaller pieces you hold the button down to grind shake the machine every now and then to redistribute the beans and then stop when the coffee is grounded on the size you want blade grinders are compact and inexpensive burr grinders are a little bit bigger and a little fancier they have three parts a hopper where you feed in the beans the grinding chamber and a removable bin that captures the ground so you can transfer them to the coffee maker now instead of all the dancing you have to do with a blade grinder with a burr grinder you just switch it on and it goes to work whole beans are pulled from the hopper through to gear like metal rings called burrs that spin against one another to crush the coffee kind of like the way a pepper mill grinds peppercorns the setting you choose determines the space between the birds and that changes the size of the grind now burr grinders are the gold standard in the coffee industry we tested ten burr grinders all with at least eight grind settings and they're priced from about thirty to 200 dollars we also tested six blade grinders much cheaper just 15 to 22 dollars now our plan was to find the best grinder of each style and then compare them to see what you really need now whatever the style a good coffee grinder should be able to grind beans to precise sizes the size you want depends on how you plan to brew your coffee now in general coarse Coffee is for French press medium for drip machines and fine for espresso think about how it's going to be exposed to the brew water for fast brewing like espresso you want small particles so the coffee has plenty of surface area to give water fast access for a slow French press style where the coffee sits in the water bigger coarser particles are better now first we tested burr grinders grinding coffee beans to coarse medium and fine sizes and we repeated this with both light roasted beans and very dark roasted beans because they have different densities and we had six testers from novices to coffee experts grind beans and rate the grinders on user friendliness now almost every model was able to grind those sizes the problem was many were confusing or annoying to use if you sprayed coffee everywhere while they ground the beans others had totally cryptic controls or had to be viewed from specific angles to be legible some had grounds containers that were teensy so they quickly overflowed her they were oddly shaped so we made a mess when we were pouring the coffee into the brewer and then there were more problems one with a built in scale it promised to dispense the exact amount of beans we wanted but our lab calibrated scale confirmed that that was inaccurate it missed the target by 10% every time even after we tinkered with it a second copy of this grinder missed by 6% yeah another grinder rattled so violently while it was working that it changed its own grind setting and another had a coffee grounds collection container made of glass when we accidentally bumped out off the counter it shattered now unlike those bad examples the best burger minders were easy to use and they had sturdy plastic grounds containers they could withstand a morning drop and they ground coffee neatly without making a mess so then we checked grind performance we're always hearing that burr grinders produce and extremely even grind since each beam only passes through the burrs once compared to that repeated whacking they get in a blade grinder we ground measured amounts of beans and then sifted the results in a crude sifter this is a device used by coffee professionals to separate large pieces called boulders from medium size or ideal pieces and then the dust like particles called fines we repeated this test on each grinder tweaking the settings till we got the maximum percentage of ideal pieces from each one now the worst grinder is achieved just 28% the best gave us 88% now at this point we had a favorite burr grinder that was easy to use and produce the highest percentage of ideal pieces of ground coffee per batch but what about the blade grinders so we went back and did all the same tests with six different blade grinders now some were too small to hold enough beans for a full pot when they were packed so full they struggled to grind all the beans and spilled when we open them once with innovative removable hoppers sounded great but they didn't work well grounds often got under the hoppers and we liked models where you could see the beans while you worked without buttons that made your hands cover them or hard to see through lids it's critical here because you have to know when to stop grinding and we learned a very important trick you need to shake blade grinders all through grinding not just at the end or some pieces get over ground while other beans stay whole our most successful pattern was to shake the grinder between one-second pulses so Paulsen shake pulse and shake that really helped even out the grind even with shaking a design factory made some more successful the blades sat lower in the bowl so coffee beans couldn't escape them we found spaces under the blade as tall as 14 point 1 millimeters and average beans are only 10 millimeters our favorite had just six point four millimeters of space under the blades so we never found whole beans and huge chunks left behind now after sifting we found our six blade grinders coffee ranged from 30 to 46% ideal particles and that falls pretty short of the nearly 90% ideal size that we got in our top rated burr grinder okay so then we wondered does that gold standard of evenness actually matter we brewed three batches of coffee using beans ground in the most even and least even burr grinders and in our top rated blade grinder 21 tasters tried them in a blind tasting the result was really surprising we found flavor differences but each made a good cup our tasters were even split on which ones they like the best so we brought in coffee tasting experts baristas coffee shop owners and Roasters and we did more blind tastings and every time these experts are split on which coffee they preferred and they came to the same conclusion that we did that they all made good coffee so if the evenness of your grind doesn't really matter why is the coffee industry obsessed with burr grinders it's because the machines work hands off with specific settings so they can guarantee consistency day after day in a way that a blade grinder can't ultimately we think a good burger is best for home - because they're easy to use and they take the guesswork out of grinding and even though grind evenness isn't the most important factor we still gave an edge to grinders that were more even since they didn't leave so many big chunks of unprocessed beans that's just a waste of good coffee so our favorite burr grinder was the Barossa encore at $139 it grinds very evenly with a dead simple design and no fuss operation you just choose the setting add the beans and you're done it has 40 grind settings so you can really customize your cup our best buy the capresso infinity conical burr grinder at $99.99 is also easy to use but it has just 16 settings and it doesn't work well with small quantities like when you just want to make a single cup our favorite blade grinder is the Krupps coffee and spice grinder it's incredibly simple to use and has a roomy grind chamber that holds plenty of beans with a crystal-clear lid for checking progress but we still prefer burr grinders for their consistency and their hands off grinding we found that you can truly get a great cup of coffee with a blade grinder and at just $17.99 our top choice is a real bargain [Music] you [Music]", "Cj87ikVnOCg": "hey you it's Paul from define in the box what we're defining the box to help you think outside of it this week we got the Golden Bell nice cute little Greiner it's the top-selling Grindr on Amazon three takeaways it's so cheap it's hard not to like secondly it has a very fluffy consistency that works for almost any consumption device and three is the kief catch is a pain to open it took me forever and there's a lot a lot of threads here overall score comes at a three point four two coming in a little bit above average the fact that it's cheap helps it a lot who's this for this is for the first time user who's just trying to figure out what a grinder is and get used to it who's it's not for someone trying to grind up a lot and being able to get a grinder that can handle anything that they throw at it we have five main variables to get to our overall score grinder came at a three point one has a very good grind consistency but yet it does not much grind capacity store it's got a two point three threats are pretty hard to open and it actually has a pretty small storage capacity longevity got a three point five with a lifetime warranty had an eight dollar price point it's pretty hard to beat but also the threats make it really hard to use miscellaneous got a three point for Amazon customer service is more than sufficient price got a four point five at an eight Tyler kinder it's really hard to beat I dive into how we got to each of these ratings later in the video [Music] so the overall rating is combined of five different categories they each have their own weight and rating we summarize those together to get an overall rating of three point four two now I'm gonna dive into each rating and how we got to each of those scores for the full weights and the rating and how it works is look in the description will describe it in detail first rating is the grinder rating they've got a three point one and is made of three subcategories grind speed grind consistency in grind capacity grind capacity it got a two point five that's basically how much product you can fit in the grind section a two-inch grinder is pretty standard in the industry but it has a lot of grind teeth on both the top and the bottom making it really hard to stuff a lot of product grinds P you got a two point five that's how fast we can get it from the unground to ground state it performed nearly as well as the pen simple our first review but what it did struggle with is that it would get stuck in these top sections and not actually fall through to the little holes third is grind consistency you got a four point five that's a little variance there is in your ground material it performed even better than the pen simple in the first grinder it and fall through as well but when it does fall through it's a perfect fluffy consistency that works with any consumption device second we have storage storage came out to a 2.3 and is made up of four categories storage capacity dispense speed Keith's catch and portability storage capacity got 2.5 it's basically how much ground material you can fit in the storage area this little grinder can only barely fit one gram with all of it ground up but it's a two inch grinder and it's just a little bit shorter so it makes sense dispense be they got a 2.0 that's how fast you can get it from your grinder into your consumption device the little threads right here are a little hard to open so it makes it hard to get product out keep catch you got a 1.5 and that's how easy and accessible is to get your Keith catch open this one is such a pain in the open that I have to give it a 1.5 and then once it's in here it's really it's really just small not convenient got some in here but it's more of a pain than anything else like just like it gets stuck like that like if you have a hard time like getting it back on the thread be very very precise lastly it's portability with a 3.0 that's how easily you can take your grinder with you wherever you go and if you need to bring another bag with it you'll easily throw this in another bag you can probably put it in your pocket be pretty uncomfortable so it's a pretty average portability size next we have longevity how long is this prod are gonna last you how often are you gonna use it within your stash collection for longevity it came at a 3.5 and is made up of four subcategories durability ease of use ease of cleaning and cleaning frequency durability I got a 4.0 that's just how well it can withstand all the elements there's a little bird on the side of this and it's obviously made in China but it has a lifetime warranty and is ten dollars so still gets pretty awesome rating ease if you still got a 2.5 that's if there's any initial learning curve and once you make it past the initial learning curve does it help a lot so it's a normal standard grinder but the threads make it a little bit harder that's where I definitely see an advantage with the premium grinder averse and not premium grinder cleaning frequency you got a 3.0 that's how often you actually have to clean it you can actually grind through most stems but given how close the teeth are it does take a little upkeep ease of cleaning I got a 4.0 this is once you have to clean it how easy is it it's a super small simple grinder it has a nice nickel coating where you can just and isopropyl alcohol it'll be good to go forth is miscellaneous these are all the other categories I didn't know how to put into the top three miscellaneous came at a three point four and is made up of two categories customer service and novelty customer service got a three point five that's just once you have an issue how easy is it to deal with that's an Amazon product enzyme only actually so there's no like troubleshooting pages or different like support bots but Amazon has pretty awesome customer service so came in at three point five novelty you've got a three point oh that's just how unique it is and you want to share with your friends it's just a standard old hockey puck right there nothing unique about it lastly we have price that's how it's priced relatively to the rest of the grinders on the market got a four point five eight dollar aluminum grinders pretty hard to beat so in conclusion it's so cheap it's hard

"alrighty guys welcome back to the shop recently on instagram i've told you all to find out which of these three designs you like the best the clear winner was design letter c i'm going to be calling this my war knife since it does have a very tactical look with the clip and the hologram also note that we are going to be using 180 thousandths of an inch stock opposed to the 125 000 stock that we normally use this is because this knife needs to be nice and beefy and we will be putting a hollow grind into the blade for me this knife project will be extremely satisfying since i'll be doing many techniques that i don't normally do i'll be putting a clip into the top of this blade with a false edge and i will also be hollow grinding the bevels which are two things that i have not done in a long time and with the hollow grind i don't think i've ever done it with success so i'm looking forward to this build from the start up to this point we have glued the design onto the bar stock we have cut it out with bandsaw and now we are on it to the 2x72 belt grinder from northridge to clean up the profile of a knife one of the things i'm really liking about this new belt grinder is the ability to go horizontal i find that i'm using it greatly when dialing in my profile so that a all my scratches are going in the same direction and b the spine of the knife is at a 90 degree angle to the flats of the knife being able to grind the profile at a 90 degree angle is especially useful when using the small wheel attachment as you can see right here now that we have our profile ground into a 220 grit finish we will be hand filing in our sharpening choil with a 3 16 of an inch chainsaw file i've used many different methods to put in the sharpening coil which include drilling a hole before cutting out the profile milling in with an end mill and then using the hand file all three of these methods work and it's just what you prefer to do in your shop i will also be filing in the jimping on the spine the knife with my checkering file both of these filing operations along with drilling your holes need to be completed before hardening the knife since after a knife is hard you will not be able to file into it or drill your holes i will be drilling two number 28 holes for loveless fasteners on this knife along with a handful of weight reduction holes and a lanyard hole at the back end of the knife this setup in my mini mill is kind of a common setup i use for drilling holes i'll put my one two three block into my mill vise which my mill head has been trimmed to and then i'll put a stud in that one two three block to act as a stop on the blade so that the drill bit does not catch the blade and helicopter it into my hand you can see here that i'm putting large quarter inch holes in the center of the blade just for weight reduction and to allow the epoxy some room to move around when we put our handle scales on the knife later on once i have my lanyard hole drilled i like to use a counter bore by hand to deburr that hole so that i don't get any chatter when trying to deburr that hole and kind of mess up the look of my lanyard hole at this point i briefly tried using my eight inch wheel to put a hollow in the handle and i wasn't terribly successful in that endeavor and i found myself going over the lines of the spine so i decided to put the hollows in my handle after the heat treating process with a smaller wheel to heat treat the knife i'll be using my small two brick forge getting a knife up to its critical temperature then quenching it in parks 50. after my quench i put it between my two straightening plates to make sure the blade stays straight while it is cooling in this case the blade stayed extremely straight i then take a file and hardness test blade to make sure that we have a nice hard blade after the quench in order to ensure that the blade stays straight during the tempering process i clamp it between two pieces of angle iron and then temper the blade for two two hour cycles at around 410 degrees fahrenheit after the heat treating process we need to clean up this blade before we start grinding in our bevels to do so i will use a 220 grit belt on the belt sander along with my horizontal tables to clean up the spine and profile of the knife i will also make sure to grind off a significant amount from the edge portion of the blade so that we don't have any decarburization along our edge which would cause us to have a soft edge using the two inch wheel i hollow out both sides of my handle so that i have a little bit of weight reduction in the handle scale area after removing a significant amount of material from the tang of this knife the next step is to get out the surface grinding attachment and flatten both sides of the blade not only does this clean up the flats to a uniform grit it also makes sure that both sides of the knife are extremely flat and ready to accept handle scales i'm using a 280 grit trisack belt to clean up the flats of this knife i know a lot of you guys out there have built your own surface grinding attachment and are finding that they can be difficult to store since they can be cumbersome and heavy this is how i store mine i use a piece of paracord and a bungee cord in order to hold the assembly together and hang it on my wall so at this point on the knife build we have both sides brought up to a 280 grit finish along with the spine of the knife brought up to a 220 grit finish i also like to get into the sharpening choil area here with some sandpaper to make sure that the entire knife has a nice finish all the way around in this case i'm using some 320 grit paper wrapped around the chainsaw file before we start grinding our clip or our bevels we need to put some marking fluid on our edges and mark out our grinding targets i like to put these targets around the center of the blade around ten thousandths of an inch apart from each other you can see those are my targets on the blade and that's my target for the false edge to grind the clip of this knife i have my rad arm attachment set up at around a 56 degree angle and i'm using an 8 inch contact wheel with a 60 grit valve i found that this setup was actually pretty easy to use and i was able to get both sides of the clip ground in and symmetrical to each other fairly painlessly after the 60 grit belt i moved up to a 220 grit belt to clean up the scratches left behind by the 60. next we will be moving on to the primary blade bevels i have recently watched some videos from zach buchanan on hollow grinding knives and they have been extremely helpful through the process of hollow running my first knife here so go ahead and check out his channel for sure the first step is to grind in at your check grinds and what they do is ensure that your edge is in the center of your knife after you have your check grinds established you can start working back towards the spine of the knife with your hollow grind ideally you will always want to keep your check grind visible so you know you are not encroaching onto your edge which was established in the center of the knife you can notice here that i'm sitting down which is also something that zach buchanan does and i figured i'd give it a shot for my first holograin i did find that i had a significant amount of control in this position and i was still able to clamp my elbows to my side and have a nice stable base to put in my grind so this is how it turned out on the right side of the blade i then move on to the other side of the blade to match my hollow grind with the 60 grit belt i am trying to keep my plunges pretty close to each other but i will use the 120 grit belt to really dial them in one thing that really stood out to me when hollow grinding this blade was the lower heat production of the contact wheel versus the platen i do all my grinding post heat treat and this can be a big deal when grinding with the platen overheating your blade and running your temper but i had no indication that this was even close to happening when grinding this blade my fingers never got hot but just to be sure i did keep dipping the blade after every pass once i have my blade bevels ground up to a 220 grit finish i'll go over to the hand sanding bench to bring up the flats to a 320 grit finish i recently put out a video on how to stonewash a knife it was actually the last video on my channel so if you're interested in that check it out i will be glossing over it in this knife build since i used much of the same footage in that previous video here i'm putting my maker's mark onto the knife etching it with dc power and about 15 hits for one second on my diy etching machine once i have the maker's mark etched in i'll take some sandpaper and lightly go over my mark just to make sure i don't have any over etching marks on the flats of my knife i will then clean the knife with soap and water put it into a mix of 5050 fair pherochloric acid and water and then start etching my knife in intervals i use two minute intervals and clean the knife with steel wool in between each one of these intervals once i have the knife up to the desired darkness that i like to use i will neutralize the acid with both glass cleaner that has ammonia and baking soda you can continue this process until you get the darkness that you desire for me i generally go for about 10 minutes of total etching time to get the darkness that you see here on a 1084 blade with acid that's around 2 years old i then coat the blade in wd-40 just because i am always paranoid of rust i put it into my diy tumbling attachment from my 2x72 belt grinder and run it for about 10 minutes i'm just using some normal rocks here that's a question that i get very regularly what type of rocks i use i got these rocks from a home and garden store and i've been using them for years with great success one question i got on the last video was how i maintained the stone washing on the spine of the knife now when this knife i did not maintain that stone wash finish on the spine i will actually be putting a satin finish on the spine of this knife so if you want to maintain that stone wash finish on the spine of your knife i would recommend using removable handle scales and shaping your handles before stone washing a knife for this knife i will be using two pieces of quarter inch g10 that are orange and black and alternating layers i will clamp both of these pieces onto the knife and use a knife as a drill guide for my holes we will be drilling number 28 holes for the bolts of our loveless fasteners once we have one hole drilled i will take a number 28 drill bit place it into that hole and then drill the other hole so that i ensure the handle scales are lined up with the knife once our holes are drilled i mark out the profile of the knife onto the scales with a scribe and then we can cut off the excess material and is at this point that i mark off how i want the front of the handle scales to look so that we can start shaping the front of the handle scales as well so i cut off the bulk of the material with the band saw and then we go to the 2 by 72 inch belt grinder in order to clean up the profile since we know that the holes in the handle scales and the knife are lined up very precisely i can actually grind pretty close down to my scribed lines and i generally get very close to these lines here so it saves me time after a knife has been glued up once again it's worth noting that having the horizontal ability of this belt grinder and having everything set up to a 90 degree angle really helps in cleaning up the profile of these scales i'm using the work rest here set at around a 45 degree angle in order to grind in the bevels on the front of the handle scales and also around the lanyard hole i will be using a exposed tang lanyard hole for this knife because i feel like that's a very strong design and i also feel like it's easier to construct than putting in a lanyard tube to make this knife have a little bit more of a tactical feel instead of using a rounded front handle scale design i decided to get a little angular here with a point in the front of the handle scales i feel like this gives a nice aggressive look to the knife i got these up to a 220 grit finish on the belt sander and then clean them up with 300 and then later 600 grit on the hand sanding bench i tried to make sure to use a backing block when cleaning up all of these angles so as not to wash out the nice crisp lines established on the belt grinder out of all the handle materials i use for some reason i really like using g10 i feel like it grinds really well and also finishes very nicely so some people hate this stuff i really like it one drawback is it's pretty heavy of a material for a handle but i feel like it's pretty bulletproof as well to set my depth on my counterbore i'm using a washer that's around a 16th of an inch thick i set the height on my mini mill and then put the stop in my mini mill so that i can just go in and drill these counter bores up to the stop quickly this ensures not only that i can do this operation quickly and precisely but also that each one of these holes have the exact same depth so using this adjustable counterbore from mcmaster i get all four of the counter bores drilled into my handle scales with around the sixteenth of an inch lip between the handle scale and the tangent knife we then clean up all of our components with alcohol before gluing everything together with our g-flex 24-hour setting epoxy we get the g-flex mixed up and start applying that g-flex epoxy to the inside the handle scales also we apply that g flex epoxy to the inside of the counter bores that our levels fasteners will be sitting in i am using some stainless steel loveless fasteners here both the bolt and nut in this case will be made out of stainless steel once we have all the crevices of this handle coated with g-flex epoxy i will be tightening down the loveless fasteners i like to use a drill to do the bulk of this tightening and i'm actually using the torque setting on my cordless drill here i think i'm using setting number seven and i found that this is just about as tight as i would want these to be i also check it with a hand screwdriver to make sure that they are tight enough but not too tight if you get them too tight you can squeeze out all the epoxy from your joint and you can end up having a weak joint so make sure not to get them too tight once i've allowed the epoxy 24 hours to secure i will cut off the bulk of the loveless fasteners with the band saw and then grind flat both sides of the knife on the 2 by 72 belt grinder once i have both sides the knife ground flat i will sure up the handle scales with the tang and the knife so that the handle scales and the metal on the tang are flush with each other once again here i am using the horizontal position of the belt grinder because i know that i have it set at a 90 degree angle and i like that i can clean up the spine of the knife with the scratches going long ways to a 220 grit belt on this knife i decided to try out a different type of handle than i normally make i'm going to be putting some scallops into this handle to give it just a little bit more grip i would imagine that a war knife would want a significant amount of grip and handle so to do that the first step here is after i get everything shirt up to the spine i will be sloping the handle scales towards the tip of the knife so they will be a little bit fatter towards the back of the knife and a little bit narrower towards the front this is the same thing i do whenever i normally put a hollow into the knife for a coke bottle handle but in this case i'm just going to be sloping them rounding over the sides and then putting in my scallops here you can see that i am rounding over the sides of the handle scales this makes the handle scales act more like an oval in hand i then use the slack belt to round over all of my edges at this point after you have all the edges rounded over the knife could really be brought to the hand sanding bench and finished and this is actually a handle design that i use frequently and it does feel very good in the hand with this smooth handle but like we said earlier with this build we want to try something new which is very appropriate for this build since i did try a lot of new techniques already with this knife we figured we'll try something new with the handle as well i'm using a quarter inch small wheel and my small wheel attachment and i'll be putting scallops all the way along the flat of the knife on both sides i will then be coming in between these scallops at around the 45 degree angle to put scallops along the top and the bottom of the tang in an effort to have these scallops line up with each other at least a little bit i used a pencil to draw on the opposite side of my first set of scallops and that worked out fairly well the scallops on the right and left side are fairly symmetrical with each other there is a element of randomness to these scallops that i was hoping to achieve with this design while i'm not disappointed with how this handle turned out if any of you guys have suggestions for how to improve my scalping and you all tend to do this a lot on your knives please drop those suggestions down in the comment section below once i have the scallops put into the blade i went over to the hand sanding bench and brought up the sides of the knife to around a 600 grit finish once we have the handle scales finished up the last step of the build is to put an edge in a knife and to do that i will be using my water cooled sharpening system from wind i will be putting around a 19 degree bevel secondary bevel onto each side of this blade for some reason these water cooled sharpening wheeled systems the cheap ones get a decent amount of hate in the community i like mine and it works perfectly fine i will say if you have a knife that does not have a sharpening choil that wheel can gum up your plunger line so if you're going to be using this type of sharpening system make sure you have a sharpening choil alrighty so this is how our war knife finished out i think it looks really good and the lines in this knife are stellar the clip is a really nice addition that i feel like i'll start putting on many of my other designs i've been scared of putting clips in the knife in the past and i've also been scared of hollow grinding just because it's something different but after taking the plunge into both of those new techniques i really like the way that they turned out i see myself doing much more clips and holograms in the future so guys that sums up this video if you all liked it please hit that like button down below and if you're not already consider subscribing to the channel i also have

[Music] [Applause] [Music] you", "f2N5jUNfLsw": "what's up stoners cubans here and today we are going to talk about my new favorite weed grinders so just recently i had somebody in my twitch stream asked me what the best weed grinder was shout out to shammy who put me on this journey of finding the best grinder well i found this there's a lot of expensive grinders out there that don't seem special so i went on a little mission looking for a new weed grinder and i wanted to see if i could come up with something better i've used a bunch of grinders over the years and i hadn't really put too much thought in the quality of my grinder but i can honestly say this is the best quality grinder i've ever had so i went on a little journey to find a new weed grinder and i came across a lot of options some of them over a hundred dollars for what didn't even seem like an impressive grinder i was very impressed with this one because it's comparable to a lot of the higher end ones however it's half the cost of a lot of these expensive grinders that i've seen so the slicks grinder like a lot of the other high-end grinders is made out of aerospace aluminum goddamn spaceship metal however what's unique about the slicks grinder is the entire surface of the grinder is coated in a non-stick ceramic which is supposed to help resin build up which is actually really common in a lot of grinders a lot of grinders i've used in the past they get really hard to turn after using them for a few weeks here's my old grinder i've had it for a couple years there's not even any weed in here but it's hard to turn there's a lot of gunk buildup in here to clean this one not too long ago so it's not terrible but i had to get rid of my old gold grinder because it had way too much buildup in it i actually got a purple one and a yellow one and we swapped some of the parts on here so we could have that two-tone action like the [ __ ] lakers we got one for home games and one for away games we should be good if anyone's interested in a slick grinder you can go to cubans.com grinder or i will have a link in the description below these are the larger ones for 60 bucks and they do have a smaller one for 50. and they also sell rolling trays in a couple of sizes i grabbed a smaller one so let's take a closer look at the inside of the grinder the first thing i noticed about this one is the lid on it is heavy and that's actually very crucial to grinding weed if you have a light flimsy lid it's not going to be easy to cut through the bud the weight on this lid is similar to the weight of my entire other ground you can see that it has some resin build up on the top definitely not the non-stick like we've got here but this is a nice heavy lid and that helps with grinding bud we got that unique shape on the teeth there and they're nice and spaced out a lot of grinders i've used before the teeth are too close and they use this shape right here and these actually do a little bit more of making like a powder or making dust out of your weed the other cool thing about the slicks grinder here so you catch your flower in the chamber here and this actually slips right out without any additional untwisting this one just pops right out and then you can see your keyframe there you got a couple of tools in there to play with but let's put some weed in one of these and see how it grinds i got this thing really loaded up we're gonna see if we have an easy time grinding it this might be more than you would typically put in but let's see if it cuts through it and it starts spinning pretty easy actually there's just a lot of herb in there so it's going to have a little bit of time breaking it up or take a little bit of time this ground up consistency nice and fluffy i prefer this for bong pacs and rolling joints it's just perfect it's not too fine and it's nice and fluffy perfect weed fluff let's light this on fire you know what they say kids if you don't tilt your beaker you're probably smoking mids you're cute [Music] if you like the video subscribe to the channel for more content check out my instagram and other social media in the description below peace out stoners", "e1ze2fcGL4o": "we're here at Metabo headquarters and what we have here is there are 36 volts this is their nine-inch angle grinder this version is powered by two 18 volt batteries they also sell a version that's powered by a single 36 volt battery and as you can see this is an impressive tool it has cut this stock roughly 3/8 to almost 1/2 an inch thick it's literally cut slivers out of it like a Ginsu knife like I don't know a scalpel in surgery pretty pretty amazing stuff here some pretty unique stuff that we take from our electric tools that we imported a chorus one for example here I have it in a chorus I'm sorry cutting positions with the handle like this that can be very easily rotate the body of the torso now and more like in a grinding position or if you like a lefty and you want to cut the other side if you go all the way there we also build in that too all safety features so you have an a break so you would get a stop the wheel in under three seconds Wow you also have a clutch of course built in and all the anti vibration technology with a dual action paddle switch for not only it's extremely powerful and gets fast but also the safety features of course are built in okay I can't believe how quickly you were able to cut through the bar stock and it seemed like you were pretty aggressively pushing down half how how does Metabo keep that that motor speed up how do they deliver so much power to the cutting wheel so there's two things but it really comes from the battery our lithium high-density lead D batteries actually deliver significant more power output than other batteries that exist and so it does is it delivers on this configuration specifically 3200 watts to the motor so that actually more that you could get out of natural socket Wow so you get more power in a very strong German made 36 volt brushless motor that take that energy and converts it into mechanical energy and so that makes a tool that has a significant overload capacity so you can press on a tool and it will not slow down so you have here a reproduction tool they can replace an electric grinder that's amazing so we appreciate that Antoine come take a look at this yeah sure latent balanced as well mm-hmm get a bed in the back come potato whether the gearbox do you have a really nice cutting balance or adds a nice force open this size you would think that it would be much heavier it is the exact same weight with the batteries of the electric tool that is awesome well that was a look at matobo's 36 volt nine inch large angle grinder and if you like

for this grinder on Amazon I'm going to tear it apart and test it plus I'll compare it to another bargain grinder the $10 Harbor Freight grinder well I should say the charred remains of the $10 grinder I did burn it up in a past video one thing I noticed right away on this grinder that I like is the quick adjust guard mechanism so to adjust the guards you loosen that move the guard and snap that lever back in place that's compared to the $10 Harbor Freight grinder which has a guard that you have to move with a screw so you have to loosen that screw move the guard then tighten the screw back this is much easier there's another thing I noticed on this that it's actually kind of inferior to the Harbor Freight let me show you real quick on the Harbor Freight grinder and on a lot of grinders you can take out the four screws here on the gear case and then reposition the head of the grinder and reinstall those screws as a way to change the position of the switch so here it's on the right side or left side rather you could take it apart put it back together like this and you could have the switch on the top however you can't do that on the Black & Decker because check out this big notch here in the gear case and the body so you cannot loosen the screws and twist it so the switch is here on the top here's the handle for the Black & Decker it's made of PA 6gf 30 so nylon with 30% glass fiber reinforcement it's decently beefy but it's not padded or anything so we've seen some better handles on more expensive grinders here's the Harbor Freight grinder handle you can see there's somewhat similar the finish on the Black & Decker is a little bit nicer the Black & Decker does have three different positions for the side handle which I like a lot of grinders only have the two here on the sides one more thing before we tear into this grinder let's take a look at the power cord the brand is a Yao Shang Electric which is not a brand I'm familiar with it's an 18 gauge cord and if you can see this on there it is an SG Kord so what does that stand for the jsj stands for junior service and the T stands for thermoplastic jacket so the jacket on this is probably PVC or something similar if you've watched my other videos you know sjt is a common material for power tool cords but it's not the best choice if it just said SJ that would mean a thermoset rubber thermoset rubber is a more flexible and lower temperatures it's tougher in some ways it's just a better cord so this is not a bad choice but there are better materials out there s JT is also what the Harbor Freight grinder uses and there's a another kind of similarity here see the cord protector boot here the strain reliever what this does is keep the cord from kinking over really sharply which can damage the cord this boot is not as big and flexible as some other grinders we've seen it looks like this is made out of nitrile rubber it's actually just a little bit bigger than the one on the Harbor Freight grinder let's start tearing into this thing I think I'm gonna do things a little bit differently this time rather than going through just piece by piece I'm gonna tear the whole thing apart then we'll pick out the most interesting pieces to talk about now that those brushes are out I should be able to remove these four screws pull off the gear case as well as pull out the armature the way this is set up you can't really get to these last two screws on the bottom holding the gear case on without taking off the cover plate here you might have noticed I'm switching screwdrivers here to this vessel screwdriver and that is because hopefully you can see this on here there is a little tiny divot in the corner of this screw here that means these are not regular Phillips screws these are JIS Japanese industrial standard screws so if you use a real ji a screwdriver it'll fit them a lot better and be much less likely to strip them out I think I paid about seven or eight dollars for this so number two JIS screwdriver and it's totally worth it I've found JIS screws in a lot of places you wouldn't expect to find them should be able to just pop this open now there we go there is a little retaining ring they are holding the gear in place I'm gonna remove that hopefully we can take off this crown gear and take a look at the bearing under there the retaining ring is off so the gear should just come right off I got all the pieces of this puzzle apart so let's get started here at the back where the main power cord comes in we have a pretty decent strain reliever here you can see heading up to the switch here this is a jeolban brand switch I had to look this up it's a company I wasn't familiar with but it's a Chinese company that specializes in making electrical switches we can see here it's rated at 10 amps at 125 volts so it has a lot of headroom over the 6 amp rating of this grinder the action is pretty good it's decently smooth and there is a boot here on the switch to help keep out debris so overall this switch looks pretty good heading up the line we see push on spade connectors here on the switch that's pretty normal this side has screw terminals and heading up the wires here you can see it has a braided sheathing here and in addition to that they put this heat shrink tubing on it for further reinforcement those are just a couple little details that they skip on the Harbor Freight grinder here we can see they just have plain wire although they do have a little bit of heat shrink tubing here and these are the type of details that they could have eliminated if they wanted to save pennies taking a look at the brush holder now you can see I pulled the brush out but it has a spring retainer here for the brush that's a nice detail because it keeps good consistent pressure on the brush as it wears and it also allows you to use a larger brush in the same space both the harbor freight and the Black & Decker have a steel brush holders not brass it's a little beefier here on the Black & Decker so you can see here the Black & Decker uses a much larger brush compared to the Harbor Freight part of that is how they're retained see the Harbor Freight uses this spring on top of the brush which takes up some of the space and the brush holder with the different retention mechanism here on the black & decker obviously we have a much longer brush you can see some scratch marks here on the Harbor Freight I was scratching them both to see if there was any significant difference in the hardness between the two I did not notice a significant difference however one of the other tests I did was rubbing them on a piece of paper and the material rubs off the Harbor Freight brush much more easily so the size of the Black & Decker brush combined with the material properties makes it clear that this one is probably going to last significantly longer than the brush on the Harbor Freight grinder sometimes Harbor Freight does include an extra set of brushes with their grinders probably for that reason time for one of my favorite topics bearings this is one of the bearings out of the Black & Decker they're all the same brand and design and the Black & Decker different sizes obviously and this is one of the bearings out of the Harbor Freight and we can see some immediate differences obviously this one's a little bit smaller it's a 607 size but this is a sealed bearing this is a rubber seal here that makes contact with both the outer race and the inner race to help keep out contaminants the Harbor Freight mostly just uses shielded bearings so this shield is crimped here on around the outer race you can see that but there is no connection between the inner race and the shield so this is an entry point for debris that can wear out the bearing I think sealed bearings are just especially important in grinders because you're always grinding things and making dust and this will help keep that dust from getting in the bearing and wearing it out so we talked about the design now let's talk about the brand names here the Harbor Freight uses Keiji international bearings this is an okay brand not exactly a name brand though the Black and Decker uses bearings that are all marked CNX BB I can't find any company called the CNX bearing or anything like that googling this you know it doesn't turn up a bearing series from any brand I recognize so while they used a good design of bearing using sealed bearings they didn't really use a name-brand bearing here in the Black & Decker now let's get into the real heart of this thing the motor rotor or armature the windings here are pretty neatly done and this has been a generously dipped in resin what that resin does is once it hardens it basically holds everything together and help prevent vibration from breaking something and causing a failure on some more expensive grinders we would see epoxy right here to reinforce the connection between the windings and the commutator they didn't do that here but it's a little hard to see if probably in the video the way they dip this in resin the resin is very generous and thick here around the connections so it is kind of reinforcing it there even though it doesn't look like they used epoxy looks like there's a production data on there 2018 1016 so it was a couple months old when I bought it all the laminations on the rotor here are cleanly cut and neatly stacked you can see these are balancing marks which is good to see although I will say when using this this is not the smoothest running grinder in the world it's probably a little bit smoother than the $10.00 Harbor Freight but it's not as smooth as some of the more expensive grinders I've tested taking a look up here at the front we see they use a directional fan which is good to see grinders only spin one direction and this can more efficiently move air than a non directional fan now that we're looking at the gearcase let's talk about this grease in here there's plenty of it which is good to see however at this point I've already done the cutting with this that you'll see later so this grinder has been plenty hot and you can see it doesn't look like the grease float around that much there's very little on the gear here so that also based on the appearance and the smell this has a yeah this has that really pungent kind of axle grease smell so the way it's behaved and the smell and the appearance make it look like they used some pretty cheap grease in here this is not the more expensive likely fully synthetic grease as we've seen in some other tools I've torn apart and there's not too much wrong with that a lot of tools have grease like this what I will do when I reassemble it is probably take a bunch of the grease and smear it on the gear here I could also replace the grease with some fully synthetic wheel bearing grease I have but I probably won't mess around with that the quality of the machine work and the casting on the gearcase here is good but it's not the prettiest we've seen if I can show you here see there's some casting flash around these openings not very clean lines the same thing up here some casting flash just kind of rough edges around these openings that's really only a cosmetic thing it shouldn't really affect the operation and it's pretty typical of a kind of a cheap tool like we have here take a look at the Harbor Freight gear case and it's the exact same thing we see some kind of rough edges and casting flash around these openings again it's just a cosmetic thing but more expensive tools I've taken apart have definitely been a little bit prettier there is one spot I've seen so far where the ten dollar Harbor Freight grinder has a little bit of a leg up over the Black & Decker grinder and that is right here the crown gear goes here obviously and there is a main shaft that goes through the crown gear and here on the Black & Decker that shaft is supported by a bronze bushing so the shaft rides in there and rotates on this Harbor Freight grinder this ten dollar model number that is a needle bearing here which will definitely last a little bit longer was a little bit more expensive to make than just putting a bronze bushing there however some other Harbor Freight grinders do use a bronze bushing if you remember from my past video where I tore apart two different Harbor Freight $10 grinders this model number uses a needle bearing but the other ones use a bronze bushing like we see here in the Black & Decker now let's take a look at the main crown gears out of these two this is the Harbor Freight over here this is the Black & Decker here the machine work is definitely cleaner and more consistent here on the Black & Decker for example take a look at the two holes they drilled here for the pin that locks the gear and K in place and you can see see that little bit of a flashing and just kind of not very good machine work there around those holes not the case here on the Black & Decker much cleaner they're also on the face of the gear here where it's been turned you can see very consistent and fine machine marks not quite as good as some of the best tools I've seen but there's nothing wrong with this also I hit this with a file and it clearly has been hardened here's the cover plate off the gear case and just like the gear case it is cast probably aluminum then it's machine to the final dimensions the machining marks here are clean and consistent so that all looks good the bearing here is the same brand and design as the others we've seen in this grinder so we see a rubber seal here this is a six zero zero one size so overall this looks good the material choice here is a really common one that we've seen on a lot of tools PA 6gf 30 so that's basically nylon with 30% glass fibers for strength so that's a good choice for a tool like this and they did not skimp on the material they use plenty of it in the body here so the body is nice and stiff a little thinner back here on this rear cover but it's still not too bad and it's also PA 6gf 30 looking down in here at the field winding and there's nothing unexpected you can see that the windings are not and epoxy like they are on some more expensive tools they've clearly been dipped in resin but on a low-cost tool like this they frequently skip covering the field winding in epoxy this grinder has a two-year warranty and a 30-day money-back guarantee the Harbor Freight grinder has a 90-day warranty so the warranty on this black & decker is a lot better than the Harbor Freight but are you actually going to use the warranty on a tool if it's only 20 or 25 bucks and it breaks after a year my thinking is maybe not it might be too much of a hassle but it is there if you want to use it now it's time for the test I put all the grinders through this test which is cutting a pretty heavy piece of angle iron and I really push the grinder to give them a good workout if they can handle this they should be able to handle any normal job the Black & Decker did fine I made a dozen cuts it did slow some but it did not stall and it generally didn't have much trouble cutting this if you remember the ten dollar Harbor Freight grinder stalled and overheated in this same test so overall here when you compare the Harbor Freight to the Black & Decker the Black & Decker has significantly more power a better bearing design better machine work overall a much longer warranty longer-lasting brushes in the motor and a much better design on the guard but there are some improvements they could do here to the Black & Decker I would like to see a needle bearing here in the gearcase supporting that main shaft that goes through the gear and maybe some better grease in here this does seem like the cheap stuff so this is more money than the Harbor Freight grinder but it's a lot better for the twenty dollars I paid it's really a steel right now as I record this it's gone up in price to twenty nine dollars but I still think that's a pretty good deal and via price history shows that it's gone on sale multiple times recently for between twenty and twenty five dollars so I think this grinder is a really good deal you could spend a little bit more money and step up to the Harbor Freight Hercules grinder as I showed you in some past videos that is well-made but it does only have the 90-day Harbor Freight warranty so what do you think is this grinder worth the price let me know in the comments down below and while you're down there hit that subscribe button and that like button thanks for watching", "QHSyiT7LS8E": "[Music] hey guys pick the pitch toes awesome baby here again hey I just want to talk about the old dump angle groin and are they any good and what to look for when you buy one I've use these things for years and years and years and I've got my own opinion sir you know coming out look at the video and I'll share some with you hey guys hot off you guys a dollar at all but I did quite a bit of metal fabrication and that sort of thing and I've been using this these grinders and plasma cutters for years and years and years and you know when I first started doing this and then bits and pieces was not still I missed by likely really cheap ones and but they had the uses but they're quite restrictive further on what you can do with them it depends what you want to do with this little one this little blush brownie here so that insane is 650 watt and it's ideal for getting into small places and bits and pieces like that marici if you can't get a big one in there but it's not really ideal for doing hours and hours and work because you'll just burn the thing out and they're not designed for that and this is ideals do you want to use it like 10 minutes every couple of days I mean no that would be fine but if you don't hear the industrial whip or that sort of thing then you know it's pretty well pretty well limited really it's a little hundred mill grinder or four inch peen one school you went to and now I don't know if you can see this specs on it or not I'll try and focus them in there so it's 650 watt and 650 watt is about 2.8 of a horsepower the IRS who do with in horse fair but it's a point out of a mechanical horse they're approximately but this is you know it's just a pretty basic little grinder but it's alright other side just would do cleaning up welds and that sort of thing that's perfectly fine but if you want something you're going to lean into your early get into it and this is probably not the machine to you you know and also with this this one here I don't know if you guys did anything like me but but um normally I don't up all the washes a lot this but this one normally they have a I know something in here that is that your hold or pushing here and it locks that they lock your your blade when you want to remove it but this one here comes with a stupid little they're all sort of Chris and key thing that goes in there they're course you always lose them well I do anyway maybe it's just me but they always lose them but that's some this one here and if you notice it if you can see it or not it's going like a square color in there if you can see that let me focus this if you look down there you can see this is a square a square color and if you can't find your key to get it out what I normally do is just get a flat bladed screwdriver like this on the flip side jammer and between that the guard there and the little flat piece and they lock this up put it down hold it there it'll one it's not even tight but it'll lock that up to that lock it up like that and then you can then you can undo it or you used to what I normally do if you're not supposed to do we all normally do there's always put a screwdriver on one of these things it hurt it with a hammer but of course there is another way are doing that as well as just keep you keep your little tool go down you're like I said I'm pretty rough sort of dude so that's just the way it is so well yeah this is this this little six hundred fifty point eight of a mechanical horsepower Bosch grinder they're pretty cheap I wouldn't guarantee really anything any cheaper than this because I'm a New Zealand and you can buy those luck something called waxes or something right there LD exes they look really good in the in the shops but really the absolute rubbish I by broad it was not only that brand it's all that really light stuff so yeah that doesn't they sell your name Greiner from about falling back you're getting about fourteen dollars worth of angle grinder if you know what I'm saying anyway this is this little Bosch 650 watt one it's all good for what it is and then a little bit harder jobs I used my blackened dhikr a blackened dicker 900 watt 1 and 900 watts is about 1.2 mechanical horsepower now this is a little bit brandy and it's quite a lot heavier I said I'm fine the sticks on the slack for her on the right way there if I can focus it I'm not very good at focusing and hear my voice but yeah like this is about 1.2 mechanical horsepower and that's this is heavier heavier than this it's probably a third of the weight here again unless you can put a little bit more and do it but you wouldn't you can't use it all day with a heavy load on it because I just not designed to do that once again you know a couple of hours a day would be fine as long as you give it a break because they're not rated at 100 percent of course not most others but otherwise again this is on the light end as well but the black and bigger stuff is good I'll drop some links down below if you want to look at the black indica stuff and other bits and pieces but I mean yeah this is just what I use that's a lot of little olive here as well that's what I find but this one see has got a push button on the top which you can lock here lucky or run lucky blade down like so and then put your key in there but I didn't never have the keys for these things I always lose them so I'll show you a little hacking you're not really supposed to do it like this this is the way I do it you gotta you can't get that out you can't find your key and you need to change your run need to change your disk so just hold the button in like so turn it around until it locks like so what do I do get a hammer because this blade will be buggered anyway get a hammer knock it around knock a hole in the in the plate and then it should be split hard to do it on camera but you get the general idea the black bucket anyway so you take your time there but saves you're mucking around for hours like me looking for the looking for the key for the thing and then just itch it itch and you just put it on the life so make sure that the little lip goes in in the center to hold the hold the center of the wheel because there's another you can put on the other way like that but that won't Center eyes the wheel through that little lip there so do it like so and tighten it up okay so it's end up tighten it up push your button and again on the back to lock it up lock it up and then I'll just go with my hand tight because it spins help there's a church anyway and it will tighten up brother than loosen off so as long as you're tight it's all good and then it's not a bad girl on earth quite heavy and for what what it is it's good to be like I say you know a couple of hours a day we'll be fine but um yeah wouldn't wouldn't use much more than that because they are designed for what they were going to do you just can't buy a really cheap toy and still use it all day every day because it just doesn't work I mean life's it's not like that is it yeah and then what if I want to really get into something get into something heavy what I do is I is this baby which is my Dewalt 9-inch grinder and this is one big grinder this is designed to work all day and you can lean will you wait on the thing and it'll keep on going I really impressed with this thing because then I've got a lot of work with this as you can see it's certainly not you it's probably four or five years old I'll see if I can focus the just think on this one this one that's two thousand two hundred watt which is about the equivalent of three mechanical horsepower and you have to watch this this sort of thing guys because this will eat you it will flick your back it's got a soft start it'll flick you back and you definitely know you're holding it this this arc in this this weighs probably the equivalent of six of these maybe five six of these it's the weight and it's so life's impossible to use this the way you would use this because you can hold this is one hand and go out for an under an orifice you can't do that was this this big one here because it is so heavy that after a minute minute and a half you have to put this thing down unless you write on top of your work like so and it's just a different totally different machines here you can under the handle from there put it up the top there you can put it on here you can put it on the other side you can put it up here yeah it's just a total different design what you what you can do with it and this just eats through steel basically it makes a hell of a racket but it's really good and now it's done this is hours and hours and hours and given a punishment out the punishment and it still goes but once again it's surprising at home they're not that expensive and the theme and scheme of things but I brought one of these a nine inch one and I bought it or on those cheap makes like I was telling you about before and ahead a years warranty I thought I was just doing there I'll take it back it's always busy in the workshop well I went down to the local shop and brought one a cheap one took her home worked over half an hour burnt it out so that all I took it back to the shop they replaced it no problem with them replacing it back to the shop half an hour burnt it out I mean it was physically the same size of this but it was not anywhere near this so I put the bullet and I paid three times as much I leave a circle but I took it back to the third time third time in about three hours I mean I'm supposed to be working you know not mucking around with grinders so I thought oh bugger I'll just buy something decent and this is quite expensive but the timeless is about $450 or than it cost at the time but they're a lot cheaper now but um I'll never look back this thing doesn't get hard it doesn't a smile peeking you can do anything aisle with the blood of a dangerous it is really dangerous and it is really really heavy you know start off with Thank You fingers in the way this one guys because I'm telling you this is not a toy Jeff sort of buyer is not a toy these ones I wouldn't say that toys but they're really light and they're designed for a specific purpose so is this in the purpose that this is designed for and the purpose that this is designed for is totally different so we're setting one tells you're grinders the grinder it's not true yeah so this is like huge compared to the other ones see this it's got the double trigger on it as well it's got the safety trigger because this thing this thing will bite you you have to push this on the top of it as well as pull on that at the same time through that won't go in without your pushing that I don't want to starter because it'll look the other way again so you have to push that and that sucks like a safety you have to do it both ends at once see I don't know if you can see that or not BAM yeah it's a good for shame downside so much three-horse bear and the way it'll kill your shoulders you do this two or three hours it'll just kill your shoulders and make sure you're wearing your eye protection and UMS with the sling because you'll get no second chances with it it'll eat you but that's brilliant brilliant but like I said they're all designed for a specific purpose vonlee excuse me as long as you use it for what it's designed for I mean you can use this all day every day and the other ones I just limited what was their use but I mean that's perfectly fine do you got to get up underneath things Nora so this one's ideal you know one-handed it's good that's and light but um yeah so anyhow that's my thoughts on the grinders guys sometimes you get what you pay for but even the really cheap little grinders the many of you are only using this thing for two hours a year you know just telling little bits and pieces of grinding the hair off a nail or something but perfectly fine but you just you know you just have to use it for what it's designed for anyway guys thanks for watching the video hope you go I hope you enjoy it I'll put some links down below if you wanna buy anything or look at anything and subscribe to my videos if you like what I'm saying or if it means you don't like what I'm saying drop me a note and just tell me whatever bit of yarn anyway like I say guys thanks bye bye [Music]", "iY-S2DLkl-I": "69. that's big long black pipe [Music] [Music] all right what's happening people today's video is quite long so please uh bear with me you can skip to the parts that you are interested in or maybe come back and watch the rest of it later so i'm going to give you a basic rundown of what the video is about i look over the tractor to see what it needs for getting set up for the plow so tips and tricks for the start of plowing the essentials you can then hitching on my plow and looking over getting it ready and there's some tips and tricks on how to set up your plow and a bit of drainage in between because i ended up draining and then straight back out to the plough eventually after i put the plow points on so the start of this video now is dad digging the drain and that pond i was on about earlier in one of my videos so he's got the wii three-ton jcb digger and he's digging it right through the middle of the pond because it's really level he's got that laser sight and a staff and that basically tells them if there's a slight angle on it for a run so the water runs out the pond down the wee galley where i'm standing [Music] and ooped down to the main drain which is down towards the farm a quick we look around so the seven tonne kamatsu is over there and down at the gateway just in the middle of the screen there there's a big main drain choked and a water's piling up out of there so that'll be sorting out another day but please take a minute and admire the view it's an absolutely gorgeous day of the day blue skies small clouds and a wet hole in the middle of my field bro gonna be getting the ploy on the day so i'll need to check all the tire pressures make sure they're all the same well for front and back you know and they get the weight blocks on go and get the plow so right now i'm just going to check the whole tractor over check the heights at the back etc and uh i make sure she's all ready to go the ground's still a lot like crazy but shouldn't be long before i'm able to get going i think i'll just try anyway it should be okay but the further across the brai i get it might not manage so i'll just need to stop and try again another day but that's all very well saying that but we'll just need to see how it goes i've now got this ridiculous thing so we'll see how that works for recording i look alright knob but it'll make it easier for myself to do hangs and records at the same time so we'll see how it goes today all right we've got this wee tire pressure gauge so i'm gonna check two front tires seen as they're in a good bit 25.5 psi [Music] is that ready to chop with a front weight block need my screwdriver because i i move the arms off above the pins so that when i'm spreading slurry the arms are above the pto shaft it helps just get that a little bit extra height so screwdrivers just to help get the lunch pin out of this spot here see him again on this side bang bang bang i hate the hangs [Music] absolutely wreck the grass great so now that that's done i need to get my measuring tape so i'll pocket somewhere and measure this length got to be both exactly the same so up there into here so that's 69. of course right perfect usually it's one out but that's 69 on both sides so that's their length both the same that's perfect [Music] i don't need to free these off they don't get used too much so i'll just need uh we go with uh stelsons and then that'll get them moving this one's fine this makes things easier touch up then ideally you want both working the same width out so the ploys moving freely in the ground and etc right so they're perfect and the two front tires are almost perfect just check this here 24.5 all right that's that one done yeah of course that's all the way over there i thought it was getting lucky here so lately all right i'll need to reverse the tractor back together so we've got a set of stalson's here so i'm gonna try and free this off i've already sprayed it with some stuff basically it's almost like wd-40 but it's not comes in a big metal can and it's seems to work pretty well it's probably not just taking off quite tight hammer uh and we there we go yeah you really want these as free as you can so you can work them in the field if you need to like this is perfect the but side isn't no way i can do that just yet you know so i need to train work it enough that i can get it going easier than this so i worked this all the way down and then i wire brushed the threads and put some oil on it and i've worked it out so it's basically turning behind now it's as good as it's going to get at the moment um the reason this gets so bad and stuff is soil and that ends up in here and that chokes it and then it gets in the threads and then it just ends up seizing it's a pain so i'm just gonna measure these are now if i start the same it's easier just to 36. it's not the same it's easier just to work it after that you know just turn that way turn that way rather than measuring all the time you just remember two turns this side two turns that side right i'll go put my front weight block on and then go fetch my plug look it over and hopefully get going so hey okay so now we've got it pitched on now talk like this as per seized not been used for a long time should check that we'll just do this so i get it and the only two you'll ever need [Music] [Music] hmm [Music] [Music] oh dear anyway right there to get a flow well is a rough it's a bit warm but then later on i might need to come back in and put my leggings on so i'll just brought them with me hello me plow it's been a while right might as well go put the balls on the end so this weight walk was built by my dad years ago i think i was a kid when i done it quite sturdy i'm pretty sure these are 40 or 45 kilos so i've never actually added it up but it's a fair amount of weight like keeps the noise down so first is my play in old cave island before the winter because i use that for plowing the winter barley that just helps keep the rust off it it's got leaf springs on we don't use shear bolts because we're quite well our ground's got a lot of stones so you'd end up breaking shear bolts all the time so these ping up and then come down there was a set of discs on it but there's desks i got fed up with those jammed stones in between them and here and all sorts but i think i'm going to put two discs on the back this year because it'll make a difference to the end far because that always falls in when there's no disc on it it makes a nice clean cut and the ploy wasn't originally a very good but added this ram on it's not very big round but it does the job and i carry about the old manual very with a link because they it broke the air once and oh you're stuffed after that so if that's there it's just a quick case of putting it on together again and then you're away but that's quite handy because our soil changes a lot and the plough starts moving in and you can it's very hard to keep it straight so this actually means it evens it out far quicker i actually quite like it and then there's my top link a another top line front fur very wedge here and that just moves the whole plow back forward to say that width on the front so it's an es-80 for those that are into plows but it's a good play i feel like her i wouldn't remind a five for her but that's when you're plowing holes like that and you're trying to get going if it's wet you're as well pulling a four further because you'd get going but uh five further you might not oh that's what my father always says so and anyway plows are expensive so we'll just keep this one going for as long as we can not sure what's going on here all right this is a front weight block one so i'll move it down a bit so it floats when you're driving then i'll lock it and that means i can use that as a spool see the weight box stayed there that means i can use it as a spool for one of the many hoses at the back here make sure the ends are clean before you put it in that means there's no rubbish going into your oil can you just quite mind who'll have this but i'm pretty sure it's in there so that when the plow turns it's no hey there's no catching now and then fuel right but it's unknown so right i'll click that and there we go all right and then i'll move this and that'll twist the plow back into place hopefully i'll line up if not that'll be a pain [Music] well that's beer still not quite right though but right i'll put the top link playstand goes on there but when that's not on it it doesn't fit right because it's a ram now with you a good big square washer keeps everything tight [Music] there we go all right take us down the road look it over give it a good grease the tractor already got greased earlier so she's all ready to go she's just this yolk tonight is in wrong way but you know i don't know as soon as you start looking over you'll find something so uh how many years know about this little trick and the arms are fully up you open this thing turn the speed of that and down right down to lock and now that means that the back is in flow so the plow will now float like this when you're driving along for a smoother light smoother right which makes a massive difference to when you're driving okay now grazing it up that was a landfill graze just there you've got to grease the leaf springs too and the front headstock ram and the headstock itself all right gonna get this one on now boatman's all lined up very handy these big spanners that come on the plow just to help keep everything really tight big long lever on it kind of to because aspect moves got to try and get it to the point where this is set and square over there so that's not square yet but it's like got to be sitting about a centimeter or two out for mine's right so that's about there maybe not yeah that's about right no so yes i'll be tightening back up again we'll get some grease in there get that we drop kind of get that one too much because it shoves this out and then it hits the wrong part on this when it's turning over and then the wheel doesn't go right down i don't know if that's the same in any anyone else's play but that's how my play works [Music] 80 80. and well lost the point last year so it would be 80 so that's perfect i always have these sitting square must mean that we knock up but 80 80 and just about 80. can you really take the measurements the now but because it's on the ground and that'll upset your measurements but they've all got to be the same just for uniform plowing i'll undo that and see if it's free just so it's easier in the field if it's if it's been tampered with that's fine so i should be able to adjust that i should be playing about eight inches or thereabouts and uh 14 inches 16 inches wide maybe wider than that it'll just depend on the soil as long as it's turning over perfect as soon as it starts not turning over perfect you adjust it but it's very easy from in the cab with this as you can see with me flipping it this isn't caught on anything which was a baller to start with because i didn't think about that and they ended up pulling the pipes and whatnot but [Music] the only thing left to do is once i get going adjust the top link and see how things are for there just as i thought would happen just as i'm about to get ready to go playing feathers away to get paint and he wants me to finish starting a drain which is neat but i thought it would have got going today but it doesn't look like it do it'll be a wee while till he's back with a pipe for in here and in there so i'll just need to see what i need to do up here and get digging so hopefully this will dry this whole bit up this is where i kept the whaleys and the leggings yeah this is when you start losing your wellies so let's see so he was telling me have to clean it out so i've got somewhere to put the pipes and he's not bled this in yet to here and it's to be bled in like a y so let's just check that that's a stone i don't want any gunned in there it's just a neat clump i'm not taking much because this shaft has got wood worm so just gonna need to be careful with it otherwise i'll break it and then that wouldn't be very handy it's let that run well until i see you i can do the rest of this until then i'll clean this up and that'll mean that it's ready for a fight i've now got this big long black pipe to shove down some of these old clay tiles try and unchoke them it's quite hard to road these bikes but there's this big long plastic hanging yourself because well when you're rotting tiles it catches on the next tail whereas if you've got somebody with you you they're turning the plastic pipe and then it ends up well it turns the front and then it uncatches it and then it keeps going up the height so it's quite hard to do this yourself these clay tiles will have been put in years ago by hand with a shovel and most of them still work so whoever done it fantastic job there are also some stone drains that dad estimates to be around 200 years old some early form of drainage i have cleared a run down there for the pipe to go in when it comes and i'll do the same in this one after i've been asked to dug it back a wee bit further so we'll see how this goes um you have to peel the top soil off and put it to one side and then the subsoil to the left and then that keeps a good soil for the top in the right place and that means that you're not going to be burying it you know of course there's always a knack to these things let me give that a wiggle one now let's see if she walks unless she's clicking this team always a knack all right let's see how this goes [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] so that's the left hand fork piping made all level it's all running i know the right hand side is just to be bled now get the pipe in and then shovel some dirt on top to keep it in place and then bleed all the pipes in place that's the right hand one and now and that's holding it all in place now it's just to be bled in as in the tiles into the pipe we've put in just like that left hand side one to be done on the right hand side and we'll put some big stones on top at the end here so that all the soil doesn't go in there and it covers the end up perfectly and saves it from getting squashed here's the view from the sky quite a lot of digging really it was a rather large pond no idea why there's not been a main drain put in right through the middle of it all that's uh draining basically finish that's going to lead the last the drains into the pipe we put in and they have to change the points on the plow because they are pretty worn then that will mean i don't need to bother halfway through change them well not even halfway through this one can i hang you know but annoying all this the soil should have cleaned the plow before i put it away but just got busy with other things just had to quickly oil the plow up before putting it away for them for the winter so not that it's caused any harm we just thought i looked better so i've got my gun quickly whip all these off one must have fell off last year that's when it's turning is gonna be a bugger so i'm going to try and keep it tight and that one [Music] never mind i'll just need to get the grinder and cut that off all right plenty meat on these ones idiot dog [Laughter] look at that stupid ginger smile you're on camera [Music] okay that's one full side done now for the this side as you can see i lost the front one last year and uh well he just ended up having to change it but a it's got plenty left on it but to keep things even i'm just going to change it anyway and then that means i've got one spare anyway one spare after that so i'll need to get this all done same all along so i'll just give them a tight knot that looks really good so that should last me i might need to give them a turn but i don't know yet we'll just need to see in general you know right we'll go get started see what needs to be adjusted and yeah get playing i almost forgot the most essential tool for going playing with here very much required because of the stones the hammer that fits perfectly in here now i'm ready and as you can see now dad has now got the old big kamatsu digger out and he's shoving the soil into the holes that's ready to go now he's bled the pipes all into the new pipe that we've put in uh diggers uh seven and a half tonner i'm pretty sure so hopefully that makes a massive difference to [Music] a hole in the middle of the field and hopefully the barley will be blowing in the wind later on this year so just going up to the top corner of this field and i'm gonna get the plow going give me look over do some adjustments and hopefully i'll get going in no time at all okay so first running the plow 2021 let's be having you sun gear let's get it going i don't look too bad need to lift the front far up as you can see the front first filling in last year's end of field hall and i'm driving doing it works pretty good actually but second runs when i'll find out what adjustments i need to do so now it looks pretty good okay trying to go how we look playing around 15 inches just want to check that the plow is level actually looks like it's leaning ever so slightly that way so i'll need to adjust that adjust the end so to do that i need to move the ram and turn this [Music] it's not much adjustment that you need to do and hopefully that will square that off and i'll check front link but looks not too bad so far it's definitely too deep right i'll need to go links lengthen the top link now but hopefully the ploy will be nice and level now see the front force too high because it's going too deep it's definitely more level now all right about eight and a half inches around about that point so lengthening the top link pushes the front far out the ground a bit yeah a couple of turns and see what happens [Music] very fine adjustments now reset it before you drive off otherwise it will make no difference at [Music] [Music] all that's better as you can see they're all turning over very evenly so some folks say you can just well you can just let go of the steering wheel and i'll steer straight if it's how you say correctly i have to always check out the back because of stones if you look forward for just half a second it'll be definitely a stone stuck and it'll just ruin your clown look at that that's absolutely beautiful soil we'll hang on to the steering wheel going up here as it has been because you're going up the side of a hill it turns you into what you've previously played here as well just to hang on just in [Music] case that's beautiful stuff [Music] and don't know you but always to adjust when you're going up and down the house yeah you've seen a trip there from the fury of the ground area and see what i tell you stone we'll see if me reversing back everybody there has unjammed it it has that's perfect not usually that easy usually another one jeez no right this is the reason i took the discs off but the dusts do leave a nice clean cut edge my dad nearly finished filling in the first hole but see here it'll be this stupidest smaller stone and it's there you go all right loose now looks like it burns away in there no surprise after how how long they've not been used but i'll keep an eye on it as it's not unlike it's not unlike them to fall off one maybe doesn't look the prettiest i'll sort it out later on once i get into it next up you come every time you turn at the end always check everything that's on your plate just in case one piece has fell off i learned that the hard way ever so slightly wider here so i'll narrow it put it down and whiten it again just to try and straighten that out looks about right all right let's get going [Music] there we go how's that looking it's not quite straight this is pretty hard to keep straight with a slope and every time i hit a stone it lifts it out the ground a little bit and buggers it up and it's been a couple of times here but the blue is turning over pretty good it's looking really really nice i generally try and play around four mile an hour four and a four and a half just depends but as long as it's turning it over and it's nice and level i'm happy see that's just what made my kink in the plow in here look at that stone there there was one there too or just really big stones that left the plow out the ground and move it when you're going across the side of the hill here i lifted two first [Music] that'll be one for the forklift here comes dad to ruin my day he's going to drive straight through the middle of math lounge to get through the gate into the next field i know there's no other way and that's just the way it is but it's gonna annoy me because my plowing is looking really nice [Music] just crawling away slowly i'm gonna overtake i'm gonna get into the lead here man i'm there in the lead coming up slowly aiming for the gateway basically there's a big main drain in there that runs right up the field up to the top right the way up through the silage field at the top there and it's choked here and it's made this whole bit right around the bottom of that field their way which is uh which isn't it good so that'll be sorted first yeah look at that beautiful in the mirror [Music] it's almost snake i think i'm doing not too bad so quick quick runs before i go through the date no no no no he's gonna ruin it he's gonna ruin that piece left after nada the play good it might do it it was approximately there and no [Laughter] might get blown how dare you at least we can tell it's leveled up [Music] there's no bumpit [Music] okay now i've got one of those bigger stones there just gets jammed in between the skimmer and the mallboard so the big hammers for [Music] well i hope you have enjoyed today's video uh it's been quite a up and down of emotions there we better last wee bit of that i've eventually got to a flower but if i didn't help with the drain i would never have got going that bit would be really wet so as i get across the field hopefully it will dry up but this field's a great tester for the cloud because you're right next to the farm and events anything majors wrong i can just go back in and then i can look it over and fix it then the further away you get when something goes wrong it's a not ideal because you need to drive all the way back so ideally i would be able to fix it in fields but [Music] usually it's something that you can effects in the field so right thank you very much for watching i hope you all have enjoyed and we'll see you next time please

about some grinders that I've had in my time we got a cosmic one down on the bottom that's a four chamber with the screen big ass chamber was this one this is the chromium crusher and a sharp stone my sharp stone recently broke and I'll show how it's gonna hit let's go in then sorry for the dirty ash catch of water honest thing all night all day actually alright so first let's get this over here why we got the sharp stone first now this is a good grinder it's got the four chamber you know it twists off right here get the kief there's still some in there that I have to salvage and then similar to the cosmic one I have and you twist off here as well you got the screen little chamber and then this little tiny teeth you could tell a few of them snapped off in there on me I think one of the top ones did - no just these two of these one snapped off what broke on this gardener was I was being a dumbass and well they're being a dumbass when this part right here I guess I definitely put way too much weed in this little thing and this thing is supposed to be attached to the back but you could see it just spins so when the blood is in there and they're grinding it's just spinning this might grind in anything so I mean tough cookies on that one the chromium crusher here we have now the screen is right under the grinding part so I mean the teeth are great when I use this thing it really chops up the bud but I wish I got the four chamber because this one the only other chamber here is the Keith catcher and the screen is up there but as you can tell when you look and it's a [ __ ] to screw this [ __ ] thing and like I said before when you look at the teeth like where the teeth are those little holes up here on the outside and inside the teeth are supposed to be where they keep fall through the screen but you could just see it builds up I mean it's a good rind and nonetheless [ __ ] with it this bad boy this thing this thing is ridiculous this is I just bought this thing yeah about the size of a lighter they're about the size of a lighter there and this thing you could probably you could kill somebody with this thing if you whip it the teeth are just strong magnetic strong magnet there the teeth are nasty they're similar to the design of the chromium crusher the holes are bigger too so I mean it's not like your buddy's getting chopped up the chamber now to hold this in is deep deep as a [ __ ] so it's really this is definitely an efficient grinder because I like to grind less smoke more as opposed to and look it already got some Keef going in on there I only grind at once so I mean I'm gonna be in love with his bad-boy I could tell this is gonna be definitely my favorite favorite diner but that's my grind and review there I mean that this is a cosmic the cosmic is my number one pick a number two pick simply just because it has this screen on a separate piece is the sharp stone but if I had a if I had the extra rigged-up chromium crusher I would definitely [ __ ] with that one and I probably wouldn't have gotten the cosmic but only because this one broke I'd like to save my save my pollen so that's why I went with the cosmic okay also I'll be dropping videos of scraping keep out of these and I'll be introducing one of the video with my first shake box I don't know if you guys seen this this is my baby right here it looks like a box fits in a shoebox easy to hide from parents kind of keep the smell in it slides out okay you can see there's little lips they're little magnets on each end just like that symmetrical over here inside is a silkscreen where all your bud I grind up my bud throw the throw it in the silkscreen here put the top on just like this slide it right in my cat's getting up in this so you just put it in slide it on in and then you just shake it it has it scrapes around on the screen you get this mirror which is full pollen once again so I'll be posting videos and me scraping these out I'll be posting videos of me scraping the grinders out so I mean I'll be reviewing some other stuff also I got I got a request to review train wreck in Northern Lights you could find me a dispensary near San Diego that has

grinder from McCormick and it ran out of black peppercorn is this seems like such a waste as this toss this into the trash can to go to some landfill somewhere so there's got to be a way to refill that so I went and bought some new whole black peppercorns and let's see what we can do I'm going to try this out to refill this so what would that take to do so we're going to COFF the lid of courses red Deal is the how you adjust the size from small to large peppercorns and it appears it must hold the white grinder mechanism in place so what I'm going to do is it take a pair of needle nose and remove the red holder I hope that's the holder so we'll just see if that oh it works tada look at that comes right on out so that means I pull the should be a pull ah there's a Tang right there that seems to be holding this whole mechanism in so what we're going to do is pull that pull on that out there it is there we go oh there's a bunch of tangs like that so carefully pull them all out get a good grip on it somehow and with that ah get it out there we go so now we're going to refill it again got some around the base inside the tank so it would that be careful with that just try that we don't want any peppercorns in this area here so let me see if I can do that one more time carefully so we did chase those into the bottom area then we're going to press there's that detent again so I'm going to push this right back in place again so we got get all those tanks so we're going to start tucking it in on this one side is tuck them in push it down and around using the needle nose to push all those in round is back in we're going to push now these house I have some tangs and they have to clip into the cover there so push down on that and I think we're good and fortune successful we have success we if we are successful we've taken it apart put it back together again it's been refilled we didn't have to send that to the landfill I hope you like that little life hack there thanks again", "BvX3hwnrebM": "[Music] [Music] you [Music]", "t3JX_kBZ89I": "this nanny changgil gran do is just suddenly stopped working it's the lent it to a friend and was he's been using it's just packed in even finds me that he has to check the fuse so I will assume that the fuse is okay so we're going to actually have a look inside I'm going to try and find out what the parties is stopping it from working obviously some electrical problem if it was mechanical it is still be working but you probably get a lot of noise from it either blade wouldn't spend but this is obviously an electrical problem when you squeeze the trigger in nothing happens when it's plugged in a large Grandda like this 10 so always have a Deadman switch on it and that means that you've got to physically all the switch on fit to work as soon as you let go of that the power will be cut to the machine that's a safety feature on machines like this so we're going to take a look inside we're going to try and find out what's wrong with it and we'll just do a few simple tests but in order to do the tests you're going to need a multimeter so I'm going to leave the blade on it because that's helping so actually balance the machine for now you'll notice on this particular machine that we've got some hawser that we can take off from the other covers that year we moved to replace the brushes because the brushes are replaceable in this model this particular grinder is about 12 years old it's been an extremely good grain used on plenty of work and we're just going to lock to see whether it's economical and not to repair it obviously if the par that's in there with ponytail is very expensive it won't be worthwhile they're permanent you're better off getting a new one so we're just going to open it up now we're going to take a look inside so I'm going to start off by removing that which is a brush cover and these are just a simple Phillips group on a lot of machines like this the I know Torx screws and sometimes even get thump approved torques so we can just gently leave that off and you can see that in there there's a lot of dust and really we need to get all that off so I'm going to scrape all it off after before I put this back and I'm going to give it a wipe ideally you blow that out with your compressor but all that's left mine plugged in in a minute so if you're observant you'll notice that I pulled a small screw outside at all so my place that up we're out of the way then along get it mixed up so I'm not going to move these two screws and these two screws and your mortise that that is a slightly longer screw than the first one that we took out and you can see that that is a longer screw of all and that one will call a bit a certain length so it's always important to put a screw back in the correct place it's probably immediately obvious because a long screw probably will not draw clear shots crucial got the public bottomed out so it can now remove the last one and now we can start to pry it open the anvil so I just comes off like that and you can see again that there is considerable dust deposits in there which we will clean before we put back Ison that we've exposed the switch some people call it a trigger doesn't really matter what you call it does the same thing inside the machines so what we need to do now is we know the fuse is working because that's been checked so now we need to check the lead so we need to make sure that there's no internal break anywhere in this cable so what we need to do is set the multimeter on to the bleep test function so now when we get continuity the machine bleeps I have done a separate video on how to use a multimeter for testing for continuity so I'm not gonna spend too much time explaining that to you all's you need to know is when we touch them two clubs together we get continuity so what I'm going to do now is I'm going to get the plug from the machine and I'm going to clip this end onto one of the pins from the plug and then I'm going to probe this end the because this is where the actual machine connects to so you can see that we've got continuity on that one so I'll now swap over to the other pin on the plug and I'll now pull the bottom terminal and you can see again that we've got continuity so that means that from the plug into the machine is perfectly okay that's working fine so the next thing we're going to check is the next thing in the sequence which is of course the trigger or a switch sorts of tests this you'll notice that there's a terminal layer and the terminal boss side so this looks like a double ball switch so when you press the switch in it makes the contact between that terminal in that terminal and that terminal and that terminal which then gives the Machine the power to run so what we're going to do is we want to take white crocodile clip and we're going to clip that on to the first terminal there and then we're going to probe the first terminal at this side here now when we press this switch the Machine shall bleep just actually switch itself off so if I touch that on there you can get it bleep in obviously because I'm bypassing a switch but if I press the switch in and touch that terminal there's absolutely nothing and also if I touch the terminal on the opposite side there's nothing so I'll by pressing the switch in and touching this terminal that tells me that this switch is no longer working so there's some components in that switch there's now faulty and that means that we can no longer use the angle grinder until we've fixed it so what we need to do is we need to order a replacement switch so if you look at the label you can see that's a DW 490 so if you go online and you search with DW 490 suppose and this particular model is an air one they tend to have different models like air model B model C model or a1 model to model or 3d model depending on when they were made generally the layer to the model number the ledge it was made so if you get a DW for 90 that's a C or a C 3 that means that it's a newer model than this and as I've already said this one is about 12 years old so now when he swaps in a replacement switch and price that up and then we can fit that in this unit and then we can get the machine working again so I found a decent website that sold the waltz birds and I managed to pick this up for 25 it so it's well worth replacing that because this machine was about 120 quid when I bought it to buy we play someone you're looking at save money again so if we do the test the end it I did on the actual grinder I place that onto that terminal then I put that probe on there and that one we press the switch in you can see that we've got continuity so as soon as I put this switch in there which will be good to go we should have a new machine basically so what I'm going to do is I want to strip it down now put the new switch in going to give it a clean and reassemble it so in order to get the old switch out we're going to remove the Bush older at this side and we'll just leave that out so I've been lucky here we can see that we've got two spared connectors so we're going to grab those and pull those off so that one goes at the top and the one at the bottom goes at the bottom so we won't forget that later when we got to put it back just to make this a bit easier I'm actually going to undo the cord grip so now I can pull that out and it can now undo the terminals so if we remember that the neutrals at the bottom and the lives at the top you shouldn't Milla make a difference but we'll put it back the same way we took it out I'll just turn it that way I'll just press that side with the Andal off and I'm going to remove that completely then I can give it a good clean before I put it back so that's the last spared connector there and that one is a bit stiff I'll just pry that off using a screwdriver so now all we need to do is switch the two switches over and that should be quite easy because it's just got a log on the end of it so if you just tries that off we can pull that side off and the same outside and that's the old switch off so I'm just going to give this a bit of a clean and that will make it easier to get a bite together so now I'm just going to push the switch back into position and then we can reconnect the spare connectors on the top there so when I'll just put our Neutral back in there which isn't a very good fit so I'm putting these waves back in there but they're not a very good fit so I'm doing it I'm just bending the actual conduct soo or slightly and that way the screws got a lot more to grip obviously you got to make sure you get all the strands in so I'll just give that a turn now so I've now got the neutral and live connectors back in there and they are very tight so now we can start to reassemble the Andal I also need to do is make sure that the little bit Flex holder is seated correctly in there and then we can put the card grip back on so we're just going to make sure we now that not only these wires actually gets out when we put the machine back together so I can now put this off put the machine back on and not just pushes into the part that we put on first then when we've done that we can put the screws back in the correct side I saw the one ones go there and the two sharp ones go there also if you look in there you'll be able to see the armature on the back of the Morton and see that that's in good condition if that was damaged in any way it's probably spending 25 pounds on a new switch for this because you just waste any money because eventually that will go so this machine because it just needed a new switch of 25-pound it was well worth fixing so all's we need to do is fit the Bush covers and they'll just push in and just secure it in with one of the small screws so that's how to fold find and replace a switch on a Dewald angle grinder so now if we take the switch that we took out we put the crocodile clip on the one terminal there and then press the switch in and such a terminal there you can see that we get nothing and if we swap terminals on to that side it's the same again so you can see that this switch it's clearly no longer working you probably could take it a bit and possibly fix it but it's just not worth it you're better off buying a brand new unit", "gvwr18lBQq4": "[Music] hmm [Music]

reshape edges completely in form entirely new tools but a lot of people give up on the bench grinder they get uneven results or they burn the tip again and again turning the steel blue and removing its hardness but there's no need to struggle I'm going to show you an amazing really old-school tip that was brought to the magazine by Joel Moskowitz that has me grinding faster and more accurately than I ever have check it out before we get into technique I need to say a few words about setting up a grinder the right way so you'll have success make sure your grinder has one of the new styles of wheel look for the word friable that's what you want that means the particles as the wheel gets worn they begin to break away exposing new fresh edges and the grinding wheel runs cooler that's really important the second thing is you want to throw away your old tool risk these old tool wrists stink in a word these are too rough too small and too hard to adjust get yourself an aftermarket rest like this Veritas from Lee Valley which adjusts quickly and easily in every direction now here's that magic trick that makes the whole rest of my grinding technique possible it's all about how you dress the wheel I used to think it should be flat across the front the weird thing is that it works much better if it's rounded slightly with a high point in the middle so get yourself a flat diamond dresser like this one they're not expensive and then knock back the edges slightly to end up with a nice smooth gentle curve across the front okay now the grinder is ready to go so here's the most common way you're going to use it this is the point when you've done a lot of honing and REE honing the edge and those polished areas are now too big to touch up efficiently on your fine stones it's time to regrind the entire edge but first we have to readjust the angle of this tool rest so if you're already happy with the angle your chisel is ground at you can just match that by laying the chisel on the rest adjusting it slightly and getting down low and taking a look you want the wheel to hit the bevel about halfway along its length what you can do is slide it up to the wheel when you think you're close and rub it back and forth and then flip it over and take a look at the scratch pattern it should be somewhere near the center of the bevel here's how easy it is lay the tool on the rest and slide it up toward the wheel when it starts to grind use your back hand as a depth stop against the back of the rest and just start moving the tool side to side letting the high point on the wheel sweep smoothly across the edge for even results flip the blade now to make sure the wheel is hitting the bevel somewhere near the middle then just turn it over occasionally to check your progress it's easy to grind a bit more in some areas to even the bevel out but grind lightly that's one of the big keys the very fine tip of the tool is vulnerable to overheating so when the grinder starts closing in on that tip start dunking the blade in water every once in a while you know you're done when the newly ground area covers the whole bevel and there's a tiny burr formed along the back of the tip that feels perfect now let's talk about a chisel that you've inherited somehow or picked up at a flea market and it's really in bad shape this one's got a rounded tip and we're really going to want to start from scratch here we want this tip to be 90 degrees and straight so just use a square and a fine tip marker to make a reference line the first thing we need to do is set this tool rest back to about 90 degrees to the wheel like you had it when you were dressing the wheel but don't really sweat this it just needs to be close to 90 that looks great now we're just going to blunt this tip working our way right up to the reference line once again all it takes is a very light touch in this case since we are grinding off the thin tip almost instantly and blunting it heat shouldn't be a problem if you use a light touch so you don't have to dump the tool in water now we have to go back to the tool rest and set it for the bevel angle we want with the last chisel which was in good shape we could sort of trust the bevel angle and use that to set the tool rest in this case let's assume that this chisel is in really bad shape and this bevel angles no good to us and we need to set it from scratch and there's a couple good ways to do that you can buy one of these inexpensive little angle setting gauges or you can just make one yourself out of cardboard since the chisel sits right down against the tool rest when you're grinding put the bottom part of your angle gauge against the wheel because we blunted the tip and we're rehabbing this entire bevel edge this grinding process will take a while but keep checking that blunt tip to gauge your progress you're removing a lot of metal now so use a light touch and start dunking the tool in water to cool it as the edge starts getting thin and sharp and the blunt edge starts to disappear once the grinder marks reach the tip you're going to start seeing that blunt tip start to disappear the great thing is you can use that blunt tip to track your progress and make sure you're grinding evenly you'll know you're done when the blunt tip is gone it feels sharp and you feel that nice tiny burr all along the back of the edge so that's it now you know how to take any garden-variety bench grinder put a new wheel on it put a better tool rest on it and then grind perfect bevels quickly and accurately every time",

ultimate jobsite convenience and performance additionally this AC brushless grinder integrates electronic controllers that compensate for reduced power loss due to voltage drop meaning you can keep on working even in tough conditions the AC brushless motor extends tool life and eliminates maintenance of armatures or carbon brushes eliminating the need for carbon brushes means freedom from issues with the motor armature burning out experiencing layer shorts or commutator wear in severe environments also brush wear and resulting armature damage from lack of maintenance is the most common service issue with grinders this is completely eliminated by the brushless motor resulting in more uninterrupted runtimes it's ultra slim grip circumference also due to the brushless motor reduces fatigue and improves control especially during continuous use applications the powerful 12 amp motor produces 1300 watts input power to tackle tough grinding applications and the variable speed dial adjusts between 2800 and 10,000 rpms no load speed which allows users to determine the best speed for the application Hitachi's G 12v II features an electronic overload protection feature that stops the motor when too much pressure is applied when the tool shuts off the switch must be turned to the off position and then turn back to the on position to resume work this not only protects the motor from overloaded but protects the gearbox from damage the G 12v e is easy to use with its soft start function that reduces the load felt by the user at startup and the slide switch with trigger Lachlan for comfortable and continuous operation the kickback reduction quickly shuts off power in the event of a bound wheel extending the life of the gears and protecting the user for potential harm zero

Today, we're gonna look at a\nbunch of high-end hand grinders and talk about which one I\nthink might be the best one of them, a note before we begin, there are a couple of notable exceptions. First and foremost is the Lyn Weber HG-1 that did not make it into this testing because it's $1,000 dollars and I just didn't really feel comfortable spending that money, it's $1,000 dollars. Secondly, a lot of people had requested the Feld 2 from Made by\nKnock, that was out of stock as were a couple of other\ngrinders that people requested. So here's what we have,\nwe have the Lido 3, we've got the Comandante\nC40, we've got the Helor 101, we've got the Timemore Chestnut, we've got the Aergrind from Made by Knock, we've got the Kinu M47\nand joining the testing is the Porlex Mini that\nwon the first round, which was the best cheap hand grinder. So I brought it forward into this round, to see how it stacks\nup, how does it compare to the other grinders? At this point, I do have to\nsay thank you to my supporters on Patreon who made this\npossible, who gave me the budget to go out and buy these things and I really look forward\nto giving them away again. I thank you so much, this is so cool. I'm aware you've kind of ruined me, I am gonna be unnecessarily\nfussy about everything. Now, you know, when you get nothing but really good things\nto compare side by side, suddenly things that\nwouldn't normally bother you become horrific,\noutrageous, disgraceful. So I'm gonna seem unnecessarily fussy, that's just the nature of having a bunch of really\nnice things to compare, you just end up nitpicking, that said, let's get into how I tested\nthese, so I did wanna make sure that they could all make espresso, so I dialed them in for\nespresso each and every one and took copious notes along the way, as well as did a bunch of tastings with that, what I will tell\nyou is that first and foremost, dialing in seven hand grinders\nacross multiple coffees for espresso is very unpleasant, I do not recommend that\nwhatsoever, it took me a long time and I had very sore arms. I'm not sure I'd recommend\nhand grinding for espresso. I know some people out there\nlike it, so it was necessary to test all of these to\nsee how they would do and they all could brew espresso. What I also did for filter testing, was I brewed them all until\nthey all were extracting at a 30 gram to 500 grams of water ratio, till they were all extracting about 21%, very small margin of error, I dialed them in as closely as I could, they would then taste it to see if there was a big difference. So I wanted to push these\njust a little bit coarser. The finer they are, the more\nuniform they're likely to be, if you give them a little\nbit more coarseness, then flaws in the burrs will start to show up a little bit more, alongside\nthat, I then took samples of the grounds and had a look at them using some free software, I recently provided by Jonathan Gagne, he is an astrophysicist by day, and someone who's writing\nsome amazing software for coffee people, I'll link it down below it lets you take a\nphotograph of the grounds and ultimately analyze the\nsize of those particles based on the number of\npixels that they occupy and give you a distribution\nof ground profile. So that was the testing\nand I've ground by hand, I don't know how many kilos now but enough that I don't particularly\nwanna do it anymore, but it was fascinating, so what I'm gonna do\nnow, is I'm gonna jump into each individual grinder and talk through a little\nbit of that grinder and then at the end, I will\nkind of wrap up with a summary of which one I think I would wanna keep, that's gonna be the metric right? Which one will be the\nsaddest to give away, because it's the one I\nwould most want to keep. Let's start with the Lido 3. So first up is the Lido\n3 from Orphan Espresso and goodness me, this thing\nis huge, like it's huge. I have no idea why it's as big as it is and to be honest,\nthis was a big negative for me, I don't want a grinder this big, there are certainly other grinders with much smaller form\nfactors delivering everything you would want, I confess\nthat from the beginning, that did bother me a little bit, now it means you have\nan enormous capacity, you could probably get 60, 70\ngrams of beans in this thing. Now it does become slightly more compact, you can lift and move the handle into the middle so it's sort of slimmer and I suppose easier to travel with but that's not an enormous\nspace saving if I'm honest. So it is plastic bodied,\nthere's a large burr set inside it and it is a\nstepless grind adjuster. So here's how it works,\nthere's a grind indicator at the top, there is a locking ring and then there's your grind adjustment. So right now the locking\nring is compressed against the grind adjustment,\nso I can't change my grind. If I unlock my locking ring and I can now adjust my grind as needed, I can\ngo finer or I can go coarser and then I can lock my grinder back at that setting, as a kind of UI, I don't\nparticularly love this feeling, I don't like sort of locking the ring against this, it just didn't feel pleasing to me, that may be different for you, but for me, I just\ndidn't really enjoy adjusting the grind on this thing, it is\na wonderfully quick grinder, those are big burrs inside of\nit and they definitely chew through coffee at a pretty fast rate, which meant grinding for\nespresso was pleasurable, the shot it pulled was pretty good. Like just about every grinder after it, I might as well say now, all of their shots start pretty slow, and then really flow very\nquickly in the last half of the espresso, which\nwas kind of interesting to me when it came to brewing coffee, I did enjoy the brew that it produced. It was a little finicky to\nget there, but it was quick to grind at least, it's 180 pounds and for that I'm a little\ndisappointed at the amount of plastic in this thing,\nit doesn't feel as premium as some of the other grinders at the same sort of price point. The bean hopper is\nrelatively well designed, there's no issues with bounce out, where\nyou're gonna put coffee in and the beans hit\nthe stabilizing pieces and bounce back out again, which does happen with the\nother grinders sometimes. So overall, yeah, pretty\nimpressed, it's a solid grinder, it does a good job for the money, I don't love the size or the form factor, I don't particularly\nenjoy the grind adjustment on it, but its actual\ndelivery of ground coffee, is pretty good. And now, Commandante C40, Commandante really kind of kick\nstarted the high-end grinder thing there had been\nexpensive hand grinders before them, but I think\nCommandante were the first ones to turn up, push grind\nquality at a higher price, push a high-end experience,\nthey really paved the way for a lot of premium hand grinders behind them, it's a beautiful thing, it does feel very well made,\nit does feel very premium with one exception, the little plastic piece here attached to the crank handle, I\ndon't love this actually, I don't love that the lid is\nattached to the crank handle, that kind of bothers me a little bit. It does also have a pretty\nhigh stabilizing point and loading this can result\nin a little bit of bounce out where you're just pouring coffee beans in and a couple hit this\nand bounce back out again. It's really really\nannoying when it happens 'cause coffee beans are very irritating once they're outside of a place you want them to be like\nthe counter or the floor or anywhere really, obviously\nyou need these pieces here to stabilize the\ndriveshaft through this thing. The grade adjustment is pretty simple, there's\na coarser, finer dial here, you do need to make sure that your lid is on otherwise you can't really adjust it, it is a stepped grinder,\nI think there is a mod to give you a bit more control over that if you find these\nsteps a little bit too big, they weren't too big for me, I didn't have a\nparticularly difficult time dialing in for espresso, it\nwas a pretty limited range to dial in with, but I\nhit my shot times my ratio that I wanted to and\nthe shot was very good. It was probably my favorite shot, other testers liked another\ngrinder a little bit more but I really liked the espresso from this again in the brewed testing, it produced a very delicious cup of coffee relatively easily, the steps\ngot me where I needed to go relatively easily again,\nit's clearly a good burr set in there and the grind analysis shows it's pretty good, it does have\na glass collection chamber, it's the only one though that I tested that had a glass collection chamber and during testing, I did\ndrop this on a hard floor it didn't break 'cause it's well made, but it did make me think, I'm not sure I want this to\nbe glass 'cause I'm clumsy. You can definitely tell\nwhen it's getting dirty quicker than you can with the other ones, breakable things stress me\nout, especially with something you're gonna travel with,\nsomething you might have just rolling around in\na bag full of stuff, that crossed my mind. I don't think I've seen many people break these or heard complaints\nabout it but it crossed my mind overall you could argue this\nis kind of the gold standard of hand grinders, they really set the bar where it is, they set it pretty high, I really enjoyed this thing,\nI was impressed by the quality of coffee that it\nproduced start to finish, it's a really nice grinder. This is the Helor 101 and it is beautiful. It's really beautifully machined. So again, the handle\nis connected to a lid, the lid in this case is metal. This is a sort of a unibody piece, it's all kind of milled\nout and it is lovely. There is a little grippy ring\nhere which was okay to use, the grounds collection bin\nis a friction connection, which is nice, it's a nice\nsolid little grounds bin. So the ground adjustment is at the bottom here, it is stepless\nunlike some of the others that have a ground\nadjustment at the bottom, which is a very nice to use. So you need to make sure\nyour handle's attached to make that adjustment, I was very impressed by this grinder, it is again relatively expensive but not by any stretch,\nthe most expensive, I think it's very good I like the design, I think it's beautiful. The adjustment was good,\nthe shots I had were good, the brewed coffee I had was also good, it seems to perform pretty\nwell in grinds analysis. This is a very strong grinder,\nit does look fantastic. Do I have any downsides? Yeah, a couple. Again, the stabilizer\nis relatively high up, I just have a little bit of bounce out there and if I'm to be truly nitpicky, this little bowl should spin\nas you crank the handle, but it was quite sticky and it often wouldn't and\nit was a bit frustrating, it's gotten better with use, which indicates that something\njust didn't quite fit the way it was supposed\nto and is wearing down to the point that it does,\nbut occasionally it sticks and that's annoying,\nit doesn't feel superb and you want these\nthings to feel fantastic. Quick to grind, enjoyable\nto use, the lack of guidance on the grind adjustment\nis a little frustrating, but not a huge problem. They do give you a reference\nin terms of burr movement for I think a 30 degree\nturn on their website, it's a very good grinder, it may be ended up\nfeeling a little mid pack, it does everything very well\nbut it doesn't really stand out in a really big way against\nsome of its competition but if you want a grinder\nthat looks like this, that produces very good tasting coffee, I was impressed by this. And this is the Timemore\ngrinder, the Chestnut grinder, I probably made a mistake, I ordered this with the wooden base, the more premium one, it's\nthe more expensive one than the clear base that is an option and upon using it, it\nkind of it, I don't like it, it doesn't feel right to grind coffee into a little wooden chamber, I find that really hard to explain why when I say it out loud, but something about it just unsettles me it feels like something\nthat's gonna get dirty in a way that's gonna be really hard to clean, if you're coating the inside\nof this with coffee oil all the time, well that might not be good but there is an option, you don't have to get it\nwith the chestnut base from the beginning, this thing, this piece has a little magnet so it clicks on but it would often come off, I don't think the magnet\nconnection is quite strong enough for me so grinding sometimes I\ndid whip the handle piece off that was quite irritating, on the plus side it is\na very fast grinder, it does grind very quickly. Whether that's the way that\nthey're feeding the beans in or not, I'm not sure, again the lid is attached to the handle and here the stabilizing\npiece is a little bit deeper though it is quite a\nnarrow grinder to load into, which was okay, that was fine. A couple of things that I didn't like as much with this grinder, now, one thing I really,\nreally didn't like about this was that the way that this bottom piece connects on, there are\nfour little ball bearings and little springs that compress in, clicks into place, but it was really easy to\nsort of break that connection during grinding, I have quite large hands, which means it's easy for me\nto want to hold the grinder on both the base and the main body and if I did that, it was easy,\nvery easy to just disconnect that and it wasn't that it fell off ever, it never did, it just\nfeels really unpleasant to hold it like that, to have it sort\nof slip and move around when you're trying to grind,\nI didn't like that at all. It made pretty good filter coffee but when it came to espresso, it is a stepped grind adjustment again, and the steps were very big,\nI had very large changes in my flow rate from a single\nstep, finer or coarser, and it was pretty difficult to dial in, I got there, the shot was okay but the steps were pretty big. There's things I like about\nthis, the way that it grinds feels very good but there's a few things that just really frustrate\nme, so it's not a grinder I'd recommend for espresso particularly. I definitely don't like the base, I don't like the material that I chose, which is I guess my own fault, but it was the premium version,\nI don't like the material and I don't like the way it connects, both of those things really\ndamaged the experience of using this thing, it just\nmakes it a lot less enjoyable to use, quite frustrating to use, the grounds from it were\ngood but not fantastic. Now this is the Aergrind from Knock and it's a really interesting\nprice point, it's 100 pounds before shipping which is cheap, 99 pounds to be more precise, so it is\neasily the cheapest grinder here and by a good long\nway, it's so cheap, it probably could have gone\ninto the cheaper grinder testing and if it had, it would have\ncrushed the competition. This is I think spectacularly\ngood value for money in terms of what you get\nfrom it, handled attaches from the lid and the stabilizing\npiece is relatively low in there so you don't have\nany issues with loading this thing with coffee, it is quite unusual in the\nway that you adjust the grind, that's quite different to everything else. So your piece goes on and what\nyou do is hold this top piece here is this lid and if you hold the lid and move the handle, you can\nsee there's an adjustment marker here and there's numbers here so again, going\nfrom eight, down to seven is a move finer, now, this\nfeels just so different as a way to do things, that part of my brain is like\nthere's no way this can work, there must be slippage. Surely, when I'm twisting this thing, that's gonna change the burr\nsetting slippage possible. I don't think it is, and I\nnever experienced any slippage with this thing, it\nstruggled when we came down to espresso, right? I found it very difficult\nto make the adjustments necessary to really dial it\nin and it very quickly slipped into being too fine,\nthat window of too coarse to too fine was actually\npretty small on this grinder, you can grind very fine, you\ncan get down to kind of Turkish on this thing, it can go very fine but it seems to me that\nthe window of opportunity for espresso was pretty small and like some of the other grinders, it is a friction ground bin, the gasket being on here,\nas opposed to on the base this time, I thought\nthis worked very well, it definitely feels very secure, perhaps sometimes a little too secure, it's quite hard work to get off, I don't know if that would\nchange over a year or two of usage but it definitely fits very well. The grinds quality is\ngood, it may not be as good as some of the other grinders,\nbut at under 100 pounds, it's fantastic value for\nmoney, it's pretty small, that's definitely an issue when\ngrinding 30 grams of coffee for my filter coffee testing,\nI couldn't put 30 grams of coffee into this thing,\nI had to load it twice which was a little bit annoying. So know that there are some limitations but overall I have to say for 100 pounds, I'm impressed, I wouldn't\nrecommend it for espresso but as a filter grinder, it's very good if it had been in the\ncheaper grinder comparison, it would have crushed the\ncompetition in every single way. So, yeah, for 99 pounds, I was\nvery impressed by this thing. At the other end of the price spectrum, we have the Kinu M47, by far\nthe most expensive grinder that I tested, this is 329\neuros, that is a lot of money. It is built like a tank,\nit is substantially heavier than any of the other grinders, it is really, really well made. Now there is no lid on this\nthing, which is interesting. The Lido doesn't have a lid\nand this doesn't have a lid, it does, however, have\nthis nice little lip here and sort of half funnel. This meant loading this\nwas an absolute pleasure, I never had any issues loading\ncoffee into this thing, despite the fact that\nwhen you look in the top, there's a big stabilizing piece\nand the hole is pretty small but the design means that\nI never had any issue with spillage, it was a pleasure to load into, now the grind adjustment on this is particularly interesting, Kinu do something a little bit different, which is they give you steps and then they tell you what\na step does, every step moves the burrs by 1/100th of a millimeter. The grind adjustment\nmechanism is quite simple, you have a locking piece on\nthe top here, which you undo, and then you move your little grind adjuster lock back in the top,\nand you're good to go. One of the challenges of hand grinding, is that you're gripping\na perfectly round thing most of the time and applying\na good amount of force to that and so keeping\nhold of it can be an issue, slippage is a thing, some\nof the grinders solve that by giving you a rubber band, with some grinders you don't\nget that, the Commandante you don't get that so\nslippage is possible. The Kinu comes with quite\na nice little thumb stop, which I really liked using a lot. It was pleasing to me to have\nmy thumb against this thing as I ground coffee, it made\nit much, much easier to use. The base of this is also very clever, it's magnetically attached, there's a bunch of\nlittle magnets in the top here that allow it to just click in, it feels very secure when you're grinding unlike the Timemore, I'm always gonna be holding\nthe main body of the grinder, I'm never going to be touching\nthis, it probably would move a little bit if I were holding it down there but I'm not so it's no issue. I thought that was really well done. The capacity of this thing is not huge, it doesn't hold an enormous\namount of ground coffee, but certainly enough but it just feels fantastic and when you grind coffee\nwith it, it feels really good from the usability experience, this thing crushes it, this\nwas incredibly enjoyable to use with the one downside of it\nbeing very, very, very heavy, much, much heavier than any of the others, which would put a dampener on me using it as a travel grinder, in terms of the shots that it produced, I had a funny experience\ndialing in the first time, which was, I kind of chased\nthe grind setting around a little bit which shouldn't\nreally happen on a hand grinder when you're grinding\nthrough everything each time and I ended up dialing it in,\ngoing in a little bit finer, having to go coarser,\nand kind of ending up where I was, but having\nquite a different flow rate. It made me wonder whether there was just a\nlittle bit of seasoning needed for the burrs, after that, it acted in a much more predictable\nand consistent fashion. I really enjoyed the espresso from this, some testers\nthought this was the best tasting espresso, as I said,\nI preferred the espresso from the Comandante but this\nproduced very good espresso. It's brewed coffee was very good, I'm not sure it was absolutely\nthe best but it was very good and very enjoyable at a 21% extraction, the grounds analysis shows\nit to be pretty good, with the grounds analysis, I'm\nnot sure I have enough data across enough different coffees, across enough different ground settings to say, with any\nconfidence that one grinder here produced the most\nuniform ground settings. It was interesting to\nlook at the grounds to see the distributions, a lot of them performed very, very similarly, I\nreally like this grinder, I do and I was impressed by it, my goodness me it's very expensive,\n329 euros is a lot of money and I'm very glad that Patreon\nallowed me to go and buy this and test it, I've really\nenjoyed testing this grinder. And so we should wrap up briefly by talking about the Porlex, this went through the\nsame testing as the others and in truth, it felt like a toy. It felt so cheap in comparison, you know the gauge of the\nmaterial felt so light, it felt plasticky, the gap in price between this and the Aergrind\nis not particularly large, the gap in quality is\nsubstantial, this did not do well in any of the testing, quite hard work to dial in for espresso and the espresso I got\nfrom it was notably worse than the espresso from the other grinders and again, the filter coffee that I got from it was noticeably\nworse, muddier, dustier, so at 57 pounds, I don't think\nit's bad value for money, it's just not in the same\nleague, it's not even close, it sounds like a toy, it\nfeels like a toy in comparison to these much, much better hand grinders that we've been testing and\nso it's time for a summary, it's time to tell you which\none I would want to take home and if I'm honest, it may\nnot be the absolute best performing in terms of\nparticle uniformity, but it is probably the Kinu M47, it is the one that I enjoyed\nusing the most of all, it is outrageously expensive but you kind of see\nreally what you're getting for your money, the grinding\naction is beautiful, the design is great, the\nbottom chamber I really like, the grind control is well\nthought out, the little details, for me, the cup quality was\nvery good, that would be the one the Kinu for me is the best\nof these from fit, finish, build, usage, as well as\nhaving really great quality in the cup, for me, that's my favorite. I want to want to use it\nthat's really important to me, and this definitely\nwent in that category. So this is my pick overall, a final note, if you have one of these six grinders, I'm not sure in most cases\nI would recommend upgrading. You know what I mean? Like your returns are\nreasonably diminishing, if you've invested in\nsomething good already, spending the extra money\nunless there's something one of these does that\nyou particularly want, you've got a good grinder, right? Like you're in the realm of this is a very good hand grinder and I'd love to hear your thoughts. Do you have one of these grinders? Does my experience marry yours or did you have\na different experience? I'd really appreciate\nyour comments down below. Thank you so much for watching and I hope\nyou have a great day.

share it with you let's get right down to business this salt and pepper grinders really cool now you all know that I like to use Himalayan pink salt and I have some very large cut pink salt in my pantry I also put just some regular black dilatory peppercorns in here as well but the the grinder itself is very very easy to deal with these endcaps just pop right off and you can fill it up they have ceramic grinding mechanisms in them so that the salt is not going to break down the grinding mechanism you know a lot of times the the grinding mechanism is made out of plastic this is a ceramic and you can tell by the weight of this that it is not plastic inside and it's got a stainless steel outer portion so that only that makes it nice and sleek looking it's nice and clean and it's easy to clean and wipe off and this just screws right back on there the same with the other end they just screw right off and you can fill them right up now again ceramic grinding mechanism on the inside there and that's really what you want to look for when you are looking for a mill a spice mill is that they have ceramic mechanisms inside now that's there's an end cap on each end of this now I will say this is very snug this is not popping off at all so what I'm going to do is I'm going to show you there's a just like with any type of spice male pepper or salt mill you can adjust the grind so if you want bigger chunks you you twist it to the left and if you want smaller chunk smaller grains of salt or pepper than you twist it to the right you know righty-tighty lefty-loosey Wranglers version or vice versa but this the tighter it is the smaller the grind the bigger it is the bigger the grind and I like my pepper a little bit on the larger side and what you want to do when you grind it is you want to hold this part here and then you want to hold the center part the loose site part and then you grind away and I I did a little demo I'm going to put right in here I we were cooking some eggs for breakfast this morning and we decided to show you what this looked like in action I like my pepper to be ground what's called a butcher's grind and that means it's a little bit on the larger size smells really good I love the smell of fresh ground pepper and the salt I like my salt a little bit finer and there you go beautiful I was very impressed when I use this for the first time and I'm very pleased with it you can store it laying down you can store it standing up I love that it is a space saver as well because you don't have to have two separate salt and pepper mills you have one and they both it contains both salt and pepper I really kind of like that I'm going to just go over some points with you about this it has obviously a lot of style it's got the sleek stainless steel on it and it is the manufacturer says that it's built for more flavor and fewer turns meal features a ceramic mechanism for smooth operation and the modern stylish design with stainless steel accents and high quality clear acrylic body that lets you know when to refill it's very easy to clean and refill as I've said and the smooth operation with many grades of grinding thanks to high-performing ceramic grinding mechanisms now um the other thing too that I wanted to mention is the lifetime warranty um they say that they want everyone to have the best buying experience ever so they're removing any risks out of your purchase they offer a 60 day no questions asked money back guarantee if for any reason during those 60 days you are not fully satisfied with your salt and pepper

just watched our videos you'll know that we're big fans of Eureka's new\nmignons series grinders we received our first beta unit over a year ago and have\nbeen using them consistently ever since we've learned a few tricks in that time\nso today I'll be sharing our top three tips first let's talk about cleaning one\nof our favorite things about the Mignon series grinders is how easy it is to\nopen them up and clean out the verge this comes in handy if the grinder has\never clogged you'll know that's the case if you hear the grinder running but\ndon't see any grounds coming out to get started just pop this Eureka badge off\nthe back it's clipped in and the plastic is durable so don't worry too much about\nhurting it unthread the screw hidden behind it and you'll be able to simply\nslide off this top panel under that you'll then undo these three screws\nholding the top burr down then you can lift off the upper burr and access the\nburr chamber all in all this requires just one tool and a few minutes making\nit really simple we find the quickest and easiest way to clean the bird\nchamber is using a vacuum cleaner in combination with a small paintbrush or\ntoothbrush make sure to focus on the opening of the chute here as they'll\noften be much more coffee hidden inside be sure to use flexible tools so as not\nto damage the metal screen at the shoots opening Eureka's micro metric grind\nadjustment knob makes adjustments both big and small quickly but it can take a\nlittle while to figure out how much of an adjustment to make to get your\ndesired shot time first it's important to remember that if your shots are\npulling too fast there's a 99% chance that all you need to do is grind finer when your grind is too coarse it can\nseem like your adjustments aren't getting you any closer until suddenly\nthe next adjustment doubles your shot time so stick with it these grinders are\ndurable and powerful so don't have any fear of grinding too fine even if you do\nthe grinder will only jam which can easily be fixed by adjusting the grind\ncoarser let's say you've pulled the shot with a new coffee and you get your\ndesired output in 15 seconds and you're aiming for 25 that seems like a big gap\nbut just by turning the setting 1.5 to 2 notches finer will be almost spot-on\nlet's pull another shot it looks like we got our output in about 23 seconds so\nwe'll just need to make another minor adjustment of maybe a quarter or half of\na setting this sensitivity will vary based on the temperament of your coffee\nbut by sticking to increments of 1/2 adjustments or smaller you can avoid\novershooting your target these grinders are also great for brew methods that\nrequire a coarser grind like pour over a drip coffee in order to switch the\ngrinder to pour over it we'll have to make a much larger adjustment than we'd\never make for espresso starting by rotating 1.5 full rotations coarser from\nthere another 1/2 to full rotation coarser will get us to a good setting\nfor drip coffee once you've done this grant a small amount of coffee and\ninspect the size of the grounds to see if they look right for your brew method\nthen adjust accordingly or brew your first batch we highly recommend taking\nnote of your espresso setting before making big adjustments this will come in\nhandy when you want to get back to pulling shots but you'll still require a\nlittle bit of fine-tuning before you're back on target before adjusting finer we\nrecommend grinding through whatever might be in the burr chamber and\nremoving the hopper after you've done this you can make the large adjustment\nback without concern of jamming your grinder when you're back to your\nespresso setting grind a couple grams of coffee to purge any large particles that\nmay

I\u2019m Mark from eReplacementParts.com.\nIn this video, I\u2019m going to show you how to replace the field on a Makita Grinder.\nThe field is one of two major components that make up the motor inside your grinder. The armature fits inside of the field. And when the field is energized, it creates a magnetic\nfield around the armature, which allows the armature to spin. The field can become damaged\nif the grinder is overloaded; and in turn, the motor overheats. When it overheats, the\ninsulation on the wires will break down or burn, which will create a short inside the\nfield. If this occurs, you\u2019ll also want to inspect the armature; or even have it tested,\nto make sure that the wires on the armature have not also been damaged. Replacing the\nfield is easy to do, and I\u2019m going to show you how. Fields, as well as many other parts,\ncan be found on our website. Let\u2019s get started. I\u2019ll begin by removing the side handle and\nthe guard. The gearbox housing is held in place with four screws. I\u2019ll go ahead and remove those. Now I can remove the rear housing. It\u2019s held in place with a single screw. Now I\u2019ll move the brush springs to the side of the brush holder. This will remove the tension from the brushes so they\u2019re not pressing against the armature. I\u2019ll do this\non both sides. With the tension removed from the brushes, now I can go ahead and remove\nthe armature assembly. Now I\u2019ll remove the baffle plate. It\u2019s held in place with two\nscrews. Now I\u2019ll remove the switch button. To do that, I hold it in the off position\nas I push forward on the switch lever. When you hear it click, you can now remove the\nswitch button. Now I\u2019ll remove the field from the motor housing. The first thing I\nwant to do is disconnect each of the wire connections. You'll want to take note of the location of each wire for reassembly. With the wires disconnected, now I can remove the field from the motor housing. The easiest way to do this is to tap the housing against my table until the field slides out. It\u2019s in there pretty firmly. Now I'll move to the edge of the housing, against the table, to remove the field the rest of the way. Now I\u2019ll install the field back into the\nmotor housing. As I do this, I need to thread the wires from the field back through the\nopenings on the motor housing. I want the side of the field with the two red wires to\nline up with the side where the connections for those wires are on the switch. I also\nhave the two black wires. One of the black wires hooks to the brush holder on the same\nside of the motor housing as the switch, and the other black wire, on the opposite side. As I thread the wires through, I find it works best to use a long screwdriver to help align the wires with the openings as I install the field. With the wires aligned, now I\u2019ll\ngo ahead and push the field the rest of the way into the housing. Now I\u2019ll reconnect\neach of the field wires. The two red wires go to the connections on the switch, and I\nloop these wires around to take up the excess, and the black wires to the connections on\nthe brush holders. And again, I\u2019ll just take up the excess getting out of the way. Now I can reinstall the switch button. To\ndo that, I push the switch lever all the forward, and then align the hook, on the back of the\nswitch button, with the opening in the switch lever. Now I\u2019ll push the switch lever up,\nagainst the hook on the switch button, and then release the lever. Now I\u2019ll replace\nthe baffle plate. Now I can install the armature assembly back into the grinder. I\u2019ll reinstall\nthe gear housing assembly to the motor assembly and secure it with the four screws.

Let's make some coffee. Today, I'm super\nexcited, because we have our good friend\nJames Hoffmann, who's an amazing coffee expert. He's going to walk\nus through how to use one of the most common\ncoffee gadgets-- a moka pot. And I actually first\nwas making coffee on one of these back\nwhen I lived in France and I had a tiny apartment. And I actually enjoyed\nthem quite a bit. They're great. Maybe, like me, you hated\nthis thing for a long time. You bought it, used it once,\nyou thought it was disgusting, you put it in the cupboard. Dig it out. Because, actually, it's\nprobably underrated and does delicious things. They make a coffee that's\na kind of halfway house between espresso, which is\nsuper strong, and drip coffee. GRANT CRILLY: Yeah. However, they have\na bad reputation, because it's pretty easy to\nmake bitter coffee with them. We're going to do a\ncouple things today to show you how you\ncan really produce something super delicious. GRANT CRILLY: OK. First things first. As with all the\nbrewing techniques, grind size is pretty important. And actually, this\nis where most people make their first mistake and\nproduce a lot of bitterness. We don't want it\nground like we would for an espresso machine, which\nis super fine, like table salt. We want to go just a\nlittle bit courser. So, once you've ground the\ncoffee, just take this, fill it, but don't push it down. GRANT CRILLY: Just level it off? Yeah. What you will\nnotice here, though, is this one is\nbeautifully clean. There's a lie that\nfloats around that having a buildup of old coffee\nin these things is good. That old, stale,\nrancid coffee is going to contribute a little bit\nof bitterness to the cup, too. So you want to keep\nit nice and clean. The other bit to worry about is\nthis little rubber gasket here. One, you want it clean\nso it seals properly. Two, when you\nstore it, you don't want to store it done up tight,\nbecause that adds pressure, and that'll age out the rubber. So just store it\nloose, not too tight. So, what we're\ngoing to do now is we're going to start on\nthe bottom with hot water. The down side of cold\nis that, while you're heating your water, you're\nheating up your coffee, too. I've always made\nmine with cold water. Right. And heating up the\ncoffee means it's going to taste a little bit\nmore bitter when you do so. So, hot water from a\nkettle, easiest way. Just fill it up to right\nbelow the safety valve. All right. So, I keep going, and it's right\nunder the little valve guy. JAMES HOFFMANN: There we go. GRANT CRILLY: I can pop this in? Yep. So, when you put\nit together, just grab a towel, because the\nbottom is going to be hot now. Sealed nice and tight. Done. And you actually\nwant to go straight to the burner pretty quick. Yeah. The water in the bottom is\ngoing to start to evaporate, but it's trapped, so\nit's going to build up a little bit of pressure. GRANT CRILLY: Oh, I\ncan hear it going. JAMES HOFFMANN: It's going to\napply pressure to the water and push it through the\nfunnel, through the coffee, and that's going to\ndo the brewing for us. Once your coffee starts to\nflow, it'll look nice, look super delicious. Listen and wait. And, as soon as you start\nto hear a gurgling sound, you want to cool it down. Take it off the stove. Just run it under your\ncold tap in the sink. It gets rid of the steam,\nstops the brewing process dead. GRANT CRILLY: So, we\nmade your moka pot. Super delicious. But, when I used to make it,\nI would take a French press on the side, heat up\nsome milk, froth it up, and pour myself a latte. It looks like it\ndoubled in volume, huh? JAMES HOFFMANN: Yeah. Tap out those little bubbles. Here we go, huh? Aah! Ooh. Check it out. Moka pot lattes. I made that one. James Hoffmann made that one. So, there it is. Put good coffee in, you use it\nright, get a delicious drink. And then, French press to hand,\na whole array of delicious drinks. So, super flexible,\ndelicious, underrated, go and play with it.

It's been a while since I've made one of these,\nbut it's about time I get to it and with it we have to go over a couple of things since\nthis is a guide geared towards newer players, though I know some of you veteran players\nlike to watch as well. Black Desert has 17 classes to choose from\nas of the date of this video, with surely more to come in the future, this means it's\ngoing to be hard for me to give you the in depth analysis compared to someone who has\nbeen playing a single class since the start of the game can give you. I am one of those players that likes to play\neverything, which leads me to be master in nothing. Kind of like real life. So with that said all of these statements\nare of course from my perspective and are my opinion and I urge to seek out your class\ndiscords and veteran players who have been playing your class of choice for a long long\ntime. The pitfall many newer players fall in is\ntrying to play every class from the beginning and then being led by what is the stronger\nclass at that given time. The meta will not matter to you because by\nthe time you as a new player reach the gear level required to competitively PVP the meta\nwill have shifted and you may be stuck with a class that wasn't as strong as you wanted\nit to be. That is why I say try the classes out, after\nthis guide see what appeals to you, check out the addendum to this video, which is the\nCLass Trailers video I posted a little while back and see how you enjoy the class. For newer players the class dynamic will change\ngreatly once you hit level 56 and then at 60 so it's a good idea to at least level a\nclass you are interested in to level 56 Awaken it, which means do a questline to obtain that\nclasses second weapon and then decide if you like the class or not. All classes in the game are gender locked\nso keep that in mind when making your decisions. I am including some brief skill demonstrations\nin this video to give you a flavor of what each class can do, but they are basic, so\nkeep that in mind. Highly skilled players make some classes look\ninsane so seek those out if you are interested. With that long but necessary intro lets get\ninto the rating system which I was honestly not going to go with a rating system this\ntime around, but its a good gauge that will give you an idea of how a class performance\nin different situations. 1v1 situations mainly mean dueling or open\nworld combat. PVP large scale means how the class does in\nguild wars, pve clear just means how quickly a class kill monsters which, I'll say this\nnow, will depend on the grind location you choose. Some classes are better at different locations\ndepending on the monster density so this rating is an average, a class can be better or worse\nthan I rate. I just give an average rating. Keep that in mind. And finally we have skill ceiling. So the higher the rating the more room you\nhave to improve and learn. A high rating means the class is usually quite\ndifficult to master. Some high skill ceiling classes can be great\nand rewarding to play, but it is sometimes the case where a less difficult class will\nstill beat you at equal levels simply because your class matchup is unfavored. Okay so those are the ratings and explanations\nout of the way. i expect there will still be those who complain,\nso comment section is down there and if you are a veteran player of a class and you hopefully\naren't offended, but if you are tell us why you think a class deserves a higher rating,\nbut keep in mind I've tried to compare all the classes together so I've attempted to\nbe as fair as possible. First up. Warrior. Classic class. Male. Uses a Longsword and a Shield and has a Greatsword\nas it's Awakening weapon, which is it's second weapon. Warrior is very good in 1v1 situations. It used to be a lot more tanky before it received\nsome nerfs, but it's received a few buffs recently that are putting warrior back on\ntrack to becoming a fairly decent class. Not as popular these days, but one of the\nOG classes. I like to call it the always dependable class\nand one of the classes with really good performance all around. It's PVE clear used to be one of the worst,\nbut nowadays every class clears okay and there are many different spots and different gear\nlevels you can grind in to find one that suits your style of play. It's not the fastest grinder, but it's much\nbetter than it used to be. Warrior has a high skill ceiling meaning once\nyou master this class you will be able to obtain some incredible mobility and pretty\ndeadly burst. It's currently outshined by some other classes\nthat do the tanky role better these days, but it is by no means unable at least try\nto play that role. Next up we have Valkyrie, Female. A Paladin-esque class that uses a Longsword\nand Shield and has a Lancia as it's Awakening weapon. Valkyrie is very good in 1v1 situations, but\nrequires mastery of the class to do well in pretty much all facets of play. PVE clear is mediocre, but she gets better\nthe more gear you have and they're able to use some support utility skills that can affect\nyour team members making her always nice to have in large scale pvp. Her heals aren't amazing, but they are still\nutility. Her defensive capability is quite strong,\nbut really where she shines is in her incredible burst potential. Skill ceiling isn't as high as Warrior, though\nit still takes a lot to master the class and once you do you will be feared by anyone you\ndeem unworthy. A good Valkyrie is like a comet when you see\nthem fight, it's kind of scary. They've been outshined by other classes that\ndon't need as much effort let's just say to play well, but recently she received some\nbuffs that have put Valkyrie in the direction of being something to look at seriously when\nchoosing a class to dedicate your time to. Next up we have Berserker. Male. Giant race class that uses Axes and an Ornamental\nKnot and a Iron Buster for it's Awakening. Berserkers are the typical high health high\ndamage hybrid tank esque class of Black Desert, but they require a lot of practice to do well\nin PVP situations. They are okay on 1v1 duels and average in\nlarge scale, though because of your high health and ranged CC you can become a sort of DP\nBerserker that Crowd Controls enemies and then sets up your teammates to get kills. It's not practical and it really only works\nin smaller pvp situations like 3v3 duels, but a good Berserker is a scary class. Just because they have high health though,\ndoesn't really mean they have inherently strong defenses. They're mobility at high skill levels are\ninsane and they're PVE clear is incredibly good overall. Berserker has many grabs and limited range\nthrough it's Awakening, but it's a class I'd say is really fun to learn and play at higher\nlevels.Warrior, Valkyrie, and Berserker kind of make up the tank role if you were to look\nat a trinity like MMO, but they don't end up playing that way because Black Desert is\njust a different game with no roles really. Ironically the mages who are usually squishy\nmake for some pretty good tanks in certain situations. Wizard and Witch. Let's start with Wizard. Male. Uses a Staff and Dagger and then Godr Sphera\nfor it's Awakening. Wizards and Witches play identically before\ngetting their second awakening. You can cast fire, ice, lighting storms. Chain lightning, heals, resurrect, but most\nimportantly they can cast a skill called Protected Area which makes them the most sought after\nguild wars class in the game. That skill amplifies your allies defenses\nby an obscene amount of a short amount of time which allows for pushes into enemy bases. In it's Awakening the Wizard uses Fire and\nWater elemental abilities and can summon an elemental pet, fire for melee. And water for ranged. The Wizard also has a lot of protected skills\nwhich means it is difficult to Crowd Control a Wizard, and his large AOE abilities make\ngrinding with wizard quite easy. He does struggle a bit at higher grind zones,\nbut overall he's one of the best grinders and absolutely a great class for newer players. He's downside is his complete failure at dueling. You can be successful in smaller 1v1 fights,\nbut the odds are greatly against you simply because Wizard and this go for Witch as well\nskills keep you rooted so it is very easy to grab and combo a Wizard and Witch. Despite them probably being the worst 1v1\nclasses in the game, they do make up for being one of the best PVE clearers and Guild War\nclasses. Witch. Female. Also uses a Staff and Dagger. But uses an Aad Sphera for her Awakening. She commands Earth and Lightning in her Awakening\nand is able to summon an Earth elemental for melee. And a Lightning elemental for ranged. I should note that both Witch and Wizard have\nskills that allow them to aggro over the mob limit so you can kill more monsters at a time. The Witch has a block that increases her resistances\nand her skills have slightly more ranges then Wizard. Wizard I forgot to mention has a grab instead\nof the block. very slow grab, and not very reliable. Because Witch and Wizard have the same pre-awakening\nskills they can both use Protected Area which makes Witch very sought after in Guilds for\nGuild Wars. PVE clear is very good as well, with struggling\na bit in high end zones, but again one of the best clearers in PVE and one fo the best\nclasses in Guild Wars. Both Witch and Wizard are not terribly difficult\nto learn, so they make for common choices for newer players. Witch and Wizard can become Defensive heavy\nwith gear and Witch specifically can be an annoying Crowd Control style class in smaller\nPVP that can absolutely do some damage even at lower Attack values. Next up we have the Sorceress, Female. Uses an Amulet and a Talisman. And uses a Scythe for her Awakening. Sorceress is a mobile dark magic user with\ndecent 1v1 potential thanks to having a lot of iframes, or invincibility frames. She isn't as useful in larger scale battles,\nbut her ultimate black hole ability is still very useful in group fights. She's been nerfed over time, so she's not\nas good as she used to be. Couple that with the fact that this class\ntakes a lot of time to master and play well, she becomes one of the most technical classes\nin the game. She has good potential and is quite good at\ngrinding, even at high end areas. Solid class overall, but I wouldn't say it\nis a new player friendly class since you need to practice a lot and then you need quite\na bit of gear to compete at high levels. When played well, though she's pretty much\nunstoppable. Next up we have Dark Knight, Female. Elven race. Uses a Kriegsmesser and an Ornamental Knot\nfor her weapons and a Vediant for her Awakening. Vediant is a magical glove that summon different\nsword shapes. Kriegsmesser is like a very long dagger. Dark Knight used to be the best class in the\ngame hands down, but has since been nerfed multiple times to now being in one of the\nweakest classes. That is not to say it's a terrible class. Dark Knight now requires a bit more resource\nmanagement, which adds to it's limitations and requires a certain mastery of the class\nto do well in PVP situations. It's fairly squishy class with decent mid\nrange AOE. It's mobility has recently been nerfed so\nshe's lost some mobility, but is by no means slow. Her PVE clear is still very good, even at\nhigh end areas and is a fairly simple class to learn if you are starting out. Dark Knight overalls is a shadow of it's former\noppressive self when it released over a year ago now, but it's still an okay class if you\nenjoy the playstyle and put the time and gear into it. Next up we have Tamer. Female. The Loli class I guess you would call it,\nthough you can customize a Tamer to be less childlike if you for some reason have a problem\nlolis. She uses a Shortsword and a Trinket for her\nWeapons. And the Celestial Bo Staff for her Awakening. Tamer is able to summon Heilang, a mystical\nwolf pet that she can ride on, unlike the Witch and Wizard pets. Heilang does a random Crowd Control when you\norder it to attack. That plus Tamer having one of the quickest\ngrabs in the game and incredible burst make her very deadly in 1v1 situations. She is still very squishy and very difficult\nto master. So one mistake and you are pretty much dead\nunless your opponent messes up or something. Her PVE clear is quite good at all areas of\nthe game since she is quite mobile and has good resource management. Like I said she is extremely difficult to\nlearn and master and is not great at all in larger scale fights, so you'll find yourself\nunable to really help. I guess it's worth mentioning she does have\na little bit of a party utility buff, but it's nothing really to depend on. She's a good class overall with it's obvious\nshortcomings, but we recent buffs she should be getting a little bit better moving forward. Tamer makes it the last of the Magic Damage\nusers. Those are Witch, Wizard, Sorceress, Dark Knight,\nand Tamer. THey all deal Magic Damage in their attacks,\neven if they use melee it will be considered Magic Damage. What this means is the next two classes will\nbe resistant to a portion of that damage since Striker and Mystic have inherent Magical Defenses. Let's start with Striker. Released was underpowered at the time. Male class. Uses a Gauntlet and a Vambrace as his weapons. And a Gardbrace as his Awakening weapon. Tanky thanks to it's magical defenses, but\ndidn't really put out a lot of damage when it first came out. Nowadays though they have great burst and\nvery good mobility. They're uniqueness comes from being able to\nsummon multiple clones or stands if you will through certain skills that deal damage alongside\nyou. They're PVE clear is very good, though because\nof their awkward mobility it can be cumbersome to grind in certain areas of the game, so\nhe is limited in that capacity. 1v1 he is quite strong if played well. And in large scale fights he has great AOE\nand can withstand a bit more than usual thanks to those magic resistances. Wouldn't say he's hard to play, so he does\nmake for a newer player friendly class. As for Mystic. Female. Also uses Gauntlets and Vambrace for her weapons\nand a Cestus for her Awakening. Her signature trait is the ability to summon\na water spirit dragon that does damage alongside her with certain skills. Tanky thanks to her magical resistances. Really good defensive skills. Quite mobile. Really resource recovery. Her damage isn't as high as a Striker, but\nher superior Crowd Control abilities make up for that. She's able to built like a Crowd Control bot\nwith super high defenses low attack, but able to attempt to Crowd COntrol enemies while\nyour teammates take them out. Her PVE clear is one of the best, if not the\nbest currently in most areas of the game. She's a bit harder to play than Striker, but\nI wouldn't say she was extremely difficult to master. Does take time, don't get me wrong but more\noften than not you should be favored in most matchups. If you want an answer to what is the strongest\nclass in the game overall. It would be Mystic. Some classes do better in some areas, but\nMystic does everything fairly well without requiring you to play for a long long time\nto master. Next up we have Musa. Male. Uses a Blade and a Horn Bow for his weapons. And a Crescent Blade for his Awakening. Musa is extremely mobile with large AOE abilities\nmaking him quite deadly at high gear levels. His PVE clear one of the best in the game. He's just fast and with large AOE abilities\nis able to dash from one pack to another killing them with one skill quite easily. He even does quite well at high end grinding\nareas with enough attack value. This makes him pretty decent in large scale\nbattles as a strong Musa can mow the lawn so to speak, mow down weaker players with\none skill essentially. Pretty cool to see to be honest. 1v1 is a bit tougher and requires quite a\nbit of practice and a level of mastery before you can start doing well. His Horn Bow is mostly a PVP tool, so don't\nexpect too much range just because he has a secondary weapon that is a bow. And overall, I'd say he's quite good, quite\nfun, certainly a good class to pick if you're new. Next up we have Maehwa, Female counterpart\nto Musa. Uses a Blade and Horn Bow for her weapons. And a Kerispear for her Awakening. Maehwa is also extremely mobile with conal\nAOE abilities. Her PVE clear isn't as great as Musa's, but\nstill quite good. Her mobility helps a lot with that. It will just depend on where you are grinding\nsince larger packs are slightly harder to hit with her conal aoe abilities. She has quite a bit of Crowd Control and is\ndecent at 1v1 situations, though as of late she's in need of some buffs to put her 4 stars. I believe those buffs are coming quite soon\nwhich is why I'm keeping her 4 stars for 1v1 situations, though keep in mind she takes\na lot of mastery to do well in pvp so it is certainly a skill reliant class if you have\nthe gear. In larger fights she struggles a bit since\nshe's a bit squishy. She's a good class overall and is fun like\nthe Musa, but you'll struggle if you come in with little knowledge about the game, so\nI wouldn't call her new player friendly. Next up we have the Ninja and Kunoichi. These are the assassin style classes you may\nbe familiar with from other MMOs. Ninja and Kunoichi both use Short Swords and\nKunai and Shuriken for their secondary weapon. Both classes can use either Kunai or SHuriken,\nthough abilities for Ninja are tied to the SHuriken and abilities for the Kunoichi are\ntied to the Kunai which is why you should use the appropriate ones for you class. We'll start with Ninja. Ninja uses a Sura Katana for his Awakening. Multiple katanas that he is able to use in\nhis Awakening skills. He is mobile in short distances and has some\npretty good combo damage. He is very difficult to learn and master,\nbut one of, if not, the most flashy looking classes in the game. They were recently nerfed a bit since they\nwere unable to be countered in some instances, so Ninjas are still one of the best 1v1 classes\nin the game. Their grind speed will be dependant on where\nyou grind, butis overall middle of the road. Ninjas aren't extremely useful in larger guild\nwar fights, but they're forte is 1v1 fighting and open world pvp. Kunoichi is very similar they share the same\nabilities pre-awakening. but Kunoichi, being the female counterpart\nto Ninja, uses a Sah Chakram instead as her Awakening weapon. This gives her slightly better PVE clear,\nbut overall is in a similar state to Ninja. Both Ninja and Kunoichi are able to go invisible\nand can get the jump on you in an open world scenario, making them favored as a classic\nassassin style evil karma character. Kunoichi has superior Crowd Control abilities\nto the Ninja. is difficult to learn and master and is one of the better 1v1 classes in the\ngame. Guild Wars wise she struggles a bit, but can\nbe somewhat useful as a Crowd Control bot if you are practiced enough. These two classes are not very beginner friendly,\nand Ninja is the more popular choice over Kunoichi, who is one of the least popular\nclasses in the game right now. Next up we have Lahn, Female. Uses a Crescent Pendulum, and a Noble Sword\nas her weapons with her Awakening being Crimson Glaives. God of War-esque. Lahn is probably the most underrated class\nin the game right now. They have the unique ability to fly for a\nshort duration. More like a glide really, but still pretty\ncool. They're AOE is decent and their PVE clear\nis quite good. Excellent resource management. Some good iframes. Ranged grab makes her potentially deadly in\n1v1 situations. Because she is so unpopular not many people\nknow how to fight a Lahn, so that more often than not becomes and advantage, but she is\nextremely squishy so one mistake or a bad damage trade will mean certain death. This also makes her not as potent in Guild\nWars since she can't really survive for long. Overall good class, though. I'd say she's not incredibly easy to learn,\nbut there is room for mastery there that can make you pretty strong in most aspects of\nthe game outside of Guild Wars. Next up we have Ranger. Female. Elven Race. Uses a Longbow and Dagger. And a Kamasylven Sword as her Awakening, which\nis just a longer dagger essentially. Ranger is strictly ranged pre-awakened before\nyou hit level 56. Then you become mostly melee with the use\nof the Kamasylven Sword. She's quite mobile presents a quick style\nof play. Her PVE clear is quite good, though her biggest\ndrawback is high resource consumption. Mana, though in my opinion not as bad as it\nused to be. But Stamina consumption was nerfed a while\nback and that is the more annoying aspect for most Ranger players. She has very good damage. 1v1 she can be deadly with enough gear. Past a certain attack value she will easily\none shot you if you let her CC you. I'd say she's not the easiest class to learn\nor master. It takes a lot of time and gear, but she offers\na different style of play that I personally find enjoyable. In terms of Guild Wars she's not very useful\nespecially at lower gearscores you won't be very effective. And it's important to note that her range\nskills are there, but she is not a pure ranged character, so keep that in mind. For pure Range you want to be looking at the\nfinal class we'll be talking about. Archer. Male. Elven Race. Uses a Crossbow and a Ra'Ghon, a Magic Glove\nas his weapons. And he uses a Greatbow for his Awakening. The only class to start with his Awakening\nso you don't need to level to 56 to get your second weapon. You start with it. His Range on some of his abilities is extreme. This class is still fairly new so not many\npeople have cracked the code so to speak to fulfill the full potential of this class,\nbut he is constantly getting buffs so he is without a doubt a strong class, we just don't\nknow how strong yet. Range is always powerful and he has a lot\nof it and his mobility is quite good as well as his resource management where he doesn't\nreally suffer too much like the Ranger does for example. PVE clear is very good in certain grind spots,\nbut it is reliant on grind areas and density so he can be a bit awkward to grind with till\nyou find a good rotation to use. 1v1 duels I'd say he is mediocre to good,\nwith these buffs recently he might be a bit better, but he'll really shine in guild wars\nwhere he can CC and deal damage from afar with the support of his teammates. Really interesting abilities as well, he has\none ability that is more novel than useful, but it uncovers any enemies in stealth and\nthen prevents them from using stealth for a brief window of time. Not very practical, but cool that he has something\nlike that. Not much else to say, but this class is the\nnewest class added to the game, so he will by sheer will of the devs be at least a decent\nclass moving forward till we get a new class as newer classes get more love and are usually,\nnot always, overtuned. And that's it from me for this 2019 guide. Went through the basics and the flavor of\neach class. Hopefully it gave you an idea what classes\nyou may want to check out. When in doubt play Witch or Wizard. Or Mystic or Striker. Simple as that. If you want to have fun and enjoy the game\nfor along time, try the classes out, see what you like and master the class regardless of\nfuture changes or the class ranking in the ever changing meta leaderboards.

Take care.", "QLEBfom0mhM": "- Today we're gonna find\nout which is the best, dirt cheap, hand grinder. What do we have here? Well, I went out, I went\nto Amazon, as you do, and I bought five hand grinders, and I thought they were a nice spread of what's available right now. So we have the Rhino Coffee\nGear, little hand grinder, we have the Porlex Mini,\nwe've got the classic, probably the bestselling cheap\nhand grinder of all time, which is the Hario Slim. On Amazon, the top search came out for the Henry Charles hand grinder. Never heard of that,\nno idea what that was, so I picked that up, and then I also went and saw what was very popular in the US, which is the JavaPresse. Pressay? Presse? Presse. And I picked up one of those as well. What I'm gonna do is break them\ndown into various categories and award them scores, and at end wrap up into what I would give\nas my recommendation of the best, cheap hand grinder out there. The sensible place to\nstart would be price, and there's some funny prices here, but that's Amazon for you. So the Rhino Coffee Gear\nwas 31 pounds and 64 pence. The Porlex, relatively\nexpensive at 57 pounds. Now I already owned this\nHario Slim, this is mine, but it would cost 28 pounds and 89 pence. The, what is it, Henry\nCharles thing, is 25,99, and the JavaPresse, we're\ngonna call it the JavaPresse, that is 70 pounds in the UK. Now here's an important\nthing I have to talk about right off the bat. I bought these knowing\nthey looked similar, but having had them turn up, they really do appear\ncompletely identical. I suspect they're gonna do\nvery similarly in testing. So a little bit frustrating\nthat they are so similar, that they are basically the same. I suspect exactly the same\nfactory put these out, with just two different brands on them. But that's what we've got. That's what we're testing today. And we're gonna take the\nbest one of these forwards into the next review of hand grinders, which is the ultimate hand grinder. Which is the very best hand\ngrinder that money can buy? And we'll see how a\ncheap grinder stacks up against the best in the world. Points-wise, more points for cheaper,\nin this situation. So I think it would be five, four, three, two and one point over here. Let's move into the next, and one of the most\nimportant categories for me, which is build quality. So starting with the Rhino Coffee Gear, it is well-intentioned, but I will say a little bit\nsloppy in its execution, in its build. Just feels a little cheap. And they've done things that are nice, like instead of just\nhaving the stainless steel slide onto another piece\nof stainless steel, there are these little\nplastic insert points here, so this should fit nice and snugly. However, down at the bottom here, this feels loose. It doesn't feel like it's\na particularly good fit. I know you're supposed to grip at the top, but it feels very easy to split the grinder\nwhen you're holding it, and that just doesn't feel fantastic. Stainless steel, as most of them are. Nice little rubber band. But just a little bit sloppy. And so onto the Porlex, which is pretty well-built, to be honest. Everything fits quite nicely. This is stainless steel\nonto stainless steel, but the parts fit well. Same with the base. It feels secure. It goes in deep enough that it doesn't feel like\nit's gonna move around. Overall, yeah, pretty well built. Now, the Hario is unusual here because it is a plastic construction. For better or worse, is different to the\napproach of the others. It means this chamber is all see-through. This is a robust plastic. I've traveled with these\nall around the world. I don't particularly\nworry about damaging it, but does it feel as\nnice as stainless steel? Well actually to me, it kind of does. Now if you really prefer\nstainless steel, that's fine. There's nothing particularly\npremium to me about that kind of brushed stainless steel, and there's nothing\nparticularly premium about this kind of plastic. It's well-built, it all\nfits together neatly. This screws into place, I\nsuppose, which is a nice aspect, instead of sliding or clicking on. It's much more secure in its build. But it's plastic. Now the Henry Charles, well, it's okay. It's not bad. It's light. It's not a particularly, it doesn't feel particularly strong. There's a little plastic insert here. I don't really know why, I don't know why you'd put a window there, but we'll talk about that\nwhen it comes to usability. Overall, yeah, entirely fine. It doesn't feel expensive. It doesn't feel like a\nparticularly thick gauge. This, little slidey. I can't imagine it falling off, but it's not secure in that regard, and to be honest, the\nJavaPresse is identical in every single way. So for that round I'll award\nthe Porlex five points, the Hario Slim four, the two identical, the Henry\nCharles and the JavaPresse, I'll give them both three points, and the Rhino Gear, I thought,\nwas just the sloppiest build so I'll give that two. One of the main reasons\npeople buy these things is to travel with them. I certainly had one in my luggage as I've traveled around the\nworld, and stayed in Airbnbs, and just wanted to make\nsome coffee in the morning. So how do they all do for portability? And so, bringing them\nall back for a second, well, we need to talk about size. Now this thing, the\nRhinowares is the biggest, which is probably the least\ndesirable in a portable grinder, and the Porlex is by far the smallest. Now the neat thing\nabout the Porlex is that the rubber band comes with a place for you to store your crank handle, because otherwise that's just\ngonna float around freely, as it would do with every other grinder. There's nowhere to put these\nwhen you take them off. You need to take them off for traveling. So that's a bit frustrating. This rubber band is a nice,\nlittle detail on the Porlex that really ups its portability. Again, plastic construction\nmeans I worry a lot less, throwing this thing in a bag, about what not only is hitting it, but what it might be hitting. I don't really worry\nabout damage that way, or I might worry a little bit more about throwing something\nstainless steel into a bag with other potentially fragile things. I'm a sloppy and hurried packer of things. I'll admit it. These two, yeah, fine. Perfectly portable. Somewhere in the middle. So, probably the most points\nagain are five for the Porlex, I'd go a four for the Slim, three points apiece here, and again, just two points to our friend\nthe Rhino coffee grinder. For the next part of testing we're gonna do the obvious thing. We're gonna grind. We're gonna brew some coffee. This will let us do\nboth usability testing, how do they feel to use,\nas well as taste testing, at the end of that. We're gonna grind at\ntwo different settings. We're gonna grind firstly to brew a 20 to 330-style pour-over. And I'm gonna go a little finer and aim for a faster brew time. There's always an issue with\nuniformity in hand grinder, especially cheap hand grinders, and going a little finer\nand faster, by and large, for me is a better way to get a better tasting\nbrew than going coarser and dealing with the much,\nmuch, much larger pieces that come with that. However, I do wanna grind a bit coarser to see at what point the grind\ndistribution falls to pieces. So now let's grind a lot of coffee. So we brewed five cups of coffee and in that time it's given me a chance to get my head around these\ngrinders a little bit more from a usability perspective, and there's a few things\nI want to talk about. So let's start at the\nbeginning with the Rhino. It's hopper holds around\n30 grams of coffee, which isn't the biggest of them. It's actually the second smallest of them. The smallest actually is the Porlex, which held only about 25 grams, which actually might be an issue for me. Now I would brew when traveling\nup to a 1/2 liter batch, so 30 grams to every 500. This would frustrate me at 25, which is really where it topped out. However, it felt very nice to use. The handles on all of them were fine. The Hario holds up to about 40 grams of coffee in the top hopper, and actually the shape with the wider top, makes it much, much, much easier\nto fill, which is a bonus. However, when you are grinding, it can feel like the beans inside are sloshing around in there,\nand you're just worrying that the beans aren't\nfunneling down the way that they would do with slimmer grinders. There wasn't a massive\nissue in grind time, though I got stuck a few\nmore times with the Hario. That was interesting to me. These two here, may as well talk about\nthem as if they're one. They both hold about 40 grams too. Shape, style, fine. Now, the bottom of these has the little window. I have no idea why you\nwould put a window in. I get that with plastic, it's plastic. I can just see in, and that's nice. Why would I not make it\nsee-through if it's plastic? But here, adding in another piece actually is kind of annoying. One, because I don't need to\nsee how much coffee's in there or if there's coffee in there. I'm gonna put all the\ncoffee I need in the top, grind it and then use it. So I don't get the point of a window. But the way that it's constructed, one, you've got another breakable. Two, something that's a\nlittle bit harder to clean. I'd rather everything be stainless steel, if it's gonna be stainless steel or everything be plastic, if it's plastic. But also the way that it's mounted inside the stainless steel. There's this ridge around the edge, and coffee was getting\nstuck in that little ridge, fines would accumulate there. So, all in all I did not\nlike the construction inside of that thing. When you look at them, it looks like they're all\nusing an identical burrs head. The burrs look very,\nvery similar in terms of their teeth configuration,\ntheir cutting edges. The Hario's is a different color. The rest of them are\nthese white, ceramic ones. This is a grayish, darker ceramic color. They all are stepped. They all have clicky adjustments. However, the Rhino's\nsteps were much smaller, so you could be more\nprecise with this one. The rest of them were\nreally pretty similar. And then I brewed them. So like I said, 20 grams to\nabout three, three, three of water in the top, so 60\ngrams per liter, as a ratio. All of them brewed and drew\ndown in a very similar time. The Hario was a little bit\nquicker, which was interesting 'cause I'd wondered if I\nwas grinding finer on it, because I got caught a few more times. I got a little bit stuck\ngrinding a couple more times on the Hario. I wondered if that was\n'cause I was going finer, but actually it drew down\nfive or 10 seconds quicker. These have all been sitting, cooling down, getting ready for me to taste. And I'm gonna be tasting\nfor a couple of things. Obviously, I want it to be good, the coffee that's coming\nout of these things, but I'm really considering\nuniformity of grounds, and so an uneven extraction from very different particle sizes would manifest in both\nunpleasant bitterness as well as unpleasant sourness. So the very tiny pieces you\nmight get would contribute in terms of bitterness, the very coarse, bouldery pieces will make\nthe brew taste extra sour. They all brewed in a very\nsimilar time, as I said, so we should have\nrelatively matching cups. Same bloom, same total pour time. All of those kind of\nthings were consistent. So, now it's time to taste. Hmm. Hmm. So I'll say now the range between\nthe best and the worst isn't huge. Not shocking 'cause the price\nrange isn't particularly wide in these things, but\nthe worst to the best, not an enormous gap. All of these coffees are okay. Nothing is wow! Nothing is undrinkably\nterrible or hugely problematic. These have a sort of souriness from, you know, it tastes\nlike there're a few more bigger pieces that didn't\nreally play the game as much. This is just a little weaker, just a little less\nextracted than the others, so it would stand to reason\nthat I was maybe a touch coarser than I thought I was on this. It doesn't have that,\na bunch of it was okay and then a bunch of it was really coarse. It has, everything was\njust a little coarse, and fining it up would make it okay. Make a good, decent cup of coffee. These are the best two cups for me. I'm aware that tasting in this manner is deeply, deeply unscientific\nand not particularly good, especially when they\ntaste as close as they do. They're really, really\nvery, very similar cups. I might say this and then you\ncould switch the cups around and I might say that. Really not much in it. Both decent, quite sweet. Not too much sourness. Really not too much bitterness either. Does it compare to an EK43? Does it compare to even the Wilfa Uniform? No. You can definitely tell there's\na spread of particle sizes. That is somewhat inevitable\nwith cheaper hand grinders. This is where the better coffees were. This was sort of in the middle, and then this, these two, this grinder, they're kind of the same thing, right, was the least tasty of them for me. I would be happy to travel with these. I've certainly happy to travel with this, or have been in the past. These, whoa. Not quite as much. So let's award maximum points, medium points, less points over here. It's summary time. So on paper the Porlex wins it. On build, on portability, on grind quality. But, that capacity, it might\nbe a sticking point for me, and someone else watching this. It just might be a little too small. The Rhinoware I liked a lot,\nthe better grind control, the good quality of grinds for the price. Yeah, it's a good little grinder. Again, not huge capacity, but good. Little bit cheaper, the Hario. It's the middle-of-the-road all-rounder. There's a reason this is\nso incredibly popular. I actually like the plastic construction. There's advantages to the shape. For the money, it grinds pretty well. It's not a surprising, popular choice. These two here, if it's at this price, if it's 25,99, and I think\nin the US it is much cheaper for the JavaPresse, then it's just, you getting what you pay for. It's not very good. It has a bunch of frustrations for me, in terms of the build. It didn't produce great-tasting coffee. I'm not an enormous fan of this. I probably wouldn't recommend these. I think there are better\noptions at a cheaper, or a higher, price. So on paper, probably the Porlex takes it. Little bit more thoughtful, but certainly a little bit more expensive. But I will say that at\nthis kind of price point, there just aren't enormous\ndifferences in the quality of grind that you're getting, so you may want to consider\nsome other factors. These were bought thanks to\nthe support of my Patreon. If you want to be involved,\nI'd love to see you there. The support means I can\ngo and buy these products, not have to rely on manufacturers, and I can tell the truth. I can tell you what I\nlike and what I don't. All of these will be given away now, including the one that I\nbought myself some time ago, but I'll give it away too. These are gonna go to Patreon backers, who've entered a little competition, and they'll be getting an\nemail from me very soon, letting them know who's won, and little packages of delight,\nincluding these grinders, will be going in the mail to them. What we'll do is we will\ntake the Porlex forwards to the next round, and the next round is gonna be the ultimate hand grinder showdown. Budget's irrelevant here. We're gonna buy the best\nhand grinders we can, we're gonna compare them,\nand see how they compare to something that wins the cheap category. Let me know your thoughts\nthen on the comments below. Let me know a grinder\nthat I cannot miss in that ultimate hand grinder showdown. As always, thank you so much for watching.

don't have a burr grinder maybe they only have a blade grinder now we said blade runs are bad because they're not nearly as good as burr grinders but I'll take a blade grinder over pre-ground coffee any day of the week and what we can do with that kind of three-stage hack is improve the quality of coffee coming out of a blade grinder quite dramatically these hacks will go from pretty simple through to something you maybe don't want to get caught doing by another family member [Music] make sure that when you've grinding in a blade grinder you don't just let the burst spin and just hold down the button but you regularly stop and shake up the grounds in there this will help ensure the evenness of the grounds that you're getting out of this thing it really does make quite a large difference it's a quick thing but it is pretty useful coffee in and then as you're grinding [Music] now you're going to have to eyeball this to the about the ground size that you want what I would say is that chances are they maybe don't have a great brewing setup this kind of a grind method works really well with things like a French press especially with the French press technique to get pretty good results for lots of people in the morning so at this point your grounds are okay right they're better than they would be if you just let the whole thing run for a while you'd have some super fine pieces which you don't want to need to have some very large pieces that you don't want so here the ground is a little uneven but it's it's okay so on to the second stage most kitchens have a sieve in them and the sieve is your friend right now we're not worried about the super fine pieces were actually worried about the much larger pieces those kind of Boulder sized pieces and not the fines so very quickly all you're gonna do is just sift the grounds you've got what you'll see is that most of it will go through and you'll be left with just those big bouldering pieces and what we're gonna do with those is just grind those again right we're going to take those down find out on their own so here still quite a lot of coffee needs to be ground again [Music] so here we're at the point of diminishing returns I would probably not keep going and going and going and going I just probably grind ten fifteen percent more coffee than I might need for my brew because what I've got here at this point is actually pretty uniform but we can go further so we've taken care of the big pieces but what about the fines now this is the thing that maybe you're going to look a little weird in front of family members doing but chances are they've got paper towel in their kitchen and this stuff is really useful this is a hack taught to me by Ben Kaminsky all you're gonna do put your grounds onto your paper towel spread them around a little bit gonna rub them into the paper and that's it you're going to decant these back into whatever you're going to brew with or another Bowl because what happens is that those super fine pieces get stuck on the paper and you get rid of them that way so what we've got on the end of all this is not the most uniformly ground coffee but actually it's really really pretty good there's a little tiny bit of waste it's a little bit of extra effort and frankly that's why we buy bur grounders but if you have to make the best coffee you can with a blade grinder in a house this is how to do it so that's it that's how you can get really pretty good grounds out of a blade grinder it's a little extra work no doubt and that's frankly why we buy fur grinders but we've got the holidays coming up maybe your whole family expects you to make amazing coffee because they know you're into coffee but they don't give you the tools to do it but here a couple of quick hacks to get the best possible grounds out of a blade grinder as always thank you so much for watching let me know your thoughts in the comments down below have a great day [Music]", "VMM8h0RzshA": "[Music] hey pups and peeps Sanji woods with dog psychology 101 today my son josh is gonna assist me and helping trim dog nails we're gonna introduce you to some concepts that maybe you haven't thought about before most people get in a hurry and they try to wrangle the dog they're trying to hit the moving nail we're gonna talk about cooperate and participate they should trust you enough to give you their little paw now hang with us and let's watch all right you guys may notice that Parker is wearing a basket muzzle so he's a nervous fearful kind of guy and he he may try to bite during his nail trim so this is for his safety now I'm a big fan of basket muzzles because as you see they don't hold his mouth closed it doesn't feel quite as unnatural so in he's not stressed out about it we weren't really hard making this a positive experience for him so it's a tool that you could certainly implement yourself hi I'm Josh woods with dog psychology 101 and I'm gonna be helping with Parker a little bit today giving some tips on nail trimming pretty important thing we did with a lot of dogs who have had bad experiences met with nail trims and when that has happened first things first we have to earn their trust in general you know it's not a great feeling it's understandable why they would be apprehensive and so most dogs are gonna know what the nail trimmers are first thing is let them smell the dough the nose as we know for a dog is the key to everything let them investigate don't try to hide it from him he's he's going to see that the nail clippers are here so what we're gonna be looking for is when he becomes nervous about something whether it's the nail trimmers coming into the environment it's touching the feet beginning to isolate a toe to trim the nail when we see him become sensitive nervous anxious or worried you stop and you slow down so let's say for instance you see how he avoids but the nails members down we try to make him feel a little better get into a better place and Parker knows what's going on he's wise to this he's not in a good state of mind before we begin he's never gonna let us trim the nail because the whole goal is for him to allow us to do it even though he doesn't enjoy it that's a big part of trust so first I would sort of lift the leg now this is a big part of it don't grab the leg don't pull the foot don't squeeze the foot those are big no nose that makes you want to retract and pull so first is getting him to let us hold his leg hold his current so here let's embrace him let's get him stabilized then we can bring the foot up normal Venice touch thing let's try to desensitize a little bit it's okay these little touches with our fingertips relax one of the common mistakes that we do is they retract the foot we want to grab it and squeeze it that's a big no-no one technique rather than grabbing like Josh mentioned is to actually put a hand or your thumb behind the elbow so that when you push it out it extends his leg this way there is no squeezing on the foot they're gonna try not to forcing one nail at a time make it a good thing there we go yeah make some love attach to this as you'll see there ah we can still disagree with him pulling his foot back so he knows that it's not something we wanted to do it's like these are the moments we stop we gather you can't continue in a panic then he'll associate the panic to getting his nail trim the next time you come to trim these nails it's gonna be worse a lot of people have questions about black nails you can't see the quick quite as readily in a black now but if you can flip this nail over there's actually a little hollow side and if you take note there's also a skinny tip here so we just want to take that tip and work our way up a little bit once we start trimming the nail a little bit Parker's nervous say Josh is doing a good job keeping them in line so once we trim it only take a little and when we're working with the dog who's having male trouble we don't need to trim all of the nails at one time we can slow things down but the black nails once we start trimming those if you can actually look at the tip of the blight now as the quick that's coming you'll see a little dot that little dot is the quick itself so once you begin to see that you want to stop it's the most important thing in my opinion is patience and not even really setting expectations about how far we're going to go that is gonna be determined by the dog make your skills if you're if this is something new for you which probably is the case is we have to leave this in a good way for him you know so put yourself in his position this this is a big part of everything that I do with the dog I try to understand their feelings where they're coming from we'll put it in human world what if we go get a manicure and they quick us do you want to get another manicure or at least from that place is it was a pleasant or was it not so Parker has obviously had some bad experiences it's been uncomfortable he's probably been forced to do it and so I can't blame them for being reactive the only way we're gonna get back to this is he has to trust me if it takes me 30 minutes just to have a session of him allowing me to touch his foot that's what we're gonna begin the nail actually clipping the nails the last thing I'm concerned about and so there have been many dogs it takes many visits just to get a flip finished we will get to the point in the future where we can trim all the nails right now it's it's earned the trust that bust step by step don't rush this is the biggest thing I can say we look we look for the future is all about doing things and the the pleasant nice way to put the dog we're gonna use our compassion here patience is key we're gonna relax Trust is earned okay everybody I'm back now wasn't that insightful it's not about the goal of getting the nails trimmed it's actually about the goal of rehabbing your dog through the nail trim

next time", "0Xn8t1OHmyk": "can you cut wood with an angle grinder it's a good question the short answer is yes definitely long answer is yes but it's sort of unsafe and kind of tricky that's what we're talking about in this episode of the honest carpenter show if you want to cut wood with an angle grinder you need the right blade grinders are usually used for cutting metal and masonry those blades tend to have abrasive edges with no teeth that's not gonna do much to would a company called Graff reached out to me recently it sent me their speed cutter blade specifically designed for wood cutting it just has three large tungsten carbide teeth in this slightly odd wheel shape it's basically designed to handle the stress of wood cutting with a grinder see grinders spin crazy fast typically 11,000 to 12,000 rpm compare that to a circular saw which does about 5,000 rpm and you can see where the speed stress comes from when cutting with a grinder so the blade seemed right for cutting wood but grinders present other problems for wood cutting as well the biggest issue is that they're completely free hand circular saws have a sole plate and you can put rip fences on them so they create stable surfaces to cut on but grinders don't have any of that you just sort of hold the tool with your hands and direct it at the cut line there are some wood cutting applications where they work really well but there are others where there's sort of just the liability so let's go through the process of cutting with one but I'll say right now this is a dangerous tool never work without supervision if you're uncomfortable and all grinder work you take on is at your own risk grinders have a half guard like a fender and you always want this directed down to protect your fingers but you want to angle it up enough that you can let the blade sink into the material in a comfortable position you typically rotate them by depressing a little catch behind the guard you get that set where you want now you need your blade installed the right way the big thing is that you want the teeth pointing in the direction that the tool spins then will usually be a little arrow on the grinder indicating spin orientation and one on the blade as well make sure these are pointing in the same direction so the teeth are engaging head-on and be sure the blade is securely tightened and that you always unplug the tool when changing blades really big rules here always hold the tool out away from yourself when you turn it on or handle it live this is an exposed blade with no spring back guard what it touches it will cut you have to exercise extreme caution when working with a grinder when cutting wood I think you should always mark a cut line it gives you something to follow then be sure to hold the tool with both hands out in front of you the best way to make these cuts I've found is use the blade guard as a pivot you can set the bottom edge of the guard on the material you want to cut now you can use it for stability as you slowly rotate the blade down into the stock another difference from circular saws that grinders cut on the pool the blade teeth spin down towards the floor rather than up at the ceiling so it can actually be easier to start your cut at the far end of the piece and draw it back towards you this still doesn't make the process very smooth or easy it's hard to keep the cut square so you may wind up with a mitered edge and the blade doesn't cut very deeply because it's not that big so if you have a thicker stock like this 1-inch PVC trim I'm cutting your blade might or might not be able to get it all in one pass you might have to flip the stock to finish the cut so yes you can technically cut wood like this with a grinder if it's the only tool you have at hand you can very carefully make cuts even if they aren't as clean as circular saw or miter saw cuts where grinders really shine has more to do with wood shaping by holding the blade flat again with both hands at all times you can use the leading edge to pare away and lightly gouge wooden surfaces you can see the depth I'm creating on this piece of plywood as new layers are revealed the blade basically goes through the material like butter anybody looking for more carving capacity could work wonders with a wood cutting bit in a grinder it takes away material in a smooth almost delicate touch it can be helpful for notching as well with a lot of careful control you can create grooves of various depths and hog out material with the blade I'll warn though your hands can get flayed from wood chips flying out so be smarter than me here and use gloves to make your cut the other thing I'll note is that this particular speed cutter blade from Graf is designed to also cut aerated concrete blocks I don't have much need for that but I thought it would work well on hardy board siding something that I've cut with grinders before and sure enough handle that application perfectly for that reason alone I think it could be worth having one of these blades on hand I want to thank Graf for sending the blades out I think they're by far the best wood cutter blades for grinders that anybody has produced yet they're a really good product and I'll link it below if you're interested but I'll stress again if you're going to tackle this yourself be careful grinders don't mess around they'll cut through fingers faster than wood so keep all digits and body parts and clothing far away from the blade wear safety gear and make sure the tool has time to spin down completely before you set it aside I hope this video was helpful let me know what you saw it down in the comments and be sure to check back in for more videos soon I made some James with the honest carpenter

as it helps you dial in the grind size to an ideal setting for each bean you are using if you need to take two hopper off for any reason you can do so without being spilling all over the place by using the stock gate feature on the hopper this also comes in handy when dialing in your grind size since it is not a good idea to adjust the grind size without the birds moving you can waste a lot of beans if you don't have a hopper with a soft gate feature the Flourens on OS 64 Evo has a wide catch tray that keeps loose grounds from falling onto your counter with the catch tray in place it will catch most of the grounds that miss the portafilter can then easily dump the caught grounds into a sink or disposal container rest your portafilter on the portafilter rests and let the grinds fall directly into it you can even push the portafilter up against the switch to activate the grinder the grinder allows you to dose with the single-shot button a double shot button or manually grind times

probably have one of these members mark peppercorn grinders or sea salt grinders and I've been trying to open this up for a few days and just put on work um so today I thought of trying a different method I feel the cup with hot water mine was about 150 degrees Celsius and I converted an empty bottle in there like that as long as the water covers the black top part of the container and after about a minute so I took it out drain the water and just take a regular tea spoon down under the rim and pop it right open like this alright I hope this helped you um as much as we can we try to reduce reuse and recycle hope you like this video thank you", "U3V2bEERk4s": "today I've spent a fair amount of time doing anything but forging there's been some grinding projects I've been cleaning up the adzes that I hardened and tempered the other day I ground some froze get them ready to go out and I've been doing that kind of stuff and then this afternoon I took a little time off to put some more brick on my floor but I've used up the last of my brick but I haven't really done much for work and I thought I was going to get back to our filing vise project but it's about the end of the day and that doesn't look like it's going to happen so I thought I would answer some viewer questions about my grinders so let's take a look at the grinders specifically the belt grinders I have three of them two of them are two by 72s which are the most common belt grinders most knife makers belt grinders you're going to buy or the plans that people go off of to make we're on a 2 by 72 belt and they're very handy and very easy to come by one of them is commercial grinder one of them I made and then there is three by hundred and thirty-two and these numbers refer to the belt size it's a three inch wide belt and it takes a hundred and thirty two inches to go all the way around there's a lot of belt surface here and this is a big aggressive grinder but let's start with the commercially purchased grinder the one I have had the longest and I will tell you a little bit about it what it is and some of why I like it or why I don't like it this machine is a wilted square wheel belt grinder and I will explain why they refer to it as a square wheel in a minute I bought this by 30 years ago and it has been an absolute workhorse in the shop this was not my first belt grinder my first one was a really cheap homemade one using a little work arbor and a little idler stand that was all bolted to a workbench and that going to work but this one was a real step up although not the best knife grinder in my opinion part of the reason for that is because it is a fixed speed grinder it only has the one drive and it's fast this runs at four 300 surface feet per minute so that's not quite 60 miles an hour that this thing is running now you can put a smaller wheel on here I've seen some people that I don't know if they're available commercially or if you have to have it made but you can put a smaller Drive wheel on and that will slow this down you can also buy a variable speed motor forum but that's considerably more expensive and I'm not sure if that's still an option on them or not but it's a fairly simple machine it's got a lever that reduces the tension this wheel drives the belt this is the idler wheel that adjusts the tracking of the belt in and out and a contact wheel and the contact wheel is where you do your grinding your it's always covered by the abrasive belt so you're not actually grinding on the rubber wheel but this is a 1/8 inch serrated wheel it is a very aggressive wheel those serrations really make for a faster brine and it's pretty darn nice now it's not the only possibility you have you can take this wheel off everything on here adjusts with this one allen wrench but you do have to have the Allen wrench so you either don't lose it or buy an extra one and then you can put this attachment on there are probably other attachments that people have made that's this is all I have and this is what it comes with or came with I should say and this is why they call it a square wheel grinder this attachment here makes it look like the front wheel is square and this has to be really cranked down to keep it from moving you can tighten up the belt and this is the square wheel but what it really is is an inch and a half wheel a three inch wheel and a platen a platen is a flat surface where you can grind that's where you're most likely going to work on knife blades to grow knife blades and profile and things like that but I don't use it that much because I don't make nice too often I use the contact wheel the serrated contact will most of the time on this grinder but this attachment is very versatile you have the platen so you can grind flat surfaces and you can set a bevel on that if you put the tool rest on it and put a tool rest in here they don't use this very often but then you can set set angles to get to specific angles you can also run this forward and use just that inch and a half contact wheel or you can turn it all the way around and use just the three inch contact wheel to grind on or you can put it in this configuration and you have a slack belt so if you're trying to get something that's got a concave or convex surface you can work on that and it's unsupported and that does a real nice job of that so that's a very handy thing so this one attachment gives you five different there should be four different options for grinding on and the fifth one is the contact wheel and you could buy different size contact wheels for this there's the single speed one horsepower motor like I say you could buy a variable speed motor for it at one point they were available with them I don't know if they still are this is the lever that controls the tension and it's just fixed Stairsteps pretty simple and pretty effective this controls the tracking this is one of the things I like the least about it to control the tracking you have to use the allen wrench I would rather have some kind of a novel on there but in the thirty years I've owned it I guess it hadn't been important enough for me to take it apart and put a knob on there so maybe it's not that big a deal last I heard this grinder was no longer being made and sold by Wilton it is now being made by jet so they're imported grinder but as far as I know it's virtually the same grinder still comes with the same attachments the same options and the people I know that have them seem to think they're pretty good machines the Wilton's lasted me for thirty years the original motor I have replaced the bearings in this contact wheel twice and the bearings in these contact well actually the entire wheels because it's easier to buy the wheel with the bearings in them I've replaced once on the smaller ones so there has been a little maintenance but the motors original nothing else is needed maintaining you just blow it out with an air compressor every now and then it works just fine this grinder is another two by seventy two belt grinder this is one I made so there's it's not specific to anybody's plans it is based on the kmg grinder and their plans it's not exactly like the kmg the AMG is made by Beaumont Metalworks and you can buy the finish grinder or you can buy lots of component parts and that's one of the reason I I made this grinder this is how you adjust the tension is you slave the arm in and out and it's got a spring here and that that's what holds the tension tracking wheel is this wheel up here to adjust the belt left to right but these arms are what makes this grinder so nice if I don't want this attachment I can take it off and I can put a plantain in and this platen will do essentially what the other one will it's got the flat platen I can take this plate off and I can grind unsupported between the wheels but this is a little harder to change because you do have to take the bolts off and take this all the way off where is the other one you just spin it in a circle and do something different with it but it's still a very functional very useful platen these are aluminum wheels they're not really contact wheels for grinding against you could a little bit but rubber wheels would mean it could be v ground against but this is the way beaumont sells the platen and it can either just bolt to the arm or you buy separate arms to put that on and you could make your own platen and i think i could adapt the square wheel platen to fit this now this arm i've actually got two things going on here one of them is I have a contact wheel on it and this is probably what I use the most on this grinder is an eight-inch wheel again it's like the eight inch wheel on the square wheel except this one is smooth so it's a smoother grinder this is more for finished work so that's the big normal and this other attachment is what's called a small wheel attachment and usually I don't leave it on here but when I'm doing the ads as they end up going back and forth some because I need a little wheel and these just pop in this is really handy but I use these little wheels and these different contact wheels are easy to swap out and change and just get different radiuses you buy these from half-inch up to two inches in probably quarter inch increments and it's very handy for doing a lot of special things our Halfpenny scroll starter that I'm making that's how I'll grind the the inside of that to clean that up there's a contact will fit just fine in there and again you're not grinding on the rubber you're grinding on the sanding belt that's running across the rubber now this big wheels got a fairly good sized bearing in it these little wheels have little itty-bitty bearings in them so you can't run these very fast you need to run them slow and you don't run them for a long time because they heat up and they'd be bad for them but that's one of the advantages of this machine is it is a somewhat variable speed it doesn't not infinitely variable but somewhat variable three-speed is what it is and I will show you that in just a minute here's another thing that is a Beaumont Metalworks invention this is a quite imaginative and I don't use it as much as I would like to or as I thought I would but I think it's still got a lot of potential for a lot of things and they refer to this as a rotary platen as this belt drives on here it drives this belt that supports and that belt can be tensioned separately to to make this firmer or softer and as you rotate this you can bring different belts with different spacings forward to get a different curve so it's a pretty handy thing very expensive thing which is why I kind of wish I used it more but if you need something like that it's just the ticket but anyways back to the fact that this is a variable-speed machine it's also quick to change the wheels and you can buy wheels at any size I've got an 8 inch and I've got a 4 inch and someday I'll probably buy a 6 and I think you but a 2 on here as well so you can get a 2 for the small wheel attachment or you can put a 2 actually on the regular axle here this one does have a knob for the tracking adjustment so that's handy it's a quick and easy to change the tracking the speed control is just done with a simple belt and you change from three different options on the step pulleys I run it usually in the middle or the lowest setting because I use this more for finish grinding and even on the fast setting it is slower than the square wheel I don't know what it is exactly but it is still about half the speed probably on the lowest setting here and this is a one and a half horse motor on this I will probably make this one variable speed before I make the square wheel variable speed because it would be a lot easier on the homemade grinder to adapt a three-phase motor with a variable speed drive a variable frequency drive that would control the speed and those three-phase motors actually use that way actually run on single-phase 220 it's kind of confusing but the the VFD is actually a phase converter so it's a pretty nice way to go but again kind of pricey when I keep a bucket of water handy under the grinder and this collects most of the grinding dust and gives me a place to cool parts off but this chute here goes to a dust collector so I do have a dust collector in here but in spite of those two things that take care of most of the dust you should always wear a respiratory protection because there's still airborne dust and there's nothing healthy about breathing grinder dust either the abrasives from the belt or the metal dust neither one of those is good so we're a good respirator and hearing protection now this is the monster grinder it's the big one this is not what I built but it is shop built or home home made however you want to look at it and it's one a friend built with components that he got from somebody else and disassembled that original grinder and the first person that had these parts passed away so my friend kind of inherited the parts and he rebuilt it into this and then decided it was just more grinder that he needed but this thing will grind froze axes adzes and do the rough grinding super fast it's a forty three inch by 14 inch serrated contact wheel and it runs at about 5600 surface feet per minute so this really is running at 60 miles an hour that's quite the fast grinder I do have another arm that'll take 2 inch wheels but there's not a lot of attachments of this it's not the way I use it it's a rough grinder it's just for hogging material off in a hurry now somebody out there has already noticed that this industrial grinder the one that's commercially made and is sold to industry where there are unions and safety rules has all sorts of guards on it so you can't get your fingers in the belt and that's pretty nice but the homemade grinders don't have guards somebody's freaking out about that and they're gonna put a comment down there it says you need a guard on your grinder well I'm going to tell you that most two by seventy-two belt grinders out there today do not have guards on them Bader doesn't have a guard on theirs and they are probably one of the best knife making belt grinders out there kmg doesn't put a guard on their commercial the model that they make to sell none of the other grinders out there that are sold as knife maker grinders or to the home shop and have guards on them it's not really that big a deal this isn't something that's going to suck your hand in the danger with these is on coarser belts that you can cut yourself the edge of the belt is sort of like a spinning saw blade so you've got to be careful it's not a huge danger you you get close to that you get out of it really fast it's to cut a finger off would be nearly impossible with it and the odds of getting your fingers stuck in here like this are really really slim and probably it'd break the belt if you did and it just isn't like a lot of other rotating machinery yes a guard would probably be nice but I'm not worried about it if you're worried about it you want one put a guard on your machine if they scare you too much don't want one it's very simple anything that I do in my shop that you think isn't safe don't do it in your shop I do it because I'm comfortable with it I've got the experience with it I've been using that grinder for 30 years I've had homemade grinders of various sorts for most of the time in between then and now and this is a good grinder like I say the debater b3s which are kind of the standard and what everybody is more or less copying with these doesn't have the guards either so it's not that big a deal you're liable to grind your knuckles on these it hurts but the odds are getting down to bone or really slim unless you're really trying to stick your finger in there that'd be hard to do but like I say cut it cutting yourself and that's really a land of course belts I've hit my my finger on these finder belts and it just doesn't hardly even scrape them so it's a theoretical risk more than a big thing but be careful be aware of what you're doing don't have any distractions when you're using a grinder like this and you should be just fine a couple of things that help with the these grinders at times one is a big eraser this is sold as a grinding belt eraser and it helps get the junk that's clogs up the belts especially if you're working with wood if you're doing knife handles this will help your belts last longer because it will the junk out from between the grit the other thing is a kind of a grease stick and it helps lubricate it I don't use it a lot but if you're doing finish work on knives it might be nice because it does make the belt grind a little bit cooler and it runs just a little bit smoother by putting this grease on it ase hanging on the wall up here lots of belts I go from 36 grit belts up to a thousand grit belt and then I've got some scotch brite and cork polishing belts and I've got a set of belts at various grits that I keep just are doing handles because they last quite a bit longer for doing wood than they do for doing metal so I be as those same belts over and over again I can do a few dozen handles before I have to replace those belts and yes these are great for working wood although you can burn wood with them you can scorch it by leaving it on here too long especially in the finer grits but a 36 grit belt on a belt grinder will shape a hammer hammer handle in nothing flat as with anything in the shop that has tension or pressure when you're done for the day you should take the pressure off of it whether that's pressurized gas lines or the tension on your belts it's better off if there's no tension on them they'll last longer your belt to last longer when I'm through grinding on an axe and I've got it down to a thousand grit my next step is frequently to buff it and that's where the absolutely fine final sharpening occurs in the shop anyways the customer may want to strop it or do a little honing but I can get a razor finish between the thousand grit belt and coming to the buffer use a coarse compound on one wheel and a very fine compound on the other wheel this is a one horsepower buffer very handy thing this one runs 1800 rpm which is about half speed from a regular grinder which is why a buffer is better than putting buffing wheels on a bench grinder because the slower speed is safer a buffer can grab something and rip it out of your hands in a heartbeat if you're buffing you can never buff up here because that will throw that back at you always buff so the buff is going away from the edge and so if it grabs it it throws it to the floor this little thing is a dental lathe I'm not sure exactly how they use it in a dental office has something to do with making things like bridges and crowns and stuff like that I believe but it has on one end a threaded tapered shaft that you can put little buffing wheels on this is a scotch-brite wheel that's about had it but it's smaller stuff this is two-speed I don't remember what the two speeds are now but it's got a high speed in the low-speed and neither one of them is all that fast but the advantage to this what I like is this in that takes the same quarter inch shank points or burrs that you put in a die grinder and what's even better that burr is now turning this lever is a clutch and it stops it and opens the Chuck you can put another one in and without turning the machine off you can make quick changes and change as often as you need to with all your different burrs that you have for a die grinder and there are hundreds of options for these things out there these are a little hard to find I think buying on new would be outrageously expensive but you definitely want one with this quick-release clutch on it but they don't all come that way used on ebay is about the only place I know to find one of these this grinder sitting in the back is just sitting there waiting to be put in closer to the drill press and will be used only for sharpening drill bits on one wheel and sharpening Tungsten's for the TIG welder on another wheel and that's all that will ever get used for the final thing is a grinder mounted with a wire wheel and a hard fiber wheel this is kind of like scotch brite but it's much harder and that can really take scratches out of two ledges if you're you're making chasing tools and things like that just like the buffer only grind down here up here that guards these come with block this off down here and up here and forces you to grind in the worst possible place for these types of wheels so this is in my opinion is safer without the commercial guards yes I could make some sort of a shroud that only leads the bottom part of the wheel available but again I'm comfortable with it just like 90% of the people who use equipment like this are comfortable with it if you're not comfortable with it do something different now in general I believe that wearing gloves around rotating machinery is foolish and you're inviting an accident that is especially true around a wire wheel I would much rather rip a little flesh off on the wheel but have a glove caught in that and wrap my hand up in the wheel so I never wear gloves around the wire wheel the belt grinders on the other hand I will frequently wear these Dyneema gloves they're a cut resistant abrasion resistant glove they are very form-fitting and they are not likely to get caught there's really nothing on the belt grinders that wants to grab a glove in the first place there's not two ledges or wire bristles or anything like that the grinding belt doesn't really want to go it grabbed these I don't always wear them in the videos for the same reason I keep mentioning if you don't like it don't do it but I'm comfortable doing it when it comes to a lot of the lack of guards on those particular machines is because somebody will comment oh you shouldn't be wearing gloves around those grinders and if I'm not wearing them somebody will comment oh you should be wearing gloves because you're going to grind your knuckles you can't win so no matter what you do the safety police are out there looking over your shoulder second-guessing everything you do even though they probably don't actually own that same equipment in their shop because if they did they'd be running it just like you do well hope that answers the question some people had on my grinders and where they came from what brands they were again the Wilton Square wheel is the only one that is a purchase grinder as it is the other two by 72 is based on Metalworks kmg grinder and almost all of the components on there the contact wheels tooling arms the motor the pulleys the idler all of that stuff came from Beaumont metal works they sell all the parts so you can make your own grinder you're not really stealing their plan they know you're doing it and they're they want to sell you the parts and they have a lot more parts than what I have they've got contact wheels and all sorts of sizes and it's worth checking out Beaumont metal works I'll try to put a link down in the description for them and that great big grinder that's such a one-off oddball you'll probably never find another one like it and you probably won't ever want to build one like it unless you're doing big work because they're expensive parts the only reason I have it is because I'm the third owner of those parts but building a grinder like the kmg style or there's other plans out there on the internet is something you can certainly do if you are comfortable with fabricating and a little bit of late machining they're very doable and you can get a pretty nice grinder for a little less money but there's lots of good grinders out there for sale now a lot more than there were even five or ten years ago because there's so many more people getting into knife making now and these really are style for the knife maker but they are extremely handy for the blacksmith nothing better for dressing a hammer taking the burrs off a chisel or sharpening a chisel sharpening the tools you're making to sell lots of good uses for one but they're not cheap an angle grinder will do most of what they will do not as nicely not as fast but an angle grinder is a lot more affordable so think about that before you go up chopping for one be prepared for sticker shock but like always I can tell I'm starting to ramble on because I don't know when to quit so I'm going to quit and head into the house call it an evening I hope you can get out to the shop I hope you can work on something but do stay safe and do wear your safety glasses we'll see you for the next one", "7ea4GBZQon4": "good evening everybody welcome to thursday night's entertainment uh what are we doing tonight we're going to carry on with last week's big bowl that we started um had a little bit of an issue so far this week some of the milliput didn't go right in so i've had to refill it this afternoon so i've just been panicked and warmed it up and i think i've got it dry enough to be able to turn but let me go over on to a different camera and i can go up to the other end of the workshop i can chat and let's let's cancel that let's bring in a pair of maggots for the evening we've got andy h so they're gonna be trying to keep me under control it doesn't always work but uh yeah yeah anyway let's put them in the background i'm going down to the work department you can see how it's filled up from last week but there's like i say it's still i can still poke my nail into it just been trying to cook it a bit but it didn't work so i think what i'm going to do is take the faceplate off and start owning out some of the middle and then come back and re re-cut and hopefully it's a bit harder by then well i'm unscrewing this lot if one of the boys would like to let me know who's in the chat yeah i'll do it absolutely grand okay let's go down the participants this alphabetical order barry chitty barry's in the shed brian at heartwood turning you may know that you may know him as well david david deadman david eisenhower douglas mullen duncan le curley turner gary levier gerard the french turner hodgepodge woodworks ian leonard james crawford john s casting mark the gentleman woodturner pat radar the woodturner stephen jobbins terry hooper trevor p hobby turner with willie witchett andrew and wood wizardry by colin um so that's that's all that's in that list so if i've missed anybody i apologize we'll try and catch up good evening everybody welcome to the fun house let's uh right i'm going to can we all say good let's see if i can get a little bit more speed in there so the usual rules of engagement guys if you want to play prefix it with a couple of twos or something and then do his best to come up with some sort of sarcastic remark or even answer the question situation normal then situation normal yeah now this isn't going to be a very deep bowl i only had just a good inch and a half when we first started but if you remember it was one hell of a shape three-quarters of an inch bow in the wood that's better i don't know if everybody has either andy and andy just said that he says hi at the best yeah [Music] sorry just done that one are you cutting in reverse okay it's okay the lights are running in reverse but this would be the normal way if you're turning out board on a a double ended one so it's just easier for me at the moment i can i'm not right out here i can be fairly close i'm above the center post so i've got maximum rigidity what i am doing is i am cutting down the grain but i can go down the grain from both sides i've got quite an overhang that's what's causing me a bit of an issue scott's in the world in the trenches so he can get in if you want oh my you didn't get home early didn't you what i'm going to do is i'm going to put put the original tool rest on which gives me a little bit closer access to it all particularly as i'm turning off that side right last week i broke the handle the lock-in lever so i've got 10 mil bolt in there so i'm using a spanner which is a lot tighter than what i could get it anyway so everything's working working for the best at the moment that's better and you can hear the difference scott says he did message you to send him the link to worm so i'll pass the message on okay let me ah where are we don't want that one i don't want that one want that one unless brian can do it because quicker than what i can the link sent to scott well done thanks brian you got mine when you're coming yep yeah so all smith's in the chat hello guys did you send it brian yep sent it it's on your messenger let's go yeah let me just finish this cart and i'll go down and let him in welcome on board mate thank you very much full house now hello how's the arm savage savage the second time so you've got the full dose now then yeah eyes all protected now the arms are right mate yeah it'll be tomorrow wouldn't it oh we'll see now we had a yet another horrible job so they sent the same early when go home cheers yeah didn't you tell him twice did you this feels like there's a horrible bit of grain through the middle of that the way it's uh throwing me about there's a massive crack down through there you can see it on the camera that is grain there but up here can't quite pick it up on the camera but there's a massive just see it yeah drying crack in there so that's why it's bouncing me about a bit i've still got a bit of meat in there i've still got to go down because i can just see the end of two of the screws that i've put three of the screws that i put in and they're only inch and a quarter was that a piece of sycamore yeah douglas among them did anyone see hello rogue's gallery is now full hello gallery yeah that's us yeah i think andy said loads of pool did he yeah i heard paul yeah i must yeah i think you were busy at the time brian how's the horse brian uh possibly yeah brian's got a breeze yeah got a really crap uh reception tonight uh nearly 10 minutes behind us down here barry in the shed hi barry good evening one and all guys thank you for 36 coming over and uh giving us a bit of a laugh tonight hopefully we can have a laugh on a giggle now i need to get this done tonight which shouldn't be a problem rich is on at nine o'clock he's invading the [Music] um virtual craft whatever it's called the huge youtuber yeah is it huge yeah cool cool uh so ben jamin said i had looked to see if i could tighten the grub screws on my chuck to secure it when reverse turning but as far as i can see it would end up tightening the grub screw onto the actual thread uh some chucks are like that unfortunately um this one didn't sorry so this one didn't have grub screws on when i bought it i've still got to go a bit deeper i can still see the screw hole there yeah this one didn't have a locking on there but the back plate i had drilled because the back plate on these are quite big this is the m35 for when i go down take the truck down to the workshop but you've got the flange on the back there and i've got quite a um register in there for this lathe so all i had was gonna mate to put two holes in there and stupidly he's done exactly what axe means to do put the grub screws outside of the fixing holes rather than centralize them can't quite understand that with the engineers brain and dangerous comes to mind that's you as well though isn't it well quite possible still got to go a bit deeper anyway sk114 chuckles and they recommend that you drill up a small hole um or start of a hole so the grub screws got somewhere to go into to stop it sliding all right hello doug no it is screws it's not worm holes because i they're three concentric or three equidistant holes magic worms are up a bit further i shan't say anymore but you know what i'm talking about oh that's a horrible cut i don't know whether you can yeah you can see my hand vibrating and i'm only literally holding the chisel down look at it bouncing might even have to resort to trying to turn the right way just to see if it's any do any better all right [Music] we're all right to there starting to pick up the shake the wobble not quite as bad this way one thing's for sure i'm not chasing it across there i'm letting it cut at its own speed a push cut across there too fast would make it to tremble all right let's see what we've got there guys uh douglas mongerman said hi to everyone hello douglas i've still got one yeah i've still got two little holes there how much how much meat have i got i can afford to take another couple of cuts off of there just [Music] well that's about a one mil cut and i had ten meal down there adam from so you broke up in the middle of that right yeah i'm sorry we got adam but that was it adam from i love uh hodgepodge is asking a question he says why not finish the outer rim before filling the inside of the platter there isn't a lot left on there um it's pretty through the back there that's there's the end of those three natural voids these come right the way through to the outside i could just feel them on my fingers as it was whipping around wondering what the hell is that but it's only there's three fairly big open voids there there's not much i can do about that that's to see if i the reason i didn't want to finish the outside too much further and most of it is only sanding and one very light cut is because the milly put up through here is still a little bit wet i'm waiting hoping for the time i've got this scooped out to i shan't say perfection but better than what it is i will be able to run over it and make something out of it that's a that's a lousy cut in the finish in the center there but [Music] i think this is gonna be the uh the woodturner's friend finishes this off in a lot of places and there's still two little holes there wouldn't believe it let's let's please hodge and go and do a bit of work on the outside just true it up a fraction [Music] i don't think it's quite so far out this week as what it was last week just invest in a new freshly sharpened last year chisel i want to do i think that one's sharp adam's saying there's some ropes in here tonight yeah oh there's no problem yeah i can't think who he's referring to [Music] i can hazard a guess i just had a few whiskers on the back when i surfaced the edge off last week this is where it could go tits up and all fall out now we could end up with something quite respectable no that's wrong acceptable acceptable oh it sounds louder this this end than what it actually picks up through the mic lawrence is in hello lawrence and radar the woodturner says he's gotta get back to work see you all later thanks radar for stopping off let's have a look see what that looks like oh it's getting there the outside it's only a bit of 40 grit paper on that that'll take that down still got to attack it just there one two there yeah there's two end of screws that have just poked through and that was inch and a quarter so i can say this started off as a two inch slab but when i put the steel rule across the back bottom i could get each finger under it that's how much it bowed it was ridiculous but if i can make something out of it good if i can't you've all learned something from it even in florida hello florida all right tell this is still wet because i can smell it [Music] did we mention him nope he must have crept in the back door didn't see him oh yes i'm quite happy with with that what's that few little bits to fill but not too bad not my phone yeah i just need to take a little bit off the top there it's coming together now the reason i want to turn this in reverse let's show you guys robert dolman is in these oysters are cut on the skew so they're put in like that so but they're put in this way so i don't want to come up on the sharp pointy end i'm trying to cut off the blunt end so i'm actually cutting across the grain so that's one of the reasons i'm cutting or got the lathe running in reverse oh there is a there is a logic to it guys not just me being silly and showing off but it's not going to be quite so critical now we've got down to a finish that's that chisel dead lily put is quite aggressive on your tools don't like it on that one need a pro edge that's what you need no i need them all sharp they were all sharp i know where there was one until i'll give it away oh no there's approach that someone told me florida says thought we were going back in time with reverse turning there's a good reason for it it keeps the overhang down [Music] this would not quite sit above the bed bars i think it started off as just over 18 inches or just on 18 inches so with my dust extraction clamped on the back bar it's easiest to do it like this plus i can see it now i'm bending the back too much and lewis says that uh wayne said milliput is like resin so it'd be tough on traditional tools yeah it cuts quite well but it cuts the edge off sharp quickly [Music] the excess is great for filling holes in the workshop florida says it's great for sanding as well i must admit that's when i use it most felt quite a nice cut around there sounded good yeah look at that i still got a i've still got a gap there get my finger in another one there and another little pimple there so that's not too bad but it won't get filled tonight i'll probably do is sand it and then just whack a little bit in and go over it i think i'm quite happy with most of that just gonna take a little bit off this top edge what have we got we've got enough room there [Music] i hope you had a no cool day at work uh douglas it was a mental day at work which is why we got seven home early that's three chisels totally are you stuffed hello john all right do i think that'll sand the linikins is in says hello kiddo you got the kenny there and molly give me a company that's four chisels that are no good to mend the beast lay on the floor they're out of the way they can't fall off there david is back to work thanks for popping in david take a little bit off there if i can vinny king says yep they're here right i don't know whether uh john and pam stepney are in i know he's watching me and i don't think he knows how to uh access youtube we might have to give him some instructions i think he just sits there in the background enjoying it whereas we could in fact have him on air and he account as one of the numbers as well i think anyone sitting in the background counts as a number don't they anyone watching i don't know i don't know yeah it's not just but would be nice if he could come in and apparently you do go on brian no he's gone somewhere i think he's trying to say that apparently looks like he once let him back in stand in the corner and then you can claim special privilege and says i get let off as i'm keith's offspring i don't know do we let her off keith do you want to argue with her i think that's a lady don't know what happened there it kicked me out yeah i did notice uh tommy's workshop's in hello tommy we thought you'd have scone did scott yeah the tag pulled me back it was a nice there's a nice bit of texturing in the middle here i don't think it quite does just about pick up yeah you can see you can see the swirl there beautiful grit get that out yeah i know yeah and that's no weight against it it's just the way this wood wants to turn it doesn't sometimes before you get a bubble isn't it well i should have should still have enough in there a pretty funnel pretty funnel yeah one little pass has shifted that it's incredible according to uh according to my double-ended i've got 10 mil in the bottom there so i could still afford to go an extra couple of passes if i really really felt that way inclined gerard says is anyone a bit nerdy on the computer um dale or peter twisted trees are you uh nerdy makers when it comes to technology yeah if it works it works if it doesn't it's a help check it out closed candy so david is saying i don't think the thumbs up counter is working um on youtube uh whether you can choose to have them uh so people can see how many there are you can choose to see how many they're on um keith likes rabbits the people just hit thumbs up or thumbs down we did end up with quite a bit of controversy along the line that was we had one supposed member come in and enjoyed giving everyone a thumbs down so it doesn't make any difference to the rating it's an interaction on your channel so the uh 105 i got on one of my videos thank you very much 105 people absolutely that's just a bit of formica for mike a sample i just wanted to put a burn ring round there i've seen people do it with lolly sticks um stirrers there's plenty of stirrers in it and many other things but i tend to use that because you can give yourself a fairly broad line it's not too bad that's not too bad let's is that a bit you broke off the worktop no that's black as is the other color but in black all right that's to come on and do that take the armstabby thing off see what we can make out of this you got a negative rake scraper will that take the bomb bit out now i've basically got it out um with the open grain you can see it there yeah you can see it there it's just bouncing in between them i'm not quite sure what what it's done but it's not going to do it anymore what's that catching them nothing it's a chuck uh stretching the green's a bit far from here at the moment in locked down so nothing happened drop the speed a bit on that rim because it's the big i want the paper to cut rather than just burnish it a little tip there for anyone doing some real simple things as in hello buddy anyone doing big items like the large diameter items just remember it's the peripheral speed that is the killer and you can end up having a lot of issues if you run too fast and always turn it up for the middle it's handy because i've got fully variable speed from two up to 2800 so we're chugging around quite handsomely quite satisfactorily see what that's like yeah taken that soft bit out across the middle and these two green lines that you can see they're quite hard plus there's two little knots here as well which doesn't help just got a ring round now how are we doing on time quarter past not too bad actual fact i'm quite happy with that it's never going to be an exhibition piece but see if we can make it something respectable that was 80 under 120 what's that practice piece dad yeah douglas is asking the question is this keep you say about speed what if the lowest speed is 500 rpm how would you deal with that that's the lowest you can go but if you if your lowest is 500 what is the maximum you can turn if you can turn if you can swing the head and turn to the floor so in effect three foot plus i would be very dubious of uh anything big going on there so 12 inches on my little life at 500 yeah it's just about doable yeah leo is in hello lionel if you work it out that uh um what was it uh i did i didn't know the formula or a basic formula the speed times the diameter three times three and one seventh times gives you the peripheral speed so if you've got 500 revs and you've got a 12 inch blank on there what's three three and one seventh times that who's got a calculator that gives you my brain's been up since four o'clock yeah that gives you your peripheral speed and obviously the peripheral speed on the edge is much faster than an inch from the center so you can work out what you're doing speed wise there is no set speed different woods react differently so again 3.142 times what uh 500. it's about 1700 and 1571 yeah feet per second it's pi times that isn't it which is yeah it's tight yeah yeah so you're looking at that's um feet per second if you're looking at 12 inches if you're doing it in metrics you're looking at kilometer meters a second so that 1500 feet per second per minute is pretty fast usain wouldn't keep up with you at that speed don't know what the conversion to mars ferrar would be it's about 47 meters how many 47 meters i think if i'm converting it properly something that's a meter uh three quarters of a meter a second that's moving then yeah which is pretty quick yeah just going to get rid of the sanding marks around the outside of this radial marks off of the paper if it's not gone this time it's more or less gone more or less gone what i would do would be to grab a bit of 400 grit uh 400 240 grit and do it by hand it's 240. rid of that just torn one off hope no one noticed uh that ticking you can possibly hear where the jaws have worn a little bit in the carriers it's an old chuck but there's nothing wrong with it it still grips it's just one carrier that is slightly loose looser than the other three you see that all the mortise isn't quite holding right let's have a look at that that's better happy with that right what what am i going to do then guys am i going to your key this or oil it or decision time if it was me i'd probably also grit yeah i think i'm good with that i think that's okay right turn the big sucky thing off we've got the lennikins once it's in purple i've got one indoors in purple not sure that was an option was it no there's a few of the lennikins i've got that ash one i did three or four weeks ago i think i'll have that big sucky thing on get rid of some of the cellulose out of the air i don't want to put too much on and get a big tear on this a lot left in me 10. doug miller it's uh scott andy who h and brian asking who the worms were it was the third one but i don't know which order we're in who are the maggots they're all out on day release so just be a bit careful guys i'd like to be here as i can now i found it so we had to had a hunt around the workshop before i started i couldn't find the hot air gun it was on the floor underneath the heater you know where you always put hot air guns you're in a sensible place yeah on the floor yeah it ain't gonna go anywhere then is it if it's on the floor no can't fall any further exactly that was what i was thinking door 60 is in yeah no door evening it's nearly morning but we let him off welcome along and enjoy the banter how many have i got uh staring at me and criticizing me tonight then 49 at the minute oh that's all right thanks guys i'm sure there was other things to do that would be more entertaining or perhaps not more entertaining but you can't cut the pub now can you because they're not open we've been talking about it but don't worry you can go back and hear what it what we said it wasn't me there's light at the end of the tunnel when it comes to pubs yeah yeah so this is this yorkshire great original yes not trying to put too much in i don't want to fill up all the cracks and crevices that we've got across it but undoubtedly some will work that's a bonus these dulcet tones are a bit hit and miss tonight with the broadband he's got over in northern ireland yeah right so i'm just gonna work this in gently again not massive speed no pressure on it just uh melt it in a bit same bit of paper probably going to end up picking it all out of the drying cracks that are on there but hey ho so now we've got that in i can hear it's worked or working because the the gravelly noise that i had is now just a sort of in the background just a gentle shush so we know that the rotten stone and pumice have worked so crank up the volume a bit piece into it [Music] i think if i ever do another platter bowl with oysters in there will be bigger oysters and there'll be a bit more of a gap around them so they'll be a more of a loose fit hopefully that will make the filling procedure a bit easier because that was the nightmare on this one it was on the last one last time they were bigger but still had a bit of an issue right there i would say we're about 650 now when the light starts creeping down the workshop i think i'll uh back off the speed a bit it's the same bit of paper so i'll find a i won't there's too many holes in it we'll invest in a new piece to hell with the expense give the cat a goldfish yeah so what i'm looking for now is nothing on the paper which i'm still getting a little bit of first clear pass let me wipe it in find a clean piece of paper don't want too much pressure on it just want enough to pick up and generate a little bit of heat find another clean piece of paper so while it's quiet on here um i will be reverting back to next tuesday at one o'clock andy's going to take a a week off scott's picking up this thursday night slot which is his own anyway and i've just filled it to stop anyone else creeping in and winning it so from then on um i think it's only the week that doing next thursday scott and then i'm doing the following thursday hang on let me check the calendar so where are we we're out today i know you've got tomorrow night so i'll be doing the next week i'm doing the next two thursdays right then i've got a week off and then you've got three on the bounce yeah i'm also live saturday lunchtime at one o'clock um turning a piece of wood douglas very kindly sent me um initially we thought it was oak but apparently it's a piece of ash that's got some uh lovely grain to it right i think i've got a piece of the same i'm not quite sure um it's still green so it's standing here on the floor out of the way no this is quite dry um i have put a pole up on my instagram for what people want to see turned out of it a colored uh faux hollow form or a ceramic lid uh popup not coming out with a little dusting stick and there might be very some left out there to do something else with come out with a paintbrush i think i'm gonna have to pick it all out tomorrow when it's dry yet i'll get the compressor in those bits around the oysters as well yeah yeah i'm hoping that i can just touch them in right though for what it's worth i'm not sure whether i should actually bother that bit is a bit worse up there it's a job to know where to draw the line on something that's got cracks across it like this do you spend another three weeks on it and still get nothing out of it or do you just donate it as to someone oh i like that there you go take it then it looks better with the wax polish fill in the cracks that's the wrong screwdriver where's my skew i'll use this one then he's popped off to trump to nanny yeah excuse you barley magruder i don't want that bit of paper that's three bits of paper emma would be crying wouldn't she uh benj ben jamin says great work looks like a viking shield right doug miller is saying what about black ca possibly if you've got some the pete from twisted trees saying that he's gonna he's cut some pieces up of small branch red is doing inlay right don't go and make the edges too tight depending what you're going to fill it with pete unless you're going to pour resin in it so we're just coming up to half past well mate just gonna buff this off and uh call it a gooden even if it's 100 good adam's come up with a good idea he said you could always put a mirror in the center or a clock could do be a big clock but it would be a reasonable mirror it was an iffy piece of wood to start with and if if if you put one of those funhouse mirrors in there mate it'd look you make you look pretty that's gonna be bloody not impossible that's why i said one of those funhouse mirrors yes yeah the ones that made me look stick thing there's not many of them about those so i'm not sure what i'm looking at doing next next tuesday the florida woodworkers and you could feel the cracks with an inlay there's um there's wax and uh yorkie grid in there now so it means chomping them out with a dremel or something i think once they're blown out they're not going to look too bad so don't put too much pressure on just caress the wax to a finish as it's not very warm out here it'd probably go dull i usually take it in and give it another another wax tomorrow but that's the yeah you can do can you also stick up amberly museum on there scott as well because they're opening back up on the 19th so we can all get back in there then that's my resident home along with scott we are a pair of the resident turners down there and andy and i know andy's not a turner at the moment you can see it better there so all right that's just two weeks work on that you know what you're complaining the back is nothing overly special it wants a good wax again so if you're local to sussex guys and girls and if you're coming down on a holiday yeah this is definitely a well worth a look at yeah where i've got my fingernail is the other side and if you're in the plant we'll let you know if we're going to be down there normally i'm on a sunday i've got an odd couple of saturdays um scott does saturdays and sundays with me so you could end up with both of us down there double bummer i'm gonna try and do some uh midweeks during the holiday as well yep yeah well i've said i might try that as well all right let me go find a down there scott hey mate come down on the thirsty i'm always down there on the thursday oh yeah different department yeah i might have some things for you to look at andy i've got some old tools of the wife's granddads that i don't know what i don't know what to do with but they don't want they didn't want them being thrown away so there you go so yes i'll go on to that one you can check out my posh red bag it still hasn't moved no it's still there yeah it's still there still there that's that's it for tonight guys cool let's bring that round yeah that is better that's better yeah yeah look at that excellent it's quite a nice piece of wood considering it's rubbish i don't find those those cracks in the middle offensive to be honest no no no enhance is a bit of wood than it's good to see that you've got that nature and natural stuff it's real yeah yeah and there's the there's the little bits that i used cut off a branch at about 45 degrees kelly's way around pete kelly sunny can do saturdays too yep so you might find more than one of us in there well the calendar is up and running peak just let us know same access as last time or before we shut down so that's not a problem i've updated it adds to the calendar character character yeah look mate i've been up since four o'clock this morning well thank you everyone for your kind comments that was the branch that i cut down and i just kept putting it through the bandsaw and taking off ten mil at a time at this at that angle so once you get that angle set it's not critical it's not ultra critical should we say not when you're just cutting it and in laying it or in setting it it is it does add quite a bit of character to it and i was unsure about the terracotta billy perkins the natural fact that brings it out it complements it yeah yeah it does it brings it out yeah because it's fairly close to the heart of the eu olive uh oysters that were in set there so so don't forget next week it's scott doing thursday night and he's doing a clock i am that's what it says on these uh instruction page it is it's a clock um so the kit was donated to me by pro craft a long time ago um and i'd forgot about it and this one is one but um wilma and barney on it haven't you no this one is going to be turned and then either auctioned on the night or sold um but all the proceeds from that are going to be going to the southampton veterans center um towards their workshop and the fund that woody has got at the moment the total as of this morning was fourteen hundred pound yeah um scott and i have put quite a few items in there woody himself has donated quite a few items in there it's been various yeah bits and pieces in there so that's not bad from just a wood turning section and woody's up in northamptonshire and we're talking about southampton veteran center down the other end of the country once they get the workshop it's not only going to be the veterans they're going to get local schools involved get people into turning so good project to support it's going to be a well-used workshop when we when we can get it up and running we've had help from one of the local radio stations down in southampton they did a southampton 2 landsand walk i believe it was and they didn't leave the the village town of southampton they just clocked up miles going round and round the block when it when that jonah gropes to land i think was it it was something like that anyway it was they clocked up a gram just on a grand i think they made so it was well worth it so they those units that we're looking at to put down there you generally run out at about 6 but now it's gotta be kids yeah but we're in it they're in talks with um southampton football club as well to use part of that so we're not quite sure how and what in which way we're going yet but everyone on here knows that lathes aren't cheap 400 pound the cheapest for a small one 1400 for a really cheap big one there is here um another beauty um that needs a new motor and a new control box so once i've raised some money to do that then that will be going down there and for those that don't know what beauty is that's the small um small lathe like it's got quite open news is axminster 305 in it i believe it is here yeah they keep changing their numbers so you get lost in the lost in terminology and numbers but yeah we're looking at that plus we need to put some tools down there so yeah it's a it's a long term project but we're hoping to see it through fairly quickly so that we can at least get a workshop up and running there's a lot of um limbless veterans that use it um gopd bstd whatever it is ptsd yeah there was the blind lady that didn't think she could turn a pen because she was blind she did one with me yep yeah so there's lots of different people that use it they've got their own um dentist that goes in two or three times a month they've got a chiropractor going to find a link for it yeah yeah there's a chiropractor that goes in and most of them just give their time they do on average i think it is 500 or on average they've done 500 meals a week for the veterans over lockdown so they're working and it's a worthwhile cause as far as i'm concerned i haven't got any military um background dad was a um auxiliary fireman he looked after the the engines on the trucks and the big old bedfords when they were running them so he didn't ever get called up he was better off on that so yeah got no military connection whatsoever but that doesn't stop us for what's in the big red bag that's uh that one's shrink wrap electrical yeah one and the one at the back is the offcuts from pens that um a mate was going to grab for his daughter to make jewelry but he's not been back so they might go somewhere else for someone else to cast into resin and there we go there's a link to the veteran center it's the only one of its kind in the country and it was all the dream of one man so yeah and it's all been it's self-financing there's no as far as i know there's no government support for it no they finance everything themselves tonight bit like amberly museum um everything down there is basically funded by us volunteers and donations we get virtually nothing although we've had a couple of handouts over the covid just to keep us up and running but we have to supply most of what we need down there so with that guys no more questions coming in see there's some nice compliments on there thank you all thanks for the three worms laura magatine in the background sorry you couldn't hear brian too much tonight but uh hopefully his internet will work better when he gets the horse in there right racing instead of just trotting around get a bit more speed and the power into it brian when are you back on brian i think he's gone yeah yeah he's just he's in his own world up there i'm still here he's still there he's out doing tractor cam again yeah when are you on brian next afternoon it's a 10 minute delay from from england to northern ireland tonight one o'clock when brian probably first just just put it in the chat there you go next thursday right okay so we're all on um and like i say andy's taking a back seat next week and hey and the week after i think and the week after two weeks no that's why i jumped in like last week and this week i'll think about that yeah we can work it out yeah you can work it out i mean it's not all about being greedy and everyone going in together helping each other out on it yeah i've had such lovely comments from people who watched um it makes me want to do it again exactly yeah yeah when i first when i did the first one i thought now do i want to do it and it was the comments that came in that said yes you do um right guys no questions come in no no comments oh no no it's just chatting to everyone so i'm going to go and hit the off button don't forget to head over to rich yeah rich is on to nine o'clock uh quite a big invade tonight so i'm going to wake the bloody mouse up to end the broadcast so thank you one and all good night from west sussex good night", "st571DYYTR8": "- This is how to get incredible\nresults with a French press. We're looking for a really\ndelicious cup of coffee with none of the silty-sludgy\nstuff at the bottom. If you're in a hurry this\nreally isn't gonna work for you. This is a really great way to make coffee but it's not very quick. You need a little bit of\npatience that will be rewarded. You need to get some delicious coffee. Delicious means fresh,\nlike freshly roasted, and you're gonna grind it fresh if you want the best possible experience. This will work with pre-ground coffee but it won't taste as good\nas it could, so grind fresh. I would recommend starting between 60 and 70 grams per liter. How you like it, is up to you. Get some digital weighing scales. This is gonna seem insane but I promise you, it's incredibly useful. There are two reasons to use it. You brew coffee that tastes really good, you wanna do that every\nsingle time you brew it, and, therefore, knowing what you did is the way to get there. The alternative is that you\nbrewed a bad cup of coffee. Now you know what you're changing when you try something\ndifferent the next time, and it will make life so much easier. Fresh, clean, soft water. Don't brew with hard water, don't brew with unfiltered water. If it doesn't taste delicious on its own, it's not gonna make great tasting coffee. So, here's how this is gonna work. When you grind your coffee,\nput it in the French press. Ignore what most people say,\ndon't grind super coarse. Grind something more\nlikely described as medium. Boil your water. Don't worry too much about\nthis, as long as it's boiled, and then pour the right\namount of water on top. I might brew 30 grams of\ncoffee to 500 grams of water. And then, we're gonna let\nit sit for four minutes. just hang out, wait, be patient. We're gonna grab a couple of tablespoons. With one of them, we're\ngonna stir the crust that forms on top of the coffee. a lot of it will start to fall\naway, and then you'll be left with some bits on top. Some foam, some floating bits. You wanna scoop those off, just throw them down the sink, it's fine. Now, here's the bit that seems difficult. I want you to do nothing at\nall for at least five minutes. Now this is a little\nfrustrating 'cause you feel like you've brewed the coffee, but even if you pour it into a cup, it's too hot to drink right now anyway,\nand the longer you leave it, the better it's gonna taste. As you sit, all of those\nfloating bits start to fall down to the bottom of the press, and settle in that bed of coffee. This is exactly what we want. We don't want those in the cup, we want those stuck down at\nthe bottom of the cafetiere. After five, maybe seven, eight minutes, now you can drink it. When you put the plunger in,\ndo not plunge all the way. All you're gonna do there is stir up all the\nsediment, all over again. So just, till it's sitting\non the surface of the coffee. We can use it as a strainer,\nin case there's any big pieces that are still floating around, but we shouldn't really need it. And then gently pour the\ncoffee through into the cup. This will be the most\ndelicious silt-sludge-free cup of coffee you will get\nfrom a French press.

left okay do you throw it away I think most people throw it away or do you switch back to regular table salt which is not quite the same you gotta have sea salt I like Hawaiian salt when you when you break this down I'll tell you four steaks and fish and everything is the greatest thing but what do you do you throw that way when your favorite pepper grinder comes down what do you do you toll that way I'm going to show you the secret there is no such thing as treading it right or left to take it off you gotta have to use just some key manpower just grab this and just pull it apart one time like ah like that okay no big secret way back okay okay for you ladies that are wives or girlfriends make sure you find your husband or boyfriend just have them do this that's it so what I do is I get my favorite type of sea salt which is my Hawaiian salt crystals get my bottle fill it up but not all the way maybe about 7/8 of the way it's good enough in there now let's see if I got this correct look at that perfect so don't throw this away hold on to it because it's reusable see miss your mccormick pepper trust me you save a lot of money this way at first I didn't know that do it away I don't go hey this is getting kind of expensive just a little elbow grease and you can do this alright thanks", "KGkDcntMWMc": "angle grinders are one of the most versatile machines you can get these machines are extremely useful if you are cutting metal storm or you are grinding these machines are invaluable these are used day in day out in industry for working on metal install this particular one are going on right now is cordless this is ideal for a smaller job sport it's absolutely useless on bigger jobs bought to get out of trouble this machine is perfect a lot of people are unsure how to mount the discs correctly in the angle grinder so they're going off look at that in a minute but what I point out is the machines are very dangerous so when you using one you're definitely the percenter classes they've also noisy so you need some ear protection and I will definitely recommend wearing a full-face visor the disks that you use in angle grinders do have a tendency to shatter if they're shatter that machine can be spinning at 10,000 rpm that is going to make a real mess of your face that's why it's a good idea to wear a full-face visor whenever you use a grinder we've got three machines on the bench here this is the large 9 inch grinder or for me we've got the 240 volt one and here we've got the card as well this demonstration I'm going to show how to mount the disks on the cordless one because it's easier the Vitara one is quite unusual in that it has a special kind of locking not that can simply put on there with your fingers you do not need a pin wrench in order to tighten or loosen the flange not on that particular machine it's essential that you always use the side handle when you are cutting sometimes if you're grinding that gets in the way sore you could remove that on a smaller grinder on a big grinder it's essential that that is kept in position because that will help you keep all of it shield the grinder decide to move away from your violently I've seen quite a lot of people using grinders on YouTube and they've removed the actual guide because it gets in the way sometimes that is a very silly thing to do if you're using a grinder like this without the guide it's quite possible for you to cut your wrists using the disc are you caught quite easily damage and other parts of your body so it's hourly important that you never remove the guide from the machine and you should also have it so this is your stake in the correct position source of all the sparks and debris fly away from you whenever you change that this kind of grinder you should always remove the battery or unplug the grind it from the men's modern machines now have a spindle lock so when you press that button in it actually locks the disk in position meaning that you can change it a lot of all the machines used off to get a small span out through the two older spindle whilst you change the disk you don't have to do that now with most machines they all seem to come now with the spindle lock button we're not going to change the disk on this machine so I'm gonna press to spin the lock button on the back and I'm going to tap the pin wrench and then I want to undo the knots once that's all done what can you spin that off if you take a look underneath you'll see that there is a spacer that spirit always goes on that way you on that side so that it will fit perfectly on the spindle so that always goes on there if you're mounting a cutting disc or a grinding disc before you use any cutting or grinding disk in a grinder you should check the date on it these disks actually expire that means that after that did it is not safe to use them if you use them after the date there's a chance that the disc can break up if you're grating some when you're using it it can make a real mess of you so if you just have a look on there you'll see stamped onto the metal part just up there he says 2016 the first 2016 so that means that this is what we've been dead so we can use that quite safe way if we look at the grinding disk that as the date on there of 2015 so that's all saw in dead so we can use that safely if you come across one of these at your bug in your cupboard for ten years it's going to be able to date you don't even miss using it just bin it and go on buy another one they are extremely cheap if you're mounting a flap disk or a cutting disk be it storm or metal you put the disc on there that way and you put the flange nuts on sort of the flat surface top cheese the disc so you will put that on there until it grips the disc and then you will press to spin the lock bottom and then just nip that all using the pin wrench so that disc is now mounted on that machine correctly the same goes for the flat disc that is mounted the exact same where with the flange not that way if you look at the knot that comes with the grinder you can see that it's flat on one side on the other side it has a raised piece in the center that is for when you are mounting a grinding disc which wanted to install the grinding disc it goes on there exactly the same but this time you need to change the nut round salsa the most part fits in the center of the disc that ensures that the grinding disc is completely censored so that disc is now fit correctly on there one thing you should never do is put the wrong this on the wrong machine if you look it up large blade there which is now an inch that is designed to go on the 9 inch grinder the 9 inch grinder rotates at about 6300 rpm the smaller disc for the foreign half-inch grinder rotates for the 11000 rpm I've seen people in the past use these larger discs wants to get down to a small size you can no longer use them in the big grinder they have then socket and placed it on to the smaller grinder which we Falls at a much faster speed so that is incredibly dangerous if you're using a large nine-inch grandeur like that and your disc gets down to that size just bin it do not try and fit that on the smaller machine it's not designed to rotate at that speed as well as the cutting and grinding discs you can also a port a flat disc on the machine these are very useful if you want to sound walk quickly if you want to remove any burrs and metal these are extremely useful usually get them in packs and to use them you need the flexible backing pad to mount that onto the machine you need to remove that spacer it will not go on with the spacer on so you just need to push that on until it's centered and then get the special knot that comes with it and screw that into position you can then press in the spindle lock and you can tighten that up using a disc like this is very useful especially on Walter you can sum the world really quickly or you can even share the water using it", "5l3Y5la87zk": "[Music] the new 9-inch grinder from Milwaukee m18 fuel platform you got a smaller handle it feels a lot like a rat tail grinder if you're used to that obviously and you're getting the cord like power of a 15 amp grinder so they're putting some serious power here and 2 pounds lighter than the corded version as well so you're getting a lighter tool with the portability of a battery don't have to worry about that trip hazard of a cord and you're looking at about skinned four-inch bevels on it so if you're if you're battling pipe so 4 inch schedule 40 black pipe you're

what's going on guys this is brady with brady hummel woodworks so i had this black walnut slab laying around it was a little too narrow for much of anything like a table or anything like that so i decided to make a serving tray uh and this wasn't going to be like a charcuterie board i have one of them on my website so i kind of wanted to do something a little different to put on my website so i decided to do a tray uh the board was a little warped so i used this kind of as a planer sled hot glued it to a piece of plywood and this allowed me to really straighten it out so there wasn't a warp in there basically you run it through a bunch of times on that and then you're able to take it off of there flip it over and run it through the planer by itself and you've got a perfectly level surface i then clamped it to my bench because i had to get rid of the bark now you really want to use a draw knife for this i don't have one so i used a chisel a chisel works but it's going to take a lot longer than a draw knife and this probably took me a good half hour to get everything off i got a majority it off with the chisel and then went back with my angle grinder with a flap disc on it and got off a majority of the rest of it this really gets all that darker stuff that's left on after the bark that allows you to clean it up real good and that flap desk that that that's pretty aggressive so you kind of want to be careful with that so i went back with this hand sander and just sanded it by hand so it's nice and smooth and leaves a nice live edge on there so there was a lot of voids on top of this board and i was going to use epoxy to fill it so i tinted the epoxy black and filled those voids i was gonna use like a teal color and all that but i don't know i'm pretty plain jane when it comes to this stuff and black epoxy just worked well for me i didn't really want too much of color contrast in there there was already quite a bit of color contrast just from the the sap wood this was a pretty heavy sapwood piece and that's why i went back and did it with stained it with coffee later went back and just used a torch to pop all the bubbles so that night i left it by my wood stove to dry and that i don't think was the right idea because that warped it once again a little bit just slightly it wasn't too bad but i had to put it back on the planer sled and run that through again one last time to finally get it all smoothed yeah this serving board ended up being a ton more work than i thought but the final product i was really happy with so uh and then running it through the planer that opened up more voids they were just really small ones though so i just used some ca glue because it dries really quick and put those in there you can see that black epoxy it looks real nice while that ca glue was drying i brewed up a really really strong cup of coffee i don't think i quite did it strong enough but it worked well enough for what i needed so i went back once the ca glue was dry and just sanded it just used my random orbital sander and sanded it smooth another thing that happened was when i put it through the planer the second time it opened up this wormhole this was like the never-ending board man this this took so long but i sanded it kind of smoothed it over a little bit and then he used a chisel and i was just kind of gonna you know flow the live edge into this just to hide that a little bit so i chiseled it down and then sanded it and the ending result actually worked pretty good just looked like it was part of the live edge i use this hand sander your normal five inch random orbital sanding pads will fit on it and this thing works really great i'll link it down in the description below but it works awesome you don't got to buy separate sandpaper i just i just buy the random orbital sandpaper and then i hand sand to this the reason i like to hand sand is i don't like the swirls for left over from the random orbital sander so to finish off i usually always hand sand here i am just putting my logo on then it was time to stain the sapwood with the coffee i brewed up so as i said i don't think i brewed the coffee strong enough i would have liked it a little darker but it darkened it up just enough and i kind of ended up really liking the contrast of it another thing this does is usually you spray down your cutting boards with water and let it dry to raise the grain i didn't have to because i was staining it with coffee and the reason i used the coffee was because obviously i needed a food safe finish a food safe stain and i just think it ended up turning out real good by putting that coffee on there that raised the grain and allowed me to sand it smooth after it dried so here i am originally i was going to put these stainless steel handles on and as i was going through it i ended up drilling all the holes and everything and then that night i was kind of looking at pictures of because i took pictures with the handles on there and that night i decided i really didn't like that it was kind of too flashy but of course i decided that after drilling the holes for it so the next day i came back and just used a forstner bit i believe this was a one inch forstner bit so i was gonna i drilled those kind of where the handle holes were so i had a whole new plan i was going to cut in handles so that's what i did i just jigsawed them out and then on the underneath i used my router to take out some material so it would be easy to get your hands in um at the end of the video you'll see how that worked out but in the end it did work out pretty well i just used a chamfer bit just to smooth out all the edges and then i used emery cloth just to sand the handles and get all the rough edges out right there that smoothed all that over and then in the end i think it turned out pretty good and uh you'll be able to see here where i routed out all that material that allowed me to you know you can grab it with your hand get your fingers under there and i really like the way this one turned out it was a ton of work but i like it i will have it available on my website if you're interested in it but

to refill it you may notice that the company that make these grinders don't want you to do that these grinders are purposely designed so you could screw in the cap but you cannot unscrew it as you can see there are two stoppers on the cap and on the bottle of those grinders but you can open them anyways using one simple trick and the easiest way to do this is to use a soft piece of furniture like a couch by pushing the grinder against the couch you are directing all of your force into opening the cap instead of holding the grinder up in the air what you want to do is try to pry open the cap by forcing it inward or outward also try to hold grinder in different positions trying to find a place where it opens the most easily all right that's how you do it refill it with brand new pepper or salt and you're good to go now and if you're planning to reuse your grinders for as long as you can you may want to cut those stoppers off so you don't have to deal with them every single time", "W2su6wsInwY": "It is possible to polish steel using an\nangle grinder. You can get quite a good finish using a polishing kit. That is\na piece of steel that has been polished as you can see the finish on\nthat is very good. You can actually get it better than that we do still have a\nsaw mark in there so it depends on the amount of time you are prepared to spend doing the polishing.  But you can quite easily get a mirror-like finish like that as\nlong as you are prepared to put in the time. So normally the steel would look\nlike this. This is high carbon steel and that has been cut on a metal cutting\nband saw. So you can see that the finish on that is not at all good. We do have some burrs on there and we have quite a lot of saw marks. By using a flap disc\nlike that or a grinding disc it is possible to get a finish like that. So\nby using this we have actually removed all of the saw marks. That is relatively\neasy to do and that simply fits into an angle grinder. These are all for a 4.5 inch angle grinder. I am then going to use this polishing kit which is made\nby Dronco and that actually shows you the different discs that you can fit on\nthis. So we have the brown the blue and then the white one. When you use the\nwhite one you use the polishing compounds. So these are the discs that is\nthe brown one that is not as abrasive as the disc that we used the first time\naround which was the flap disk and that will bring the metal to a finish like that.\nYou can then use the blue disk which is finer still, and that will give you a\nfinish like that. So each time the abrasive is getting finer and it is\ngiving you a better finish. When we get to the end we use this felt disc\nwhich is very soft and with that we use these polishing compounds, the white\none first and then the blue one. The white one will give you a mirror finish like that \nwhich is very smooth and then when you use a blue one you will get a better\nfinish like that. I have to point out that this is high carbon steel so it is a very\ngood quality steel and can be polished and give you a really good result like that.\nIf you were to polish other steel such as stainless steel you would probably also get a similar result. But as you can see that is very reflective that has given us a\nvery good finish. So I'm now going to take this piece and we'll put it in the\nvice and I'm going to show you the steps that we go through to transform something like that into looking something like that.   It's also a good idea when\nyou're using an angle grinder to use a full faced visor, some hearing protection and also some good quality safety glasses. You may also need to use a dust\nmask. I'm going to start off first of all using the flap disc and I'm going to use\nthat to remove all the burrs and remove all the rough parts from this\npiece of steel.   After a couple of minutes you end up with a surface like that, you can see that all the saw marks have now gone. So we are now going to swap over to the next disc. You can see that we've now got a good finish on that so it's now time to swap the disk again.   We have now got quite a good finish on there so it's now time to swap to the final disc for the final 2 polishes. We're going to start off with the white polish there are two ways to use this. You can either run it onto the wheel when it's spinning around or you can actually just rub some\nonto the metal. Obviously the metal is quite warm so when you put this on it\ndoes tend to melt a bit. But if you just put some on there and then clean\nit off with a grinder that will give you a good finish. You can see we've got a really good finish on that\nnow we're just going to swap over to the blue polishing compound. You can see that that has given us a\nmirror-like finish and it is dependent on the amount of time you are prepared\nto spend doing the polishing. This isn't for an important job so I'm not\nspending that much time on it. I'm just trying to demonstrate how easy it is\nto polish metal at home using an angle grinder and the polishing kit. I hope\nthis video has been useful if it has and you haven't done so already, please subscribe to the channel.", "kCl8oepseDw": "All right, so today I\u2019ve got some quick\ntips for you on how to cut tile with an angle grinder. So lately Steve and I have been shooting\na lot of videos on how to tile a shower or a bathtub surround. And one of the best tools\nthat Steve uses, one of the most convenient tools that he uses to cut tile is an angle\ngrinder equipped with the right blade. Let me show you those blades right now.\nSo the blade that we like best is DeWalt\u2019s XP4 blade. This is for a 4 \u00bd\u201d angle grinder.\nThis is a continuous rim blade, meaning it\u2019s not rough. You could also use DeWalt\u2019s XP\nExtended 450X blade. Now this is a turbo ring, but it\u2019s a little bit different that it\nhas serrations on it. You can actually use this to cut concrete, brick, tile, other masonry\nmaterials. It\u2019s an awesome blade. But if you want to get a smooth cut on tile, we recommend\nthe XP4. So you can cut ceramic, porcelain, granite, slate, you name it. This is an awesome\nblade. So how do you switch out the blade on an angle\ngrinder? And which way should you install it? There\u2019s an arrow on most angle grinders.\nYou can see it here. And by the way, this is Fein\u2019s WSG7 angle grinder.\nSo this arrow should also correspond with the arrows on your blade. So that means that\nI should probably flip this over, right, because this arrow needs to be going in the same direction?\nSo there\u2019s a little retaining nut for your angle grinder. Just take the blade off, and\nwe want the blade to face towards us. Now this little retaining nut has two different\nsides to it. You want the flat side to go flush with the blade. There\u2019s also a lip\non it. You don\u2019t want that for this type of blade. This lip here is for inserting grinding\ndiscs. But you want the flat side to be flush with the blade. There\u2019s a little button\non this grinder. So you just press it, turn the blade until it stops, and then you tighten\nit down. So now I\u2019m going to show you how to cut\nthrough this piece of ceramic tile using an angle grinder and XP4 blade. One safety tip\nhere: Make sure you wear eye protection when using a grinder. Good thing.\nNow some people like using the wheel guard; some people don\u2019t. It\u2019s your personal\npreference. But this is a nice, safety feature on grinders. So just hit the power button.\nAnd you can see how that grinder just chewed right through this tile.\nAll right, so there you go. Those are some quick tips on how to use an angle grinder\nto cut tile. Now let me know what you think down in the comments. Would you feel comfortable\nusing this? Do you have any other tips and suggestions that I missed in this tutorial?\nNow this is a very quick tutorial. This wasn\u2019t meant to be exhaustive or anything. I just\nwanted to let you know about this tool and the different blades that go along with it.\nSo please keep that in mind in your comments down below.\nThat\u2019s it for today. If you want to see an angle grinder in action and how we tile\na shower surround on the plumbing wall, you can watch this video right here. That\u2019s\na great video if you\u2019re wanting to learn how to tile a shower, and you\u2019re worried\nabout the plumbing wall. That\u2019s it for today. Thanks so much for\nwatching the video.

vine\nnative to India and the Latin is right there what is black pepper black pepper\nis berry it is picked off of the vine just before it ripens it is allowed to\nferment a little bit and then dried so the fruit dries around the seed in the\nmiddle and you end up with this black peppercorn now sometimes but not very\noften you will see white pepper it comes from exactly the same plant it is\nexactly the same berry this time the berry is allowed to fully ripen and then\nthe berry is completely removed from the seed the seed is dried and that's how\nyou end up with white peppercorns a lot of flavor similarities between the two\nof course because they are pretty much exactly the same thing white pepper\nlacks some of the complexity and some of the heat that black peppercorns have and\ntherefore white peppercorns are used slightly differently in cooking you'll\nuse a white peppercorn where you want the flavor without the heat you'll use a\nwhite peppercorn where you want the flavor without the color you don't want\nto see the black specks throughout now pepper is native to India but at this\npoint the number one producer in the world is Vietnam of course pepper like

preparing a delicious spicy chicken soup as of this chicken's tube it's going to be asian style chinese style and it's going to have bok choy and oyster mushrooms so let's get started all right friends so to make our spicy chicken soup we have two bone-in chicken breasts so what we're going to do is we're going to boil the chicken for about an hour until it's cooked in in 12 cups of water and that's going to give it like a chicken stock also you know with the bone and the chicken that's going to be our base then we're going to add bok choy i'm going to add oyster mushrooms and before that what we're going to do is that we're going to saute some onions some dry red peppers we're also going to add a couple of bay leaves and then we're going to make a paste of that of the onion and the garlic and also the red peppers dry red peppers and then all that is going to go in this soup along with chicken chicken once it's done we're gonna pull it out we're gonna shred it and then we're gonna add bok choy and other you know ingredients like all spice paprika soy sauce salt to taste and sesame oil so all right so here i have 12 cups of water that's been boiling to do that i'm going to add two bone and chicken breast all right and then what we're going to do is cover this pot with the chicken bone and chicken breast cover it for one hour and then after an hour we check how it is and then we're going to shred it so the next thing that we're going to do is that here i have a little pot for lack of a better word to that i'm going to add two cups of cooking oil i'm using vegetable oil canola oil that's two tablespoons natural cups all right friends so while our chicken is being cooked and you know creating the broth why should this stock here in this saucepan mini saucer i have two and a half tablespoons of cooking oil i'm using canola oil to do that what we're going to do is add two roughly chopped onions that's going to go in there next thing we're going to add to that is three large dry red chili peppers and these are essentially chinese cooking also we're going to add two large cloves of garlic and what we're gonna do is let that you know cook for a minute or so

going to cover it and then make it into you know mix it up blend it all right so let's check our paste all right it's ready our onion garlic and red chili paste it's looking awesome so what we're gonna do next is we're gonna check on our chicken and see if it's done all right friends so we are sharing our two bone and chicken dress after cooking it in the chicken stock and creating the chicken stock with that for about 45 minutes so now we're going to make our soup spicy chicken soup with bok choy and oyster mushrooms so we'll add to this the red chili garlic and onion paste that we had made earlier okay i'm going to give it a quick stir the knife gets nicely mixed in here so this is going to be an awesome soup with the stuff that we made with the bay leaves and a pinch of salt and then have you added the paste all right so the next thing that i'm going to add to that are the oyster mushrooms i've washed these and then you know broken them into small cut them hand cut them into small pieces okay so that's going gonna give it another awesome flavor the next thing i'm gonna add is four block choice but i'm gonna take the you know and the leaves off because we don't want this hard stack to go in there oh yes this is the part we don't want to go in there all right so i've added the bok choy in there and so we're going to give it a quick stir so also i have our oyster mushrooms in there and then now we're going to add the chicken pieces the shredded chicken oh yeah this is where we want fantastic soup spicy delicious awesome oh yeah give that a quick stir so that the chicken gets mixed nicely with the rest of the items in the soup next thing i'm going to add is some salt and we'll adjust that a little later as need be okay what i'm also going to do is i like mine spicy and some fresh black pepper and then we're going to add one teaspoon of allspice powder yeah this is going to be a nice spicy zesty soup quick stir and you'll see that as we keep on adding the ingredients the color of the soup is going to change okay all right the next thing i'm going to add is one teaspoon of paprika powder this is more for color this is not spicy this is for color give that a quick stir now you see the is already changing color of our soup next thing i'm going to add is one tablespoon of soy sauce oh yeah that's going to give it another flavor that the flavor basically now you're creating this umami flavor symphony is what i would like to call it oh my goodness that's looking awesome and then we add a teaspoon of sesame oil sesame oil goes a long way so you don't put too much but looking at the quantity of our soup 12 cups it's okay i'm just going to clean up the little bowl with the sesame oil with a little bit of water give it a good stir all right now what we're going to do is cover the soup and let it simmer on low heat for about half an hour and then it'll be done all right friends so let's check on our soup oh yeah there you have it a delicious spicy chicken soup with bok choy and oyster mushrooms smells fantastic look at that can't get any better than that oh my goodness so be sure to check this video of you know the chicken soup on my youtube channel guest sugar and please like share and subscribe there's some awesome recipes on it so bon appetit thank you very much and now we're gonna plate this oh yeah no need to say anything because you can see what's going on here oh my goodness look at that you", "ym9T40RrW7M": "[Music] hi guys steve here and in this video i wanna share to get black pills you need them to make tech armor plus we are going to tame a giant squid next and that's what we eat i wonder at Narok map in vikings bay the coordinates is 2133 this is a good place to farm black pearls crawling along a bottom of a sea you find sea scorpions an inviting bay area is a high concentration enough found anywhere else normally in the deep ocean you might find a group of three maybe six if you're lucky but here four grams crawling with them who do quite a lot of damage in large groups like this so I'm gonna use a sea creature to kill them and the first one I'm gonna test as a Mouser as it's got a lot of health and does huge damage keep your iron amador left to see what a pick up I found other motorists hit or miss if you get black pills or not sometimes you can sometimes you don't the farming is on +4 on this service I'll get more than normal I go around in kill the sea scorpions for a minute and see what we get no black pills yet of course if you've got a good mo so you want to use that in the oceans it's dangerous down there as you can see here it's not really great at harvesting scorpions first what I've had before but I've not picked any new ones up yet they're only now I've started to harvest black poles and again there's some more as you saw you don't get from every scorpion after a short time you still get a fair amount of black pearls most of us are from a previous trip but visa would have just picked up then and I'll keep you better creatures to kill scorpions is a Megalodon as always seems to get you an amount of black pills from each scorpion however it's week of animo sir so it takes longer to kill them and you take more damage I put my visor on so you can see just how many scorpions are down here [Music] and as you can see is loads thumb this is a high level chakra just tamed but I've not leveled itself yet that's why it's taking a long time to kill them plus if you look at myself in the top right you can see I'm taking quite a bit of damage it's slower going but also I can gain pills from every single scorpion that's how many I managed to get from that short run another methods is to park a therizinosaurus next to the beach for some reason this land are now supposed to be the best creature to harvest sea scorpions not sure to thought out and quite through but you can use it well in Viking Bay go down in a grove of scorpions of a follow you then lead them back to the beach you can also shoot them with a grappling hook and pull them up but acronyms easier just make sure they keep following you now get on the pharisee no an attack when when it come for you the scorpions are able to walk on land not backs bear the pain this one's only low level and not leveled up on damage that's why it's a bit tense but yes it does seem to get more black pills in a shark going out to see is more creature to confirm these ammonites are the like sea snails but are again hit and miss if you actually get black pills from them when you attack them watch out because I make you hostile to every creature around you then everything will start attacking you at once time to get out of here as you can see get quite a lot of pills from giant squids but we are a bit of a pain to kill if is more than one is they keep grabbing you to get around out you can tame a basilosaurus which you can't grab and I showed how to do that my last video which you can see on the playlist at the end now we start getting into dangerous territory you'll get a lot more black pills from alpha squids but these are a major pain in the butt a tanki the do loader damage andr grab you again if you solo and only really go for the low-level ones as it's gonna take ages to kill it and if a medium to high level at least take two people on high level mousers because when one of you gets grabbed you ever one can attack it from behind or both of you go on basilosaurus it's a really tanking they can't be grabbed this fight took forever because it was a medium level one the most of a damage I did was shooting it from a distance with mimosa lasers but I finally managed and got quite a lot of pearls honestly take two or three people it'd be a lot easier I killed a few Mouse's but as you can see I didn't get any black pearls so don't waste your time doing that however killing alpha Moses is definitely worth it as each time we do you'll get a hundred black pearls but again if it's medium to high level is going to be a really difficult finds so take two or more people to help you if you can but at least on this one you can or in a way if you're got enough stamina or like fighting out for squid when I sleep by myself this fight took about an hour even with mimosa lasers because it kept swimming there is bloody jellyfish if you know the quickest way to kill jellyfish please let me know in the comments below as our a major pain in the butt finally and there we go a button 100 black pills I'm not gonna do that again solo however killin em does give you quite a lot of levels and there's 100 pills we got from it if you plan on scorched earth you find all these previous methods a little difficult as there is no ocean so to form black pills in this map you need to kill death worms by gain its hit and miss sometimes you do get black pills and sometimes you don't I killed five Williams and got five horns but only seven pills from one worm but a farming multiplier is only on times one here if you like wasting time and you've got nothing useful to do you can always get black pills by fishing well when I say always I mean extremely rarely and it's not really worth doing you'll need a chair fishing rod and bait you can do this on any map and for bait you'll need sap leech blood or honey but that's spores quickly so you need to refrigerate next year to keep it in to equip the baits drag it onto a fishing rod then drag a fishing rod onto your hotbar then press the left mouse button to cast I've done a full tutorial on how to fish in our playlist when you

gonna talk about\nratios for coffee brewing. How much coffee should I\nuse to brew a cup of coffee in terms of filter coffee? Now I'm gonna talk about this\nin three separate stages. I'm gonna talk about\nwhy I'm gonna recommend a certain type of ratios of using grams per liter, and then I'm gonna talk\nabout kinda finding your ideal ratio. And finally I'm gonna talk about why I might recommend a different ratio for different brewing methods. So first thing, why would I\nrecommend grams per liter? There's a number of different ways people do recipes and ratios. The most common ones still is\nto recommend scoops per cup. There's no international\nstandard for scoops. A scoop can contain about seven grams. It could contain about 10 or 12 grams. Now the problem I have with scoops or cups or tablespoons or teaspoons, or all of that sort of stuff is that they're volumetric measurements. Which means that they'll\nhave massive fluctuations in actual weight depending\non a few different factors. For example, if I were to use, let's say a dark roast,\nmedium ground coffee and I have a perfect level scoop of that, that might weigh around\nseven, seven and a half grams. If I went for a light\nroast finer ground coffee, that might weigh eight,\neight and a half grams, well over 10% more, and\nthat's me being really careful in loading the same volume each time. It's very easy to have small variances in that volume result\nin pretty big variances in the gram weight that you're using. In the day-to-day morning coffee brewing, using scoops will mean that some days your coffee is good\nand some days it's not. Even though you seemingly\ndid the same thing, but volumetric measurements,\nthey're just not very reliable. Then there's the other\ncommonly used ratios of like one to 14, one to 15, one to 16. These break my head, I\ncan't deal with these. They kind of work\ncompletely backwards to me. Those kinds of ratios are pretty useful. If you know how much\nground coffee you have and you wanna work out how\nmuch coffee you can make. That is never a problem\nI have, in the mornings. Usually, I have a desired amount of coffee that I wanna brew and I wanna work out, how much ground coffee I need, you know what weight of\ncoffee I need to start with. So, using a one to 15 ratio. I can't do the maths on that, if I need 500 mL of coffee, I'm not dividing 500 by 15\nfirst thing in the morning. However, if you give me a grams per liter, well, if I'm brewing\nhalf a liter than I need. If at 60 grams a liter,\nthen I need half that, which is 30 that's not, I don't need my phone and\na calculator for that. I can just do a quick little bit of maths. I like it also because typically a cup, an average cup is about 250 mL of brewing or about eight ounces and\nthat scales really nicely. Whether I'm making one or\ntwo or three or four or more, two to the grams per liter ratio. You know I'm using half\na liter, a full liter, three quarters of a liter. The maths is never complicated. And there's one other kind of ratio that deserves a special place in hell. The mixed unit ratio, if you are recommending grams per ounce, get out, get out, go\naway, you do not belong. Just get, that's all. What are you doing? That's the worst thing in the world. Don't, ah, I mean, you know, the Imperial, I have no time for that to begin with, but don't be mixing Imperial\nand metric that is no, stop it. Rant aside. We end up at grams per liter. I think it's a really\nnice, neat way to work. So if it's a 60 grams per\nliter doing the mass with that, that's very, very easy. It's very, very usable. And this leads us into the\nsecond part of this video. What is the right amount of\ncoffee per liter of water? And this is a really important point that becomes a little bit complicated. There is no correct ratio. There is only preference. The ratio of coffee to water you use is really gonna determine\nhow strong the end cup of coffee is, how strong\nyou like your coffee. that's up to you, right? That's, your decision. I shouldn't get a say. I'll give a good starting point, right? Like I think 60 grams per liter is a pretty good one-size-fits-all. Most people are happy with\nthe resulting strength of a good brew, but you\ncan choose 55, 50, 75 that's up to you. But, there's one complicating factor in the world of coffee brewing\nand that is extraction. I'll give a very quick\nprimer on extraction. In ground coffee, about approximately, about a third of it is soluble material. It could be dissolved by water. Two thirds of it pretty much is insoluble. It's cellulose, it's kind of wood. You could steep that coffee,\nbrew their coffee forever. You still have some grounds left over that you would throw away afterwards. You don't want everything that is soluble and available in coffee. You want, broadly speaking, for the sake of easy maths\nin the video to come, about to 20%. Some would prefer a little\nbit more, 22, maybe 23, maybe even more, but let's\nsay for the sake of argument about 20%. If you do a good job\nof brewing your coffee, that will have a nice resulting strength, but if you didn't do a good\njob, brewing that coffee, that 60 grams liter would\nproduce a weaker cup. Let's say, you under extracted it, you ground it to too coarse,\nyou brew too quickly, however it happened, you\nend up with a weak cup. So if you're trying to change your ratio, if you're trying to work\nout your ideal ratio, you only want to change the ratio, once you're really happy with the taste. If you've brewed a cup of coffee and you think that was delicious, I just wish it was a fraction stronger. That's the time to change your ratio. If you brew a cup of coffee and\nyou think that's a bit weak, it's a bit sour, it's\nnot really delicious. Don't change your ratio. Change your extraction. Grind a little finer,\nsteep, a little longer, agitate a little bit more. Those things need to be fixed first before you mess with your ratio. Once you're happy with\ntaste, sure experiment. In my life, I kinda\nwandered around in terms of what I prefer in\nterms of the end strength of my cup of coffee. It's a personal thing. Whatever you like is okay. There is no one answer to this question. This brings us into the\nthird part of this video, which is why I might recommend\nusing a different ratio for different brewing methods. Now you can broadly divide\nall coffee brewing methods into two camps. Percolation and infusion. Now with percolation,\nwater is passing through a bed of coffee. In infusion, all of the\nwater, and all of the coffee are hanging out together\nduring the brew time. A pour-over is percolation. A French press, an AeroPress. Those are infusion methods. Now, I would recommend using\na little bit more coffee for an infusion method than\nI would for a pour-over for a percolation method. I'll explain why. Let's imagine for the sake of argument, we're gonna brew a liter of coffee and we're gonna use 60 grams per liter. That's a good starting point, and in this theoretical brew, we're gonna extract 20%\nof the coffee, right? So it means that of those 60 grams, about 12 grams were dissolved and brought into the liquid coffee. Now when you brew a percolation, when you brew a pour-over, not all of the water that you\npour in, ends up in the brew. Typically, about two grams per\ngram of coffee get absorbed by the ground coffee. That bed still contains\na good amount of water and that water never really got involved in the brewing process. So what you have in the\nresulting brew, is 12 grams of coffee dissolved in round\nabout 880 grams of water. If you take a French press\nand you do the same thing, you brew 60 grams per liter, those 12 grams of solubles\nthat we've extracted, that 20% extraction, that's now dissolved into a thousand grams of water. All a thousand grams we're\ninvolved in the brewing process and those solubles are distributed amongst the whole thing, that\nmakes that brew weaker, even though it's the same extraction. That's why if you want\na similar extraction and a similar strength, I would recommend using more\ncoffee, in my infusions. 70 grams, maybe 75 grams\nper liter of water. If you dive into extraction theory and you start playing the refractometers, you'll notice that the\nsoftware does ask you to specify if it's an\nimmersion or a percolation, because it does affect your\nextraction calculations. But more than that, it really just affects the strength and the taste. So that's why with any infusion brew, any brew where all of\nthe ground is in contact with all of the brew water\nfor a period of time, even if in the case of an AeroPress, you're gonna push that liquid through the bed of coffee at the end. It was still an infusion. Any pour-over I would recommend\nabout 60 grams a liter. Any infusion brew, I'd recommend\nabout 75 grams a liter. I think those are both\ngreat starting points, but they're not the answer. Don't take it as gospel. Find your own way. Find your own preferences. If they are too weak too\nstrong, well change them. Being consistent in how you brew, and that means weighing the\namount of coffee going in and ideally weighing\nthe amount of water too means that you actually\nunderstand what's affecting your morning coffee. You don't have to make decisions, you don't have to guesstimate the amount of water you poured in\nor the amount of coffee you're brewing, especially frankly, before you've had coffee. So, get a set of scales. This is a great starting point. I'd love to hear what\nyou're brewing at home. I'd love also to hear\nmore about your journey. Has this changed for you over time? Have you gone weaker? Have you gone stronger? Are you kinda bouncing\naround all over the place. I'd be really interested\nto hear what you're doing. As always, thank you so much for watching. I hope you have a great day. Dammit.", "2jwask38l94": "There are several parts to know when\nfilling and adjusting a pepper mill. The peppercorns are ground in the base the\ncorns are stored in the middle shaft and the top is where you fill the pepper\nmill. To fill remove the small silver nut. With the lid off grip your fingers\naround the ledge of the opening to form a very basic funnel as you pour the\ncorns into the storage chamber. Make sure not to overfill. As you replace the top\nyou can adjust the size of the grind by either tightening or loosening the\nsilver nut. For a larger grind leave the bolt fairly loose. Here is an example of\na more coarsely ground pepper. For a more medium-sized grind\ntighten the bolt slightly. For a finer grind twist the bolt on tightly. If you\ntake the time to adjust your pepper mill it can produce the exact type of grind\nyou need for your recipe.

It's gonna include this bag of\noranges and your cell phone. I'm Ken Steepe, and welcome\nback to McCann Dogs.

We publish new videos every single week to help you spend some quality time with your four-legged family member. Now I need to give some credit\nwhere credit is due here. One of our instructors sort of put me on to this idea with the oranges, and I really appreciate\nthose sort of tips. And I'm sure you guys will\nappreciate them as well. So this first tip is great for you guys who have a dog who has hairy toes. Sometimes it can be really challenging if you have a dog that\nhas excessively hairy toes trying to clip around that hair. You're constantly trying to move it around and see where the toenail is, and see where the quick\nof your dog's nail is. This first tip is for you. So I want you to take that bag\nof oranges that you've got, and dump all of the oranges out. We're actually just gonna use the bag for this household hack. We're gonna use the\nlittle holes in the bag to go around Slam's nails, and it's gonna actually hold\nthe fur on his toes back just enough that we can really\nsee the nails really well. So I'm actually gonna bunch\nthis bag up a little bit, and you could these tiny\nlittle holes are perfect. I'm gonna take Slam's foot, and I'm just gonna slip\nhis toenails through. Oh, you can see actually Slam's, Slam needs a bit of a toenail clipping. But at this point, I wouldn't even worry about getting all of the toenails through, but just keep them separated enough. And you could see that that bag holds the fur back really well, and we could very clearly see that Slam is due for a clipping. Now that we've got\nSlam's toenails exposed, another great household\nhack is your cell phone. Now every cell phone seems to have a flashlight on it nowadays, so we're gonna turn on that flashlight. I'm gonna set it on the ground with the flashlight facing up. Now all I need to do is\nhold Slam's toes, toenails, over top of that light. And I can very clearly\nsee where Slam's quick is, and that way, I can avoid cutting it. Now look at how easy\nit is to see the quick in Slam's nail there, and\nit makes it a lot easier to make sure that we're\nnot clipping that quick. (clippers click) And you know the darker\nspot on his toenail will be where the quick is, and we're gonna try to avoid\nthat as we're clipping. Slam isn't really the kind of dog who loves having his toenails clipped, so anything we can do\nto make this experience just a little bit easier\nis absolutely worth it. You see the nail really\nhighlights that nail, or the light really highlights that nail. Now if you have the kind of dog who just doesn't like\nhaving their feet handled, we've published a video not that long ago, and I'll link it in a card above, that'll make your dog a\nlittle bit more comfortable with having their feet or\nany really body part handled. If you have a dog who has furry toes or if you have a friend who\nhas a dog with hairy feet, this hack, this orange bag\nhack, is perfect for you guys. And if you have a dog with darker nails, be sure to use that\ncell phone light trick. It's really nice to be able\nto visualize the quick, so that you don't end up cutting it when you're trimming their nails.

(drill whirring) Let's try and fix that\ntoday in GardenFork. Ready? Here we go. Make, fix, grow, cook. GardenFork. Unplug this, I've actually started to take apart power tools\nand then realized that this was still plugged in. Don't do that, okay? This is one of these projects where I knew this was broken for quite a while. And today, I actually need\nto use my hammer drill. This is a really good\nhammer drill by the way. I've beat this thing into the ground. But sparks are coming\nout of it and I ordered the parts for it a really long time ago, and it sat taped to it like this forever until I needed the hammer drill. But more importantly,\nyou're here to find out why sparks are coming out of your drill. So unplug the puppy and take it apart. There are screws on one side of the drill. No screws on this side. Phillips, (drill whirring) nice. Don't lose these. (drill whirring loudly) Put all these, no, I mean put all these where you're not gonna lose them. (screws clanging in can) Like in a can. Learn from me. You're gonna need to\nput these things back. Gotta do this uh, carefully,\ncause things might come springing out of it. Oh, it goes all the way here. I thought the plastic part of the housing was separate from the metal part here. Oh! It's all plastic. Well, plastic-ey. See it's silver, but\nthen underneath is red. See, I thought this was metal. But anyway, it is a good drill. I'll link to it below.\nI've used this...a lot. (drill whirring) There we go. This may have fallen out\nwhen we were taking it apart but it looks like... that might be a part of the problem. That's supposed to be up here. This is the trigger. That\nis a switch that sends electrical power to these two\nbrushes here. Here and here. And this is the commutator and\nthis spins using this coil, and powers the gears that turn the drill. And I think that these\nbrushes here are burnt out and doing the sparking.\nBut the fact that this spring was loose in\nhere, that did fall out when I pulled the case off. I hate throwing things out. And this is one of those things where I'm pretty sure I can fix this, so I won't throw it out.\nI've ordered some parts I think that are broken and\nit sits in the to-do pile. Kinda like that chainsaw\nthat I fixed the other day. (chainsaw revving) So this always starts\nbut as soon as I rev it, it dies. (chainsaw slows then dies) What's wrong? I'll link below to that video. But um, it sat in the\nto-do pile for a while and I put a new chainsaw,\nput new chainsaw parts in it, chainsaw works now. This, this looks like this spring may have broken off in here. So I'm\ngonna study the existing, intact spring and see up\nhere if I can fix this. So you and I will try this. If I'm doing something wrong, let me know in the comments\ncause I'm...(trails off) Well, I'm sure you're gonna let me know in the comments anyway. So, let's go. (metal bits clanking against plastic) Oh look, these are the brushes, these are the brush holders. This is a spring, looks very familiar. This is the spring holder. This broke off, but really nicely, the new part has that on there. That's very nice. So if\nthis broke off the old one, the new one has it connected to it. These are brushes, I don't know\nwhy they're called brushes. Someone will tell us in the comments. They're carbon, they're like\npencil lead but really thick. And they make motors go around.

So, if this thing, if\nyou have one of these and you can't get it to\nwork, put it back together and give it to your kid\nand let 'em take it apart and maybe they'll learn.\nThat's how I learned, basically my dad would\nbring home stuff that was broken and I would take\nit apart and I was just curious about how it worked\nand sometimes we fixed it. Sometimes we didn't but... This is an amazing\npiece of machinery here. So if you can't, or just\nbring your kid along, and say, \"hey I'm gonna fix this thing, let's try and figure it out together.\" This is the one that's broken,\nso let's take that out. This, oh man if this works,\nthat would be really cool. Don't let screws fall into here, okay? Bad things can happen. Okay, so how is this\nwire connected to that? That's what I'm curious about. So there is the brush. So this is the brush. A piece of carbon. Kinda\nsparky there, see that? Sparks. This is the housing that holds it. And this is the wire. Yeah it does, look at that. So this disconnects from that right there. Since I have two of these, I'm\ngonna replace this one also. (loud gusting) Okay the furnace just turned on. Um. I'm talking over the furnace then. So this used to be shiny, right here. And we're gonna make it shiny\nagain. This is 600 sandpaper. And I'm just going to turn the motor, and clean it. Well it might be easier, it's probably easier\nif I just go like this. See how it's shiny again? If you happen to have\nsome of this electronic parts cleaner, just hit this real quick. Then I'm gonna take this\nnew brush and slip it into the holder here. That goes in there... And we press it in there. It's back in. Make sure\nthe wire is still attached. Very good. So now we're\ngonna put the new part in with a new brush and a new spring. All kinda tiny but,\nlet's see what happens. See that little notch right there? That is held in by the spring like that. You're probably thinking\nthat thought, right? I'm not gonna forget to\nconnect the power wire. I usually do. I'll put the\nwhole thing back together and then I'll have forgot that the wire that runs the whole thing,\nI forgot to connect that. This little wire? (clicks tongue) Okay, you just, I just put it on. And you're like me, I\nbet you are cause you'll, like you'll put the whole thing together and you forget one little\nwasher or something. All right put this thing\ntogether, fingers crossed. (drill whirring) Moment of truth. (hammer drill whirs to life) How cool is that? You fixed a drill.

face it If you're making cold brew at home, from scratch, you're addicted to coffee. And maybe, well, probably just caffeine as a whole. But that's okay. Let me be of assistance. Why \"cold brew\" right? Why? Cold brew vs Iced Coffee Cold brew extracts the coffee very slowly over a long period of time which limits the amount of acidity and bitterness that is already involved in coffee making. The heat in coffee tends to extract a little bit of bitterness and much more acidity. Whereas with cold brew, you got a lower acidity, lower bitterness And an overall smoother flavor. And more importantly, a higher -- wow that is a lot of saliva My mouth is obviously getting excited for cold brew. Plus not to mention a much higher caffeine content so -- You're welcome. Now with cold brew comes good beans. Obviously that's kind of a given but you know, use your favorite or ideally use a locally sourced, maybe a freshly roasted coffee. Some sites say that older coffee is better but that is up to you. Now we're going to be doing two different methods. But they both use the same grind consistency and same ratio of coffee:water. Now we're going to start off by grinding 1.5 cups (80g) of coffee beans. Now when you're grinding the coffee, keep in mind that you want the grind consistency to be relatively course, something like course cornmeal. Then simply add that coffee to a half gallon container. In this case, I used a half gallon mason jar. They're really great and they're cheap. Now for Method 1 which is the Immersion Cold Brew method. So to these beans you're going to add 6 cups (1400g) of cold or room temp water. Either/or, you just don't want it to be hot. Ideally filtered. Give that a good stir to make sure you've hydrated all the grounds. Put a lid on it and place it in the fridge for 12-24 hours. 24 hours will make a much stronger brew. And 12 hours will make a pretty light brew. Now for Method 2, the Hot Bloom method. This is essentially the same thing but this time you're only going to add 1/3 of your water which has been heated up until it's steaming hot, not quite boiling but pretty hot. And if you want to be specific, probably 205 degrees F Give that a little stir to hydrate the beans And let it sit for 1 minute, no more no less. Then immediatly after that minute add the remaining 4 cups of water and make sure that water is cold. So you want to cool this mixture right back down. Yet again, give it another stir. Put a lid on it and in the fridge for 12-24 hours. Now once that 12-24 hours is up Remove it from the fridge and now we gotta strain it. Now since I've give you two different methods to brew the cold brew It only seems right to give you two different methods to strain it. Now the first one, would be through a fine mesh strainer with cheesecloth laid over it. Downside and drawback of this method is that if you strain it through this and you're grinder doesn't get a super consistent grind then it's gonna be a little bit gritty. You're gonna get a little bit of grittiness through there. So this may not be a good choice for everybody. Now the other method that I've figured out is pouring through a pour-over type coffee situation. So I'm basically pouring it through the filter of the pour-over AKA my Chemex. And this actually filters out all the grounds. So it's super smooth, no gritty Literally zero grittiness no matter how inconsistent your grinder is. Takes a bit longer but hey, it works. Now you can also get this thing called a CoffeeSock. It basically brews it and strains it for you. I'll put a link in the description if you want to get it. I personally don't use one but a lot of people have been DMing me on Instagram about it So I thought I'd give it a little shout out. So that is it, Cold brew coffee. I don't really know what else to say. It's coffee. It's iced. It's got a lot of caffeine in it. Much more than regular iced coffee. And whichever method you choose, I trust you.

I'm going to show you how to make a French\npress. First there's a few things you're going to\nneed. You're going to need some fresh coffee, preferably\nwhole bean in which case you'll also need a grinder. You'll need a timer and then you'll also need\nthe French press. So the first thing you're going to do is weigh\nout the beans. I like to use 25 grams of coffee for this\nsize French press. Now if you don't have a scale, you can also\njust do three rounded scoops. So you can go ahead and grind this coffee. So this is ground medium coarse. You can play around with the grind setting\nafter making it a couple of times. If it's tasting too bitter and too strong,\nyou might be using a little bit too fine of a grind. And if it's a little bit watery and weak,\nthen it might be too coarse. So you take the French press, and you're going\nto want to preheat it. You can either take water off a boil, have\na nice water tower here. Then you let that sit for a while so it gets\nup to heat. Alright, so after the French press is preheated,\nyou want to dry it out then add the grounds. Now again, I definitely recommend getting\na scale, it just makes brewing coffee easier. But if you don't have one, you just want to\nuse about 12 and a half ounces of water for this size. So I'm going to go ahead and add the water\nto the French press. The first amount I'm going to add is just\nenough to soak the grounds at the bottom of the press. So adding that in... so just that much water\nthere. And then just stir it around to incorporate\nall the grounds with the water and start the timer. And you actually just let that sit there for\n30 seconds. I would also recommend covering it when you're\nnot doing anything to keep the heat intact. Alright, after 30 seconds you're going to\nadd the rest of the water. Now this is either 12 and a half ounces or\n400 grams of water. Once you've added all of that, just give it\nanother gentle stir. And you put the plunger on and then you're\ngoing to let that sit until 3 and a half minutes. So after 3 and a half minutes you're going\nto press the plunger down. And this is another way you can tell if you've\nground too coarse or too fine. If it goes without any resistance, it's going\nto be too coarse. And then if you have a really difficult time\npressing down it's going to be too fine. Then I recommend decanting the French press\nbefore serving, because if you leave it sitting there it will actually keep extracting and\nend up tasting bitter. So once you've done that, you can just let\nit cool down and it's ready to serve.", "yFYoWLsWB7A": "hi I'm Davina with for complete comm and today we're going to show you how to crush whole black

in your shop that's pretty amazing I need to learn how to Photoshop photos that'd be pretty good so big thing your other foot perfect okay yeah it's perfect everything is nice and flat but this one I'm just going to tell the camera how you you have all the nails are thick on this foot nothing another one no hard skin on the side of this tool but this one hard skin and the big thing is because you have this bunion [Music] yeah this bunion that causes the total to go sideways is working differently all the pressure is on the side of the foot and that can change the way you walk the toes start gripping the ground we get more pressure and that's what caused all the nails to grow things that brown or black is dry blood and you said this one's a little sore that's told now when you put pressure on it walking is no problem okay but pressure when I go like this a little sensitive right no it's better that's good so this is dry blood so what will happen as the new nail grows in the old nail that's the discolored will grow out oh but I'm gonna try to follow everything down I know you're worried about fungus but this nail although these are just thick and damaged I really don't think there's fungus they're just thick in damaged nail we get a hold of extra pressure so we're gonna find out when we file everything down but they looks good to me these this is a flip that just needs regular maintenance well nothing should hurt so I'm gonna trim all the nails and then I'm gonna file everything smooth and then take off that dead skin and so your doctor just referred you right here right yeah going to her yeah she said let it go to see the podiatrist okay so anything is too sensitive you let me know do you have trouble cutting these nails yourself yeah my wife's cuts it so are you okay yeah very very thick they're not easy to cut yes yeah it's a hard time cutting you two will only use nail cutters not the special tool like you have the wire cutters like mine are so I'm gonna trim as much as I can yeah and then I'm gonna file everything smooth so a lot of the times people who have a thick Antonio think it looks I think it's fungus but not boys sometimes it's just a damaged nail due to dropping something on your toe tight shoes in the past what happens a lot when you have a bunion it makes your foot wider so the shoe on this foot is tighter and I've put some more pressure on the nails yeah and can cause them to grow thicker with time you okay and I think I'll show you that's it make it go faster a lot of people say that but to me not really because the nails are not like bone oh they're made of keratin which is the same kind of stuff your hair is made of so it's a little different yeah no they're just tough and thick because you're just a tough guy that's why tough guy needs tough nails mm-hmm so I can see there's dry blood underneath here yeah okay she is a hard time cutting there too well that's why when I suggest this maybe every couple months yeah you come in here to have the nail trim down and that way you don't have to or your wife has to suffer or or deal with these thick hard to cut nails you okay yeah so when I trim everything back the attached nail to me looks pretty healthy everything looks nice and smooth yeah well attach not yellowish like fungus where there's mold or different colors when I scrape down some of the dead skin on this side okay okay we'll take down some of this callus as well okay nothing should hurt so if anything sensitive you let me know this is just dead skin but unfortunately because of the way your toes working with that bunion this is probably something that's always gonna come back you okay over here sir so I'm also gonna use that file to smooth down the skin a little bit more okay I'm just going to get the majority down with the scalpel and then we'll smooth everything out didn't used to have one underneath back here no below there no nothing here no it's good you got a baby foot on the bottom that's nice and smooth nothing should hurt sore or sensitive or a little bit of heat you let me know this is the important part because that's what's gonna keep these nails thin for a very long time okay so you ready yeah a little bit of water that's right it's like a dentist drill [Music] [Music] four years at university and then it's three years after university feet [Music] no no it's just an advanced diploma just for just for what we call property [Music] the boy for years death right in Toronto P in society [Music] doctor of chiropractic yet [Music] in Toronto yeah and in Toronto oh yeah she'll last you three months we're just following some of those that skin on the side [Music] so this is the big things a lot of people a lot of people would have seen your thick toenails and think right away you have fungus but after filing everything down everything looks really good to me I don't know if you're able to see sir yeah but these two yeah nice and pink and they're one color underneath they're not multicolored that's typical of fungus this is just a thickened damaged toenail at the top there's a little bit yellowish but that's the thick hardened skin mm-hmm same with your big toe too after trimming everything that's lifted everything is attached in pink this is just damaged tissue at the front that's what's causing the nail to grow thick your second tool has really been bruised pretty pretty good and so this is gonna take usually six months to a year to grow out the new nail grows in it's gonna grow nice and pink and healthy and this this colored part grows out because I filed them smooth this is gonna last a long time they don't grow long they just grow thick so in three to four months you can come back we can file them down and then I'll be fine okay okay you can still trim the length but there's not gonna be that much length that really grows just just thick so your wife can definitely help with you trimming the length but whenever these get thick that'll be the time to come in okay okay but looks much better you", "i-EYN120xeU": "[Music] [Music] the 21 000 with the load when the eleven thousand were lower either on the indian brand so either

won't work well so this is where now we start every two months we come in to the office I trim everything back I filed it very thin and you apply this Julia twice a day morning and night as a new nail grows and healthy this bad fungal part should move out the one thing you need to know with certain ethnicities people have darker skin we get a black nail we get these dark lines in it there's a lot of that dark discoloration down here that might never go away but this fungally stuff in the front should so we got both fungus and both big toes if anything is too sensitive you let me know so this is all dead lifted nail you got a nice sandal tan yeah how long have you been back I just came a couple of on Sunday oh yeah videos I wanted to come on Monday about their disease oh yeah we're you're busy unfortunately so I'm just going to trim this nice and short do you cut your own toenails do you cut your own Tony oh yeah new credit card do they have that much opening to cut these well so one of our I can put this so I try hard a bit from size here at the air it already but not the really that's why so what I would say is if you try to use the nail nipper on this nail get rid of it you get a fresh new nail nipper one for the smaller toes and a separate one for the these big toe nails and after use its you know soap and water try to get the dust off you can put it in Bleach rubbing alcohol they won't really kill it but at least they'll try to make it a little bit cleaner but pretty much we should be coming in here every two months that way you don't have to really cut your big toenail anymore I'll do that for you you can leave all the all the fun for me so first I'm gonna trim as much and then we're gonna file it really thin no pain so see all this this is all fungal debris yes yeah it's not fun to have it's actually eating the nail yeah and so what people don't realize if they're not exposing the nail fungus if they're not filing it down the topicals not going to work yeah it will not work yeah yeah because the skin covers yep the skin covers it the nail covers it yeah so the size of your nail actually look attached I'm trying to trim this part but it seems a little bit attached so I think this is about it for the lifted portion I'm going to trim the other toenail and then I'm gonna file this one down you let me know but the more I file off the better penetration we have of the medicine so a little bit of cool water do you feel hey just let me know so these alerts lions and a nail that's always gonna be there that's his genetics but all that really bad discoloration that should be going away him that that was in the top of the nail [Music] any pain no pain I'm going to get a little sensitive so that's normal so when you do feel okay so you can see that big hole where the fungus was living I know it's authentic almost I'm a little bit more if we can expose all that now be much better so you find that medicine twice a day every day you see where that nail ends yeah I should move forward it will reattach and then everything just grows up takes one year for a new nail to grow from bottom to top so the fact that's just past halfway we're looking around eight months it looks much better it doesn't it yeah yeah that's good looks much better you're gonna file it a little bit more [Music] they're perfect no more than we're all done you",

really great results for more information about our products please visit our website", "id2GLt8Nd4s": "in today's video we're going to see if it's possible to turn a cast-iron pan into a functioning mirror guys I love a good cast-iron pan like this one this one happens to be Lodge brand but that's just because they're kind of the most common and cheapest to get your hands on cast-iron pans used to come much smoother they would actually sand them out there called cast iron because they are cast in iron and the method of casting is with sand casting they take the shape of the cast iron pan they press it into sand and then they pour the molten iron down into it and the texture that we have all over is from that sand the sand itself leaves this sort of grit pattern everywhere and well I've had great results using cast iron pans with that in theory they work better when they're smooth and I don't just want to smooth this down I want to see how smooth I can get it I want to take this down to the point where it's so shiny I can use it as a mirror here's the basic idea we've got a classic cast iron cooking pan we're gonna see if it's possible through sandpaper and polish to bring it up to a true and brilliant shine and if we can get a mirror finish on it how well will it cook I'm not gonna do the whole pan I'm just gonna try and do that on the flat bottom surface but that's the goal I want it to be so reflective I can see myself in it and see myself in it pretty well so that's gonna take a lot of grinding I'm gonna stir it out with this grinder I've got a whole bunch of these grinding flap wheels I'm then gonna move on to a rotary sander and then even some polish after that the sander goes down to like 3000 grit sandpaper and I think at that point if I start hitting with polish it should work pretty well so this is gonna probably be a lot of time lapsing with some updates in between this is also going to be very loud and throwing iron dust everywhere so I'm gonna be wearing dust masks I'm gonna be wearing glasses and for the noise I'm gonna be wearing earplugs all the safety equipment because it's not gonna go quick and it's gonna throw a lot of metal dust in the air I don't want to breathe that in or get it in my eyes or hear my loud machines so here goes that seems like it should be a pretty good angle to work on starting off with a 36 grit flap wheel here even with this I think I'm probably going to go through several of these before I get this down smooth enough to move up to the next level let's give a shot this is just gonna be a lot of elbow grease here [Music] all right quick update I've switched to these glasses because I think they have better coverage and form more of a seal against my face I felt like I was getting some dust in my eyes there's also a lot of dust all over the table already so what we're gonna do is leave the vacuum running right here to try and catch more of that hopefully it'll help back to the ground [Music] [Music] making good progress however I probably got like lines on my face from the amount of dust even with the glasses that fit closer to my face I take them off and there's still dust on the inside and I feel like it's getting in my eyes so we're gonna take this one step farther and I'm actually going to try and use tape to seal up the edges around my glasses I should be wearing like swim goggles for this I don't have any of those here this is why if you ever watch Alex steel and he's like doing stuff then grinding room he has that whole helmet face mask on with a pack on the back it's pumping filtered air in and through so that but nothing can get in on the sides the way this is to me so I should have that going I don't own one of those so I'm gonna go with just the dust mask on my face Bowl pretty tight and I'm literally just gonna seal up the sides of my glasses of the tape see how that goes I might go back to these bigger ones though just so I have more light visibility and that way the tape isn't like in my eyebrows as much my glasses are now taped to my face covering most if not all of the seals I'm hoping that will do a better job of keeping some of the dust out of my eyes so I just hit this with the sixty grit I started with a thirty grit now I did the 60 and now I'm gonna move up to I think I got a 120 grit and after that I'm gonna move on to my little rotary sander instead of this thing [Music] as an update I have now sanded up through 3000 grit sandpaper and this is smooth feeling like this is what you'd expect stainless steel to feel like not cast-iron it's not a mirror but if I get about that far away I can see really good I know that's really close but I can see a lot of detail I had a friend in the Army once and he told me that polishing his boots they knew it was acceptable when you could smile and see the lines in your teeth it's kind of a guide for what I'm going for in terms of shininess now at this point I with the right lighting I can see that from like a foot away or so so I'm pretty happy it is very smooth I'm now about to move on to polish so this is a cotton wheel I've got on the grinder I'm just gonna go up through from courses polish to the smoothest polish and of course there's gonna be a little bit of a residue left on so it's not a perfect system I really should have six different wheels for this but I'm not really worried overall I think it's gonna work out decently well this is probably already about the smoothest cast-iron pan that's ever been made but we can go smoother so here we go [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] there's a shiny pan it's not perfect this is not a perfect mirror like a glass mirror but it's for seeing lines my teeth yeah that's doing pretty good there are sandpaper swirl marks probably from the 1000 to 1500 grit sandpaper still visible in there I didn't do a good enough job of taking those out when I went up to the higher grit it can be hard to tell to get a real mirror polish on something you often have to go back and say like okay I bring it up to a shine level oh and now I can see where I had problems before and I have to go back down to that level and do it again so for the two and a half hours that I've put into this so far I am quite pleased with it I do think this is probably about the shiniest cast iron pan that's ever been made I'm gonna take this home and I'm going to try to season it seasoning is the process by which you use oil to sort of baked into the cast iron the cast iron has little micro pores that absorb the oil you heat it up to a certain temperature it goes past its smoke point and it actually hardens so what we've got is some flaxseed oil and that's supposed to give the nice hardest shell problem with it is normally that the surface you're applying that oil to is not quite as shiny as this so it's probably going to have a tendency to beat up and pull away and not stick really well to the cast iron I'm gonna do the best I can I'm actually gonna hit this with a fairly strong detergent try and get rid of all the extra polish and stuff that there is may be embedded in it try and soak all that out and then I'm gonna go through the process you heat up the pan a little bit you take oil spread it all the parts of the pan not just the shiny part you put it in your oven at about 450 degrees for like an hour you take it out and it should have baked the oil into the iron a little bit you can do a few layers of that and you often want to do multiple when you've taken it down so there's no seasoning left on the pan like I've just done and gone way past so I'll try alright we are now doing the inaugural cooking test this is seasoned with three layers of flaxseed oil and it's stuck to the bottom of the pan actually much better than I thought it was I was worried that because it was so smooth it was just beat up and we wouldn't get an even coating but by getting it hot and then spreading on hot it seems to have been absorbed pretty well we've got what looks like a decent shell it's not like 100% even if you were to get really close in you to see a lot of little speckle bits but everything is coated at least somewhat and you can see it's still really nice and reflective although now it's more of a bronze color than the silver was before you can still make out like the reflection of that Windex bottle there the blue color even off of the brownish orange surface very nice and shiny very slick and we're gonna try the classic cast iron test of a fried egg we'll see if it like slides and moves around really easily or if something has gone terribly wrong and it just like sticks on worse than anything yeah see that that wasn't supposed to happen it wasn't supposed to run like that sloppy Nate sloppy you know because this is my spatula and it's like 1/8 third to a quarter of an inch thick these might end up as scrambled eggs hmm that does not look like it's working great I'm gonna try one more egg just kind of next to this one and this time I'm gonna try putting down a little cooking spray and hopefully not cracking the yolk no guarantees on that yolk is intact still do not have a really great flipping tool fried eggs go this first one I'm giving myself about a D grade it could be worse but I'd have to try pretty hard for a second one little bit of it seemed like it was just sliding really nice I'm just gonna let it cook I know sometimes the protein of egg can like loose its bonds as it cooks against the surface a little bit but that is about as stuck to a frying pan as I have ever seen egg beat oh that actually did come up pretty good though not all the way but that could be a poor distribution of oil as proud of the problem [Music] Oh yep I am losing some of the seasoning right here as I try and scrape the egg off you can see how it's turning silver in there I think the oil isn't able to bond very well with the pan just because of how smooth it got can you take a cast-iron pan to a mirror finish pretty well it's not a perfect mirror well I think I did a pretty good job and got it quite shiny I even managed to season it but in terms of being good for cooking one egg managed to damage the seasoning so much that it just stripped right off and part of that was because I started using a fairly aggressive sponge on it but some of it came up even before I just use my fingernails and it just kind of chewed right through it so maybe if I were better about always oiling the pan as I'm using it it could last I'm not saying that it's impossible to make this work but just the method that I've done it obviously still has some problems probably not worth the amount of effort it takes to get it to that point maybe just taking down the surface a little bit we'll get you something smoother that'll cook better but really the goal was to see if we could get a reflective surface and we did do that I'm just not saying it's worth it to do that in terms of cooking guys that's not at all you know we've always got more for you to see click that box up the top to check out our most recent video and we'll see you the next one talk to you then [Music] you", "DWRDfyYlzL0": "[Music] he is hardworking all doing well today I have come to you all with not cooking recipe I'm going to show how to clean this Indian kind of a yellow color which I bought recently when I will feel yeah I think about it what I'm going to do is this has a grip mat of mine which are which I don't want to get it messed up so I'm just going to put this so that all that and everything can be removed I will show y'all how I am going to clean this because this Lord dust it's never being used and it's used for the first time when you wash this in plain water I'm not going to do anything I'm just going to use some plain water and then rinse it and clean and then I will show you how I'm going to clean up this stone [Music] eight to ten kilos a lot things don't like to meet like how you look like it has been my Vista by this and I have been on TV or black black kind of you know remaining feeling so couple of times we need to do a good cleaning and only then you can start using it otherwise you just can't use it like how you buy and dislike that you can't use this you need to do some a bit of cleaning and a bit of grinding work if that's what you need to do what I am done is like I have talked about a teaspoon of the wheat the normal beat see this is a normal weight or to have it me I have soaked it for about three to four hours and that's am going to grind that in this reason be when I grind this why would you use the wheat reason being once I use the a wheat here what happens is if the this will go into all this area of this place because what they have done is they have miss capture has being done on this and all this marks everything dirt has been accumulated see the way I am doing like as you can see this lot of dirt coming see black black so you cannot use it at a staff first time itself you cannot use it so what do you have to do this first grind ensure you grind and you reach the entire area everywhere with this you know with a wheat face what happened to be to meet what it does is much eat give special and see how the color of that have changed so you have a over again see hope they're treating that it's become now so you have to reach all of the area corners andrey way i put this paper here because if i have left it like that only what would happen is like all dirt will drip onto this and my matter become dirty and my drip fat happened you know so i don't like it so see how the colors changed and also i have to keep in mind to roll my stone adze when you just I'm loving it I have been watching this from soul many years and all the time I hope I would find it like a prequel I was not interested to buy big one you know and I wanted small ones which are very handy and I can use it like I'm just going to rub maybe there see just nicely everything so that you can make out from the wheat color of the BTS change you see how black it has become see it looks much cleaner right now I'm very keen use that I have more left of the reach today whatever and then more people do is like we strain the rice you get that water the starch water every day when we are going to use it B what we will do is we'll pour that starch water also onto this and then soak it for about five minutes and then again cleaning so you can move quite a bit of cleaning it doesn't just come like that let me run my roller 22 all the area it doesn't name to date when I can't use it in three days I like to do for at least couple of days until I find my the stone becomes neat when I am putting this masala and the grinding wheat or the rice whatever I put it should come out neat so that means I'm terms of style this kind of has to be done I bought this date chips from here itself which is quite nice but different kind of stone juices and very handy and they even say about for all my torrents everything I can is crushing take it out from this you know I need not use a mixer jar I don't mind the same believe me the Queen come up with curry and everything what you do that from grinding and using something different now I have done with the wheat okay now I'm going to grind that same one with some more rice I was twice grinding this also in that same women how I have done the wheat and then let me try see we the rice flour will give you a good indication if the rice flour comes out white that means it is all completely done if it is not done that if it doesn't come out clearly that means it still needs this kind of cleaning and everything the rice [Music] see their eyes are still not white color it's telling order to make the go it'll give us more suggestion but it will be going not like this little tiny one this is a ad for only small families we are just three of a service more than interference but caressing our house is to have bigger one but only I'd wanted difficult on this part is like the video on this is very easy much easy to hold it also the other one was little big like it's so big and then you have to look when we were small you just say you do like this so smooth I'm not used to it and then doing like this like this you know what happens all the side the skin would go away and when we are grinding chilies and all the other kind of stuffs your hand starts to get really burnt when it touches the areas you know but no choice it still stays there so we were forced to use some patent later after some time and then mix it came then even for footer we don't have the podium a double my court and now what we'll get all kind of available we used to make founder at home itself how powder like we have to soak the rice and then there is a kind of a pounding stick like this you have to keep and then that's round like this thing in that you have to keep hitting hitting like this and then you have to power you have to see that flow then you have to try the flaw there's quite a bit of processing but it's not easy now so easy life has become you just taught about that the cup tea for the body start making it life was not so very easy those days very complicated your procedures become neat I'm going to put some weeks block thinking this you don't have to bring the more idea of this one using is just to ensure what we want to be to you except that you go to all the areas and you get stuck there and then it'll try and bring out the dirt out much neater way and easier much better hope we does not change its color [Music] [Music] and then I put water as I said that's all no this will get back tomorrow again I will do all this process again one more time and then it will be ready to use in a day or two I can start writing and using us thank you for watching me sure your like this video thanks for watching bye", "oxcuOa5QAv0": "[Music] hi folks Neil here from ECS coffee today we're going to be having a look at La special ista from the longing it's a new entry into the sub $1,000 price point espresso machine category in Canada going up kind of against you know Breville barista Express as a new entry we really like the Machine a lot of really cool features to it so what we're gonna do is gonna do an overview of the machine kind of what's kind of special about it I'm gonna make a couple of drinks and show you why we think this is gonna be a huge hit so let's start with the overall look we think de'longhi has nailed it with the location it looks a little bit commercial full stainless steel housing this really cool shiny black piece on the front with the nice white lights your traditional pressure gauge on the front which is great even the drip tray we would like it's a it's a stainless so it's not and nothing plastic about it which is really really good overall aesthetic Leigh we think it's fantastic the height is seventeen and a half inches tall which depending on your upper cabinets could be an issue so before you go ahead and and look at this machine you may want to make just double check because you do want to have access to the hopper I mean some some of the time most time is to slide these things out anyway regardless because you do need I think the Breville ik's 15 or so high but you need to slide them out to get the beans in anyway so just be aware of that 17 and a half total height on this guy 250 gram hopper on the top and we have a 2 litre water tank at the back of the machine in our world not ideal to be the back of the machine we'd prefer that if one of these companies would kind of do it and on the front so you pull out the water tank or the side but it seems to be there's a lot going on here and it's pretty standard for in this price point in this style of machine they're gonna have a water tank on the back but 2 liters is a good size so let's see I know go over kind of some of the the really neat features about this machine we're gonna go and show you how they all work but we have a built-in tamper which we think is really great after the coffee is is ground we have a rinse button which will not only preheat your portafilter but also rinse it out ahead of time we have a hot water 40 button and we have three preset sizes espresso kotl and coffee and for the americano and for your hot water you might notice is this little extra spout here that gives your water separately so the water is not coming through the Porta filter for the americano we also have steam wand on the side flatten foam very easy to use and I am terrible at milk frothing so we'll see how this goes I'm just not good at it cuz I drink you know espressos and Americanos more so than then lattes and cappuccinos so I've never really learned and I'm a guy that likes to push buttons I like to push a button get a coffee but for those that want hands-on this is going to go through some of the different things and show you how they all work and why we think this is gonna give the Breville barista Express a run for its money so we start with 6 grind settings throwing the espresso range from fine to coarse and we also have here the the level of of grind so how much grind you're gonna get with these machines typically if you're using the same coffee you can kind of set it and forget it but as you change coffees and you each kind of change your drinks you may have to adjust it slightly never use oily beans in these machines I know a lot of people like to go to box stores because things are getting a great deal on coffee beans you'll pay for it and fixing your special machine because the oils will screw up your grinder this grinder has two built-in sensors one to tell you that there's no beans left the beans in it and it doesn't time the the grind it does it by councii rpms which is a little more consistent than than a time grinder so how many rpms you get one of the neat features on this this grind level is if you turn it to the scoop that's for your decaf which will enable you to use the tamping station just as a tamping station and not as an actual grinder so we're going to turn it back up to just around the nine nine o'clock area we're going to use a double we're gonna make a few drinks so we'll start with the start with basically a double espresso I've got my double porterfield's here nice and heavy nice and solid we pressed our times to cruising a double and which pops came here like so and of course first time I'm counting real clicks it starts to grind and one of the the challenges with these guys is typically you'd have to take this out when you're done get your tamper and know what your pressures like and what the long is done here is they put a tamper built right in so soon as it's done grinding you just pull this guy down now I like to do it three times no real except reason why but three seems illogical to me and you want to you'll notice that the the coffee is ground and if you get a close up here I'm not sure if you can see this jockey get you to zoom right in on this little line here as long as you're kind of below that line for the coffee you should be good so that's something you want to be be aware of that's where you play with your grind amount here and your finest in your coarseness so now that we're done here we're going to go over to the we have our hot water heated top here for our special cups and I've got a little cool little flip down tray here which I really like - it's nice little feature and let's just do that double right into our special cup here so we're going to go over to espresso on the front here and we've got the the double shot and we're gonna hit okay let's see what happens now sometimes you can be a little too fast a little too slow depending on your grind and and the amount so let's see how we we did here it's a little fast may have to adjust that for the next one but overall you can see you're getting a nice crema it's just running a little bit fast and there we go done with the espresso so nice and quick nice and easy decent crema I could do better and we're done now I'm just going to tap this out to our box and then we can one of the things we can do is I'm going to show you the rinse feature here you can press this it's gonna rinse through your the group head here you can also put also put this guy in here as well stop it I'll give it a gun to show you guys neat rinse feature which we really like kind of clean zeg your portafilter and we'll stop that there and then we're gonna go into making ourselves an Americano so let's turn this guy over here same things before we're going to take a Porta filter we pop it in here we've got a double and we click it over off it goes and we're done again I made this mistake the first time use it I took it out but you got to remember tamp inside ok so again I do three for no apparent reason the other and that's the number I like now let's do four a nice tamp here so we'll pop over and we're going to grab our larger americano glass and you can kind of seam lining it up so that we get the water out of here as well we've got this now turn to americano we've got a double pressed and we're going to press okay and then like some espresso machines we have to move to get water separately this is going to do it all in one which is nice [Music] so unlike the the the coffee section functionality on this the americano will do pre infusion of coffee will not I I don't really know why they have to have a coffee and here to be honest with you adding the americano does the job the coffee still unjoin 5 ounce the americano is actually a larger a larger cup so I actually prefer the americano in this machine but in North America we still have that belief sometimes that we need a drip style coffee it is it's a European coffee it's an espresso based coffee it's not going to be like your drip coffee so don't think you gonna get your your Tim Hortons out of this because you're not to be way better but I like the americano function I'm not sure coffee was necessary but it is a nice feature to have on there anyway so there's the americano like I said you know you play with your beans in your settings and your grind too to sort of set it up the way you like it well you can actually pre-program using the my button your drinks we haven't done any of that we're kind of we're kind of playing it with the presets but you can pre-program the three drinks so that they're set for you when you come to the machine and here is our beautiful americano filling a glass so now we're going to go over we're gonna make ourselves a cappuccino and let's see how this milk thing works because i am not the pro like I said before milk but what we'll do is we will dump this guy out to our another box and we're gonna go with the double again just again I like doubles because why would you have a single it's more caffeine click it over espresso so we're not again Tam let's go for three I really like this you know the bigger problem I found with the the self tamping is it just makes a mess and you need a tamping mat and you can score your counter top and you need to get enough pressure I really like the idea this kind of keeps it nice and clean for you and over we go so let's see what happens when we do at cappuccino so we start with the yeah I like to double it cuz that's just me I'm sorry times two I've got espresso we're okay and then we're gonna go to get the milk the fun stuff one other feature of this machine it will prompt you to descale and this knob over here does have a D scale functionality that you turn it to for the program so makes a little bit easier something else this machine has is two heating systems so you've got your thermal block for the the espresso and the coffee portion you have separate heating system for your milk free milks you have to worry about that wait time okay so we got our double shots now I'm just gonna put that over to the side for a minute and we're gonna just play with our milk let's see what we can do and grab the milk from my assistant on the side here so we've just reusing two percent so this happens to be what I have articulating arm which I kind of like you know a little bit all I'm gonna take the portafilter out just for fun move that other way for now and I'm just going to put this in here and I'm gonna go from you flat for your for your lattes and foam for the cappuccinos and I'm gonna turn the milk on and see what happens what does leave it be and we'll see what we can get out of it takes a few seconds to get going and it will turn itself off you can turn the knob and turn it off if you like but I'm gonna just leave it gotta turn itself off and see what happens against separate heating system from the McAfee seems like we're almost getting done I would probably stop it now if I was doing the the frothing myself we're getting near the top of the notch to see if it stops on its own I'm gonna stop it now it was a little ambitious with that well anyway so we've got our foam okay that's a bad mmm let's pour in and see what happens again I'm terrible with foam so we have to forgive me that's not bad though if you look at that cappuccino considering we literally did nothing with the wand and typically with the ones you do have to play with it and raise you know raise your your your milk frothing container up and down to get to get it right that was pretty good considering I didn't do a darn thing so you gotta sell a cappuccino here wipe off your your wand and your often you're off to go so overall guys I really like this machine for the less than sub $1000 market or where you get some functionality manually you got to do some stuff but also it's almost like a semi automatic it's doing a lot of stuff for you you've got some great adjustments with your grinder you've got your hot water your rinse button you've got your hot water feature for your americano you've got three presets you've got a very easy to use milk system which I really really like considering how bad I am at it no mess with the smart tamping the two heating systems in there and I got aesthetically a wonderful machine one of the great things that I haven't mentioned yet about the long e where they just destroy the competition is it's a to eat plus one year warranty so it's a two year warranty but if you're registering machine as soon as you get it it's right inside the box you get an extra year you can't beat that in this market so three years on this machine which is something that that I think is a wonderful really smart move on the longest behalf again come by and see us in bromanor Ancaster online at ECS coffee calm if you have any questions feel free to ask on youtube or reach out to one of us we're more than happy now have a great day [Music]", "KuwSnihXcBU": "hi everyone decide today I'll be doing a comparison between two angle grinders that I've had for a few years and one is a Bosch model d70 745 and the other one is a Makita and 955 4mb the Bosch is 850 watts 125 mm this size and 11000 rpm and it costs around 89 dollars right now and the makita is 710 Watts 115 millimeter this size 10,000 rpm and I just saw it on Amazon for $59 so it's about 30 dollars cheaper than the Bosch I've had these for quite a while I've had the boys for about five years and the makita for about eight years so and I've been using extensively as far as the sizes go they're pretty much the same and they're weigh about the same as the makita's are slightly heavier so as you see the handle for the makita is a lot more substantial and the handguard and the makita is much bigger so it's a it's just a better handle all around and it is slightly bigger okay here's where the big difference is the gear housing cover on the Bosch is made out of hard plastic and on the makita it's aluminum so that's a big win for Makita right there so I will go ahead and take those off to see what's inside so as you see the makita has a sealed bearing inside and the Bosch has none big thumbs up for Makita and thumb down for for Bosch huge diff in terms of quality and as you see the hole in the gear head housing in the makita is much bigger than the bosch naturally which spreads the forces over a greater area which makes for a smoother running grind now checking the power chords and the quality of the code seen by the same and the lengths are identical also okay now here's an interesting difference this I noticed the first day when I bought the box after I've been using the makita for a few years the makita when you turn it down it winds up immediately for the full speed but the bosch takes it maybe by the second it lags a little bit and it's very noticeable I don't know if you can tell the difference in that it takes a little bit longer to wind up mr. Bosch of course I think could hear it then now with both of them running its again noticeable that the makita runs smoother less vibration and if you notice when I turn both them off at the same time the boy stops but the makita keeps on going once we because of that bearing in there as far as the switches go they both turn on about the same but the makita turns off a little bit easier the boss you have to wrestle with a little bit more so I like the makita here also better so all around the makita gets my boat and that's the one I always reach for whenever I need to grind around my shop

and [Music]", "jZaDG0e70jA": "this is a review of the chewy grinder the only other thing apart from buying one of these is you will need to operate this as one of these batteries a simple magnet Villopoto Sheree we're going to man anyways this is the chewy grinder this is the box that comes in once you open the box put off the Steve instead it in the box you get yourself a user module I already poured through this a lot but I will quickly scroll through it for you so you can see the call liver that it is a good colic well put together I'll show you everything you need to know about caring for ER so we'll put this Aksum assume your gumbo reading yours and this is the product itself the chewy grinder not bad on a freaking paranoid so I wrote it this way easy enough to come back so er the chewy grinder mobile do is will pop it open and we'll show you how it works first of all what you're going to want to do is you want to put the battery in the bottom so open it up and you put your meal the female female the male your battery the said needed earlier on pops by then that is that sample click close Don this is the business end of it see now you can either hard pension or tight paint it whenever you're filling it all you want those tight Pettis are sorry lightly patches to be lightly pinch of thigh and then this is the mechanism that actually chews up it has the name choo-choos of the material whenever you put it in here so what you'll see is whenever there's a safety mechanism the bottom here by hold of dies and I press the button there you go you can see a tunnel there you go you can imagine that whatever you want to chew as clear stone here like so and then whenever this is closed and you press there's two buttons beside one here I'm on the other side when you can sort a bones together it forces this chamber to close up and pushes whatever you have in here enter the actual path ascendant so if we open this up and override the safety mechanism because there is one to stop you little AG to put your finger in there and grinding it up so I was at the bottom so you can just imagine if the being closed and there you go shearing and I'm spending it out because obviously driving I like to pointing at the other end and going backwards and forwards and then spelling it out and to whatever receptacle you might be putting onto but I'll show you that in a second so anyways as I said you want to lightly pepper so lightly pinch what we will have down here because we want to show you how you're going to clean the side this is the chewy bit and it is sharp so you don't really want to play around with too much but here you go you can put a lot out and then this is this bit here will actually come out as well so you want better angle the actual sleeve here will come out as well as we said you're running lightly Paget hard pendulum if you hard painted you can pull all that out and anything give it a good clean but you wouldn't really want to because everything's going around don't agree with it don't [ __ ] with them so once you put the mechanism back down in between magazine you close it up another sale earlier on just two buttons but you want to make sure you have this end because if not sometimes the weed house or whatever helps blotted out on me or anyways this is the chewy grinder we're just going to do a quick poll and then I'm going to get out of your car and that is how this works say just like that doesn't even have to do much oh we're going to enjoy having one with me so here we are cheers the air.you tears to me tears to everybody the chewy grinder as far as I'm aware there's only 400 units in America priced at $69.99 dollars uh Nana things are going to matter one of the hundred dollars so while there's only 400 units of the pre-order the pre-release or whatever there is I would suggest getting one now because these interpreter nut but was wet you know wasn't even perfectly dried and it just went through there like a jab but I hope you're enjoying one again because I'm just going to finish this off and I'm going to go thanks for watching please", "mdvPOQmQhfg": "so if you've been around my channel at all you've seen any of my other videos like I said earlier you know I use these a lot so let's take a minute now and take a closer look at some of the different some the different attachments you can use on your angle grinder these can be used for wood steel plexiglass you name it this is a handy tool to have in your home workshop so let's start by taking a look at some of the different attachments you can get for your four-and-a-half inch angle grinder to work on wood of course they have what's called flat disks and these are nothing more than sandpaper that's been attached to a disc and you can get these in a variety of grits 50 on up to 120 these work really good for standing out finish you would in fact let's take a look at how it works before we do that though let's talk about a couple more of these it's a nice set these flat discs aside for now and and look at D now this is nothing more than an abrasive disc for using using a wood you can see here we've got what's called a Lancelot which is essentially turning your your little angle grinder into a miniature chainsaw alright so let's start with this Lancelot now you can see this is nothing more than a chainsaw blade on a disc now we want to engage that and we can take up take this tool that comes with your grinder and you don't need to get it on there real tight so let's make a cutter to here alright so here you can see I've got one of the logs that we've been setting up for work our rocking off chairs and you can see where I got a little uh a little rough in here with my chainsaw so we're gonna use this this Lancelot attachment on a four and a half inch angle grinder it's brand new Milwaukee I'll show you how to polish some of this start smoothing these now please don't start into any kind of project with your new angle grinder without wearing some kind of eye protection so I think you'd agree the landslide takes out a lot of bulk in a hurry makes a big mess too so next we'll switch over to this mrs. Grayson pack and we can start polishing this thing out it's just like saying to give me videos you start out with heavy heavy grit take out a lot of bulk then you work your way down into the into the smoother flap desks just like you would with sandpaper whatever you're changing your discs out always make sure you're unplug just is a safety precaution just back that off let's go ahead and run this for a minute pretty much operates the same way you can see doesn't take much and you start getting these things polished out pretty quick let's go ahead put all these flap discs in next now well these flap discs we've got a 7/8 inch Harbor and all angle grinders come with up attachment that will allow for that and lock it into place again you can use this or just twist it on there by hand all right so I think you get the idea how that works and you can see I'll start sanding them out pretty nice in fact let me show you what you can do with your angle grinder here's a perfect example of some of the work you can do with your angle grinder this is the cabin club a rocker comes in our cabin collection and you can see the detail work even these scallops I did all this with my angle grinder hope this has been helpful next time you want to use your angle grinder to sand or shape would remember if you need a new angle grinder be sure to come see me Michell Dillman at love furniture how to calm I appreciate you taking time to stop by we'll see you again just a few days", "rIsKmvYV9Cg": "Hello guys, Anders here with another Black\nDesert video, today are going to go over some Hashashin PVE potential, but before we do\nthat I want to thank the supporters of the channel, you guys help me keep these videos\ngoing. So thank you so much for the support. If you want to help support the channel you\ncan do so buy liking or disliking this video, subbing to the channel if you haven't already\nand hitting the bell icon. Bell is good. So please ding the bell so you get notified\nwhen i upload my next video. So we got Hashashin this week on test server\nand I had been asked to look into PVE grinding so I decided to check out the more common\nareas that I know. It's hard to replicate my gear on test server,\nbut I did my best so results will vary. The main thing I'm looking for when testing\nout these areas mainly on Hashashin Awakening is how easy it is to get the flow of the grind. How large Hashashin AOES are, that kind of\nthing. So Star's End, Hashashin does very well. He can pull with his Haladie Throw if you\nwant to manage pulls. In terms of Star's End you want some tight\nAOE burst damage with Down Attack modifiers. Getting Back attack modifiers as well will\nhelp you burst faster. Hashashin has everything you need. Sand Dune into Flow into Blood Poison increases\nyour damage a ton. You can use Gelation into Crash Collapse and\nfinish with something like Sand Swamp into Condemnation flow or Snake Charm into Condemnation. With so many Down attacks some range projectile\nto get some mobs to leash and good AOE with superamor grinding Star's End to me feels\nvery easy and that is really good considering I know for sure there will be true Hashashin\nmains that can and will eventually show better combos \nor pulls for places like this. I used 275 Kutum and 258 Kutum at Stars End\nto check the difference, but as you can see it's hard to not have to put on the max pen\ngear since a lot of players seem to like to go into PK mode when it comes time to test\nthings, which is fine more power to them. Just makes testing for longer periods a little\ndifficult. I moved on to Abandoned Monastery for a quick\ncheck to see how Hashashin would do with 258 Kutum I think. That's low for Monastery, but I mainly wanted\nto see how his skill vacuums would do and yeah it's pretty amazing to be honest. A lot of Hashashin's skills in Awakening and\nPre-Awakening have vacuum ability in PVE so they drag the monsters in close which is specially\nnice in Abandoned Monastery. Maybe not as OP as Awakened Guardians Forward\nF ability physically pushing the mobs there as she moves, but vacuums are nice to have\nfor sure. After that, I checked Thorny Forest, the 250\nO'Dyllita area and once again this area is similar to Abandoned Monastery so Hashashin\ndid very well. In terms of Mana or HP I didn't feel like\nI was churning through my potions too much, which is good. I decided to be a little silly and go to the\nTuros zone also in O'Dyllita. This is a duo spot but Hashashin did okay. The monsters do a lot of CC here so it's important\nto stay in SA and FG as much as possible which Hashashin has no problems doing, though I\ndid get caught a bunch since my ping to test server is something like 200 ping so not as\nfluid as you want. I decided, you know Turos isn't silly enough\nlets go to the 300 ap zone and see what this class can do. Yeah bad idea. So I went to Hystria which is something we\nhave on live servers and many of us grind and grinded there with 258 Kutum and with\nhis dash being such low cooldown its easy to get behind for back attacks and he really\nhas no problem grinding here whatsoever. Aakman was a little more difficult to test\nfor reasons you see, but it felt even easier. His movement pack to pack is great you can\nstretch his movement to make him go lightning fast but that does drain a lot of stamina\nwhich actually isn't a bad thing since he doesn't really consume a ton of stamina while\nyou combo. Overall maybe he's not as easy to grind with\nas Guardian Awakening, but the fact that I was able to grind well with having such little\nknowledge of the class on test server which I say has some weird damage ratios for PVE\ngrind. It bodes well for this class when we eventually\nget Hashashin. As for Succession, it clearly does more damage\nthan Awakening. Like scary amounts, but I think this is one\nof those rare times that Succession and Awakening may be closer in grind speed than other classes. From my PVP experience, Succession was just\nnasty damage, but that is compared to Awakening which I think does good damage already. So we will see when we get the Awakening and\nSuccession on live which one ends up being the better of the two. And that's pretty much it for this video guys. Let me know what you think about Hashashin\ngrinding, have you had a chance to check it out on test server? Let me know in the comments and as always,\nthanks again for watch thanks for listening. I'll see you all in the next one. Take care.", "HvMhNNfx3vU": "oh hey what's happening there youtube it's brian house here for housework and today we are going to be building the revolution 2x72 belt grinder generation 4. now if you're not familiar with the revolution project um i'll put a link right up here so you can follow along or go back and look at the genesis uh but it's actually a 2x72 belt grinder project that we developed about a year ago right here on youtube and then over the course of the last year we brought it to production with your help so i just wanted to say thank you for following along and supporting my work and doing all the things you guys do so i can do the things i do now when i approached this project i really wanted to build a heavy industrial machine that had all of the features and functionality of a manufactured grinder but didn't have the associated cost um i just didn't have 3000 bucks to dump into a 2x72 belt grinder so we came up with some creative solutions to use some common materials so that we could build a big heavy industrial grinder that did all of those things but for about a third of the cost and this is now generation four we've kind of come along a long ways to determine hey these are some of the problems people have had when they were building the first few generations we've solved those problems we've added parts and we've kind of moved past a lot of that and added a bunch of stuff that makes this even better than it was before so um i just want to uh to just preface that you know you will have to go out and still purchase some tube steel to make this happen but pretty much everything else is there you know you're going to need wheels motor and a vfd there's a resources page in the plans that will take you to all of those resources so you can see the plethora of different choices you have to buy those accessories for this thing and then um you know you could kind of pick your your price level like you know do you want to buy the cheaper things and save some money or do you want to go middle of the road uh or go all the way to the top you know some people do that too and that's the beauty of this project is that you're not roped into just buying one thing and getting all of those one parts and you may get something that just doesn't add up or you paid too much for one thing it's up to you you know you can make it happen for yourself also you get a little bit of ownership over the project you know you're putting this thing together you're welding it a lot of people do it with a family member they do it with their kids or their fathers or whatever and at the end they have this super industrial mega beefy machine that they can utilize for all kinds of things and you know my my first thought about the revolution was that it was going to be used for our knife making um and i do that a lot but i will tell you that across the board that is not what everybody is using this tool for they're using it in woodworking and in muffler shops and in film studios we've sold thousands of these all over the world and they have been built all over the world and you know it's not just for bladesmiths and nice knife makers and blacksmiths so anyhow i'm blathering on why don't we just dive into the build essentially what we're going to be doing is i'm going to take you step by step through the ultimate bundle so you know if you buy the kit from housemade.us these are the parts you're going to get and then these are the things you're going to have to buy and then each individual piece of this build is going to be filmed and walk through and there's time stamps down below in the description where you can just click through and you can kind of follow along with my process and how i build my machine so that you can do the same anyway guys let's get started screw it let's do it all right so let's just take a quick gander at some of the parts here uh these are 3 8 inch steel quarter inch steel and half inch steel these pieces are laser cut on a million dollar laser machine they're very very high quality parts real tight tolerances you know if you have the means to purchase the kit uh this just makes the bill go up by so much quicker and you just get a much more professional uh machine out of it not that not to say that you can't buy the plans and you know build it with a new plan set so um what we've done is we have broken down each individual piece and it's uh real easy to follow along um you know i've learned a lot over the course of the last year on how to put together plan sets the first revision of the plans was great uh but you know over time you learn you know when you start seeing the same question over and over and over um you know you've got to make some changes and we've done that here with the plan set so you know you can buy just this plant set 25 bucks so you can and you can obviously follow along and then later if you decide you want to buy the kit we do include a promo code so that it'll knock the price of the plans down quite a bit and you know make that happen so uh let's just real quick go over some of the parts and pieces you'll see here we've upgraded the platinum it's a nice big long platen now the the pivot point is lower on the machine so that you get more platen face above the work rest that was by design we're also including a tracking mechanism now you will have to drill these holes out and for the the pivot point here you'll have to drill those out that'll be important and then also tap this hole drill and tap this hole for the tracking wheel but this is now included um and just like the other build you get all the other pieces platinum bracket is included now um you get all the legs and feet uh you get the spacers here these are uh the spacers they may may not be quite this big we might shrink these down a little bit i think these are too beefy but this is my first prototype kit that i got back also we've included a base plate that has the holes cut in it for the pillars themselves so there's no more measuring in figuring this out the pillar actually slides right down in here and you weld it together and that's what kind of holds everything in place while you while you line everything all up and of course the motor plate the work rest has a notch in it for the platen now so you can work around your platen it doesn't just bump right up to it and that also assists you in lining everything up for the work rest build now the work rest is so much simpler to put together to and we'll kind of get into that later in the build now the very first step is to cut all of your tube steel so we're going to go ahead and do that now and then we're going to throw it in a vinegar bath for 48 hours i like to tell people when they buy the kit make sure you source this tube steel right away in your local area or in the resources you'll find a link where you can buy it online that's the first thing i would buy get it cut and get it soaking in vinegar to remove the mill scale that is a requirement for this build because it does remove the outer portions of the mill scale for the tooling arms to allow the the receiver to accept the one and a half inch so that's the first step now when you're cutting this you're going to want to use something like this thing here this is a little digital level you want to zero it out on your table just kind of clean off a spot set it to zero and then you're going to level the work piece off of that and we've got about a degree to go up on that end so to shore it up just a little bit grab a piece of wood and damn near right on the money with that one beauty all right now let's make our cuts and you really want to make sure that you're wearing ear protection and eye protection breathing protection when you're doing this kind of work it's really important i use an evolution chop saw for this i love this thing if you're doing a lot of metal working this is a hundred percent um worth the investment um it just takes this steel cuts it uh super quick by the way i get my tube steel from a local steel distributor most most of you will probably have somebody close but if not you can go on the resources page and you can click through and there's a resources that you can buy this deal pre-cut right online we'll ship it right to you okay so now that we've got all our tube steel cut and labeled we're going to deburr the edges and then toss it in a vinegar bath for about 48 hours okay so now that the steel has been soaking for 48 hours go in and take a look at what we've got the goal was here to have all the black mill scale come off and you can see just it just wipes right off so what i like to do is pull these out one by one i keep a little windex right here this will neutralize the acid and keep it the flash rust down and you want to spray the inside too just make sure you get a nice good coating on there and then take them over to your sink and wash everything off now you're going to want to wear gloves when you do this because you get this black stuff on you uh it's really hard to get off so yeah but that's a success oh yeah smells like a pickle non-toxic and easy on the environment now you can use muriatic acid for this it works faster you just obviously take the necessary precautions to protect yourself when working with muriatic acid so all right i will uh pull all these out neutralize them and then wash them with a little bit of soap and water all right let's look at the receiver tubes this is a two by tube steel structural it's a quarter inch thick wall tube steel these are 10 inches long and what they're designed to do is be the receivers to hold the tooling arms and there is a weld seam down inside of here and there's a numerous ways to get rid of that weld seam i personally like the pneumatic file option which is one of these devices they're about eighty dollars on amazon i highly recommend them because of course i know that there's other tools out there that you can make to remove a weld seam however those are single use tools this tool will give you a whole lot of other functionality i use this for texturing knife blades and rounding over interiors of tubes and all kinds of stuff it can make fillets in your welds as well so there's there's numerous uh functions for this one tool and they are relatively inexpensive like i said at about 80 bucks on amazon i'll put a link down below uh and then you're going to want to get some high grit uh belts for this uh these are i think this is a 36 grit ceramic and if you're removing weld seams you could probably remove uh weld seams from about 10 sets you know before you have to change the belt out so it's a good buy so let's get started on removing the weld seam so how i like to do this is throw it in a vise and kind of tilt it up so i can see what i'm doing see down in there makes it pretty easy just to kind of get work your work your pneumatic file down in there and of course always wearing proper ppe i can't stress that enough and in this case because we're grinding we're going to wear a half mask respirator and hearing protection and then we're going to run this file down and inside of this and it's going to be kind of counterintuitive when you start doing this because you're going to want to kind of go fast and work it back and forth but in this case you're going to really want to go slow the slower you go and you just sort of work the grinder down into it the more even bevel you're going to get you're going to get a nice even cut on that weld seam and with this particular size of pneumatic file you can almost get all the way down you can almost get all the way to the end of this 10 inch you're gonna have to flip it around and finish it off but this takes me all about five minutes to do one tube so it's a pretty quick process once you learn how to do it uh take your time wear your ppe and get grinding [Music] now one of the things i like to do is have a tooling arm just uh hanging out so i can actually give it a test yep slides all the way in and out and then i like to turn it 90 degrees try it again just to ensure that i have clearance on both axes because the grinder does tilt and you want to be able to turn your tooling arms as well that's a success all right so now that we've got the weld seam ground out of both of our receiver tubes we're ready to start clamping this thing together so that we can put our welds on it and you know we're not building a skyscraper here so the concept is keep your welds fairly light in the beginning and then we're going to do three one inch full welds on each side inside of this center line here one thing to take into consideration when you're welding make sure that whatever you've got this set on is really flat you don't want one of these tubes up or turned or any of that and you want them lined up just right and you want to also this is just a pet peeve of mine but wherever the weld seam was down on this particular part of the tube do the same up here so just line them up you know this was where the weld seam was this was where the weld seam was that way the tube orientation is the same so these two pieces were like that when they were on the tube a pet peeve of mine don't know if it matters or not but that's how i do it so i put these together you got a couple options for clamps you can just do like a whole c-clamp which is what a lot of people do they'll just c-clamp this together one of my favorite kind of clamps is a can't twist clamp uh these are indispensable in a metal working shop or knife making shop i will put links down in the description so you can go out and find them on amazon they're a little spendy but you will quickly realize that it is worth every penny so i'm just going to line everything up and get this a little bit tight and do another one on this side just going to make sure everything's flush tighten it down i'm going to check to make sure everything's flat and it is and let's get welding and there you go now i run a hobart handler 190 it's a 220 volt i have seen many many people put together the revolution with a an inexpensive 110 welder so again like i said we're not building skyscrapers here as long as it's stuck together you're good to go okay so the last and final step to finish off the receiver tubes is to drill and tap some 3 8 16 holes about one inch back from the front of the two receiver tubes one at the top and one underneath at the bottom and what that's going to do is it's going to serve a spot for those knobs to dial in and lock into your tooling arms [Music] [Music] all right so let's take a look at the tracking pillar there's a few pieces of paper in the plan set that are dedicated to this but for this particular step we're really going to be looking at the tracking pillar template one of the cool features of the plan set is that if you print these one to one or actual size on an eight and a half by eleven sheet of paper all you really have to do is cut it out and lay it on your steel and place your marks all right so here's our eight inch piece of two by two and because i'm so bad with angles this makes it stupid simple to mark off your 60 degree right here and then we can punch the hole and mark where our slots are going to go where we need to cut all right there we go now the way i like to do this is i like to uh take this 60 degree cut here and do that first you can do that on a chop saw and then we'll drill this center hole out after that we'll cut these out with a porta band saw okay so now we've got our 60 degree angle cut on the base here we are going to drill this 3 8 inch hole uh and we're going to drill it all the way through both sides of this this is the next step and the reason why this is the next step in not cutting this is these two flanges once this is cut uh these two pieces are cut this these have a tendency to flare out so in order to keep this hole true and accurate all the way through we're going to drill that first so so so now you can see we've got our notches cut and our 60 degree angle cut here and just as i predicted these did kind of warp out just a little bit good news is it's super simple to fix just grab a vise and we're just going to use the mechanical leverage of the vice to bring it all back together i have to fiddle with it just a little bit just to kind of [Music] get them to come back into shape almost there and there we go one last thing we got to do now is we need to drill a hole back here about a half inch hole for our spring tab [Music] all right so now that we've got our spring tab hole drilled in the back side of the pillar we just need to um fit this all up now you can do this in a couple of different ways my ocd says that just the way this is is not okay with me i'd rather rather have it uh level with the the 60 degree cut here so i'm going to go ahead and just grind down with a flap disc a little bit of these edges right here on the spring tab and then while i'm at it i'm just going to smooth over some of these harsher corners on this on this pillar okay so the last piece of the tracking pillar puzzle is to pop a weld onto the little spring tab here i always like to pop my weld first here and then finish it up down here just a quick tack just to make sure everything stays in place okay so now we got both of these uh assemblies together the receiver tubes and the tracking pillar we're going to marry the two together now this is a pretty straightforward simple process it's important that this all remains level together so we're going to do this on a work surface that's relatively flat which is my welding table here uh and the the way that this is configured is just like you see it here it's it you know this dimension here is far back from the back end of this receiver tube is not a huge deal you know this is not a critical dimension i will tell you i like it about a half inch or so away from the back of this receiver tube so i just kind of lay it on there and then i'm going to work this towards the edge of my welding table kind of set it up and just use a couple of c-clamps to lock everything in place when you're welding this you don't want to get weld crazy all right i've seen some builds where you know they're running a hot beat across here i've been known to do it it's just 100 percent not necessary um you know go in with a couple of light tacks we're going to do light tacks on all four corners of this pillar first and then we're going to come back and we're just going to do about a three quarter of an inch line right in here a little bit of a hot weld but that's it we're going to stop right there so let's lock it down and let's tack it make sure everything is nice and flat and lined up and then i'm going to really crank down on these c-clamps because i i do not want this once i hit these two corners right here with the weld i do not want this to flex at all and i'm going to let it cool before i unlock these two c-clamps [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] i think what i'm gonna do with this one is i'm just gonna clamp it down flat right on the where the weld is gonna go right here and just let this hold it down and then when you pop your two welds here and here the tendency for the weld is going to shrink and pull it's going to want to pull this up believe it or not even with those two tacks on the other side this will want to shift just slightly so if we can keep this in place uh long enough for that weld to cool i think we'll be okay i'm not gonna lock it down too tight just enough to keep it from moving [Music] so [Music] so all right feels pretty flat and let's just go ahead and finish our welds again about three quarters of an inch here and on the other side as well uh [Music] [Music] all right so let's take a look at the making the riser the tubes for the risers there's a entire dedicated page to this a couple pages in the plan set one of which is a printable template that makes this really really easy to do you simply just cut this out and i like to grab a little bit of painters tape and then tape it right on to my my tube steel now these are 10 inches long in some of the previous builds i've recommended 9 inches or 10 inches i have abandoned that because of availability of certain motors and everything if you go 10 inches you're pretty much guaranteed you're going to be able to use just about any motor that's on the market so let's get this template cut out and taped on and let's mark our holes and then you can see how simple it is to fabricate these [Applause] all right so i've got my template taped on here uh something to keep in mind is this line right here is the center line for uh the tube steel itself so there's marks here where you can actually mark the center of the tube steel just to kind of keep things lined up it makes things a little bit easier we're just going to use a sharpie marker and mark over our round overs here and then also use a center punch so we know where we're going to drill our holes it's that easy now there's a couple of ways you can get rid of this material if you have another grinder you can just grind it down that's by far the simplest way or you can use a cut off wheel or a chop saw it's totally up to you really this is just to allow for the swing of the the motor or swing of the entire grinder itself if you don't remove this the uh the hinge system will not function properly so it's a little bit forgiving so if you if you take some off and you realize i didn't take enough you can always go back and clean it up now if you take too much off it really doesn't matter as long as you've got enough over here to keep the grinder sitting at 90 degrees all right so now we got our round over all taken care of we're going to drill a three-quarter inch hole through this we made our mark using the template so we know it's in the right spot first and foremost though we're going to drill a pilot hole can be quarter inch or whatever we're going to drill that through first all in one motion okay which means we're not going to take this piece of steel out of this vise we want the the drill bit to go all the way through so just make sure you adjust you know your your settings so that you know that you're not going to have to move this when all is said and done so you know a little bit overhangs not a bad idea we can actually do it like this clamp it down and 90 degrees is pretty key with this so if you don't think your setup is exactly at 90 degrees it wouldn't be a bad idea to grab a digital level you can do this you know you can buy these on amazon now for like 20 bucks i know my mill is set up pretty well so i'm not going to mess with that too much but a digital level is kind of a game changer it's like one of these little guys and you can you know uh set your drill bit and get it set up to 90 and drill away just take your time no need to rush um huh [Music] [Music] so without moving anything now we've got our pilot hole drilled we're going to set ourselves up for the three-quarter inch hole with drilling a hole this big i always like to use some tap magic which is a cutting oil you can get away with a lot of different kinds of oils but lubrication is important and also going slow just take your time [Applause] [Applause] [Music] so one of the cool things about this system is that it you can grab one of the hinges and your axle bolt and you can actually take it and uh check to make sure that you've got clearance for the grinder head and in this case that uh that template was right on the money we we uh we're exactly right where we need to be and if you turn it you can see we've got plenty of clearance all the way down to 90 degrees i love it when a plan comes together now that we've got the rear pillar done we're going to focus on the front pillar that one's got a little bit of a different setup because of the locking bolt that's in the front so you don't forget to drill and tap that let's take a look at the tracking arm this is a real simple design for this this is a nine inch piece of one and a half by one and a half not a lot to do on this there's about three holes to drill some of which are tapped some of which are not tapped and we do the printable templates again so if you buy the plan set or the kit you will just literally cut this out and make your marks and drill and fabricate it's important to look at this from the side and the top so we're gonna do the top first and this one down here this is on the bottom so you just flip this over pretty easy to follow all right so one thing to take into consideration when you're doing this is the weld seam i always put that on the bottom uh so this would be the top of the tracking arm here uh it's just a pet peeve of mine but also there's a mechanical thing involved if you have to drill through that weld seam it can have a heat affected zone it can be a little hardened right there so uh just try to avoid that i'm gonna go for the top first lay this in make this pretty stinking easy so you got my hole there my mark and we're going to flip it over to the bottom and we're going to lay that same piece of paper on the bottom and we're going to mark our hole for the spring not a super critical dimension but it's nice to have a template done with that one now go to our side view here which right on this side all right we're all set let's go drill and tap all right so since we're set up for it we're gonna drill and tap our 3 8 16 holes first this top hole pretty straight forward only through the top doesn't have to go all the way through [Music] all right flip this over and give us enough clearance to drill all the way through because we're going to drill the tracking mechanism hole next so you want to make sure you give yourself enough clearance to drill all the way through [Music] okay so now we're done with the 5 16 inch drill bit we'll throw in the 3 8 because we need a through hole for the fulcrum bolt and this also has to go all the way through it's important that we give ourselves enough clearance for that we have one more hole to drill and that's the spring hole in the bottom i like to do a 3 16. on that there's that weld seam while we're at it we'll use our single fluted chamfer bit to clean up all these edges one of my favorite tools for my drill press or mill is this little single fluted chamfer bit it's uh one of the things you should always have because it takes care of a whole lot of dirty edges and i'd never clamp anything down i like it just self center go in there and clean up those edges all right now we gotta tap this hole and tap all the way through on this hole so let's take a look at the base we're going to put this assembly together from this point forward we're really going to it's going to go fast now we've got most of the tube steel all fabricated and everything the base plate is already pre-cut for you with these slots you just want to make sure that you've got it oriented correctly you've got a front riser that's the one with the pivot point hole tapped into it then you get your rear riser and the the uh the curves go to the right of the grinder if you're looking at the front and then i like to grab the bolt slide it through just like this it's going to keep us kind of where we want to be okay and i'm pushing these together towards the middle of the of the base plate and i'm just going to use my welding magnets to keep everything at 45. and that's pretty much it i mean this this is a very easy step now used to be a lot of math and a lot of figuring things out and that we kind of solved all that now with these notches that are cut down into the the plate so the one thing you really want to keep in mind when doing this is you don't want to again go weld crazy you want to make sure that you've got the same distance down here at the base between the two pillars and risers and at the top and i know from designing it that this is three and three quarters of an inch between the base so if i look up here and i measure this three and three quarters and we got to push this top one out a little bit so because that's pretty important you don't want to have it too too far out so now i've got that set properly just gonna double check my measurement here i now know that this is the dimension between the two risers at the top is the same as the base i've got my welding magnets keeping everything at a nice 45. i'm gonna make light tack welds in the corners of each one of these and when i say light tack welds i just mean we're going to bond the two together and then we'll come back later we'll kind of look at what we need to do to solidify the welds so by putting these two tacks on this side it's pulled this top riser over just slightly that's actually to my advantage because i needed it to move just slightly so looks good i'll finish my tax now what i'm thinking with this is that we're going to leave it like this until we get the machine totally fabricated and then we'll come back and marry these two pieces together permanently and the reason why i'm doing that something could have gone wrong something might bind up when we put the whole thing together and it's just so much easier to cut tack welds than it is to cut you know full on welds so let's move on to the next step all right we're going to mount the motor plate to the body or the chassis this is really stupid simple actually i just like to line everything up uh with the front plate here and the very front of the the very front of the grinder right here just line everything all up and then kind of take your marks here the way that this is cut is that it follows the lines of the tube steel so that's the exact size they use a can't twist clamp and in this case you can pretty much just use one um you know if you're careful enough with your tacks and all you can and you basically line this front end up once you do that you set a tack down here and it's game over it's pretty straight forward just make sure you take your time there's no rush with any of this all right so this is what i came up with one c clamp in the back and then uh can't twist up front here lined everything up as best as possible and then pop a plug weld there and pop a plug weld there just to keep everything in place all right so now we're going to mount the grinder body with the motor plate onto the risers here uh this is a kind of a cool process this is a something that i worked really hard on to try to figure out in the previous editions of this grinder you had to use all thread and you know you had to kind of put it in fabricate it take it out replace it with the axle bolt and so on but now it's all done in one take so you you know when you put it all together uh you actually don't have to take it back apart to um you know mount the axle bolt or any of that it's all already together so uh i like to lay this flat down on the table this is important so you want to make sure this is flat and then we're going to basically take our hinges and we're going to thread them through with the axle bolt and the spacers you get four of these spacers in the kit these are little shims that go between the pillars and the hinges and we're going to line everything all up now the axle bolt goes in from the back of the grinder so it faces this way so the locking nut is actually towards the user so keep that in mind and then the last hinge you're going to use is the one with the slot so we're just going to thread this through first and foremost make sure that you got everything lined up the top of the hinge is this part here we're going to slide this through we're going to add a shim and then we're going to slide this in and do the exact opposite so shim again and another another hinge and then one more hinge another shim okay slide that through and we got one more shim and our last hinge and this is the one with the the channel in it you want to really make sure that you got this oriented correctly so the channel itself should be down there it should line up with that pivot point hole that we threaded up and now we've got everything kind of lined up the way we want so just to give you a frame of reference you get the bolt coming in from the back this is the front of the grinder all right this is your your locking nut for the grinder you got standard hinge shim riser shim standard hinge standard hinge shim riser shim c-channel hinge okay then we're going to take the locking nut we're going to lock this down into place but you'll notice these two can slide around you know so keep that in mind we're gonna end up having to use some clamps to kind of lock this in place lightly all right so uh grab your your motor plate and your body assembly we're going to lean this down we're just going to put it down onto where they go be a little fiddly gravity's going to work against you here but no big deal and you can beat it so all right uh we've got this somewhat in place now so that basically this is how it goes on the grinder turn this around see it here so it lives on the grinder like this and what i do is i line up the top of the hinges with the top of this inner line right here um so the the top of that line is kind of my guide right because we want everything to sit pretty flush on here but if you notice over here the hinges are just rise raised up just slightly so we need to actually tilt this up just a little bit to get some pressure leverage pressure off of these hinges and how i figured to do it was just take your work rest put it back up underneath this thing and use that with a couple of welding magnets just to kind of support it as your your lift to kind of keep this up off of itself that way now you can maneuver this thing get it into position where you want it and and it's not trying to fight you okay so by the way this is all kind of heavy so you know just make sure you know you're you've got this propped up properly your welding magnets in place and everything because if this were to fall you know probably hurt and that would suck uh so and then now just to keep these in place i'm going to use a standard c clamp and we're just going to lightly squeeze these into place and this is the first time i've done this so it's a little bit of a fiddly process i just want to make sure that when i have this clamp down that i'm not you know bowing things out this way or this way so you know the closest you can get it to the hinge the better okay here's another view of how this is all set up you can see i've got the work rest propping up the base assembly our hinges are flat against the the receiver tubes everything is nice and flush we've made sure that our line you know we're lined up at the top here and that we're not uh you know all caddy wampus on there i kind of like to leave a little bit of space you know to make sure that everything is um you know kind of divided equally on these hinges between the front and the back it's not super critical this isn't a critical dimension uh but it's just for looks but you know hey build it how you want and you know use it all right so if all went well should be able to stand this thing up and see if it'll tilt this is actually one of my favorite parts of the build seeing this thing stand up for the first time it kind of reminds me of something right out of star wars uh it's uh kind of cool to see this thing it reminds me of like the first time you know i built one which is about a year ago now okay all right now one of the things you're going to want to do is check this thing for level uh when you set this up as long as you drilled your holes right and in your pillar this this should settle right at 90 degrees now if this hole that you drilled in to these pillars was off one way or the other you're gonna have to make some minor adjustments on these pillars and you know i've built a bunch of these sometimes they're right on the money dead on and sometimes i gotta you know take a little metal off the base here and in this particular grinder i did have to just grind out just a little bit right here to make this sit at 90 degrees it was about a degree off so i had something messed up on my pillar here you know the hole is just probably not in the right way or the right spot but not a huge deal you know you use a angle grinder you know you can get in there or that little pneumatic file works for that too turn on your your level set it down on the base plate zero it out and then set it up here and see where you fall this one is within 0.15 of a degree so you know we're really good and then you want to take this and turn it this way and check it does it almost get to 90 and we're at 89.89 so i'd say that's a definitely within spec you know so that's a good thing but yep check it if it's not right you know uh you can always add metal here too with a little splat of a welder i've done that in the past um and you know kind of make it work but yeah oh baby oh yes i love it i love it all right we're going to take a look at the tooling arms page we're only going to make one tooling arm in this section and that's the tooling arm that holds the platen in place that's a 15 inch piece of one and a half by one and a half tube steel a quarter inch thick wall i get a lot of questions about the thickness of the wall and if people can use a smaller uh wall diameter or smaller walled tube but because of the rigidity needed here and you're tapping into this thing you really got to have a minimum of a quarter inch or even your you're in the uk or or on a metric system it's like four or five millimeters i believe so you really want to find tube steel like this i have no trouble finding this at a local steel distributor it's about four dollars a foot and you need about five feet of this total to build the machine uh plus the two by two but that's another story but you know it's it's not that difficult to find so um the the cool part about this is that when this is done properly soaked in vinegar and the weld seam is ground out of the two by two this axe is a really great tooling arm and it's super inexpensive you know looking at 15 inches of this it's probably about six or seven bucks so uh the best and easiest way i can i can translate the holes to we need to drill and tap some holes in this is you get a spacer uh with the kit and it's in the the perfect size to just sit right on here and take a couple welding magnets and slide them right up and kind of lock this spacer into place and then just simply use a pen or a sharpie marker and mark my holes i'm kind of a big fan of these uh welding and steel uh pencils they work pretty well um the one thing you really want to just kind of make sure of is that it's fairly square so i'm gonna mark our spots here now we've got our locations for our holes we can now we can use a punch and mark where we need to drill our and tap our holes these are 3 8 inch 16 holes so you're going to drill 5 16 holes here and we're going to tap now the only one that needs to go all the way through is this guy right here the first one so this one we're going to drill all the way through this back one we only just need to drill through this top piece here so one of the things i've been doing now to get my taps to set in straight is to put it in my mill or my drill press tighten it down nice and tight and then line everything up so that my my tap is actually in line with my hole and start my my cutting of my threads that way first and i have a a wrench that i use to turn the quill and if you know if you have a drill press you can do the same thing with you know all kinds of stuff pliers work or anything but i just use a socket wrench putting pressure down on the quill and then also simultaneously turning the wrench i can get my tap started and then i'll know that it will be nice and straight now i won't finish my tap like this i'm going to loosen this up now that i have it set back off the add my tap handle tighten it down and then i'll finish my tap now this particular hole in the plans i have it tapped all the way through uh both sides and and i do that all in one motion and i've had a few people find uh in an issue to make this happen because their taps don't have this sort of smaller tap area at the top of the tap area the name escapes me now but anyway i just buy the cheap harbor freight ones now i will say this is a little bit over engineered so if you wanted to drill this hole out at 3 8 and then just tap the other one that would be fine too this one would be the one closest to the d plate and the spacer but in my case because i can do it i'm going to go ahead and just tap it all the way through and how i do it i have a whole video on this i'll put a link up but how i do it is as i'm going through it and i get to that spot where i can feel it grabbing down below i'm just adding lots of pressure so that it will set and catch and then the threads will all line up and i can feel it it's caught and i'm good to go simple as that okay so we've got our our holes drilled and tapped remember that uh you know if you're having trouble with the double all the way through tap right here uh this could be a 3 8 inch hole just a straight through hole and then tap the back side that will give you enough rigidity i just personally like to have the bolt threaded all the way through and then this one just needs to be you know through the one side doesn't have to go through the other side so i want to test this to make sure she slides in and yeah we're looking pretty good nice and tight tolerances you know it's it's a little sticky but that's okay and i also like to ensure that i can turn it 90 degrees and slide it in as well because you're gonna be swapping these things around sometimes so you never know when you might need that also when you turn this thing to this thing up like this she slides right in looking good so the next step of this is we are going to build the platen so you're going to want to grab all the pieces and parts to the platen bracket which is the two legs the two feet and the backer which is this big piece here you want the spacer and that goes between the d plate and the tooling arm obviously the d plate new and improved d plate by the way in gen 4 which i really like the lower pivot hole gives you a little bit more room above the work rest and uh you know cool house made logo there which i'm really proud of thanks to my wife you're gonna need the hardware and the wheels uh these are two inch wheels i get these from knifegrinderparts.com uh awesome website to buy your good quality stuff you want a couple of welding magnets and your mig welder for this uh the setup for this is really actually quite simple the first thing we're going to do is weld our leg and our foot together and that's these two little guys right here this is quarter inch plate steel super simple process really what we're looking to do is keep this at 90 degrees off of that foot and then splat a weld right here on the top and then one right here on the front and that'll keep us it'll give us a nice little bracket for the platinum face backer i like to keep a little refrigerator magnet around for this throw it up underneath and that kind of keeps everything in place pretty easy right and then at this point we're just going to pop a weld right there on the top splat across the top [Music] she's hot look out then we're gonna put another weld right across the face of that let that cool before you touch it all right so now we got both our legs and feet our little brackets here uh all welded up and ready to go um the next step is actually to bolt these two to the d plate right where they go it sounds a little counterintuitive but we're going to use the d plate to support these two things in the right spot so that we can actually get everything lined up for our platen backer plate now what i like to do is just line up the front of the foot with the front of the platen on both sides so we're all squared up now that those are bolted on and lined up on the face of this thing we're going to take our platen we're going to take our platen backer and we're going to set it face down flat and we're going to set this right on top and sort of split the difference and then just use a welding magnet you know you can just take a welding magnet and hold up the d plate with so that now we know it's 45 off the table a couple of them does a better job get that all set up lined up everywhere and then push everything into place try not to knock everything apart and uh set it all down on itself there and just line it all up you know make sure all your edges are flush and all and kind of split the difference between the two brackets and remember it doesn't have to be perfect you know you want really the angle you want here is 90 degrees off of this piece i mean that's pretty much it everything else you know just kind of get it close and just remember you know this is fabrication it's kind of the process of learning and setting up and taking your time and build something that by the way this is going to be around for 100 plus years you know most likely so uh yeah okay so now that we've got it all set up we've got our welding magnets holding this at a perfect 90 degrees off the table we are going to turn on our welder and pop some welds on the inside of each of these brackets okay so we're going to do a weld here and then we're going to go to the opposite side and do a weld over here until we reach six total welds three on each side okay so now we've got our d plate all made up with our platen bracket here and we're going to mount this to the platen bracket arm in order to do that you need the hardware and your spacer and basically we're going to thread it all up and make it work so how i like to do this is throw my my bolt through grab my spacer thread it up and get this get this bolt started for this i like to just use a drill makes it go fast but don't get it too tight you just kind of want it loose and then you're going to grab your knob then the adjusting knob for when you want to change the platen angle and thread it up so it kind of starts to line up and then that way your your spacer will be lined up at this point you may want to go manual with this and just tighten this up as you go to kind of get the right tension on the the d plate here it's pretty easy to get it right you just kind of want to take your time line everything up tighten your knob down and then add the lock nut and the washer to the back side all right so now the fun part of the platinum build in my opinion my the best part as far as i'm concerned is putting on the wheels and seeing how it all comes together uh in the hardware kit that you got sent with the ultimate bundle this is all included uh the wheels like i said earlier i buy these at uh knifegrinderparts.com they have a whole set you can get all four wheels uh for a pretty good price um and yeah so basically how this works take this apart and leave those two on there the washer and the brass spacer slide your wheel on put your brass spacer on a couple of washers and then we're gonna thread this through the d plate with another washer on the outside and a lock locking nut so we've taken all the guesswork out of putting this whole scenario together when you buy the kit you get all these pieces you don't get the wheel you got to order that from chas or knife grinder parts but all the spacers and everything are all perfectly aligned so they'll line up with this platen bracket it's really important now when you tighten this down you don't want to go too tight you know you want to kind of have it so that this wheel can spin but there's no play in that wheel up or down so perfectly achievable and this will give you long life and accurate grinding i'll show that to you one more time here so this is the hardware that comes with the kit i'm gonna leave the brass spacers brass spacer and the washer on there slide the wheel over it make sure that there's a spacer in the middle there kind of a little bit fiddly to get that to go in there then you're going to want to put one more brass spacer and two washers and slide the whole mechanism through one more washer and a lock nut this thing's starting to look like a grinder now take your half inch knob thread it up into the top hole your receiver tube here what that's supposed to do is just keep this locked into place this arm that's important for tensioning and later on when we we'll talk about tuning the grinder this will all kind of come into play but oh man it's starting to look really cool okay so it's a good time now to mount the tracking arm here this is a real simple process get a bolt and your washers and a lock nut and your spring and set this in place and line everything all up and there she goes it's pretty easy now again this is something you don't want to you don't need to tighten this thing down real tight all right this can be somewhat floppy and in fact uh when i'm putting the spring and stuff in i'd like to have it you know nice and loose so i can kind of just line everything up and snap it into place nice tight fit okay so let's talk about the tracking mechanism in the kit you get two half-inch pieces of steel they come pre-drilled uh this this hole here is about three-eighths that's for a through bolt this one over here this is a pilot hole okay so this is a pilot hole we're going to drill this one out to 27 64. which means uh here's the the long story short about this is with a laser cutter or any kind of uh cnc uh cutting of steel other than water jet which i i believe water jet does not leave a heat affected zone what happens is if you try to cut this the exact size that you need to tap it you can't actually tap it because the steel is work hardened so without annealing it and the whole thing so anyway what we've done is we've drilled a quarter inch hole this is just a pilot hole you're going to drill this out to 2764. so now the other thing you need to drill is the hinge the hinge hole the pivot hole for the hinge and that's a pretty simple process the way we made this is that if you line these up just like this and you clamp them into a vise just like this and you drill a hole right through the top here and it's a very simple measurement it's a quarter inch in on both sides you drill it through both pieces at the same time while this is in a vise and you have a perfect pivot hole now you're saying yourself well brian it can't pivot if it's you know set together like that and that's correct we're actually going to take and round over one side of this steel so that it actually can roll and and and pivot inside of here so we'll do that later though okay and just be aware that this hole right here on this piece of steel is not set in the center you can see it's a little further this way that needs to be the short end needs to be near the bottom of the grinder so this is the top and this is the bottom let's do it okay so we're over at the drill press now we're going to line these up these have to be sitting perfectly aligned inside of each other you don't want this up or down you want to line it all up in the vise and we're going to drill a 3 16 of an inch pilot hole through both pieces at the same time so when i put this in the vise i'll line it all up okay and i'm just going to pay attention to the top alignment of this piece and this piece and make sure that they're they're both sitting parallel to each to each other and just for good measure probably not a bad idea to just verify with a ruler that you are lined up properly and in this case we're pretty dang close okay so now that we know everything is aligned we are parallel both pieces are parallel we're going to drill our 3 16 inch pilot hole a little cutting oil we're going to go slow while we are at the drill press we might as well drill our 2764s hole in our tracking face here so i'm just going to go ahead and slide this down into the vise if you have parallels you can use those i just rest mine down at the bottom of the vise we really want to make sure we're at 90 degrees against the drill bit itself when we drill this hole because it's going to hold the axle for the tracking wheel so now you're probably saying to yourself brian how the hell is this going to pivot if uh everything is kind of lined up like that and uh a real simple solution actually we're going to take and grind a nice radius over this little corner here so that this thing will pivot i do that with a flap disk okay now you can see we've got a good pivot point here nice hinge with zero play in the in the mechanism itself if you've ever used a poor tracking mechanism you'll know that that makes a huge difference and i spent a ton of time designing this so that it could be laser cut and fabricated really easily by somebody with just you know standard tools like a drill press and some taps so that's kind of the reason why it took so long to kind of come up with this design but once we had it we knew we had something because it's just such a tight tight design so last thing we got to do is tap this half inch 13 and then we can mount it on the grinder okay so we've got the hole drilled and tapped we've got everything rounded over here notice the fabrication is done now we just gotta thread our quarter inch 20 bolt in here put our lock nut on there and then let's fit it up to the machine okay so take a tracking mechanism set it on top grab a 3 8 16 bolt and a lock washer thread it through the top and thread it into that top threaded spot on the tracking arm and you can tighten it down a little bit it doesn't need to be super tight at this point but you're going to tighten it down just a little okay looking good we got our tracking wheel here this is a four inch crown tracking we've got our tracking wheel bolt we're going to use a brass spacer thread that through another brass spacer and a washer and it all gets threaded into the tracking mechanism make sure she spins freely looking good the last piece is the knob okay so let's take a look at building the work rest which is the last piece to the fabrication puzzle of building the revolution these are the pieces you're going to need this is all laid out in the plan set for you if you buy the kit you get the work rest table nice big table 15x6 and you get this uh cut piece that actually allows it to articulate and really what you want to do here is just make sure you get your tube steel cut okay this is a two by two tube steel and one and a half and these slide together pretty easy okay as long as you take the weld seam out make sure you do that and then also i like to just check it you know slide it through a couple of different ways does it get bound up does it fit properly that kind of stuff before you go any further you want to make sure that that actually has been done all right so now we need to drill and tap a couple of holes uh in this case we're going to drill and tap a hole in the 2x2 for the knob and then we need to drill and tap a couple of holes in the work rest arm that will actually hold the these two pieces together once they're married together so the two by two tube steel is pretty simple to figure out where the knob goes this isn't a critical dimension so i just you know x marks the spot kind of thing with this um and again like i said it's not a super critical dimension but you know you want to look good and be somewhat in the middle grab your uh punch make a hole or make a uh indentation there that's done now the tooling arm a little bit different uh you want to do this uh the right way obviously there's there's a couple of right ways to make this happen uh you got this little piece that comes in with the uh the tool rest kit right so if uh you what you really want to be able to do a couple things is you need to be able to line up the top of it here but this hole is dead center at 7 8 of an inch from the edge so what i like to do is take a ruler and measure back 7 8 of an inch all right now we got that and make a line and if you want you can grab a square draw it straight down i always like to just double check everything double check my marks and then i know that if i lay this on top we want it to line up with the top of the tube and we'll do that with a welding magnet put that in place here to kind of keep it all lined up turn this around so you guys can see it line this up and then we're going to slide this into place to try and just keep everything as true as possible now you can kind of see how i've got this laid out with that line right in the middle right in the dead center middle of that hole okay i'm just lining everything up making sure i'm taking my time and then i'm just going to draw the circle here try not to move anything and again this isn't a super critical dimension but it's it's uh pretty important that you get it right because if you go too far this slot is going to be uh over the edge and you don't want that because you have to drill and uh tap a slot right in there so drill and tap a hole down in here so might as well mark the slot too while we're at it and then we're going to just use our punch it's going to get our spot that and our spot for this hole goes there all right let's drill and tap our holes okay so now we've got our holes drilled and this one is tapped this one down here in the bottom remember this is a 3 8 hole straight through i like to drill a 5 16 pilot hole because you're gonna have it in your your drill bit anyway or your drill press anyway uh for this hole so i drilled 5 16 all the way through because it does ride really super close to that inner wall in there these holes do so you know you want to have a nice pilot hole drilled through first and then finish it off with a 3 8 drill bit but so now we've got that drilled uh drilled all out i'm just going to take my plate set it on top here and just double check that everything fits you know the taps worked that everything looks good and looks pretty good to me not going to tighten it down too much thread through our other bolt here remember that's just a it's just a through bolt there goes all the way through and then we'll put a nut on that side but yeah looks good and we've got our swivel that we want 45 degrees looks looks pretty good lots of clearance on the top nice and flat so yeah now we're going to fabricate the uh we're going to weld this to this okay so these two pieces need to be married together and the easiest way i've found to do that is basically clamp them down to a work surface flat and then shoot some tack welds into it make sure everything's straight and then we'll finish the welds fairly simple you just want to make sure all all is in alignment that your hole is out front and that this is on the top this is have to align but i'm going to weld it like this so i'm going to lay it flat just take a couple clamps here get it in position name it flat okay and then we're going to do the same with this piece here this one i'm not going to clamp down too tight just yet because i'm going to use a just something flat to just make sure that it's in alignment with itself and it could come up just a little bit so yeah so now we're nice and flat and we're flush up against it and then we'll just tighten that down so it can't move anywhere all right so you can see everything is in alignment everything's nice and tight and straight across the top we're gonna put a couple attack welds right in here and we're gonna let it cool before we remove the clamps cool completely okay so now that it's cooled completely let me go ahead and take these clamps off yeah looking good you can see we've got spot for weld over here i just want to do some fit up before we finish our weld all right so let's take a look at the work rest table there's a slot right here at the top the way that the plans are set up there's a drawing in here that will explain the placement of this of this riser and this is the what i call the secondary tooling arm uh for the work rest but uh yeah so you get the primary tooling arm which is the big long guy and then you got the secondary one which is this guy this essentially just gets welded right up to the bottom of the plate and there's measurements in the plans that will make this align properly i just like to make sure that my my receiver will slide back and forth on each one so i just do a quick quick uh test on that and the orientation it's going to go on just to verify everything looks good and then we're going to make our measurements here follow the plan tack weld it to the bottom of the plate all right i've got my marks line everything up clamp it down and tack weld it now we're just going to do a straight up tack because we want to assemble this thing and make sure that it will in fact sit properly on the grinder okay now that i've got this clamped down there's one thing i do want to check and that's to make sure that everything is square in both directions okay just use a speed square for that and this looks pretty good you could probably go over on the top just a little bit in this direction so i'll put my first tack on that side and pull it over okay so now let's try to fit this thing up we're gonna put the work rest tooling arm into the work rest receiver we're gonna grab our mounting bracket here and our hardware slide this in and through i need a hammer for that apparently that tight like it tight oh yeah and then thread up our one inch bolt here get going and again this is the reason why i say you know tacking everything together is not a bad idea don't you know if you rush your welds and something's just not quite square you could always fix it and um you know without a lot of headache so in this case because we have only tack welds here if something wasn't quite right we could actually bend those tacks and get it straight and then we'll actually finish our welds all right so i've got a nut for this side use a locking nut for that side and get this somewhat tight because we we kind of want to feel what it feels like to have this tightened in there and then also i have my knob down here um i'm going to tighten down get this in the position and tighten this work rest knob down here and then we're just going to slide the work rest into place the way it should be and see if it lines up and yeah it does that's actually pretty good um and then we've got our knob here for the front of the device here so we're going to go ahead and lock this into place set it and then set this one kind of just get a feel for what it feels like when it's when it's riding up on its own if it's off just a little bit we can kind of tighten that down and then we can also tighten this guy and it should sit you know fairly close to 90 degrees off of the platen and this end needs to go oh maybe we need to just tighten this up a little bit she's really close but we might want to just use a little leverage and straighten it out give you a better angle here of what i'm up to so i've just got my my speed square here and i'm checking for whether or not we're actually square 90 degrees against the platen and if we're not because those tack welds are there i can actually manipulate that just ever so slightly and get us right on the money and while we're at it i want to check to make sure that it'll ride at 45 degrees this is the first one i've ever built so i just want to check that loosen that nut or bolt just a little bit slide this out slide this up or tilt it up 45 stop it right there and punch this up just a little bit and she slides right into place gotta love that man it's really neat to see something that you designed in cad come to life and actually work all right so let's go ahead and set it right back to zero again see how hard that is to actually do that so what we're looking for here with just a few minor tuning things is we want to make sure we're at 90 degrees you know off of the the work rest here and just kind of double check things this these aren't super important you know you can adjust a lot of this later but if you find that you're off by a couple of degrees here or on your uh your platen it's typically in the tubes so you can adjust this by shimming it up and at i'm going to make another video about tuning this thing and making it perfect but for now you know we're just working on the fabrication i do this little thing where i splat a weld if if these tubes don't sit in there quite right i'll splat a little weld down there and then i'll file it down until they do sit uh perfect in there but that's pretty much how i i tune the the entire grinder and i do that first but uh the next step really is is that we now that we've got the fabrication done uh we're gonna mount the motor in this and throw a belt on it and then we're gonna see how the belt travels so we can kind of gauge how well we did when we built the machine okay so here's our motor this is a two horsepower um it's a made by automation direct and it's uh it's just my favorite motor on the market if you buy the kit or the plans you'll get a link to a resources page that shows you all the different motors and vfds and everything you can choose from when building this device my go-to is the iron horse two horsepower motor all right so i'm gonna just take this and line it up and i kind of just manhandle this thing into there in the kit you get four bolts it holds everything together and this is one of my favorite parts of the build because that's when the balance of the machine really starts to show off just get them all finger tight here and then i will just slowly bring them up with my wrench to kind of tighten them all down some people like to put loctite on these bolts it's not necessary i don't think i've never had one come loose so but i use these button head screws or bolts because they uh they sit nice and low to the frame here and you don't have to worry about clearance issues with the drive wheel we'll need to go crazy and get them super tight just torque them down just a little bit now i've been uh recommending to use uh the five inch drive wheel from knife grinder parts i really like working with chas and i enjoy uh using his gear because it's it's usually always right i mean i've never had an issue with it uh the downside is is i prefer a seven inch drive wheel but uh as of late uh seven inch drive wheels are tough to come by so um five inches the difference between five and seven i'll make a video on that at some point there really isn't an enormous change in performance you do get some more belt speed out of a seven inch but this five inch works great you can get a whole set from chas for a great price there's links in the resources page for all of that all right so now we got our drive wheel all hooked up and i don't really torque down that uh retaining bolt too heavy because we might need to adjust it left to right now let's throw in the platen getting close here being done with this thing and i'm going to leave this loose for now and i'm going to go ahead and grab a belt throw on one of these fancy ceramic belts go ahead and throw on one of these fancy ceramic belts from empire abrasives their sponsor of the channel now and they make really good stuff and then i like to hold down the put some pressure on that and then tighten down the platen and it gets me where i want to go and actually looks like it's riding pretty good here let's see yeah i'm not seeing a lot of deviation on the belt so i'm looking to make sure that the belt is going to ride on the platen face and it's going to do it in a way where there's not a lot of deviation from top to bottom if there is like i said you may want to just check to make sure that you're 90 degrees off of your receiver tubes and all of that but this looks pretty dang good and just shot in reverse reverse looks pretty good too forward and reverse with absolute zero change to the tracking mechanism looks like we did it the right way so in the next couple of videos i'm going to make i'm going to make a couple more that follows up with this and one's going to be how to wire up a vfd we're going to take a deep dive into frequent variable frequency drives how to convert single phase 220 to three phase 220 and then also i'll do a video on tearing this thing down and tuning it so you know the once you're done building it it's pretty much out of the box if you follow the directions it will be fairly straight but you might need to make some minor adjustments and i'll show you how i do it and what i've learned over time so be on the lookout for those videos coming up in the very near future thank you so much guys for supporting my

everyone and welcome back today i want to take you along with me as we organize my kitchen and this is something that is very much needed while my counters are clear beneath the surface behind closed drawers and cupboards my kitchen has quite a few areas that are in desperate need of attention so i'm excited to get right into this and to inject some order into my kitchen and really give everything a place and a purpose so if you haven't already be sure to hit that subscribe button below for more simple and intentional living videos coming at you twice a week and let's dive right in okay so let's start off with some of the easier areas and work our way up to the pantry which is by far going to be the most challenging area to organize but one thing that i've noticed is that within our drawers i have a lot of different like sections we have very wide drawers and so one thing that i want to do is to divide up my drawers using these little dividers so that we can kind of make sure that everything stays in its place and i can easily create areas within these super wide drawers just to make the space a bit more functional so let me start by showing you what drawers i want to put them in and then we can get to organizing so this is the first area that i want to put a divider in really just right down the middle as you can see things just kind of get spread about all over in this area and so i think that just by creating a defined space for each item it's really just going to add some organization to this drawer and then drawer number two there is a little bit more than just putting in a divider and that i want to do here but first i do want to add a divider here so that we can just create one extra essentially box or just define the area that we can put things in again this will just help to make the space feel a bit more organized something else that i want to do is whenever i close the drawer these boxes um really just kind of move everywhere and so i also want to put some command strips on the bottoms of these so they stay in place and that way i don't have to worry about things just moving about and generally creating disorder whenever i try to open this it's also just going to make it a lot more useful for cooking too so that's the plan for door number two and then finally drawer number three is our junk slash utility drawer these are just the things that we reach for quite often so since i have two dividers left what i think i'm going to do is i'm going to cut this area into three and just hopefully organize these items by kind they're all things that we use and that i want to have in here with the exception of probably this and this i should move those but i think that just by creating some defined spaces in this area it's going to make it so that these items are just arranged in a far more practical way so that's the plan for some of those problem drawers in our kitchen i feel like everyone has those to a certain extent just drawers that don't kind of work exactly the way that you want it so i really hope that this is going to just add some utility some usefulness and practicality to our kitchen let's get to it now and start organizing those drawers as i was sorting out these drawers one of my biggest goals was really to create defined spaces and areas for items to belong i find that organization is so much easier to maintain when everything has a defined place where it belongs a home if you will and then another thing too i focused on was grouping items by kind keeping like items together really can make any system you create easier to maintain okay so the drawers are now organized and looking good i feel like especially the utensils drawer and the junk drawer are just going to be so much more useful now and it's going to be easy to find exactly what i'm looking for so i'm excited about that now what i want to do is just quickly look through the rest of the cupboards that we have in the kitchen to see if there are any kind of hot spots and areas that we want to organize so this is kind of christopher's cabinet is what i like to call it we keep our food storage containers here and then his tumblers workout things mugs all of that so nothing much to do there and then we just keep extra paper towels and water bottles there so i feel like this is organized enough and i just don't touch this area and christopher just kind of does what he wants to with it so i don't really want to try organizing that too much on him and then here this is decently well organized already we have our pans for baking some drying racks for things like cookies and such and then i just have a couple of baking dishes and pans down there so that's looking good and then again this one i already know is quite organized as well i really really like our pots and pan set these are from caraway actually came with these magnetic organizers so they're really easy to reach to get out back and they stay in place really well and then on the side here we attached the what is this called the like lid organizer it has these kind of sticky things that keep it up but yeah really organized here too and easy to get at so nothing too much needed there but this one i definitely know we have some stuff to do in here as you can see there's just a ton of stuff that i've kind of thrown in here and i've just let this area get really disorganized so what i want to do is just kind of go in and remove anything that doesn't belong to put it back where it belongs and then also to give things that don't have a home a better home so for example i have some extra tea packets here that can go into this box forty packet and then yeah just generally i feel like there's a lot we can do to make this space more useful so let's get to that now i'm going to start out by just really emptying everything in this cupboard putting it all on the counter organizing it and then we'll put everything back in a logical way something that i like to look for as i'm organizing is to see if i have any empty bottles or jars and to use any back stock i have on hand to refill them to make sure that they stay filled with useful items okay so this still might not be the prettiest thing ever but it is organized now i have all of my utensils and things for making tea in this little jar here all of the loose leaf teas on the side here my little dino infusing tea buddy i have a few of the bigger teas on that side there let's see here syrup here my french press here these are the things that i grabbed most often so i wanted to have them on the bottom shelf and then on the second shelf here things that i reach for a bit less frequently i have my coffee bean grinder and some coffee beans and then i also have some more refills for some of the teas that i have down here i'll often buy them in bulk and then just keep out a smaller amount which is just easier for me to keep organized and then keep the kind of larger stock back there so slowly working my way through those and then in this box i just keep all of my tea bags and things like that so this might not be the prettiest organization system although it doesn't look that bad but i definitely think this is going to be a lot more functional and definitely is looking better than it was okay and that finally brings us to the pantry and this is honestly the main reason why i felt the need to do a big organization of my kitchen i've really struggled with figuring out how to organize this in a way that's practical and useful and i've done a lot of research on exactly how i want to organize it so i want to give you kind of a tour of what it looks like now and then i'll talk about my plans for organizing it so as you can see there is no real system of organization here i have a couple of cardboard boxes that we literally had left over from when we moved that i've been using to store a bunch of things there's also like a random pile of crap there that needs to be sorted out let's see here i have all of our like oils vinegars salt pepper all of the baking supplies is there spices to the side okay this looks pretty nice okay if we can make the rest of the pantry look like this i'll be happy and then we have kind of christopher's row here let's call it it's got like crackers granolas his whoppers trail mix chips all kinds of stuff and then finally up here there's a couple boxes of cereal some protein powder and i think that's a thing of english muffins we definitely have our work cut out for us so let me flip you around now and i'll tell you kind of what i envisioned for this space okay so let's talk about our plan of attack first off i have a whole bunch of baskets here that i want to use to really sort everything by kind and just bring some defined spaces into the pantry right now it's these massive shelves that really don't have any way of breaking it into specific areas so i want to use these baskets to create those specific spaces for different kinds of foods so i'm thinking we'll do one for snack foods one for those oils and vinegars and kind of cooking ingredients one may be that's more baking oriented and put things like baking soda and baking powder in there and i think that's immediately going to help make this space feel a lot more organized and then the other big thing i want to do is you just saw that box that i had of herbs and spices and cooking ingredients and the jars in there are every different possible shape and size well i really want to just transform my spice area so recently i went out and bought these really beautiful they're glass with a bamboo lid spice jars and i got 24 of them i think and so they're all identical the same size so that immediately is a huge improvement and i love that but what i also did is i printed out these they're actually like stickers that have all of the different spices that we have and so what i'm going to do is cut these out label them and then fill these jars and then we're just going to have the most beautiful practical functional uh spice jar area ever oh and that's not all i'll show you in a minute but we also got this really cool it's kind of like a horizontal organizer which means that i'm also going to be able to visually see all of my spices at once too so i really think these two projects of putting everything into baskets and organizing by kinds and then also putting our spices into uniform same size jars that are easy to read is going to make a huge difference in our pantry so again let's begin with getting everything out onto the island so we can see what we have and assess everything appropriately and then begin organizing and after getting everything out i really just went through a system of trial and error and figuring out exactly how it would work best functionally in our pantry to organize all of these items i knew generally that i wanted specific categories of items grouped together but it did require a little bit of playing around with to see what would fit best where and what category each item would best belong okay so we've made some really good progress here everything is in baskets and looking organized so up here i've got kind of all of the cereals crackers tortilla chips and things like that arranged by height so it just kind of goes down in a nice little waterfall and very conveniently actually it just has cereals here and crackers here so it ended up dividing out really well over here we have all of christopher's snacks and i think his bread is in there so most of his like food area is right here then down here i've got all of the cooking oils baking ingredients and then dried goods so i've got rice oats barley things like that in that corner and then over here some dried foods so i normally buy these in bulk so i've got things like cranberries raisins things like that in those little mason jars and then finally down here i have all of our flour nothing really changed their flour sugar things like that other baking ingredients and then also my snack food so i've got some little chocolates here some trail mixes and then some superfood powders and then we have things like popcorn almond butter peanut butter and then again baking things like some yeast for making bread and things like that and then on the ground here i just have one last basket with over stock so i have things like refills for my flour when that runs out extra salt pepper things along those lines and then my reusable bags for going to the grocery store so then the last thing here is to sort out all of the herbs and spices in these boxes into these lovely little containers oh and this is the organizer i was talking about earlier it's got three kind of angled tears so it's really easy to see all of the spices at once so i think what i'm going to do first is to cut out all of these labels that i made and then i'll fill up the jars and then it's going to really easily slot into the pantry just right here so it's going to go in this spot i already tested it fits really well and then this pantry is going to be done so i'm going to get started just by cutting up all of these labels and like i mentioned before i printed these all onto sticker paper this is a waterproof matte sticker paper so they should stay in pretty good condition once they're all cut up and what i'm going to be using to make sure that i get nice straight lines for these is this paper cutter it's just like a straight thing that you slide across creates beautiful straight lines so hopefully these should turn out looking really nice let's do this okay so i've got all the labels cut now we've got 24 of them and this is what they look like so they each have like a number at the top the name and then i say if it's an herb or spice so i wanted to show you them that's what they look like but now i think we're ready to finally start applying them to our jars um okay so i have all of these spices labeled now love how they turned out so now what i'm going to do is take all of the spices in these three containers and start filling these guys up okay well we did it i love how this project turned out i think that these little spice jars just look so cute and not only that they're going to be really practical as well i am all about some aesthetic and really beautiful way of organizing things so long as it can be really useful when put into practice and i really think that's going to be true of these spices so the last thing that we need to do is put them into the pantry and then i want to finish this off with a completed pantry tour and we'll wrap this up okay so i am in love with this pantry organization the spices especially i feel like are going to be so convenient to just be able to grab whatever i need and to bring them over for cooking they turned out looking so cool and this is just a really nice visually appealing way of organizing them that's really practical too i already kind of showed you around what we had set up before but i did want to mention that i switched over some of the jars we had so all of the pantry goods we could have in one place in the little jars that i've got them in and then on this side now i just have all of the baking and cooking supplies so that's a small change for the pantry then again i have all of like the pantry supplies snack food or at least my snack food lunch stuff and things like that on that side and then this upper shelf is the exact same but i really do feel like organizing this section by type and then my size and then just putting some of the other loose items into baskets as well as really tackling the spices and turning them from these really kind of gross looking boxes with all kinds of different sized spices in them to something that's neat clean and organized really has made such a huge difference and i feel like this pantry honestly just makes me really excited and wanting to cook something and to really take advantage of it well that's it my pantry and kitchen are feeling so much more organized now and like i was just sharing i really do feel this like renewed sense of passion and energy and motivation to really want to cook in my kitchen so really excited about how all of this came out and i really do think that this is just going to make my kitchen a much more practical and functional space to work and to live into now i want to know though what is one strategy tip or tool that you use to organize your kitchen i'd love to hear about it so be sure to comment that down below and if you enjoyed

watching and i'll see you in the next one bye", "8UXznJJqSCs": "caddis Maximus here this time with a review of the Black and Decker Wildcat grinders since these are basically or almost the exact same tool I'm doing both grinders in one the 40 75 in the 40 76 yup I have that right this is Type three this type 5 you can see a difference in the handle change I think the older handle is a little there we go is a little better it's a little more profiled these are the infamous Wildcat grinders these are known as some of the best or most durable electric grinders made I don't know if Black & Decker or would be de Waal still sells these or not Makeda and a few other manufacturers make grinders that are real similar to these of course the milwaukee's and Mateos and all those are really great too but these were really famous for just being you know the grinders that set the standard through the 70s and 80s etc they're just super heavy-duty they use the special line boring so they have highly aligned bearings you can see the flange here this is my index finger it's you know 3/8 of an inch thick these are just excellent they're 15 amps this one's at 5,000 rpm this one's at 6,000 rpm that's the difference it's kind of funny they're both rated at 7 or 9 inch angle Sanders I mean or and just depending on how you order them they'd say exam 2 our grinder on them really the 6,000 rpm is optimized for 7-inch and then this one does have the seven-inch guard these things are really heavy they're like 15 pounds this has a cubit round wheel on it and this is actually in not bad shape this one is even though it looks pretty dirty I've I haven't actually seen these that have worked on shipyards and they've been drug across the concrete so much that this whole top parts been worn smooth and I mean it's just crazy they still run and like the body is getting ground down the front guard even though it's pretty thick is all eat up this one was obviously a lucky purchase and this is what a really nice one looks like we'll give you a closer look the guard is bolted on so it's not easy to rotate but it holds on very securely and you can actually use the guard the brace against your material and actually get some very aggressive cutting action as a nicely guarded spindle lock so you're not accidentally hitting it of course it's been the locks hole metal you can rotate the head in any of four positions so if you're doing primarily cutting operations you can rotate the head 90 degrees this does say a wildcat on this one one thing I was gonna show you which is kind of funny I think Black & Decker took the naming tools about as far as you can get because I think the Wildcats is one of the only tools that they did this on see they silkscreen this it looks kind of looks like a tiger a cartoonish tiger on the front of the grinder on this type 540 76 the so anyway that's one of the reasons they're called Wildcats and they of course have the Wildcat label these are very heavy grinders you know I can do that use these for overhead work or horizontal work unless you're doing like downwards cutting operations or something but these are just known for just lasting forever and having a ton of power practically able to stand on them and just not have to worry about the tool this always works will show you the power cord here it is extremely thick on these once again my index finger it's almost as big around with a huge heavy-duty plug will give each of these runs so you can hear and hopefully I don't blow a circuit breaker here we go we'll give the nine-inch quick run here if I hear let's go ahead and get this off the table all right here we go [Applause] always wear eye shields when working with grinders obviously and one lesser known fact is that you any new grinding wheel you're supposed to mount and then hold the grinder and like a trash bin and run it for like a minute if you have a defective wheel and it blows up it's one of the most serious power tool incidents literally is a grinding wheel exploding so you're always supposed to run in like a trash can your grinding wheels just to make sure that you don't have a defect and it's not gonna blow up on you but you can hear how smooth this one is they have a huge amount of power will give the seven-inch a quick run the other thing I forgot to mention obviously is the size of the gear box on this it has huge gears there's some of the largest I've seen on this 6,000 rpm it's like an inch diameter output gear on the motor by like five of eighths of an inch thick or something I mean it's huge these are meant to have just have a high amount of surface area on those gears to really really last so this is the 6,000 rpm seven-inch one it has a few more hours of runtime so you can see the way these torque over the 15 amp motor is no joke on these under full load they can easily draw I know a lot of power over 2 kilowatts they're notorious for burning up extension cords are pretty much 12 gauge only or 10 gauge on longer links other than that these are the infamous Wildcats this body style is very unique so if you ever see one even if it's so beat up that you can't see the labels as long as it runs all you'll be amazed these things are made the last hundreds and hundreds of hours of continuous use anyway thanks for watching please subscribe catice maximus out", "sisprxhsc6I": "keeping a dog's claws in perfect condition is imperative to avoid leg injuries if we acquire the right tools it's possible to trim the nails ourselves of course we need the right method along with these tools so animal wise brings you the step-by-step guide to cutting your dog's claws at home but some helpful tips to ensure it goes smoothly [Music] why is it important to cut your dog's nails normally dogs wear their nails darn when walking on hard ground this might not always happen so we should check them ourselves to see if they are too long if a dog's nails grew excessively they will be unable to walk properly uncomfortably they begin to adopt awkward postures leading to serious health problems such as sprains or injuries to their paws also the nail can grow so long that it burrows into the skin leading to pain and potential infection how often should the nails be cut a dog's nails should not exceed the pads of their paws as soon as we see them start to approach the end of the paw pad it's time for a trim what does it take to cut a dog's nails to be able to cut the nails of a dog at home without hurting them you'll need the appropriate tools for small and medium-sized dogs the most advisable thing is to use a pair of clippers preferably with a guard like this it's important to note that trimmers like cause come in several sizes so it's essential to choose the size which best suits our dog for larger dogs it is best to choose a guillotine style clipper with a more effective design and if we are to unsure of our own ability to trim a dog's nails with clippers as they do not like to be manipulated we can still use a nail grinder instead it's easy to use and allows us to file the dog's nails to the perfect length finally we recommend having styptic or silver nitrate harder to stop hemorrhaging if you accidentally cut too much both can be found in veterinary clinics now that we have the right tools we can talk about the formation of the dog's nails and how far we should cut inside the nail is living tissue which we should never cut since this would cause great pain to the animal the tissue can be observed by looking at the nail and the light showing a line of pink coloration which doesn't extend to the tip this is our cutting limit it is also imperative we cut in a straight line or at a slight angle which follows the natural shape of the nail if your dog has black nails and you cannot see the tissue you should place the dog in a flat surface and trim the nails on the grind now we start with these steps if this is the first time you've trimmed your dog's nails you should familiarize them with the Clippers and relate them to positive stimuli to do this let them smell the Clippers and give them a reward when they do this must be done for a few days before the Clipper create a relaxed environment and accustom your dog to being touched on their legs if you haven't done so already ask another person to help by holding the dog grab one of the nails and examine it see the living tissue and know how far to cut cut the nail with clippers in a quick and safe motion if you take too long it can make the dog nervous and they'll try to escape repeat with all the other nails for black nails you can use the grinder simply turn it on and place the nail on the right part following the product instructions if you cut too much stay calm stop the bleeding with the partner and reassure the dog so there can as well in addition to the previous guide we share some tricks and extra tips to ensure this is a positive experience for everyone touch their paws and nails on a regular basis so they get used to being handled present the clipping tools positively and reassure them not to be scared avoid cutting your dog's nails when stressed nervous or in a hurry it's best to carry the side one cam during the nail cutting session don't forget to use words of encouragement and reassuring pets who they associate the experience positively if you notice you're too tired or nervous stop and do it at another more appropriate time synthetic pheromones can sometimes help create a relaxed environment if you adopt your dog as a puppy start this routine as soon as possible only use clippers which are dogs specific be patient and positive as not all dogs will get used to this routine quickly if your dog has a lot of fur in their paws it's best to trim this before clipping their nails when to go to the veterinarian if your dog is too uncomfortable being manipulated or even shows aggression during a clipping it's best to go to a vet or professional groomer to have their nails cut also if your dog's nails are black it may also be preferable to visit a specialist have you find this video useful do you have any stories about trimming your dog's nails if so leave a comment below subscribe to discover new videos and we'll see you next time [Music]", "Z0O484KEC4Y": "tips and tricks' yep that's what it is tips and tricks it's Gail from Sam coffee gear and we get a lot of questions about the barista expressed by Breville and so we thought well let's do a video and some of the tips and tricks I'm going to give you will actually apply to other manufacturers and other machines it's some things that are just things you want to do across the board with a machine like this there's a single boiler machine so a couple of things right off the bat this machine is ready very fast but you really want everything hot not just the boiler inside that's ready in a few minutes you want the portafilter the brew head and everything hot so we recommend have the machine on for a good 20 minutes before you're actually going to use it turn it on in the morning go do something else come back to it and by then everything's going to be hot if it's not hot and your Brewer shot it's gonna make the shot cold which is going to it's gonna SAP the temperature out of the shot it's gonna be sour so you don't want that so that's my first tip is preheat this machine for quite a while for 20 minutes or so before you actually want to use it the other thing is this machine comes with pressurized and non-pressurized baskets the pressurized baskets actually well they look like they're double wall and they look like this versus like this with a bunch of holes in it this is non pressurize this is pressurized this happens to be a single this happens to be a double but it's going to look the same these pressurized baskets are meant to be user friendly hence if you don't have the grind of the coffee right on they're gonna compensate and still going to give you a crema on the top it's not a true creme it's more like a faux crema for the person that doesn't want to be all fussy about the grind of the coffee they're great but if you want to up your game go to these the down pressurized and then dial in that grinder and I'll talk to you about that in a few minutes what I guess one of the other really important things on any machine keep it clean do your cleaning and your descaling on a regular basis that's a that's something that people neglect just like changing the oil in your car if you don't do it your car doesn't run right after a while the grinder setting is going to be as important as anything and I'm going to show you that in a minute about dialing it in with the non-pressurized basket you're looking for a double shot which is two ounces to come out in twenty to thirty twenty to thirty five seconds the grind and the tamp is what makes that happen the finer the grind the more restricted it is for the water to go through that ground coffee so it's going to go through slower so if you're if it's coming out in 15 seconds make the grind finer and then maybe tamp a little bit harder as well and try that and it's gonna take you a while and every time you change coffees to a different blend or a single origin you're gonna have to do this dial again that's an important another important tip water let's talk about water you want halfway-decent water you don't want water with too many minerals in it and you don't want water that is void of minerals like reverse osmosis or distilled that the minerals add a certain amount of flavor so if you want to actually get it perfect which not too many people do this but if you want it perfect get reverse osmosis or distill then on our website there's a product that you can adds just the right amount of minerals to a one gallon of water so that's on our website and I think I can't remember the name of it I think it's global but check that out on our website that's important too it's going to improve the flavor of your coffee the other tip is fresh beans without beans that are half way fresh you're not get grandma you're not going to have good flavor so try to have your beans you know fresh roasted and then talk to the person that the the Roasterie and see how long they recommend that you can use those beans because every roaster has their own idea the Italian blends their maiya roasted in a different way with a nitrogen flush they're good for months and months and months so check out the the coffee's and make sure that that's fresh as well what else steaming of the milk this is just a traditional steamed arm so it's gonna take a little more technique and I can show you that as well we'll we'll pull a shot and I'll show you what looks like a good shot and then we'll also steam some milk and steaming is very hard it's not an easy thing to do unless you have a pannarello so let me get some coffee we're gonna use the libera Sumatran queen cut Tierra in this machine today now let me talk about this roaster just a little bit they are run they are owned and operated by veterans and they still have active military working down there they sent us some samples and we were just blown away every one of the samples of their coffee turned up to be really good so check that out on our website as well so that's what we're gonna be using in the grinder today one other tip with the grinder let me just swing over here and show you on this grinder the way it comes from the factory it's going to be good and use it just the way it is and this is your adjustment there is on the underside here another adjustment if this machine just will not grind fine enough or it's a couple of years old and the the burrs are seating themselves a little bit different there is an adjustment under here that you can get into and you'll see it in here I hate to get out of the frame here but anyway this comes out and then in here you take it's in I don't know if it's in the book or not I would think it would be in the book you take this out and you take this out this little clip and then you can rotate this to make it finer or coarser and it says right on here it'll tell you that's only if things are working right or a couple of years down the road things are seemed to be changing that you want to do this this is not something you want to do typically right out of the box just won't let you know that back in there keep the thing clean to you know clean out this bean hopper every now and again wash it with sudsy water and then let it dry and put it back on keep it clean vacuum out the birds clean those out as well put some grinds through there with this machine because it's like a standalone grinder you can actually put the product made by your necks in there it's called grinds and you can clean the grinder out then chase it with some whole beans all right let me get some milk I put some coffee in here and then we'll show you the other tips and tricks okay we got the beans in there and I have deliberately set this to a grind setting that is going to make it come out too fast and you'll see that it just won't even look good and then we're going to taste it the other thing is this gives you an indicator of the ground when it's brewing if the grind is the proper consistency this needle should go up into this dark grey zone if it doesn't if it's below it's not enough pressure so it's back pressure from the coffee so it's too coarse and if it goes way up here and hardly anything drip drip drip comes out it's too fine so the other thing is this machine does pre-infusion which is nice and I think you probably know if you already own this that it does it and what it does pre-infusion puts a little bit of water on the coffee sits for a minute wait time and then brews and it saturates the coffee better makes for a better brew all right I'm gonna time this too to show you all right [Music] should be two ounces in 20 to 30 seconds that's the pre-infusion and the weight watch this needle it's not going up high enough Oh 17 seconds for two ounces it's a little shy 2 ounces actually it's programmed for a little bit less but oh man that's awful awful awful it's it's way sour that's probably that's a nasty shot I haven't had a nasty with one like that in a long time we're gonna dump that put some water in here so the other thing is when you make an adjustment we're gonna take it down I'm gonna it's on about 14 right now and I can't really take it down unless it's running so we're gonna make it run I hate to say it but this is a conglomeration of the previous grind and everything in between us I was grinding dump get rid of it it's not going to reflect the true nature of the the difference in the different setting that you put it on so this is all just trial and error folks it really is you know nobody likes to waste coffee but it's the only way that you're gonna get it dialed in properly either hate to say it but you aren't gonna waste some coffee in the very beginning okay so I took it down from 14 down to about 10 10 and a half let's see I mean it was so far off typically you would take if you get close and you just want to dial it in a little bit you take baby steps take it down maybe one notch and that's it oops all right it's time this this is popping way up look at that way and that looks better that's more of that caramel a rich honey tone it's a little shy on length that was a 20 about 24 tastes a lot better mucho better now what I would do if I was doing that same grind I program it to keep it about the two ounces but what I'm gonna do now I'm gonna make it even finer I'm going to show you what it looks like if it's choking it Oh dump that all right and what you'll get if this chokes it and it's all just coming out drip drip drip too slow it will be bitter too slow makes bitter too fast too sour too hot is better to call this hour those all those variables this is a science let's forget this rinse down a little bit not that it's going to really affect the flavor much because it's not I can guarantee it's not going to be very good start I'm gonna make it come up to two ounces and see how long it takes I'm programming it if it comes out look at it going up way high if I took it even finer it would choke it we're already at 22 seconds and it's only at an ounce okay 35 seconds I mean it might not be all bad some coffees like to be brewed a little bit longer actually that's not bad at all but imagine if I took it up even higher it would come out even slower and it would turn into a it would be very bitter this is actually not bad this coffee does very well at about 35 seconds so I would say that's where I would have the grinder set for this particular blend it tastes very good every bag is gonna be different you'd go to a different blend or a different single origin it's not gonna be the same you're gonna to dial it in again so the only thing left I wanted to show you is steaming if I can get some techniques here but let's see what we can do blow that out first it's got to heat up that tells me it's heating up because I want to wipe this Office's we're done this is another another tip is keep this clean very important it's reef this machine autofills the boiler so start with the tip in the milk and then back it off and till you hear more of a missing noise and you'll see bubbles you back it off too far your bubbles are gonna be huge and if you get just right you actually create a nice foam and a nice swirl going around in a rotation and it'll make it a nice drink bury it it's the tip too much no bubbles have it hanging out too far big bubbles you want that happy medium and then put a thermometer in there in the beginning you want between 140 and 170 degrees above 170 it's scalded it doesn't taste good then the other thing is you can use your hand and when you can't hold your hand on the bottom that's a pretty good indicator that you're at about 150 or so of course everybody's hand is different so I got some foam great it wasn't paying attention totally but the other thing is so important open this up either down like that or whatever just to get the milk out of that tip otherwise next time you go to use it it's gonna have crusty milk in there and nothing's gonna come out well now that I've made a mess I think I got across all the tips I can think of water grinder adjustment preheat the machine steaming cleaning it keep it clean I think that's basically it but if you have any other questions by all means ask them in the comments down below and don't forget you can always call us or email us and we'll respond as fast as possible and you know I think those are all the tips and tricks I can think of for this machine thanks a lot for watching Cheers [Music] you", "b1vYiHWS9Z8": "hi everyone in today's video we are going to unbox stainless 600 watt angle grinder so that's how it looks so it has like a 600 watt capacity and one thing uh you will you should notice is uh it doesn't come with any blade so uh before buying that uh do mind that because you will be needing it in order to attach this one so inside the package if you can see it's it's like saying stanley so it's authentic product and inside that you will find angle grinder right and it has a indian wall plug and then it has a handle which will uh be a place something like this so it's a screw based thing it looks very uh very strong and sturdy and then you will find a key or to like tight and lose this stuff so that you can add any blade to it and then you will have this service center list so i will just show it just in case if anyone wants to see it i will just go one by one so it's by looking at this you can understand or know how big company is they have almost in every states they have a service center and then the last page and you guys can always comment if you want to know any of those numbers i think mostly it's from the maharashtra only well that's it i think so uh then you will find a uh like a warranty card something and you will get a 3d hologram sticker so that you can know that that's authentic product so it company bases on bangalore and i was not sure that stanley and black and decker have the same company so that's my first time i'm looking at that so i know the stanley companies exist but black and decker i have black and decker iron as well but i was not sure uh they are the same company so okay okay so now uh this is the model number as you as it suggests uh 600 6 watt oh i mean 6 000 watt uh not six thousand what i'm saying 600 watt okay 600 watts so so this is the manual you will get so if you can see uh they have mentioned like figure one figure two so there is a key to like uh reading this manual you you won't find the reference of these figures uh just after this one so they have published the warning after that which is like made me confused because most of the manuals have warnings and stuff after assembling so they put it before that and now if you can see even here you won't find anything related to the figures but when we go here so now you will start to see the figure related information so you need to go to page 8 in order to read this manual [Music] so now uh we are done with this so i have uh read this and now i understand how it will going to work so let's get started so in order to buy this you you must have a blade so i was really i was really having a hard time while choosing the blade so many uh users suggest that that that it won't be able to accommodate 110 mm blade only 100 mm is suitable but in the market if you go you won't find 100 mm blade that easily so i have bought one very local blade which says that the 107 mm and we will try to add it here and see whether it will able to work or not and i have also seen many uh like drill machines which are using 110 blade as well so i guess it should be usable with this so let's just try to attach it on the drill so in order to do that first you need to unscrew this and if if this is tight this tight enough you will see if you try to move it like that the whole section will start moving so there is a button which will lock this and now you can easily remove this and after removing this uh you will find another versa kind of stuff which also comes like this uh it doesn't have any uh like this attachment which will uh use it for tighten the stuff it will just get inside like that so according to the blade you have you need to like uh add it this by like this or in the opposite way so uh how you can able to uh tell how uh what attachment or inward position you need to add the screw so you take the blade right and try to put it inside above it so now it you can see it's totally fit so now the screw should go like that and if you try to put it in a opposite direction and then try to put it it will just keep losing itself so uh by doing that you can uh like fully sure that that it's a good fit so let's just try to move it and it will not going to move it so that's one way so that's how in that position you will you need to add this so no need to uh like revolve it around this and now we will put this on above it and then the main part so i think uh there is a uh two direction as well so one is this and another is in the opposite direction so uh i think we should put it in this way so that it will get locked to this position and if you can if you remember the opposite way is like was like this and i think and that time you need to put it something like this let's just see it again and see whether it will fit or not so now that's fit but if you put it like that it will keep like keep moving so when we do that i think that way it will be fit tightly so let's just put it in the same way which we have discussed and then add it and now let's try to uh try this so now in order to tight it uh you need to use this and you need to push this button as well so i will just press this button and try this so now you can see now we are able to tighten this so that's how you add this add a blade to this mechanism but one thing we forgot to do it is uh there is a protection cover for this so let me just bring that i think i have lost it in another room so i'm back so this is the another attachment uh which comes with this so i forgot to like add it so let me just remove it again so again in order to remove this you need to push this button and and uh move it in opposite direction so now it's it is in a loose position and you can just take it out and take out the blade and place this on it so i'm guessing uh let me first see uh how it should be added so if you can see uh the picture of this the way we should add it is [Music] it's in this direction so there is a on off switch for the reference and it should be cover here so let us try to put it for reference i think it's pretty much the same now and let's just try to tighten the screw so i will use this what should i say i think page cuts and i will try to tie this so you can see what kind of screw it has [Music] so i think it's tight enough and it looks solid don't tie it too much because you need to like lose it again so according to your own requirements so i will just for the sake of showing i'm doing that so let's just follow the same steps again and add a blade so now you can see that's a 107 mm blade and it is not touching anywhere on the guard so there is a like how much distance is left it's more than i think 4 mm is left i think a total of 5 mm so it's a 187 blade so if you put i think 110 it still have a 2mm space left so i will try to use that as well i think i'm doing something wrong ah that's looking much much much secure and i will just again use the button and tie this off so i think we are good to go so i will show you uh while cutting it like uh what are the results so the blade i got it in the local market is for around of 25 rupees only so let's see the performance of this so it was he was saying that it can cut wood and iron as well so we will try that but it can be used for cutting so guys you have seen uh how i use this grinder to cut the wood so this blade was uh specially designed for iron i think but you can do cutting on wood as well so it's my first time so that's why that's why it was like very weird but it's fine and there is a correction which i want to make is uh when you uh add this thing uh to the blade you always remember that it shouldn't moving so earlier i i was saying that it should be like in the opposite way but when i try to like turn it on it was moving a lot so you need to make sure in which direction it it is not moving so for this blade particular blade uh in this is the way it should be attached so there shouldn't be any gap in between so as you can see and for the right-handed person uh it should be placed like this so you have a stainless mark here so you need to add the handle this so that you can move something like in this position so i think i i have given you a overview of this if i purchase any plate i will make those videos as well so for now uh i think uh that's it for this video so if you have like any queries regarding this please comment below and i will try to answer them as soon as possible and if you uh like gain anything from it it or it was some helpful for you please like and subscribe um and thanks for watching have a nice day bye", "aS2_tuua-7c": "I can't just pick this video without first saying this at the last restaurant that I worked at I was known as the sausage boy so now that I'm making this video it's really come full circle unfortunately let me explain all right so we're in sausage lane or so cig land if you're into deep fried Gordon Ramsay means two things first I was called sausage I was called sausage boy not because I made a lot of sausage but because I literally said the word sausage so much in a New York accent not my paradise takeaway but it's just fun to say sausage the second thing is sausage is astonishingly easy to make you've got a tube you've got some meat and yes Duff the meat in the tube if it honestly is that simple there's a couple things of minutiae like salt percentages and adding fat to it and stuff like that but other than that I really honestly feel like more people would be doing it if they just saw singe for themselves why I think that's gonna be the last sausage part of the year let's just make this shall we so the two things that can make sausage confusing is the fat percentage in the salt percentage you know to me the ideal fat percentage for sausage is twenty to thirty percent but just to simplify it's just easier to go ahead and use a boneless pork shoulder roast or a Boston butt roast because those tend to be around the 20 to 30% fat range and then if you want you can always just add a little bit of extra fat using pork fatback which all this you can get from your butcher really easy to find and cheap now obviously in order to grind and stuff your own meat you're gonna need a grinder and a stuffer but luckily I found this nice little KitchenAid attachment for thirty bucks that does both so it's pretty dope link is gonna be in the description you might already have one it's time to put that bad boy into use relevant seasoning the sausage by eye we're actually gonna be working off of a percentage which for us is gonna be 2% so in other words you want to get the weight of all of your meat and fat for the sausage in grams and then multiply that by point zero two and that will give you a 2% weight of exactly how much salt you need to use so for every pound or 453 grams of pork shoulder you're gonna need about 1/2 a tablespoon or 9 grams of kosher salt now just a matter of flavoring the sausage which I will be giving you three different examples now before we start spicing grinding any meat we need casing I'm using natural hog casings here I know this is something that grosses some people out it's it's it's up to you but if you're using these natural hog casings then you need to make sure that you take them out of the packet and rinse their salt cure off and then just let them sit in warm water for about thirty minutes before using now the first sausage that we're gonna be doing is an American favorite also known as the mild Italian so you're gonna start with three pounds or 1300 grams of boneless pork shoulder a quarter pound or 113 grams of pork fatback which is optional then just cut that into pieces that'll easily fit into your grinder I actually like to cut them into long thin strips so that way it just just faster then we're gonna get our spice mixed together so get one tablespoon or six grams of fennel seeds 1 tablespoon or six grams of coriander seeds and two teaspoons or five grams of black peppercorns place this in a dry pan at set over medium heat and host them shaking the pan often till they're fragrant about 2 to 3 minutes once that's done just grind them up until they're nice and fine in a spice grinder or blender or whatever or a mortar and pestle and mix that with 2.5 tablespoons or 29 grams of kosher salt then combine the meet with your seasoning along with three cloves of garlic finely minced mix all those ingredients together until everything is thoroughly incorporated then just run your meat through the grinder accordingly you can run it through a fine or coarse grinding plate up to you I like it on a fine one okay so you've got your mild Italian sausage meat but before we start stuffing let's do the other two iterations next we're gonna be doing a non traditional bratwurst so Germans I'm sorry this is not a traditional one but it's gonna be two pounds or nine hundred and seven grams of boneless pork shoulder and 1/3 a pound or 151 grams of pork fatback highly recommended slice that stuff up and two tablespoons or wait no wait don't do that yet then toss all of your cut pieces of pork and fat with a spice mix consisting of one teaspoon of freshly ground black pepper half a teaspoon or 3 grams of mace or allspice a small pinch of dried savory and two teaspoons or five grams of dried mustard give it a nice little massage then run it through the grinder same as before the last one is gonna be a mer Gaz sausage so you're gonna start with three pounds or 1300 grams of boneless lamb shoulder cut that bad boy along with half a pound or 226 grams of pork fatback highly recommended now to spice this bad boy we're gonna do two teaspoons or six grams of cumin seeds and one teaspoon or two grams of fennel seeds toast both of those like before and then grind them into a fine powder and to that you're gonna add one teaspoon or 3 grams of sumac if you can find it 1 teaspoon or 2 grams of ground cinnamon and 3 tablespoons or 33 grams of kosher salt mix all that stuff together and then add it to your cut-up lamb with a quarter cup or 60 grams of harissa paste and 7 cloves of garlic minced yeah that's right 7 we're going hard on the garlic game today toss all that stuff together and then show them that the grind never stops 100 ok so once you're ready to stuff that ground meat in there the first thing that you need to do is emulsify that meat and fat together really nice so just gonna do that by kneading it just like a piece of dough and just go back and forth that's right we go back down to bread City even when we're working with me I just do that a few times until you can see that the fat is beginning to sort of mix with the meat it's not quite so separate anymore okay so now we're ready to stuff in your casing should have soaked by now so once they're done soaking just run a little bit of warm water through a single casing then attach your stuffing tube to whatever grinder attachment you have make sure that screwed on tight then we rub the tube with just a little bit of oil spray on oil or whatever and then slide on a single casing like you see here making sure to leave about 1 and 1/2 inches or 4 centimetres of overhang now this part is easier than it looks it just takes a few minutes of practice so start up your stuffer on a low speed and add your ground meat to the feeder slowly fill up your casings pulling the casing when necessary to allow it to float downward as you fill now don't fill these to the point of being super tight it's okay if it's a little looser and even you can adjust later you don't want these to break when cooking also the casing tears no worries just popping meat back into the hopper and keep going now keep this process up until you filled the entire casing making sure to leave another one-and-a-half inches of overhang on the other side as well once it's all filled up figure out what length you want your sausage is about 5 to 6 inches is good and then start with the farthest end and pinch with both hands to close both ends at that length then twist the sausage to tighten and form that closed end repeat that along the whole sausage making sure you're not unwinding any of the other links until you have a fully linked casing that's it just repeat that with all of your meat and casings now do check to see if there are any air bubbles if there are just poked them with a fine tip needle or in this case I used to wall anchor because I didn't have one please don't judge me and yeah just lightly poke them don't tear it then just tie off both ends and place these on a baking sheet in the fridge for four hours or ideally overnight so the casings have time to dry a little those twists won't unravel when they're dried properly also just make sure to flip them halfway through their drying process just so that they dry evenly now you have fresh sausages you can cook these however you like but I prefer to gently poach mine by placing in a pot with just enough water to cover and then gently poach them over medium heat for about ten minutes then you can sear them in a pan or grill them however you want you make some nice sausage buns with German mustard and kraut or sort of a fancy bangers and mash or an easy snack with mirga's and creme fraiche a nice little preserved lemon relish you know a little bougie but not too bad but do you want to know what else is little bougie b-roll [Music] all right guy said that is it so homemade sausage which I've gotten a couple DMS on Instagram Twitter and all that about people having granular attachments and never using them well the if you've got it the time is now and you won't regret it and you know what else you won't regret you won't regret following me on Instagram Twitter and all my other social media which will be in the link in the description so thank you so much is still in the works but we got a design nailed down it's being worked on right now and hopefully some aprons I'm really trying to figure out how to get aprons going I'm talking to teespring right now there's just a lot of things up in the air it's I don't know why a lot of people don't offer aprons they just don't care about us it hurts it hurts me it hurts us but with all that said if you enjoy this video or you learn something leave a like subscribe and I will see you next time [Music]", "ZrfD8VAXsSI": "hey everybody out there in vape land this is the vape ologists here and today I've got a review of some aluminum grinder shredders from aerospace they also make wood and acrylic versions but these aluminum models are without question the strongest alloy grinder you can use I decided to really put it to the test putting herbs or tobacco an aluminum grinder or just isn't that much of a challenge I know echinacea is pretty tough to grind up maybe even st. John's wort but I want to see what these things are really capable of so I took the grinder review on the road to a cookout I was meeting up with some friends on the river to enjoy some man sodas and cook up some pepper steaks so I thought this would be a perfect test let's see what these things can do with some whole peppercorns aerospace has got many models and sizes a two-piece that just grinds but more importantly a four or five piece that separate two different levels of grind I need some fine grind for the salad and some course for the steaks today I'm gonna be using the mill version that's got a crank on top for extra leverage but I ended up not needing to these grinders are really burly what is the quick turn the peppers were instantly reduced to an excellent coarse grind and under the fine screen was a fine powder this has a huge advantage over standard pepper mills they can't separate the grinds it produces the nominal version blasted through them as well there was no challenge whatsoever these CNC aluminum grinders are definitely built to last there's a strong magnet keeping each lid on and the screens if they have them are really high-quality and pressed in super tight a lot of grinder manufacturers I've got loose or wavy screens and that's not what you're looking for aerospace also has a removable screen model if you would ever need to clean it the teeth are brutally ferocious and the anodizing is properly done aerospace h's the end pieces for extra grip and that really does make a difference each grinder also includes a small shovel to help pick up the finer grind and comes with a nice black bag to be honest it was almost impossible to tell that there was ever anything hard inside the grinder it just blasted through peppercorn with such ease there was no challenge whatsoever even using just a tiny one-inch 2-piece nod mill grinder went through them like butter damn that's just what these steaks are gonna need fresh whipped butter you", "qCw8BNAY0YA": "you hear that area that's a finely tuned 250 watts 1,600 rpms and it's so good and so reliable it's the last Rinder you'll ever have to buy hi mark and Morgan from whole lot sale of calm with an in-depth look it's a Messner mini grinder today we have it in black which gives a contemporary touch to this classic design the mini is a commercial grinder when I say that I don't mean commercial light or commercial quality or prosumer I mean it's designed and built for use in cafes and coffee shops but it's just sixteen point five inches tall and in the die cast aluminum case in black it's a size and look that's doable in the home we always advise customers to get the most grinder their budget will allow if you go with the lesser grinder at some point you'll probably want to replace it or upgrade but this master gives you everything the ultimate and quality put together to grind for a lifetime and when you look at price and features it turns out that the master mini is a real value compared to many of the consumer grade plastic cased step grinders in the market that's right I'm the mini you've got infinitely variable grind adjustment that means superior control from super fine Turkish grinds up to coarse grinds for French crepes so if you've been dialing espresso shots on a step rinder you're gonna love the level of control you'll have with the infinitely variable adjustment the master operates with the timer so you turn the dial for up to 60 seconds of continuous grinding and that timer is a good thing because when you run this grinder without beans it's almost silent so when you don't hear it running don't worry it'll shut itself off if you forget it's got a super strong 250 watt direct drive motor that runs at 1600 RPM and direct drive is part of why it's so quiet it's not geared like many consumer grinders that motor drives 58 millimeter flat birds made of Swedish hardened steel now those master burrs are known as the best in the industry they grind fast without overheating beans and produce a very consistent particle size these are fed from the space-saving hopper which holds about a pound of beans again the total height of the grinder is 16 and a half inches so it can fit places most commercial units camped the hopper has a slide to shut it off so you can remove it without spilling beans ground coffee feeds into the doser which has a 200 gram capacity this could be set to dose between 5.5 and 9 grams per pull it's adjusted by turning the knob in the center of the dosing container below the doser and adjustable fork holds the Porta filter in place and a polish tray catches any overflow the grinder comes with a pressing device which attaches to the side of the doser but many owners will forgo mounting this preferring a handheld tamper instead but it's there if you want it for cleaning and calibrating remove the safety screw from the adjustment disc and turn the disc out clockwise and lift off the top birth from there it's very easy here's a link to our video showing the whole cleaning and calibrating process you know when it comes to quality that matters our Mini is an exceptional value for those looking for extreme control and long lasting reliability it really puts a lot of power in a home setup and we really like the black finish it's gonna give you the professional capabilities to take your espresso and other brewing methods to the next level that's the mazzard mini in black it's available now at a whole lot they loved calm I'm mark and I'm Morgan thanks for watching and be sure to

tuning in to the Robinson knowledge YouTube channel and today we're gonna be showing you guys how to refill the mccormick peppercorn grinders now these are meant to be disposable but I actually don't like to do this cuz this is glass um glass doesn't break down forever in a landfill it's a very very long time so um if we can we're gonna reuse this and I'm sure you guys had to do that so I see a lot of people online cutting this open cutting the red piece out doing all kinds of weird stuff to get this top off cuz it does just turn in place obviously so the grinder can function properly but you don't need to cut anything you don't need to take out this red piece all you need to do is simply pull the top off it just takes a little bit of finessing sometimes now sometimes the motion of taking this off can make all the stuff on the inside fly out so I wouldn't do this until this is empty or just about empty here we have pretty much just a few little things left so if it flies out it's okay I just want to make this video refilling it but all you need to do is this cap just pulls off okay now there is a little bit of a trick first of all if you just can't seem to get it after this method you can try running this under warm water for a while to kind of soften the plastics a little bit and that will help or some people you could probably use like a hairdryer but regardless you're gonna separate the cap from the glass and if you're strong enough you can probably pull it straight off but most people can't do that so what you can do is almost like you're trying to break it trying to snap it in half where the pivot point is gonna be obviously where this meets but you're just gonna bend one of them like so so you're gonna wanna try to bend this one at the base while also pulling out this way so you're gonna come out this way and Bend like that and that should allow the cap to come off and I'm trying to get this as good as I can in the camera without flinging pepper corns everywhere so grab firmly on one end firmly on the other pull apart and push it out and of course my hands are getting a little sweaty pull it against my body a little bit yeah see I can see it's getting a little you can see it's off tilt tilt it a little bit so it's close oh yeah and it's close it's coming off right now yeah you can see it's more tilted and you keep bending it and you'll see a lot of the pepper came out but we have the cap off the most important part so now all is left to do is just refill it I'm gonna dump these little ones out of here real quick and we're gonna go ahead and refill this with a just a peppercorn you get these from your grocery store or if you can't find them or you want a bigger container I will put some links down Amazon down below that's where I actually got mine off if I order a lot of stuff off the Amazon so we're gonna open these up uses put these in here I wouldn't fill it up to the very brim that way you have the room to put the top on well like I just did being stupid so dump a little bees out but regardless I can just put those and in a day or so I use a lot of pepper so and then all you do is just press the cap back on and you can push the cap straight back on you don't have to do any kind of weird angles really it just takes a little bit sometimes put it between your hands and snap it back on and as you can see we're all good to go the adjustment dial still works because we didn't cut this off like some other video show you how to do we got big flakes we got small flakes but most importantly of all we recycled this glass and didn't throw it in the landfill right away even if you only get one extra use out of this you're still recycling you're still one less class you're gonna go out and buy and after you're done with this go ahead and go out and buy a permanent pepper mill I'll post some of my favorite ones from Amazon down below there's all kinds of cool ones there's thumb press ones you know if you're gonna use a pepper grinder get a permanent one so you're not sitting here buying disposable ones and just throwing all kinds of glass in landfills that's it for today guys I'm gonna stop ranting I hope you learned something hope you got your pepper mill filled up this also does work for the salt mills but I'll post a separate video on that as I have one of those until next time guys slap the like button if to help you out until next time peace out", "35nJskauwQI": "so so [Laughter] [Music] bye hey so so [Music] [Music] [Music] so so [Music] [Music] [Music] hey there thank you for watching my first attempt at making raindrop damascus i have learned a lot and i want to jump in to point out a couple of things that i don't think show through in the video first if you want to try something like this yourself keep in mind there is a lot of wasted materials i haven't measured in weight but i think is more than half of wasted materials in scales and grinds then for this particular pattern i think a higher layer count would have looked cooler and i'll try that out next time for sure and finally make sure you don't drill holes symmetrically on both sides of the billet as i did because that will lead to pockets and holes after you draw out the material in thickness anyway i'm very happy the process has worked out overall with good forge welds so no cracks or delamination in the damascus and for that i have to thank my friend my mechanics for making this awesome dice for me he went through the effort of using h13 steel that is a very tough steel for hot metal working and these work absolutely perfectly so much better than the ones that came with the power hammer and now i even have the option to make my own attachments that can sit between the two flat dies and secure thanks to these threaded holes he made a video about making those dies so go ahead and watch that right now i will leave link everywhere and of course subscribe if you are not already and that's it thanks again for watching and see you next time bye you", "BcPFVAKbdv0": "today we're gonna go through the steps of making the perfect french press coffee you'll need freshly roasted whole coffee beans clean purified water a French press an electric burr grinder a food scale and a smart gooseneck kettle the most flavorful coffee starts with freshly roasted beans if you can find a local roaster or go online and find a supplier who can deliver freshly roasted beans a lot of people are familiar with dark roast coffee and that's what they think coffee is supposed to taste like but I'd actually recommend going with a medium or even light roast coffee you're gonna get a lot more flavor from the actual coffee bean with a light or medium roast coffee whereas dark roast so much of the coffee is roasted away and all you're really left with is carbon which gives you that burn almost charcoal like taste to your coffee the next step is measuring the amount of beans we're using to make our cup of coffee a good starting ratio is 1 to 15 and that just means for every gram of coffee beans we're using we're gonna be using 15 grams of water that's about three tablespoons of coffee beans to every 8 ounces of water the most important thing is being consistent so we're gonna use a food scale to ensure our measurements are accurate zero at the food scale and measure the coffee beans before grinding for this French press I'm using 32 grams of coffee to grind your coffee beans you have a lot of different options and they come in all shapes sizes and price points I'd recommend an electric burr grinder these are a little bit more expensive but trust me it's totally worth it if you start with a hand grinder or a blade grinder you're soon going to be tempted to upgrade to a full electric burr grinder these let you dial in the perfect grind size so that your coffee grounds match the type of coffee you're making for the French press we're making today we're gonna want a grind size that's a little bit larger coarser more like sand or soil before we add our coffee grounds to the French press we want to Prime the French press with hot water just pour a little hot water in there to warm up the glass this ensures consistency and temperature throughout the brewing process once you pour out the hot water now you can add your coffee grounds don't overlook the water the better the water the better the coffee don't ruin what could be a great cup of coffee by using water that's unfiltered or unpurified water that's too hot or too cold is going to affect the extraction of the coffee and the brewing process and that's get impact a flavor giving you less optimal results never use boiling water boiling water is gonna scorch the coffee grounds and make them taste worse the optimal temperature for your hot water is going to be between 195 and 205 degrees Fahrenheit boiling water is 212 degrees Fahrenheit so if you got boiled water you're gonna want to wait about 30 seconds before you add it to your coffee [Music] zero out the food scale and then with your gooseneck kettle pour the hot water over the coffee grounds until we reach four hundred and eighty grams remember we use 32 grams of coffee so for a 1 to 15 ratio we're looking for that 480 grams of water it takes four minutes to brew the perfect cup of coffee and a French press so the moment you add your hot water start a timer as you're brewing your coffee you'll notice a crust of coffee grounds forming on top of the water at the two minute mark you want to break this crust to make sure all the coffee grounds are incorporated into the hot water once your timer hits four minutes the coffee is finished brewing press down on the plunger and pour out the liquid the French press method will result in some very small particles remaining in the coffee this is a former residue at the bottom of the cup and creates a texture to the coffee that's a little silkier if you prefer a cleaner brew you can pour the coffee through a coffee filter to extract all those particles where you're only left with the liquid this will result in a really clean cup of coffee and that's it the only thing left to do is enjoy the perfect cup of coffee made with a French press", "FzOY2tHyZ4w": "- Today we're gonna review this, the Niche Zero Grinder. It's a grinder that has confounded my expectations in a good way. So let me tell you about\nwhere this came from. This I first saw on Indiegogo, and for that reason,\nignored, because it was from an unknown manufacturer,\nit was crowdfunding, and it made some big promises about fixing problems with coffee. And those three things\ntogether are a giant red flag. And I will broadly ignore anything that has those three\nthings, on crowdfunding or anywhere else., because most of the time it's just not gonna happen. There's been a lot of companies turned up, new to manufacturing, gonna do something big and bold and I'm gonna kick start it, or put it in Indiegogo,\nand you get nothing. You get burned usually. So, I ignored it, to my\ndetriment to be honest, because for every rule that\nI have there's probably and exception, and this might just be one. So I wasn't gonna look at it, I wasn't gonna review it, but then they got in touch and said did I want to, you know, to try, and I\nsaid no, I have a Patreon. Which is amazing, so thank\nyou to Patreon supporters. Which means that I can buy the equipment that I review so it's\nan independent review. And I explained this to them and we agreed that I would buy a unit, and they gave me a small discount for\nwhich I am very grateful, but I still bought this and this will be given away, sort of, to a Patreon backer. So this thing's \u00a3500 in the UK, and ships, I think, all over the world, they do a one ten and a\ntwo twenty volt model. And, for the money I have to say compared to other grinders at the same price point, it's pretty small, it's pretty light, it's about five kilos, but\nit feels very well built, it feels very nicely put together, it feels really solid, it sounds solid when it grinds, it just feels good. Now, design wise, I can't tell you how to feel about how something looks, it looks like a kitchen appliance, it has a little bit of\ncoffee grinder in there and a little bit of juicer in there too. It comes, I think in jus two\ncolors, a white and a black. But I like how it looks. The detail around the wood is nice, it's built by someone\nwho's built things before, and this I think is really key, it might be a new company, but Martin the guy behind it, has spent a long time designing and building products, and I think that really really shows. So, it's called the Niche Zero because it's big promise is zero retention which we'll get into also in a little bit. Now, the design I think is interesting because design is about picking problems and finding solutions for those problems. There's whole suite of problems you can look at with a coffee grinder and I think the selection that they've chosen to fix or attempted to fix here,\nis a very smart selection. For example, this is not a grinder trying to fix dosing for you. You are gonna weigh your coffee beans, put them in, grind them, right. The grinder is gonna do no work to help you dose your coffee, whatsoever. That's not a problem it's\ninterested in solving. Here, wat they're really trying to do, is get out everything that you put in. The whole point of zero retention is that there's nothing left inside. Which is mostly true. It's not entirely true, there's always gonna be a little bit of retention and even if you put eighteen and a half in and get eighteen and a half out, that doesn't mean zero retention, there probably was some coffee retained and exchanged and replaced, the old replaced by the new. And it retains a consistent amount. But that amount isn't very much. So it is definitely an\nespresso focused grinder. And so the work flow with this is very very simple, you've got an on/off switch on the side, you've got a lid. Under the lid you have you're bean funnel where you're gonna load your coffee in once you've weighed it. Conical Burr set in here. It's from Mazzer Koney Burrs in here. The funnel is also your grind\nadjuster, which is nice. It's a step less adjustment with a little indicator on here as well to see where you've been, where you're going. And, coffee in, close the lid, there's a little micro\nswitch here, and turn it on. It really is very very simple. And I think that's a really good thing. Not only for longevity, but in terms of componentry that's gone into this. This is well built, there's\na good motor in here. There's a good set of Burrs in here, if you like Conical Burrs. And that's very nearly it. With the exception of one thing, which is this little thing here, which is your dosing cup, which I think is beautifully made because this is juts under 58 mls which means if you want a dose from here into your Portafilter just put your Portafilter on top, upside down and the flip everything over. Zero mess, zero fuss. It's a beautiful little\nthing that kind of should be available with all coffee grinders. The idea of sort of tipping ground coffee into a Portafilter, the spill, the mess, the new and additional funnel, all of that noise I'm\nnot interested in it. I like this kind of zen approach of what's the least I have to do\nto get great results? That's really a thing I like a lot. So let's talk about performance. How is it to use to make coffee with? Well, as I said it is a Conical Burr set in there, it's the same Burr set as you might find in a Mazzer Koney. And I am not a huge fan\nof Conical Burr sets compared to flat Burr sets, my preference has always been for flat Burr sets. I pulled a bunch of shots with this and I had some very very\ntasty espresso with it. I did pull shots with this against a Mythos one as a kind\nof benchmarking tool. And I really liked the\nshots that I got off this. I slightly preferred\nthe shots of the Mythos for having a little bit\nmore clarity to them, which isn't hugely surprising, it's a good flat Burr grinder, I really like the shots from it and the espresso blend I was using was benchmarked against it so, the odds were stacked in\nthe Mythos one's favor. But, I really did enjoy the\ncoffee I got from this thing. Some really nice shots, didn't speed up too much in the\nsecond half, didn't show too much in the way of\nsigns of channeling. I was pretty happy with the shots that I got from this thing. I think there's a couple of really neat, clever little things here. Adjusting the grinder's\nvery easy, very intuitive. The spacing between sort of dots and sort of guidance is good. You need to make a decent enough movement to have a\nsubstantial change in grinds. You feel like you can tweak quite easily, which is kind of nice on this. There is a calibration function for the little dot under here, if you take it all the way fine. You can then adjust this bottom ring so that it lines up with calibrate and you should be pretty calibrated, grinder to grinder to grinder. Now, this wasn't perfect for me but it was a pretty good starting place and a pretty good idea I think. Certainly you have way more calibration than you would do with\nmost typical grinders that just have a selection\nof random numbers from zero to nine that you're\nsomewhere on at some point. So, overall pretty happy, and I spent most of the time pulling shots in the middle of the espresso region. In terms of things that I didn't like as much, I wish this held\na little bit more coffee. Because sometimes I wanted to make a large batch of coffee with this. I'll often make a liter of coffee and I wanted to use it for filter coffee and it performs pretty\nwell for filter coffee. Again my preference might\nbe for flat Burr grinders but I really enjoyed the\ncoffee I got from this. But you can just sort of get about fifty, fifty five grams in here. I kind of wish it was\njust a nice even sixty. That's just me. Now if you do want to grind for sort of a medium sized batch\nfilter from a half liter up to a liter, you're gonna\nbe too coarse for the dial. Which is a bit of a shame. I know some people have\nstarted putting dots on the other side of their dials to sort of track where they're going with the coarser grind\nsettings and I think that might be an interesting\nimprovement for the future. And I suppose one of the bigger complaints that I have with this is that it does suffer pop-corning a little bit towards the end of grinding a shot. So those last few beans\nas they're grinding tend to bounce around quite a lot and take a little while to\nsort of suck them through. You're looking at, at\nleast a twenty second grind time for eighteen\nto twenty grams of coffee, so it's relatively slow but not so slow that that's a problem for me if I was pulling shots\nat home or anywhere else. But it does popcorn a little bit. And that means those beans do grind in a way, a little bit coarser than the other beans which isn't ideal. It's not a big problem, like I said it doesn't really damage\nthe shots generally but if you compared let's say, eighteen grams of coffee that had not pop-corned at all by let's say grinding twenty five grams and stopping early to eighteen grams that\ndid have some pop-corning in it, then I would see maybe a four, maybe five second variants\nin shot time as a result. So having maybe a better orga system, maybe feed beans in, I don't really know what the answer is but I do know that pop-corning does change your grind a lite bit, so the more\npop-corning there is the more variants you'll have as a result. That maybe why some of\nthe shots don't have the same kind of clarity as a Mythos with a hopper full of coffee. You know, grinding through like this in any grinder that you'll grind through will produce a small\nvariants in grind setting as a result of those last\nbeans having no force behind them kind of driving\nthem into the Burrs. No weight of coffee behind them. That's true on an EK, that's true if you single dosed a Mythos, that's true if you dosed\njust sort of anything really, like a Baraza Granda\nor something like that. Those last few beans on\nany grinder will popcorn. In some cases they popcorn\nmore than others, that's all. So that's something I'd like to see addressed in the future, and also I'd be interested to see if they ever do build a flat Burr\nversion of this grinder, that would get me very\nexcited indeed, but- I should give you a summary right? Like I should give you\na summary of how I feel. And to be honest, charmed, I feel charmed by this grinder, I just really like it. I like the way it's built, I like the design thinking behind it. I think it's really enjoyable to use. If you said how does it stack\nup against a Mahlkonig EK43? Well I would say that's a very dangerous question to ask, because the EK is a nice set of Burrs, accidentally designed by Mahlkonig at some point, attached to not a particularly compelling grinder. The EK is not beautiful, it's heavy, it's expensive, it's not particularly pleasurable to use, it\nhas a nice set of Burrs. This is a pleasure to use, this sort of highlights a lot of the flaws of a grinder like the EK because of it's\nease and pleasure of use. And I'll give you an example of just what feels nice and simple. I got a bag of coffee from a friend and just a small bag, and I wanted to dial it in, and so here I would dose eighteen and a half grams, grind eighteen and a half grams, pull a shot and make an adjustment as necessary. And yeah the retention\nisn't completely zero, there's a little bit of\nexchange happening there, but it's so little that you don't need to purge between grinder\nadjustments, right. I would adjust the grind and just grind a fresh dose straight afterwards. And I had no issues with that. It meant that very quickly, very easily I could dial in to exactly\nwhere I needed to be, with almost no excessive waste, right. I got a lot of shots\nout of a bag of coffee and I don't think I'm alone in people using this grinder. So, from a waste perspective,\nit's pretty great. The retention is certainly\nlow enough for me to be very very happy\nwith it, I don't think there's any issues with it's retention. It's just a pleasure to use. And so, yeah, the way\nthat this works is that Patreon that fund each\nmonth let's me go and buy equipment to review independently. But I wanna keep this, I'm not gonna give it away so I'm\ngonna buy a brand new one to give away to Patreon backers and this one I'm gonna keep, I kinda just want it around, there's a lot of uses for a grinder like this for me. And it's rare that I wanna\nadd to my collection of stuff. It's rare that I want one\nmore piece of kit in my life. I have enough stuff. The whole point of Patreon\nis to give it away. I don't want to accumulate endless stuff. The good news is, they build these in one ten and one two twenty volt which means that I can sort of open it up to Patreon backers\nall over the world it doesn't matter, I'll ship it to wherever it needs to go, and I kind of like that I get to give\naway a brand new one and it can be white or\nblack and they can choose. I'm gonna keep this one though. Overall I'm impressed,\nas a sort of first time product, a first time manufacturer, I think they've knocked\nit out of the park. That's not to say it's flawless, but it's great, it's\nvery good and I've just been enthusiastic about it to other people which has got to be a pretty good sign. So there you go, that is my\nreview of the Niche Zero. Do you have a Niche? Do you have one of these? How is your experience so far? Are you seeing less coffee wastage? Are you happy with the\nshots that you're getting? Does the pop-corning drive you crazy or does it not bother you at all? Are you brewing filter coffee? What kind of results are you having? I'd be really interested to hear your thoughts in the comments down below. Please share them with all of us.

Chill bowl & beater for 30 mins 2 tbsp of powdered sugar. I have taken regular sugar and I have grinded it in mixer and 10-12 ice cubes Lets start with this perfect recipe at Creative cooking Take the packet of amul fresh cream out of freezer when you are ready to whisk Cut packet and scoop out only thick cream into chilled bowl The main thing to remember here is that bowl and Amul cream has to be chilled properly We have taken thick cream in bowl and this is thin cream which we are not using in recipe Now take other large bowl and put ice cubes in it Over this place small bowl which has thick cream Take water in large bowl and freeze it and place ice cubes over it Place small bowl over it and start whisking it with chilled beater at slow speed Now you can see soft peaks have started to come and cream has doubled its size Now we will addd powdered sugar to this and whisk it at medium speed The cream will not whip properly if .... thick cream was not separated from thin cream bowl/beater/cream was not chilled enough Less ice / cold water was taken in bowl Cream was whipped for less time For a stiffer peak, we will continue to beat this at high speed for 20 seconds Wow look at this perfectly whipped cream My goodness I can eat this just like that This is awesome :) :) I just feel like putting off camera and digging into it! If you have enjoyed this recipe of Amul fresh cream, give it a thumbs up and SUBSCRIBE So i can make more recipes like this !  ", "VenkvIeGqxk": "hey this is cam with black tail studio in this week's table build i'm getting a custom base designed for me making a really big photography backdrop and eventually getting crushed by my own table stay tuned if you've watched very many of my videos you've probably seen me shop up at gobi walnut before and if you don't know gobi is the world's largest supplier of these big walnut slabs like the ones i use in most of my videos what you probably don't know and what i didn't know tell just a couple weeks ago is the majority of their sales actually come from out of state so they have a really good web store which i had to go to for this particular video because i couldn't find what i needed in their showroom so i put in the species i wanted the size i wanted and the price i wanted i ended up finding this slab right here which as you can see cost a thousand bucks which wasn't too bad for one that was over nine feet long and up to about 62 inches wide at the widest point one thing you should be aware of when you're shopping for these live edge slabs whether it's at gobi or anywhere else is you need to know if it's dry or if it's still drying and this slab was still drying so i had to give him some heads up told him what my timeline was and it took about eight weeks for them to get it in their kiln and get it completely dry and ready for me and this one i checked with my wagner meter and it was at like seven or eight percent which is plenty dry enough for us here in oregon i am very paranoid about getting my clients the exact size table that i promised them when i start so you'll see me mark two lines the inner line is the actual finished size that i've told my clients the table will be the outer line is more of a buffer for me when i make my mold make my cuts so when i am all said and done i can cut it down and end up at the exact finished size i promised them which is usually about a two inch overall buffer so i have an inch buffer on every side length and width you'll see me struggle a little bit with the saw because the slab was about two and three quarters to about three inches thick in some areas and this saw only cuts about two and seven eighths so some cuts went well and other cuts i can see we had to do a little candy dance there to break them off people are always asking me what tools they need to make these epoxy tables and if the tracks isn't the most important it is really close because you can see i had to make a pretty unusual cut for that kind of odd shaped piece and it would be really really hard to do without a track saw i was all set to start cleaning up my slab and of course it started to rain and just a little bit of water isn't really going to hurt it but you wouldn't want to stand out in the rain for 30 minutes or an hour and let your slab get completely saturated that could cause it to warp or twist and right now it is really flat and in really good shape so waited for the sun to come back out got my chisels got my angle grinder and my wire wheel and started going to town and overall this is my least favorite part of the job but it is really really necessary you need to remove all the soft stuff all the bark so when you pour your epoxy you have just really good hardwood for that epoxy to grip too i mentioned an angle grinder and a wire wheel and this is my favorite tool because it essentially removes all the bad wood and leaves all the good wood and i do recommend using a variable speed angle grinder because it makes your wire wheels last a lot longer and i will include links to both those in the video description the next thing i do is i go through and i seal all my edges with a clear epoxy and what this does primarily is this prevents any of the black resin i'm gonna be using from soaking in and staining that table top showing that black resin in the wood recently i made a video specifically on how to make a mold for these epoxy tables but what i didn't show is what to do is if your table is bigger than a sheet of melamine from home depot and since this table is going to be oh about nine feet by almost four feet and a sheet of melamine is about eight feet by four feet i had to extend it slightly and not terribly complicated added a bit of caulk pushed it together and then added a couple pieces of tape and that is it and then i continued to make my mold like normal only difference is on the sides i had to extend them just like i did the base not only does sealing the top and bottom of your slab with shellac prevent any color staining from any drips that you get it also really helps prevent any warping especially if you leave your table in the mold for a week or a month because if you have the top unsealed and the bottom is sitting there in a pool of epoxy you can really get some warping and twisting in your slab since i'm a one-man shop i'm always having to come up with ideas to move these big slabs around by myself and this is one i do pretty frequently at least with the larger tables is i just build two of the sides to start so that way i can slide in the big slab instead of having to drop a big heavy slab in vertically by myself which would essentially be impossible what happened here though is i forgot to scuff up my sides before i did that so i had to slide it back out scuff it up and then i could slide it back in and build my third and four sides to this mold if you're watching this video because you want to learn how to make epoxy tables like this one i have several blogs that should help you out with that process one of them is a step-by-step guide on how to make a mold just like this one i have another one on how to calculate exactly how much epoxy you're going to use and in both those blogs i should have videos as well so i will include links to all those blogs all those videos in addition to all the tools and consumables you've seen me using in this video in the video description below a few months ago i mentioned becoming a brand ambassador for liquid glass epoxy which means i am now sponsored by them and so some of you probably wondered if i am just a sellout and first of all let me put that rumor to rest i am definitely a sellout it is all i ever wanted to be but i do sell these tables for about ten thousand dollars so i personally would never risk getting one of these tables sent back having to redo a table having to waste thousands of dollars in wood just to save a little bit of money on epoxy so i am definitely a sellout but i still would only ever consider using the best possible epoxy because it's a relatively small investment when it comes to the total cost of a table like this one that cost around ten thousand dollars liquid glass advertises this as a two to four inch thick epoxy formula which means you can pour anywhere from zero to four inches in a single pour i however i'm a little too nervous to pour any epoxy that deep all at once what can happen is you actually create too much heat and the epoxy can crack and split on you which is what happened with my very first epoxy pour with a different epoxy brand so i'm gonna do the first pour just seal everything up about an inch and a quarter inch and a half then i'll come back top it off all the way up to that two and three quarters to three inch mark the liquid glass doesn't smell particularly strong i do recommend wearing a mask any time you're working with chemicals so what i'm doing here is just brushing in the side sometimes the bubbles like to cling to the sides brushing them will kind of free them and enable them to come to the surface and pop on their own right here i'm making a little dam this is going to save us some epoxy so instead of having to flood the entire top of the table the dam will kind of hold everything in one place right here you can see the epoxy is pretty well set up it's not even close to hard yet though but the epoxy temperature has peaked and after about 18 hours that epoxy will peak anytime after that you are really pretty safe to do your next pour so i do recommend going before it gets completely cured if you do let your epoxy completely cure you can go back scuff it up do your second pour then and it will cure perfectly fine but this is how i recommend doing it if at all possible wait about 24 hours or so till that epoxy is just tacky then you'll get a perfect chemical bond with the first layer there is a lot of information in making one of these epoxy tables so i apologize if i'm kind of rushed if i talk really fast while getting through all this but i'm trying to get through a ton of information in just about 15 minutes so if i'm unclear on anything if i left anything out or if you just like me to elaborate a little bit feel free to ask me in the comments because i am really good about responding to essentially every single comment that someone asked below so only thing i ask in return is that if you like this video if you get something from it hit that little subscribe button hit that bell button because that's what enables me to keep creating more content just like this just like most all of my tables i had this one surfaced on an industrial planer up at creative woodworking northwest in portland oregon if you don't have a creative woodworking northwest in your particular town i recommend checking out my blog on three ways to flatten your slab and i go into all the ways to flatten it if you don't have access to an industrial planer like i do i'm not entirely sure how many of these tables i've built at this point it's probably about 40 or 50 or so which isn't a lot i think there's some companies that probably do close to that many in a month or two however i still come up with new tips and tricks almost every single table and this is one that i struggled with for a while some of those tiny little pits can be really stubborn and hard to fill because they are so small they don't really allow the air to escape when you try to fill them so i started carving them out slightly larger and then filling them and that worked a lot better when i first started making furniture all i wanted to do was make big tables i thought they were the coolest thing ever and while i still want the money for bigtables the initial allure of the big table has worn off because of things like this right here got pretty well crushed and it hurt pretty good the table was fine and that is why i have the styrofoam down on the workbench so if anything does happen it doesn't actually hurt the table but the initial appeal of the large table has slightly worn off a lot of people ask me if i put as much detail into the bottom as i do the top and short answer is no i don't i generally sand the bottom to about 150 grit i don't want the bottom to look bad or distracting at all but i don't feel that you need to put the same effort into the bottom as you do the top because when you see my finished video that'll be out in a few weeks i put a lot of work into getting the top just absolutely perfect at the very start of this video you saw a 3d rendering on this table base by bryson steele and he's just a small one-man steel shop kind of like i am a one-man woodworking shop and he does really really good work and he does those renderings at no charge and this was a really unusual table base that my client found and i didn't exactly know how to choose the size i knew how high it should be but everything else i didn't know so he was able to draw the entire thing up at no charge and have the client approve it so that way we knew exactly what it was going to look like when it was done i love using threaded inserts but i am always so nervous using them in epoxy and i try to avoid it whenever possible however the way this base was oriented i really didn't have a choice in a couple spots so a couple tips is drill the hole slightly larger than the other ones add some epoxy to hold it in there and go really really slow one thing i haven't done that i should try that someone told me about is warming up the threaded insert slightly with a torch so when you thread it in it actually kind of melts the epoxy instead of cracking it the idea of using c channels in these large slab tables originated from a company canadian woodworks a really really cool shop up in canada and i specifically asked him if he invented it and he would not take claim for that he said somebody could have thought of it before him but he didn't get the idea from anybody else anyway with his permission i made a video a couple years ago about how to inlay them and i've been thinking about doing another video maybe a little deeper dive on when to use them how far to space them and just kind of get some good tips and tricks from him on where and how they use them so let me know in the comments if that's something that interests you guys if you think that you would be interested to know when your table may need these c channels and when you're probably fine without them the video i made previously was all about making your own c channels however these c channels come from concept 13 which was formerly a part of canadian woodworks actually and they are much nicer and much easier than making your own they are also not that expensive so i will include a link to those in the video description as well if you've seen my other videos you've probably seen me use this gem buffer or as the owner just called me the other day he asked me to say it's actually a sander that can also be used for buffing and normally there's a little attachment that allows my hose to click in there i just seem to have lost it so i tend to gravitate towards my festool however it does make a good sander that can also be used as a buffer this is another trick i've picked up in the last couple tables and that is warming up the epoxy slightly with your sander and then scraping it off because if you don't warm it up it can kind of tend to chip out and break out whereas if you warm it up it kind of gets a little bit gummy and you can come back scrape the majority of it off then come back with your sander and smooth the rest of it out if you're worried that you're not detail-oriented enough to spot every single flaw and make sure it's perfect before it leaves your shop one trick i've learned is get a wife with ocd and that will ensure nothing ever leaves your shop that's not absolutely perfect a few weeks ago i made a full video on how i do this edge profile trick and this is just something i came up with a couple months ago and using my track saw to get a perfect chamfer on the edge and the reason i came up with this is because i didn't have a router bit big enough to go this deep and you can't really even buy them so it is a pretty cool trick that you can do with your track saw earlier in the video i mentioned the table like this would cost around ten thousand dollars and i am well aware that is a ton of money if you want to get the most amount of money possible for your tables it's things like this it's going to make all the difference there's a lot of people doing this so taking your time taking a full day on tiny little touch-ups on your sanding pattern using a light stick like that just getting the details absolutely perfect that's what's going to enable you to get the most amount of money for your table i've been talking about my new favorite finish for a few weeks now and it's not a secret the finish is called rubio monaco i'll add a link to it in the video description below the technique i use is not very hard you don't actually need to even use a buffer like this is one of the things i like about it you essentially wipe it on wipe it off and there's a little bit more to it than that and in a couple weeks i will have the full finished video i promise and the reason is it's such an easy finish to use it looks amazing but most importantly it's like bulletproof i have some tests that i've done where two hours of standing water and not a single mark so i promise that video is coming out in a few weeks and i will give a step-by-step guide on how to get an absolutely perfect finish in a dusty shop like this i previously made a video on getting a perfect finish in a dusty shop and i was using osmo and the main problem with osmo is that it really isn't that great protection i found i get a lot of water spots and damage from hot mugs and things like that and this one i have had a lot of success with so the personal items i have that i've finished with odie's oil and osmo i am refinishing all of them and i'll have some videos on all of that in the coming months and this is not sponsored this is not like liquid glass this is just a product that i've really taken to i love this satin sheen one of the things that you can't get really a high gloss with rubio which is fine for me but if you do like the high gloss you do need to go with something like an osmo i try to show you guys every possible view when i'm done making these tables because if you get a video that has a couple million views someone is going to see what you tried to hide and there's nothing more embarrassing than having somebody in the comments call you out for something that you try to cover up in the video so i'll do a little sweep around here and show you just how even the sheen was overall i just couldn't have been happier with how it turned out and i think a week or two ago i had a blue resin table build that i went with a high gloss and that was the osmo and that again that finish won't be as durable but you can get a lot more sheen out of it i have that finished video coming up along with this finished video if you're wondering why it's vertical and weird it's because this was from my instagram stories so satin video coming along with that high gloss blue finish video in the next coming weeks when i take my photos i normally do them on my nine foot paper photography backdrop however since this table was nine feet that wasn't going to work it was going to hang over the edges so i had to come up with something this was some sheets i bought on amazon added some grommets added some screws to the top of my garage door and came up with this backdrop and i don't really like using sheets you can this photo turned out pretty good but the rest of them showed either none of the legs or a bunch of wrinkles like you'll see here just in a second so i'm going to need to get my wife who knows photoshop to fix this photo and the next one but overall the tables turned out great just didn't love the photos two of the most common complaints we hear about social media are too many ads and the algorithm buried my post and that is why i am especially excited about this week's sponsor the jump because we have collaborated to start an all-new woodworking group called that wood life and that wood life is going to be a place where you can go share your work maybe you're just getting started or just finishing a project i can go share a new trick that i've learned a new hack that i've come up with not have to worry about whether or not the algorithm deems it important enough to put it in front of you because apparently in the jump there is no algorithm and there's also no ads so if you want to show a little support from my page and maybe find a better app to share your work on click the link to download in the video description right now thanks so much every week i like to give a little bit of credit to the people that make it this far in the videos so this week start your question or comment with your name or even a fake name because i probably won't know either way and that way i will know you watch the entire video and i promise i will answer all of your questions or comments first so thanks again so much for watching please subscribe for more videos just like this one", "J3FKio7lfeg": "okay welcome back friends about a month ago I reviewed this item right here this is a work sharp knife and tool sharpener it's the Kenyan Edition and this thing is just simply awesome [Music] [Music] it has five different grits on it right here some different belts that you can switch through so you can start off with a coarse grit and work your way down so you can actually go to a strapping belt which makes your knife nice and sharp if you want to check out my video I show how it cuts this tomato up close it's a really like soft tomato and that knife actually I'll just tell you as a testimony how sharp it was about a week or two later my mother-in-law was over visiting and she's helped my wife make some dinner and she was slicing some potatoes that I happened to come home after work and I saw her sit in the table with the knife in her hand and she had a bandaid on it and she said hey you didn't tell me that you sharpen your knives so she said she end up cutting her stun which I felt bad about but just to show you how sharp that knife was you know she's used that several times before it's just that much sharper so I guess I should almost put warning labels on my knives because there's that sharp you know the thing I like about this system right here it's just really fast and easy to sharpen knives so I can just go through my house and sharpen a bunch of them in a short amount of time a lot faster than using this method let me show you I have this whetstone right here so you have to soak this in water and then you have to keep applying water to it and then actually one of my knives I scraped it because I wasn't able to maintain the same angle but the work sharp sharpener has really helped to maintain that proper angle to keep you from a scuffle your knife but you also recommend it if you're nervous about scraping knife to put some painters tape on your knife just during the sharpening process to keep it from scratching so then I try me this video right here I started to get a little bit curious about this attachment right here this is the work sharp blade grinder attachment can any in addition so this only works with this right here so the way to do it if you're going to want to use something like this you can't just buy a kit that has them all in one you to buy this and then yet to buy this and I'll have some links down below but just so you know this is kit number RWS k TS - k oh and this so I'm looking for a model number on this but it does stay right there the attachments for this one right here it does not fit the WS k TS it has to be the - Kato fork in onion so I'm gonna point the camera down we're gonna open these up and take a closer look at how this works right here so one thing I notice after owning this for about a month or so this has several different parts to it and for storing it I really only have this box right here so when it comes to storing I was doing about using this to wall bag right here but it might be just a little bit small I don't use it for whatever tool came with this I have this larger rocker bag right here this looks like might be a good fit so one of the upgrades when you go to this right here you go from a three-quarter inch belt to a one-inch wide belt I think these are like a 12 inch belt and that's a 18 inch belt so it looks like you're gonna get longer life because it's a longer belt and wider belt deal and we're going to open this up to install it here's all your belts right here so you just see the difference between the two belts the old version the new version okay so looks like it's pretty simple just slide that there any of this tightening knob right here that's what keeps the belt in place so you have a total of five different belts that come with it this is a really soft like a strapping belt so letting you have some coarse grit medium grit fine extra fine I believe they I've heard this is a clay belt right there so we're gonna probably find a medium grit right here we're gonna find a dull knife to practice on so to install this looks pretty simple I guess that's it right there that was fast so right here is a spring tensioner you need to see that automatically keeps the right amount of tension on it and that's not right here you turn it if you want to align your belt so you just keep it in the center let me show you there we go it's on the back side right here you can loosen that so if you want to change the angle you can see right there see how it changes the angle right here by pivoting this somebody want to go 15 degrees but I think for the most part I'm going to do a lot at 25 degrees so I'm gonna dial in right there again I have a couple of different pocket knives this one right here I've been using quite a bit this is a Milwaukee Rockville knife has a really cool design almost looks like an eagle right there someone said it has a raptor claw like from Jurassic Park on it then I also have this drop point that's probably what I'm gonna start out with see how sharp we can get this these are both stainless steel blades so I like about this one right here you can turn the belt on and leave it running and then you can use two hands to guide it across the belt the other sharpener you get to have one hand on the trigger and then you have to use like your right hand going back and forth so I think this right here just it's gonna be better all-around so one of the things I read in the comments that you can see in the link down below people have said when they put this attachment on they have never gone back to the other one so and the other ones really good too but this is just that much better you don't need a really fast speed so you can adjust the speed let's see what I got here [Applause] okay so I went seven times across and now yep you can fill that little burr but you'll fill that burr going all the way across so what you do then is do the same amount of strokes seven going this way so you just put the spline down right there that's your reference point that's the 90-degree so you just try to duplicate that and then you start right on the edge there and then when the tip gets in the middle of this then you lift it off so let's try that so now we're going to step down in belts so this one's actually easier than the other one to change the belts I find so I probably have started a little bit heavier grit that I needed to on a 65 right here so we'll go down the 22 and then the X 4 and then the 12,000 this is the narrower the x4 this is the fine thus dropping one right here okay so now we're gonna test it out in just a second so I think I may have shown you this leather item right here force dropping this is from a friend of mine made a belt and a wallet that I still use he's from the same town right here Ashland Oregon and this is something that this sounds like the rougher side and I put some of the green compound in that so whenever I sharpen my axes and knives I'll take this right here you see that green in there and just I think this gives it that really nice finish so like in the little barber shops whether that big piece of leather this is just kind of the same thing this is like a smooth piece right here it's kind of my finishing touch right here I think when I do that that you just cannot beat the edge that you get all right so we're gonna get a piece of paper here and see how this works so just to be clear this is the very first night that ever sharpened on this right here so let's see how I did oh man looks like it's cut pretty good alright and this is I think like a $19 knife right here so what do you guys think now the hawk bill right here this is gonna be a little bit trickier to sharpen and I think this is gonna be a better setup than the original one and I stripped a lot of wire and then cut a lot of boxes down with this so I think this one's gonna really pay off to be sharpened I don't even know if it will cut the paper yeah you can you can feel it it's cutting it but it's it's rough I just feel like you can change these belts super fast and you should be able to sharpen a knife I would say within like three minutes so now I'm going to try the Hawksbill right here and see how that works so we're going to go to the 22 the geese are coming back King to see it's an awesome sunset going on tonight no wind and it's about 55 degrees out and there's my bird dog Oakley yep he's just watched him so this Hawksbill right here it's going to take a little more skill so let's just see if i can keep up with that curve all right so let's move belts [Applause] don't change belts again [Applause] [Music] okay so that should be pretty sharp definitely look sharp good this dropout my finishing touch on it right here okay the moment of truth cutting paper oh yeah I'm loving it oh man this is awesome check that out this thing is just amazing man I'm loving it so I touch up the straight knife right here so let me just show you how sharp that is on some paper see the point works really nice I was thinking this was a clip point somebody else told me it was something else I don't know what they said this style knife is it's like a hunter's knife model number four nine eight so this is a old paring knife this end up kind of getting thrown into like the junk drawer kind of in the toolbox so it's just kind of a handy thing but pretty beat-up it's actually a high carbon steel so you can see how it cuts it's it's pretty rough cutting I haven't ever sharpened this I could never I can't you tell you how long ago it's been since this has been sharpened years I'd say so if we're just trying to get a sense of how it cuts see like a lemon let's try this right here just see trying to cut a lemon the dull knife is more dangerous than a sharp knife so you know steam is trying to cut that lemon right there it's kind of a chore so let's sharpen this up and then try that one more time so we're gonna go through and start with the X 65 right here this is going to be at 20 degrees we're gonna do it eight times [Music] [Applause] [Music] so as I was transitioning to the last belt I could just really see the shine of this right here so I can tell there's a nice sharp cutting edge so we're just gonna touch it up a little bit with my leather stropping tool just love the smell of cutting lemon some of you guys oh yeah that's like butter that is like a night and day difference it's like going right through it check that out definitely give it a thumbs up so I'm gonna say this is probably the trickiest knife right here to sharpen the bigger ones I think are gonna be easier let's see how it works on some paper there's that same piece of paper oh yeah all right try it again you can just see it's just shaving that paper I just have to get my technique proper look at that just amazing alright let's try to zoom in so you just get a close look at it so I'd like to see if I can polish this blade up a little bit it's definitely been in the tool box and just kind of beat around but it looks like a pretty nice paring knife okay so what do you guys think about the blade grinding attachment I'm really impressed with it I just like the way that you can mostly like freehand it having two hands on the knife itself and then bringing it across you don't have to start and stop the belt like on the other one so if you want to go back to the other one that's the nice thing you have the option of this or going back to the other one it might be easier with the smaller knives like this to go back to the smaller one but you know I found that my hand was pretty steady going all the way across if you want to see a lot of questions and answers in the reviews check on the two links I have below to this and you'll see that this it's definitely worth it so I think this one else things where it's gonna hurt once when you buy it but then once you do you're gonna be glad that you have it because it's going to be around 200 bucks I think it's 129 for this right here 67 for this currently so you're just under 200 bucks and it has everything that you need all the belts and everything so you can get started with it and I'm sure you get at least a few years out of it unless you're like really going through and sharpening tons of knives and if so and the belts wear out then you can also get some replacement ones but I think that right now this is gonna last me at least a couple years before I'm even looking at some other belts again I've gone through my house I sharpen all kinds of knives so one thing I'm going to try sharpening that I haven't yet I'm gonna try it my lawn mower blades with this right here and then I also have back here a blade balancer so you can see the Oregon blade balancer it's a really nice one so we're gonna see how this works as far as removing it and what kind of angle we get so if you want to see that please subscribe to my channel and hit that Bell icon to be notified of future videos so my goal this video is to help you guys out by putting this blade grinding attachment to the test sharpening a variety of knives so you can see if it's right for you in case you're considering the purchase of it so if you enjoy this video and you find it interesting

she kind of is community in England I've been asked to do a little review on these grinders from VMI grinders in China I've been using these this company for a few years now so I know that what's in here was gonna be colleague but they normally come in cellophane packaging both my plate an alternative so first painted the box completely quality box is noise solid so you grind is not gonna get damaged when it's transported as you can see in braved low dose they never been it come off say nice dog box I've been moving around having it damaged a fade room they're not a solid metal and they fit well it was nice and smooth nice easy movements on it it's a four part to knife inch grinder the teeth of very much like the Space Case so they want quality teeth you can overlook I've had one of these grinders for over two years now and I'm still using it the t-phone absolute perfect on it take it it's got a nice smash in it I know the meshes work they aren't graded them of a while ago and they do their weekly first thing you get a nice pine in the bottom and these are ceramics or nothing stakes get raised enough alright in the apartment box you get seven little accessories got a nice little silk bag keep going to it stop it getting scratched don't thank you card and then in this I've gotta play with it the way an 88 little brush wins it all back for tuning and a little scraper it's very pop we eat from the bottom sorry guys so I grind a looking nice feeling nice but how does it work only one way to find out like the arrow my face a little bit that is perfectly ground for that [Music] no smellivision but that sounds lovely I say yeah they work good well done VI grinders you should be getting more business for me you know you will Cheers check out handshake Anna

inches wide weighs about 2 pounds it's very compact and takes a part of any space the Express chop is designed to process small amounts of food the Express shop comes with the processing bowl for all 16 ounces there are measurements marked on the bowl the bowl is BPA free and it has a no slip bottom the unit comes with a blade splash guard but you can also use as a storage lid the power head which has an on-off pulse button Quick Start Guide and an instruction manual to use put the blade in the bowl make sure to hold the blade by the shaft it's very sharp just spin it a little to make sure that it's all the way on the bottom of the bowl put the lid on with the tab open and put the power head on it just sits on the bowl will test the ninja by mincing some garlic chopping onions tomatoes herbs and some nuts I'm going to put in about 10 cloves of peeled garlic put the guard on make sure the flap is open put the head on plug in the unit to use press and let go off the pulse button make sure to hold the bowl when you press down on the pulse button remove the blade by holding under the shaft then in to did a really good job on the garlic I'm very surprised because usually mini choppers um don't handle garlic that well and it's all pretty even that's impressive and that was super fast I'm going to try shopping onions I've cut one large onion into about an inch pieces don't cut them too big this is a small chopper it's not designed to handle big pieces and don't overload the processor either don't put more than two cups dry or one cup of liquid ingredients in the bowl because the bowl could overflow I also find that the ninja works best if you don't overload the processor I wouldn't recommend filling it more than halfway put the lid on make sure that plop is open the head does move around a little so hold it and pulse with one hand see how that is take the blade out not bad most of the pieces are chopped pretty evenly I can keep going if I want a finer chop this is pretty good and it was done in just a couple of pulses next I'm going to pulse some hot serrano peppers about three ups cut them into 1-inch pieces again pretty evenly chopped again the peppers are spicy this would work well with bell peppers too next I'll process some flat-leaf parsley I've washed and dried these this is about a cup don't remove the head until the blade has come to a full stop the Parsley's chop nicely there are a couple of big pieces that probably got stuck to the side and moved to the top the rest of them are all chopped pretty nicely and pretty evenly next I'll try some Tomatoes these are two medium tomatoes that have cut up into about one inch pieces it's best to cut your ingredients into about one inch pieces don't throw a whole tomato in the processor it's small and it's not designed to handle large pieces of food there's still a couple of big pieces so I'm going to do one or two more pulses the tomatoes aren't bad either they're not perfectly even there are one or two big pieces but the rests are chopped okay you could have towards puree this further to make into a sauce for a fresh salsa I would stop at three or four pulses I've washed and dried my container because I want to try chopping some nuts these are walnut halves it's about a cup it did a decent job on the nuts the nuts on the bottom or processed finer than the ones on top there are no big halves of walnuts most of them are processed pretty evenly over all the ninja did a pretty good job on most of the things that I put in here I would say the garlic was the most impressive the onion was not bad at all there was just one or two big pieces but the rest were process evenly did a really good job on the parsley and also the serrano pepper with the tomatoes there were a few big pieces I think it might be best to do a smaller quantity of tomatoes at a time maybe one at a time to get a more even result and the ninja did a decent job on the nuts there were no big pieces there was some powdery stuff on the bottom but most of the nuts were processed evenly all the parts are dishwasher safe on the top rock of course the power head is not just wipe it with a damp cloth and dry and $20 or lower the ninja Express shop is a good value if you want to try out this ninja I've put a link to it in the description below I hope you found this review useful if there are any other

back to another weekly wolf vlog my name is Joshua and today we're gonna be taking a look at troubleshooting whilst on the bar some one of the things I might mention in this vlog today might seem really simple and easy to remember but definitely on those early mornings while you're dialing in you might not have even had your espresso I for one am guilty of it and I might have missed something as easy as making sure that my espresso grinder was turned on and it sent me into a panic wondering why my grinder wasn't working so let's take a look now and troubleshoot the things that can go wrong when you least expect it first up is your espresso grinder we here at wolf on the bar use the mazza Tonys and essentially though all espresso grinders are built in a similar fashion when you have a issue with your grinder I definitely go back to the source and make sure a that my grinder is first plugged in and B then it is turned on however espresso grinders do have a safety function that's built into the hopper so when you remove the hopper from the grinder a lot of espresso machines have a safety function which will turn off your grinder now occasionally those hopper systems don't properly impress the button or the button has popped out and you'll find that your grinder isn't turning on at all and it might just be the fact that your safety button is pressed out or is out of function so it's really important to head straight upstairs and check to make sure that that safety function is working what I do here is just quickly remove the hopper pop it up place it back down gently onto the grinder and hopefully that fixes the issue of turning the grinder on one of the other big issues we have with grinders is that it's turning on it seems to be working when you push the button however there's no beans grinding out of the grinder it can be as simple as just checking to see if your hapa gate is open so most grinders have a gate that closes off your front of the beans from your hopper to the actual blades themselves then that allows you to remove two hopper without any beans spilling out and all over the place now we close that off the way out the night to remove the beans and occasionally you might place the beans back in and forget to open that over morning so you turn on your grinder you go to grind and the beans haven't even passed through the grinder so really important again if your grinder is working and it seems to heal like it's grinding come upstairs and just open that gate by doing that that allows the beans to drop down onto the blades and you can start grinding away so following through from making sure that your grinder is turned on the hopper gate is open now if you are grinding through and it is still not coming out what you certainly would want to check is to see if the fineness and coarseness of the grind is allowing the beans to pass through now sometimes that could have been fiddled with on a clothes you might have knocked it and turned it all the way to fine and if it's too fine then the beans will not be able to pass through the blades you might even hear metal on metal which is not great and you want to avoid that at all costs but definitely want to check that the dial hasn't been changed all the way to fine if that is the case and the dial is set to very very fine and it doesn't allow the beans to pass through turn that dial back to coarse slowly until you find the coffee is pouring out at a reasonable speed again one of the things that happens occasionally on the bar at Wolff is we'll get a blockage after grinding the beans and within the chute so the grinder is working however the blockage at the fine end of the chute is allowing dosas to build up in the chute and you're not seeing any grinds falling into the portafilter at that point you're questioning why the grinder is not grinding and just a simple look into the chute will let you know whether there is any blockage of grinds and any build-up at that point just either grabbing a brush or the back of a spoon now I'm not recommending shoving anything up towards the blades themselves but just getting rid of that blockage should get the grind working and back again now some grinders don't look quite like this and they don't have a chute quite similar however there might be a blockage further up in the line perhaps even between the hopper gate and the blades themselves or post blades and between where that and the coffee will fall out so if you have to take your grinder apart and look beyond the blades themselves I'd certainly recommend getting one of your service team or the cafe manager to help you out with that beyond that definitely make sure that you have beans in your hopper and you're good to go now any electrical issues again if you follow the electrical from the source to the grinder and you can't see any issues there then I would certainly get one of your maintenance repair men or a cafe manager to help you out it could be something further down the line now let's take a look at the espresso machine and see what the [Music] [Music] you [Music]", "o-AMaFcMkDA": "so I got a few questions on all the different grinders I use and each one has a purpose so I've got four grinders and I'll just go through them one by one so I'll start off with this Itachi this is actually a five inch grinder so I can put five inch metal discs or sandpaper on this but for the most part it's designated for a wire brush and basically if you're going to weld rusty metal if you're going to paint rusty metal this is a great tool to sort of hit the the rust or the paint chips off first and it's just convenient to always have it set up with a wire brush the next grinder I've got is actually I've got two of the same grinders these a two small Makita 4 inch grinder and this one I always keep a grinding wheel on it and for this I could use it for sharpening lawnmower blades like I did in the last video you can use it for cutting a bolt if you want to you can use it for grinding welds a lot of different uses you can also replace the grinding wheel with a cutting wheel I don't know if you ever watched any of the old Orange County chopper show they would always cut everything with a grinding wheel on a cutting wheel on a grinder and so that works great this is probably the grinder or the set up on a grower that I use the most in the woodshop here I've got 36 inch paper on this grinder and this is great for shaping power shaping it just takes off a lot of material I'll start with 36 then maybe go to 50 then 80 and then maybe switch over to a palm sander but you can really remove a lot of material with this the thing I like about these small forage makitas and at the Walt's are probably the same actually happen to have nikita's is they're light so it's really easy to handle with one hand so you can hold your material with your left hand and work with your right hand now this grinder is a variable speed to be honest we I'm not sure if this is designated as a buffer that's what I bought it for I don't know why you couldn't use it as a grinder I I think this might be a just for buffing I'm not a hundred percent sure but anyway I always use this for buffing and so I make a series of paintings that are painted on plexiglass and then I X the Plexiglas lacquer the Plexiglas and then I buff the Plexiglas with like a turtle wax with a little bit of pumice in it and so I always have this grinder set up the exact same way I don't use this for or at least I haven't yet used this for polishing furniture or tops or anything like that this is solely designated for the certain type of artwork that I make I guess that's it and thanks for tuning in I'll see you on Friday you",

welcome to another episode of the fabricator with yours truly so a few terms here notching fish mouthing coping saddling these are all industry terms used to describe this series of cuts to make one tube made up to another tube without the gap that's essentially all it is and there's a couple of different ways to do that one is with the use of a tube not sure which is an actual tool you set up in the shop now in 15 years of doing this I've never even owned one so that leads us to the other method which is without the use of a tube not do anything entirely by hand which will allow you to achieve great fitment very close tight tolerances and it often times greater fitment and in less time than it takes to use the tube not sure so first we have our main tube which has no notching in it we have our lower tube that will mate up to it with our standard 90-degree notch the easy one and then we have our kicker tube which has a 10 degree bend in the middle of it and we have no particular order of the angle that we're going to cut out here we're just gonna kind of wing it to make a little bit more realistic so let's get downstairs and start building on the real model so to make this a little bit more realistic and not so typical here I've already fabricated this little stand here it's just a little plug it slides into the tube helps establish I'm gonna try and make it realistically almost kind of like building a roll cage yourself but on the small model here so we have our main tube we have our lower tube we're gonna take that tube made it up to this one very simple this is the easiest one that we're gonna do but first we need to establish our baseline now the baseline is going to be the point at which the bottom of the tube or even the top of the tube is going to be made it this is our visual reference in which to measure so on this we'll just do four inches now if you were doing like a harness bar the door bar or whatever the case is you're gonna need to know where the measurement of that baseline is hopefully you do because they're all very very specific to the certain class of racing that we're going to do so with our baseline in place stick our tube up here all right now taking a really careful look at this we can see that there's a big gap there and that's obviously what the whole purpose of this video is how to eliminate that gap but first we need to establish our face line the face line is going to be the point at which you always come back to for reference or the centerline of this tube at the face of what you're looking at it so at the point of view that you have you need to mark out the center of it now if you'd like you can extend this line to know that you're always going to made it up the exact same place I usually visually reference the base line but sometimes you need to put the extra center line in there but always on the tube that you're notching make sure you have your center line very very important so if we were to cut this out perfectly with a notch or with anything else you'll end up realizing that it's almost never going to happen that the tube will cover exactly half the diameter of the tube it just doesn't happen that way due to wall thicknesses and you know everything else that goes with it plus you have to put a little bevel on there for a good solid weld so if you look carefully it's actually about 1/3 the diameter of the tube is the gap that we need to eliminate 1/3 the diameter tube is a general rule of thumb of which you always want to create your notches for and that's going to create our throat depth now the throat depth is the depth at which the notch will be cut out to how deep the notch will go which in this case 1/3 the diameter of an inch and a half is half an inch so you can do this on the car you can do this off the car whatever the case is just make sure you give yourself enough measurement in there this is our throat depth so from the top of the tube here to our face line and from the bottom of the tube to our face line this is our notch these are the two lines that we just marked out that we need to cut those are when we stick them in the saw we'll put them in there we'll slice them out we're gonna undercut them just to you know because we're gonna have to go through with the grinder and you know do some contouring and you know cut this out and make it fit you know beautifully perfect so let's get over to the saw and get cut you got it in the saw here you're going to want your face line up so that you get your same cuts on both sides so that's what the whole purpose in the face line is to make sure that you always have it held up almost perfect so one of the reasons why I don't actually lock it in it's because when I flip it over I can use the fence here as a guide to make sure that I made it up at the same 45 degrees so they've always said 9 I'll bring this other tube over here so you can see that's almost perfect in all actuality I mean we could just clean it up and go with it right now as it is the fitments pretty good I mean there's there's a lot of roughness in here but we're gonna clean that out with the grinder real quick I just flat disc I usually like to use and reuse my older ones because they have this nice little contour so when you dig into here it cleans it out quite nicely so we're going to round over this huh this edge is just a little bit and then slice all this out of here clean it up nicely you can use a file you can use the flat disc and use whatever but to make sure that I made it up there almost exactly in one I'm going to contour this edge to try and mate with the other tube so let's get this sliced out well that's a much better fit nice and clean so what I'm gonna do is take a few minutes here and I'm gonna clean all this up and get it ready to weld put a couple tacks in check it out see where it ends up but make sure that when we get rid of all these lines and clean these tubes up we've got to make sure that we put our baseline back on here so we know where the tube is gonna sit all right so now it's time for the kicker here and why I say the kicker is because one we have a 10 degree bend in here and two I am NOT going to place this in any particular style form whatever the case is to finish all this off here so what we're gonna do is I'm gonna start at the the lower portion of the tube and we're not going to have a baseline in this one instead we're going to skip ahead to a certain part which is going to be our throat line so you set this up just kind of visually look at it take your marker you draw a line straight across that line is now your throat line so I'm going to unclamp this here now I'm just using these little Pony clamps on here it doesn't ways to clamp a tube down but if you hold this parallel to the lower tube at the position that's going to be sitting at you look from the end of this line to roughly the end of that line and you go right down the center of it which is roughly here so we'll make our mark that is your face line so as we're running around here and we look at this we say how do we know where the angles gonna be in which one that we need to cut and where and all the rest that good stuff well one-third tube diameter which is half of an inch from the throat line to the top of the face line half inch one-third diameter so at this intersection here take one line from the end of one tube to the center of the face line one line from the end of the other tube to the center of the face line and yes we're going to undercut this that's the first one cut then we're gonna do make so let's go stick that and a saw and see where we're moving on to the top portion okay now since this is going to have to be still notched out or whatever the case is to actually place this where it needs to be notice that we're actually got a pretty big gap going on right here and that's kind of a quality assurance there or reassurance that it's correct because once we notch this back of this throat out here and contoured around the tube there this is going to drop straight down anyway so another really interesting lesson you got to learn is if your marks are all on this side of the tube remember where the saw has to cut so if your marks are on this side of the tube that means the tube is going to be sticking out this way and if the base of the saw is on the left side then you're not gonna be able to hold this in there and you know hold it steady with your face line correct and all the rest of that stuff as the as the saw cuts down so we're gonna mark the other side this rule applies to pretty much everything so I'm gonna set it up opposite and we can kind of visually look at this here notice we have the gap down here which is good and we're gonna kind of hold this in place here and make our throat line hey you gotta kind of straighten this out here cuz I'm working a little backwards now now we'll hold this up parallel notice how it all kind of seems to straighten out a little bit and this line gets just a little bit crooked that's good that's another one of those reassurances so just the same as before halfway down the throat line give out right here is our face line and again same rule of thumb one third diameter of the tubing which in this case is half of an inch now we go from throat line to the intersection of the face line and throw line face line to the throat line same as before [Applause] so we'll put this up here in the first glance you're gonna look at it and say oh no I screwed up well actually you didn't because this extreme angle right here needs to be cut out with the grinder still now this is a little bit crazy but notice how I've got the base of it mounted flat out here correctly and this hasn't been notched out either so when we actually stick this on here let me say about where it's gonna land we're we're actually looking really close to where we need to be so what we're gonna do is take the grinder cut out those throats contour this around make sure these edges and these throats actually line up where they need to be and hopefully we'll get it right pretty quickly right Mossad I just kind of snapped right in that's a clear indication that we pretty much nailed it gaps aren't too insane like they used to be I might have a little bit of trimming still yet to do in that throat but we'll worry about that when we get to the top about the correct fit and down below but up top here the idea is to take this tube slide it that way to make it actually fit because this gap up here if we were to actually you know throw it this out and then bring it back up or whatever the case is that would change the angle down below so the idea is to just slide the tube forward so in order to do that we're gonna actually have to over cut from our throat line and bring that inner throat down just a little bit more and we're talking only fractions here so once you get the experience in the time doing this you'll you'll finally get it you know you'll you'll know how much to cut and where so we're just gonna put in a little reference line there we'll start cutting that one out I remember before when I mentioned that snap fit notice I don't have anything actually holding this on there it's only held in by itself which is nice clean perfect fit so get this set up correctly laid out attack there it is so what do we actually take away from this video well there's a couple of things here one it's entirely possible we got by hand without the use of toon underachieve these same angles who would with a tube hunter now the second part this is entirely overview this practice makes perfect okay so the more you practice this the better you get at it the quicker you will be and when I say quicker you can actually achieve these same angles just as we did in this video without the use of the tube doctor and be quicker than using a tube doctor that's the most beautiful part now it's even better than that one if you don't have a to doctor then we'll go on multiple planes as well as multiple angles you're gonna have to do it by hand anyway so here's the thing the better you can get out the quicker you get out of it the more angles you can achieve without the tube doctor keep practicing most importantly keep practicing then you can eventually even find out that you will get your perfect fit every single time now one thing I suggest is make this model over and over again make a dozen models like this make one similar to this make ones with different beds different angles and keep practicing and keep trying at it the more you practice the better you're gonna become at it that's all I have for this episode of the fabricator thanks for checking it out we'll see you on the next project", "WnEnvLaAHIM": "it's rare to find a top-of-the-line commercial espresso grinder that retains the ease-of-use and styling of a consumer model without sacrificing the performance consistency and durability required by the demanding cafe office or home barista hi I'm Ben with Clive coffee today we'll be giving you a brief overview of the eureka olympus 75 e high speed espresso grinder while Eureka's name may not be as familiar as some manufacturers they have been making grinders in Florence Italy since the 1940s Eureka has also become the largest grinder manufacturer in Italy although they're better known for the models they rebrand for companies like ciminelli this storied heritage is evident across their innovative product line and especially in the Olympus but we'll talk more about innovation in a minute this grinder provides an advantage in cup quality cleanliness and consistency over the typical 64 millimetre commercial flat burr butwhy massive 75 millimeter flat burrs available in both steel and titanium create a more uniform particle size distribution for more even extractions and an 800 watt motor can move 20 grams of fluffy ground coffee in just three seconds which reduces flavor loss from friction and motor heat the standard steel burrs are rated for 1,100 pounds of grinding were 21 years at a rate of one pound per week the optional mythos titanium coated burs offer even greater longevity as they're rated to last three times as long that's 1.6 tons of coffee in either metal these large birds have produced some of the cleanest and smoothest espresso we've never had we also use this grinder to pull back-to-back shots in our latte art classes for 40 straight minutes and the shots are consistent from start to finish but the Olympus doesn't just offer brute strength it offers simplicity and refinement in equal measure the dough service chute can be adjusted up and down to direct the coffee exactly where you want to minimize spillage and the barista light lets you see when the basket is full Eureka's exclusive micro metric grind adjustment dial is ergonomically placed right at the front and has a satisfying premium feel it's also sensitive enough but even a tense adjustment in shot time is never more than a half number away but precise enough to make a one-second change with ease add in its electronic timed dosing system which can be adjusted with one button to minimize mess or bypassed in manual mode and you've got one of the easiest grinders out there as if that weren't enough we also love how cleaning the burr chamber is a breeze on the Olympus in exclusive Eureka fashion you can access the burrs by removing three bolts from there you can take out the upper berth sweep or vacuum the chamber and ensure that next week shots are just as good as the last the biggest bonus removing the burrs doesn't affect your grind setting there's no model we more confidently recommend to those seeking the perfect flat burr grinder for their high-volume business or home espresso lab with its performance design and ease of use the Eureka Olympus is a grinder worthy of the praise it receives and may well be the final upgrade you've been looking for", "gsJCx19tnBc": "hi everybody I believe CJ drill and today we'll show you how to use one of these what is it it's a manual tile cutter now the great thing about a manual tile cutter is it's very convenient for cutting straight lines it's also inexpensive when you compare it to well the cost of a wet saw I want to show you the different components on a tile cutter it's very simplistic basically you have a handle and this handle allows you to apply pressure to the tile and it also allows you to guide the cutter along these two rails okay come on in close because I want to show you the tungsten there's a tungsten carbide will here and if I move it maybe you can see it and that will this will is what actually scores the surface of the tile and helps you or allows you to make the cut okay so what I have here is I have a tile that's approximately five inches by five inches and it's a quarter of it inch in thickness now I've already marked where I want to cut my tile so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna place it in the tile cutter I'm gonna rest the tile up against this fence here that's what it's gonna hold it in place and then what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna line up this mark cuz that's where I want to cut the tile with the wheel to put the wheel in place okay so I've got my wheel in place I want to rest it right on the the edge there okay so now what you want to do is you want to slowly slide the manual tile cutter forward and want to apply slight pressure on the handle as you slide forward you just want to score it is what you want to do so you rest that will on the edge and then push forward and it's scored now what I want to do is you don't want to go back over it you just have to do it once that's all it takes and now comes time to snap it this little toggle here is going to apply equal pressure to the surface of the tile and it's going to allow you to snap it so I'm going to pull it back to slightly and this toggle is going to rest on the surface of the tile now I'm going to take this handle here this handle here and I'm just gonna push down firmly what we have is a nice clean cut now I will say this in the instance that you don't get a nice clean cut like I have here you're gonna want to take a tile stone and and smooth it out now I gotta tell you there's some drawbacks to using them in manual tile cutter and that is you can't cut stone you can't do combination cuts and you can't do tiny cuts you're going to need a wet saw for that but if all you need to make are a series of straight cuts on a ceramic tile or you can't be a manual tile cutter for it this is Leah saying you can do this see you next time you", "0wG4uQK5xKQ": "and let's brew some French press coffee alright so first of all we're gonna grind coffee we're gonna grind it to the French press setting once we've got our coffee and you want to make sure your coffee is properly ground which ours is we're gonna add in this case three tablespoons of coffee and if you're wondering you're looking at seven grams of coffee for every four ounces of water that you're gonna be putting in your French press so that makes it pretty easy to calculate again how much coffee you're gonna need in order to get the proper cup of coffee so a little bit of coffee math for you there after you've done your coffee math or at least just measured properly you're going to go ahead and take your I'm using a goose neck kettle right now and we talked about this one before here on French press coffee calm either way you want to get your water to the proper temperature I've got mine at 200 degrees Fahrenheit and we'll go ahead and pour we're gonna bloom first I'm not gonna fill this up all the way we're just gonna let our grounds bloom a little bit and of course we've got the exclusive French press coffee calm stirring paddle that you can make use of and this comes with every single order at French press coffee calm again we're blooming our grounds so I'm just going to give them a little bit of a stir and again that bloom just lets us get a nice initial kind of beginning to our coffee first so after 30 seconds we're gonna go ahead and just finish pouring our water you don't need to go too slow but you can take your time here to get this right I remember you got to give yourself a little bit of room because you're gonna be pushing your plunger down so make sure to give yourself a little bit of room we'll give this a little stir and then don't forget the magic number you want four minutes total brew time so we had 30 seconds of blooms so we're looking at about three and a half minutes maybe a little less because I was pouring there it doesn't have to be you know super accurate but make sure that you get that time in there so you can get the right cup of coffee and as you're brewing after you've given that kind of final initial stir I like to take my lid and my plunger and just kind of set it resting right ever-so-slightly on top of the grounds that I'm not going to press it down yet I'm going to let it sit there and I'm going to brew for a total time of about four minutes and after we've allowed our brew to happen we're just going to go ahead and press our plunger down so this will finish the brew process and now I would have my hopefully perfect cup of coffee now it sometimes takes a little bit of practice to perfect this even if you're using all the math that I talked about here you've still got different factors that come into play the type of coffee grounds and the type of coffee that you're using and again the temperature of your water etc but spend a little time playing with it because that's how you're gonna get your perfect cup of coffee but once you're done that's your cup of French press coffee this is the classic French press again if you say the words French press someone's gonna see this in their heads probably nine times out of ten so did you like that video so go ahead and give us a like and for more caffeinated videos once you go ahead and subscribe to our channel as well and if you do I'll go ahead and give you a nice little coffee quote it's gonna wait did it yet ah there you go and now for our quote remember that if it isn't caffeinated it ain't coffee", "pckuS--UlV4": "An old lady and an old man lived in a little house by themselves they had no children and they felt very lonely and sad at times. It gets so boring with just the two of us you are always out in the garden and I have nothing to do after i finish my cooking and cleaning. Well I'm sure you can find some other ways to keep yourself occupied. Hmm i think i will bake something today, I haven't done that in a long time. That's a good idea go ahead and do that. Make something interesting for dinner tonight, now i have to head out to the garden again is there are still some more weeds to be pulled out. The old lady decided she would make some gingerbread, she got out all of the ingredients she needed and kneaded the dough for the gingerbread softly humming to herself. Suddenly she had an idea, let me do something fun i will make the gingerbread in the shape of a man a gingerbread man, my husband will be very amused I'm sure. So the old lady rolled out the dough and cut it out in the shape of a man let me see now, one little ball to be shaped into a mouth, two little chocolate chips for eyes and these pretty red cherries for buttons. Oh that's one handsome gingerbread man. I'm sure he'll taste as good as he looks, now into the oven. The old lady went sat on her rocking-chair knitting away while waiting for the gingerbread man to bake. Hmm I'm starting to get the lovely smell of gingerbread, must be done by now, let me go and check. The old lady put on your oven gloves and went to open the oven door. But as she did the gingerbread man got up from the baking tray and jumped out of the oven. Good heavens what was that? Before she realized what was happening the gingerbread man ran to the open window jumped out and in a second was running down the garden and out into the stream. Hey where do you think you're going, come right back here, we are supposed to be having you for dinner. Oh no no I am not your dinner, for you can't let your hands on me run ran as fast as you can can't catch me, am a  gingerbread man The old lady's husband looked in surprise and his wife running after a gingerbread man, what's happening? Stop staring and run and catch that rogue, i had baked him for our dinner, but how did he run out?  I will tell you all that later. Quick catch him before he vanishes. The old man starts running after the gingerbread man shouting at him to stop. Your lady cannot catch me, nor can you. Run run as fast as you can, you can't catch me, I'm a gingerbread man. Down the road ran the gingerbread man with the old man and the lady running behind him, a cow sitting beside the road saw the gingerbread man and said, you look so tasty I want to eat you. The old lady and old man cannot catch me see if you can catch me, you fat thing. Fat thing, you cheeky fellow, just you wait till I catch you. The cow started running after the gingerbread man along with the old man and the old lady. Run,run  as fast as you can you can't catch me I'm the gingerbread man Along the road they ran, with all the passer byes looking at them in surprise. A little way ahead a horse that was trotting along the road stopped to see what was happening. That looks like a a tasty meal everyone out of my way I'm going to catch that fellow and have him for dinner instead of hay. Ho Ho so you also want to eat me come on you can also try but you'll have to start galloping instead of trying he leave me you will be having your hey only for dinner after all so the horse also join the old lady old band and the cow to try and catch the gingerbread man the gingerbread man was having a lot of fun seeing all of them trying to catch him a little way ahead he stood by the roadside don't you think you should give up let me tell you again run run as fast as you can you can't catch me I'm the gingerbread man once again the gingerbread man started running looking back at all those chasing him with a big grin on his face a little way ahead was a big fat pig walking along with its piglets when it saw the gingerbread man it said nice or smells good should be a good treat for my little piggies wait wait I want to have a word with you no you don't you want to make a meal of me that is not going to happen you stinking thing what how dare you rude fellow i will show you come on piggies let's catch him and eat him and so the pig and piglets also joined the rest to try and catch the gingerbread man up ahead there was a farm and near the fence was a big clown hen when she saw the gingerbread man she said you look so yummy  May I have a nibble? May I have a nibble?  no you may not but you can always try Come, join the merry procession. Run, run, as fast as you can.  You can\u2019t catch me, I\u2019m the gingerbread man oh what a sight it was there was the old man and the old lady trundling along the cow and the pig waddling along the horse galloping along and the hen running and flapping her wings with a loud sound I think I\u2019ve had enough fun. No way are those slow coaches going to catch up with me just look around for some place to rest running has really tired me out a little farther away there was a river flowing gently the gingerbread man wanted to go across to the other side but if you fell in the water he would become all soggy as he was thinking of what to do he heard a voice want me to take you across the gingerbread man looked around and saw a fox sitting against a rock you think I'm a fool you also want to eat me like the rest of them Eat you?  A measly looking fellow like you? you are not even enough as a starter forget a whole meal the Fox was a very very wily fellow he knew the gingerbread man could run very fast and he was too lazy to run after him and why would you want to be so good to me i am not being good to you I was going across the river anyway so I thought you could hop on my back and I would take you across decide fast i don't have the whole day okay what would you want in exchange I'll tell you that when we cross over come on on my back when they were half way across the fox told the gingerbread man I'm feeling a bit uncomfortable i think it would be better if you put yourself on my neck the gingerbread man crawled onto the Fox's neck ah that's better after a while the Fox started moving its neck and told him oh my neck has started painting and I think it would be better if you sit on my snout the gingerbread man thought he was very smart but he couldn't guess what was going on in the cunning Fox's mind as before it did what the Fox told him There!  Are you okay now? this was the chance the Fox had been waiting for as soon as the gingerbread man sat on its snout the Fox quickly tossed him up and caught him in his mouth as he fell and their ended the tale of the gingerbread man no body was smarter than me", "IAlG3ByKN5c": "I'm a self-confessed caffeine nut and there's nothing I enjoy more than a smooth perfectly balanced latte or cappuccino but great coffee doesn't always come easily this is because the smoothest richest and most flavor some compounds the oils in case within this complex little bean some of the hardest to remove soon after green beans are roasted they're ready to be used to make coffee but within a few days the natural oils that give espresso based drinks their smooth creamy taste start to evaporate from the bean over a period of weeks the beans lose a lot of their oil content but once the coffee beans are ground the evaporation happens much much faster with the bean is losing their oil content by the second to show the difference freshness makes to the quality of the coffee flavor just have a look at these two espresso shots now they're both from the same batch of coffee beans roasted on the same date but the beans used to make this espresso will ground a few days ago while these were ground less than a minute before extracting have a look at the difference in the two shots the layer on top of the coffees extracted oils or crema just look at how much thicker and darker colored iskremas in comparison to this one a thick caramel colored crema is the sign of a well-balanced espresso our one good test of the crema qualities whether or not it can hold the weight of a sugar survey on top of it for a small period of time so let's try it on these two espressos as you can see the espresso from freshly ground beans has a much stronger better quality crema amazingly the same coffee beans roasted on the same day just ground at different times how great coffee starts with a great espresso pour and to do that you need the right amount of coffee ground to precisely the right consistency and converted from whole beans to espresso as quickly as possible and that is not easy it's delicious problems such as this that the sage designers and me for that matter love to try and solve so sage developed a way to dose the right amount and consistency of freshly ground beans precisely when you need it the barista Express has a built-in dosing grinder designed to work especially for this machine now it's activated with a push of a button once the right amount of coffee is delivered it automatically stops and the onboard tamper tell them placed by a magnet so you need to do is just temp the coffee then it's just a matter of inserting the handle in place papi the cup underneath and pushing a button you now that is exactly what an espresso should look like a thick caramel colored crema free from white swirls and air bubbles oh and that's just how it should taste rich sweet creamy and perfectly balanced this machine also comes with a milk frother and jug for turning espressos into lattes and cappuccinos simply hold the nozzle right below the surface to begin with to introduce air bubbles and as the jug starts to warm lower the nozzle down to circulate the milk the sage barista Express cappuccinos lattes and whole beans to espresso in under a minute", "h3t7jULUCpc": "welcome back to stop for garage guys in today's video I'm going to be showing you how to remove any swirl marks or light scratching on your car's paint so the first step is make sure you have your car washed your car is clean of any contaminants or dirt and then what we're going to do is we are going to clay the surface here I'm spraying a soapy water which is just actually Dawn dish detergent probably three or four drops and a full bottle of water and we're using that more as a lubricant to slide the clay back and forth across now if you've never heard of clay barring clay bar is not actual real clay like you would think it is it is a specific type of material but what it essentially does is is a moldable piece of putty that you slide across the surface of your paint to remove any contaminants or dirt that is clinging to the surface I'm going to be showing you here in a second how dirty this clay bar is but you're using essentially light pressure to let the car slide across the surface and when you hit a contaminant or any sort of particle on the paint surface you'll feel the bar drag a little bit and you'll kind of slide it back and forth across that area until it goes away that is a really crude way of explaining it but it's essentially just trying to remove anything on the surface before you polish so you're not scratching the paint more [Music] here is the bar after just doing half the hood you can see how dark it is what you'll want to do is then just fold and knead the bar over and essentially you're locking and all that contaminant in dirt inside the bar revealing a fresh clean surface to continue doing the rest of your hood now the whole hood is done being played usually you'll want to go across the whole car for this video I'm just kind of doing a demo of the hood itself but once you're done clean I'm just using a quick detail spray to spray the surface before I dry it off to kind of clean any of that soapy water and any dirt that might have been left on the surface off before we polish now with the surface completely dried off and ready to go we are going to begin machine polishing today I'm going to be using a DA polisher it's so a dual action orbital polisher Paul show that I have is from Harbor Freight so it is a budget-friendly economical option for people I will say though that I'm going to be doing a video soon where I'm going to be comparing it to a roofs 15 millimeter throw polisher which I am super super excited about because that is supposed to be the king of polishers from a dual action standpoint I'm really excited to use it but today I'm using a great polishing pad with a one-step type polished product there are tons of different polish types out there I'll leave all the products that I use in the description box below if you're interested but you know kind of do your research figure out what polish works best for you this is a Polish that I've been using for a little while now I've been trying out several different types but this is a good one step type polish if you will that allows you to clean the surface remove a lot of the swirl marks but it's not super super aggressive now when you begin polishing usually put about dime sized circles of polish onto your pad I usually put about seven or eight and usually spray the surface of the pad one time with a quick detail spray because the pad is new the pad is fresh I haven't used it yet and it hasn't soaked up any of that polish after doing a large part of the car that way I just feel that there's a little bit extra lubricity on the surface before I throw it on the paint now for a dual action polisher I usually kind of dab the pad around on the paint to kind of spread that polish onto the surface because if you turn it on full blast right away what will happen is you'll fling it everywhere and we don't want that that just gives you extra work so usually start off at a speed one or two and then for this type polisher I'm cranking it up to about a five or six speed which is about relevant relatively comparable to any other orbital polisher in terms of speed now one thing to remember with a da polisher orbital polisher you can't really burn your paint I'm sure there is types and examples where you can but for the most part moving it slowly back and forth in a uniform pattern overlapping with your previous pass you'll be able to remove most swirl marks pretty easily but just not as quickly as if you had a circular polisher for the most part the orbital polisher for anybody that's doing this is a weekend hobby it's a great option including this Harbor Freight example which you can pick up for fairly cheap when you're doing your polishing make sure you're doing enough of the pass and you're going slow enough to break down the polish itself the polish itself is supposed to dry up it's supposed to become chalky it's supposed to do the work for you [Music] [Music] in this example here I'm actually figuring out that the amount of polish I used was just a little too much based on when I was drying it you could see some of the streaking of the Polish it wasn't coming off super super easily now with any flashlights you can typically see there are certain detailing flashlights that are pull and show better the different scratches and swirl marks here you can see just after one pass how big of a change I was able to accomplish with this polish in this orbital polisher now I'm going to be forming a second pass on the same surface area and once again cranking up the speed to six or seven and slowly moving the polisher back and forth doing horizontal and vertical passes to break down the Polish [Music] so this is a one-step polish which I've enjoyed using so far but I have used different polishes in the past especially poor boys SS r12 and 2.5 that I've enjoyed a lot more so I'm not completely sold on the polish and I'm using this video so if you do have recommendations about one-step polish kind of like the snow nax perfect finish that is kind of one that I'm looking forward to trying here soon so if you have any product recommendations please let me know in the comments below the good thing about orbital polisher is especially on cars with a lot of you know curves or edges on it like my hood here you can see the different raised surfaces an orbital polisher really can't burn through the paint in those different high spots whereas a circular polisher you have to be really really careful with that and you have to be you know a really good detailer and know what you're doing but with an orbital polisher kind of coming up on those edges kind of eliminate some of the risk and concern of damaging the paint excessively [Music] always be careful and always keep the polisher moving but with an orbital you do minimize the amount of heat buildup compared to a circular polisher I highly recommend gloves and I highly recommend that if you are working in enclosed space you know maybe wear a respirator as well just for the long-term health benefits now the amount of pressure that you typically want to apply with a polisher is very minimal so in the orbital here this polisher itself I'm not super super happy with it does have some imbalances it does need a little bit more extra control and firmness when holding it compared to some other nicer polishers out there but this one in particular does a pretty good job it just requires some extra hand control and firmness going over some curved areas to make sure it doesn't jump around I think one of my favorite things about polishing a car is actually putting that tape line down the center of a panel and polishing one side and then removing the tape to reveal the difference between what you've polished and what you haven't I think that's one of the most rewarding parts of the whole experience because then you can truly see how much work you've done and how well it's turned out I do recommend that after you're done polishing just kind of top it off with a quick detail spray what it kind of does is lifts any of the oily residue from polishing off of the paint before you do any last step products [Music] [Music] now for the reveal so once I remove my tape I do need to use a quick detail spray again just from the residue that was left over underneath the tape edges the transformation just with doing one light pass and I will say that this is not a perfect polish deep job but you can quickly see with about 30 minutes of polishing how much swirl marking and damage I removed from the paint and leveled out so here's the line here's the right side being the polished side and the left side being the unpolished side it is a drastic difference in just doing one pass of the orbital polisher and here is the after I am bisque following up with a quick detail spray of what the paint job looks like just with a polish on the hood this is no product put on top and no wax no sealant no nothing but you can see the mirror like finish that was obtained just by doing one pass with an orbital polisher and one step final polish so if you guys liked today's video make sure you give it a thumbs up I am going to be doing a full exterior detail of this car and I'm also going to be trying out the new McGuire's hybrid ceramic sealant I've actually tried it on a different car that I haven't videoed yet

workshop needs a pair of good scissors or shears and today I want to look at how do you maintenance them and how do you sharpen them up let's dive in this is actually a topic that I have been wanting to make for years and every time I get down to the point where I want to actually go and make how do I sharpen scissors I do something else but this is something that is very important to most workshops not only do you use scissors for cutting fabric and other things around the house in the shop I often do a lot of things of working with thin veneers or even for cutting paper out where I may be making a design or a pattern that I want to do some carving on I'm usually grabbing my scissors two to three times a week and using them for some pretty odd things but that being said they're a tool that most people don't think too much of because everyone has a pair of scissors and they're disposable right you buy pair scissors and they stop working is there money to get new ones well no a good pair of scissors can be an amazing thing and I want to take a look at that so these are the two pair of scissors that I have in my shop these are Fiskars scissors that I've had for I don't know how long I probably bought these when I was in college and they were decent scissors and they worked pretty well now they're plastic handles they they they don't feel quite as nice as a really nice pair of old shears and these are a pair of Compton you set that I picked up with a box lot with a bunch of other things and I used to use these when I did a lot of fiberglass work and I would beat these up like crazy and I got epoxy all over them but as long as you maintenance them and keep going with them they actually still work really really well so both of these have gotten a bit dull and so I want to actually sharpen them and show you what I'm looking for now when I check for sharpness I want to make sure I get a nice clean cut all the way from one end to the other all the way to the tip and I get a slice all the way across there also I want to see if I can get them to cut without slicing I want to just hold them there and slide the paper through in this case I'm getting a Terra same thing with this one on this one I can get a nice clean cut all the way from one side the other but it's not going to slide it's a little bit better than the other one but not by much so we need to work on that the other thing I'm looking for is a slop in the scissors there should be little bit of slop when they're crossed like this but by about this point that slop should be gone and they should be touching each other all the way down this one has slop all the way down to rib out here and then at that point they're actually touching and a little sheer all the way off so I want to see if I can get rid of a little bit more slop in this these ones are pretty good there there's a little bit of slop here but by the time I get them here they're touching and there's nothing slopping in them and I'm getting a nice contact all the way down basically the way they do that is the two shears are bent past each other so as they slide there's always something contacting and they share across so just as with a chisel a sharp point is just two faces of Steel coming together to meet we have our back of the channel and then we have our bevel on shears or scissors the exact same thing we have the back of the shear and then we have the bevel on here now with a chisel the bevel may be 2025 or sometimes 15 degrees with these it's usually at like 80 degrees so basically a 10 degree cut on the back here I have seen some people with the screw design actually take them apart to do the sharpening I leave them together I find that to be just a little bit simpler it's one less step in the process so for the actual sharpening I'm going to grab a diamond plate that I have this is a roughly 1200 grit diamond plate though grits and diamonds don't equate to grits and other things if you have a whetstone or sandpaper on a hard surface those weren't perfectly fine so I'm just going to hit this with a little bit of wet and then bring the scissors over and hit the back it doesn't take much at all just a few strokes and you start to see this little black stuff coming out that's actually the steel being removed from these shears so just like that we can flip it over and you can see the shiny area running all the way down the edge here that's the cutting edge on the back here you may see some shiny as well when they initially grind this they cut with a hollow in there a hollow grind on there makes it easy so you just have to remove a little bit of material so you can see the shininess all along the cutting edge now these have been sharpened quite a few times and because of that the shininess isn't right along the edge it's starting to draw back a little ways along there and the more you sharpen it the farther it'll come back along with blade so now that I've done this side we're gonna flip it over do the same thing on this side now with the chisel I do not always hit the back I really only hit that if I have a problem or a nick to come out with and the same thing with the scissors I don't all always at the back but if ever there's any junk on the back or if there's been some nick in the blade or if there's some other issues that I'm gonna hit the back and I'm probably going to hit the back every time because I only sharpen the scissors once a year maybe that and now that we've hit the back on these we need to do the bevel I've seen some people who would take the diamond plate and just do the same thing all the way across here or with their whetstone I actually prefer to do it the file I find it gives me a little bit more of a consistent surface all the way along that bevel so what I have here is one of the two jaws in a vise here I'm gonna grab my file and I'm going to draw file it from the back here all the way to the front what draw file means you're just going to drag it along and with a little bit of movement from side to side so we're gonna try here starting out by the tip and as we move we're gonna end up back over here like this you can see I'm using the edge of my vise here as a checked is to keep it at the same angle all the way across and after a few passes like that you start to see the shininess coming right along the edge except for right down here the tip I need to do a little more work and just like that I've got a nice edge on there and before I go any farther I'm actually gonna grab this little diamond paddle and this will just smooth out a little bit and give me a nice clean edge all the way across there I find that the diamond paddle really does a good job of giving that planishing touch on there so you get that extra sharp edge then we can flip it over and do the same thing on the other side now as a diamond paddle needed no man it makes it shine get that really nice edge on there so after that minute and a half of work we can take it for a test put it in here do a little slice and then on top of that it cuts all the way from back all the way into the tip the last thing I want to do is remove just that little bit of slop in this and so I can do this one just with the screw here give it a tiny little crank not much just a little bit yeah that one actually took a little bit too much it's binding up right here I'm gonna take just a hair off of that just like that that's I'm looking for it right there oh it feels good now we get a really nice clean cut very very quickly very very easily from end to end with a nice slide all the way down the piece now that's a really nice pair of scissors that will last me for years and years and years to come some scissors don't have the screws they actually have a rivet on there and so you can put a handle on one side or a hammerhead on one side and then you have to strike the other side and tap it down to tighten it up a little bit and sometimes you have to do that if you remove too much material off of the face of the scissor you need to bring these together a little bit better so that they will slide all the across it is amazing what a good pair of scissors can do and the difference between a decently sharp pair of scissors and a really nice sharp person is we can slide all that across the paper it makes things really really happy now if you want to see it links to what I use I'll have those down in the description below you don't have to use diamonds I just like them they give that little extra clean sharpen on their files work just perfectly just understand you have to do a little bit more time to get that perfectly clean edge on there I'm sure this has brought up a few other questions feel free to let me know the questions down below and I'll try and get to as many of those as I can also if you did like the video please hit like comment share subscribe ring the bell become a patron click the join button all those things really do help out the channel and thank you for that anything there really does make a difference and that helps a lot so I think that's about it for now and until next time have a wonderful day some people have asked me why I like working from home and well I did try to find a regular job at the last interview I was at the interviewer asked me so we're looking for someone who's responsible do you fit that bill and my response was well at my last job the building burnt down and my employer did say I was responsible", "tqZp5uj7eXE": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music]

we need to do is get the blade off get the drawbar back on because i can't have the blade on with the drawbar at the same time it won't swing around one of the important things to remember to do in the wintertime is put diesel conditioner in when it's really cold anti-gel is your friend there's a little head here too [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] we had the 2840 starting to gel up the other day so don't want to get caught off guard so the drawbar just slides in underneath and clips in normally we grind big feed with the 2840 but since the snow blower is on that and you saw how much of a pain that can be taken on and off we just have a little bit of grinding to do today so we'll use the 2240 so we'll go ahead take the blade off put the grinder up [Music] [Music] so hooking up the pto shaft on this one you have to you can see where you need to line it up and in order to do it sometimes you have to turn the whole flywheel on the grinder in order to get the shaft turn enough to line up sometimes i have to resort to spinning the pto on the tractor but usually if i can get this to move just enough [Music] there we go so this is our oatana feed mill we've had it for about four uh maybe five years we had replaced one bearing otherwise it's been a good grinder for us uh what it does is it uh you put whatever you're going to going to be putting is your raw product in the front and then it has a hammer mill that grinds it you have different size screens that you can put in it in order to change how it's grinding and it augers that back and this is a giant mixer so you can add in minerals and other things so we'll go through how we do this the uh milk can be drawn either without the grinder running or with it grinding there's a pin you push in here to lock the grinder in so we'll show you the insides of the mill here essentially there is this screen that everything needs to get pushed through in order to be made into there and in here there's the hammers that spin and knock against the screen real fast and that's how it knocks it and hammers apart the wheat and the oats and everything into our final feed so this meal i believe is probably made around 1980 it's an oathana 420 things that it doesn't have that would be really nice as a way to weigh your feet inside of it so you know how much you're adding without measuring it ahead of time what we do is i figured out how much a bucket full of this or that is ways and i'll show you that in a second so we know how much we're putting in of each ingredient just by the amount of a bucket full so what we're making today is our basic pig feed and if you can i don't know if this will show up or not on the screen uh but i chose me for a what i consider a full grind i'd put in 1200 pounds of wheat [Music] 500 pounds of oats 275 pounds of field peas and 40 pounds of buckwheat and that'll give me a total weight of the with the mineral and salt of 228 or 2028 pounds of which that comes down to 300 pounds of protein containing product based on the average protein content content for each thing i'm grinding and also allows me to figure out my cost a rough cost based on averages i pay and then it gives me a final percent protein which just comes out to a 14.8 percent which is a finisher or [Music] non-feeder pig ratio i have a different one that gives me a 16 for that we we find that the buckwheat is a key ingredient as you see there's no corn or soy in our grind so i have our bucket full drilled in it and you can see i have a hole drilled here a hole drilled here the higher one will give me 20 pounds of oats in wheat approximately if i fill to that level the lower one gives me 25 pounds of buckwheat when i scoop the buck we did so we'll run through demonstrating how we fill this and what we how we go through the process of making the feed [Music] so next we have field keys and we've already measured out what we needed to this bin here so we're going to put the whole thing in [Music] next we need to put the weed in here in our grain bin we keep wheat that came from our own field we'll put 600 pounds of this in for this mix and micah's gonna shovel it towards the door here so i can scoop it out into the otter and pull it over to the grinder in the summer we just drive right over here but it's easier to do this right now all right here comes bucket number one all right that's 15 buckets so we'll go put this one through the grinder [Music] okay so now we've got it over here and we know we've got 15 buckets full in here and so we will put that in the grinder and we'll go back and put another 15 buckets in here [Music] so the final step before emptying it is adding the mineral and salt uh in the mixtures that we're doing we do if we're for a full grind we do 10 pounds of salt and three and a half or three pounds of the mineral since this is only a half grind that we have in uh done today we will add five pounds of salt and one and a half pounds of the mineral what i found is that this green cup here is exactly one pound per scoop so putting five of these [Music] [Music] [Music] five of those and a little more than one and a half of these [Music] and what we have here is plain old salt and then this is a swine grower this is for the feeder pigs [Music] and not for the pregnant or nursing moms uh and we found this to be a good uh nice mineral mix that we use now we'll fire up the grinder again and mix this in before we empty it out so in order to add the mineral you dump it in back here and it gets sucked in and then mixed in i'm gonna get a little bit of old seeds because i mix that in pull in the cell we'll let that mix for a little while it just salt mixed in good then when it comes time to empty it we push this lever forward with it off and that'll turn on this auger and then we release this trap door here right there in order to let it come out with the auger that cover goes on there next we'll swing out the arm and get ready to empty it [Music] in order to empty it without such a mess we made a shoot just out of a cardboard box that allows us to empty it without [Music] [Music] so we'll click on so the auger is running now and we'll open the trapdoor unless it's vito there's an auger coming all the way up it empties it right into our bag and this thing is great so this is what we would call a half grind on our recipe card um since we're down to just two hogs of me feeding uh this too i only did a half on this and that's how we make pig feed and dog food can dab get the trailers in with the grinder on the back and the stock trailer on the front [Music] so [Music] [Music] all right you can back up two trailers at a time", "3ggghDldZf8": "- I have Mr. John Thompson, National Technical Sales\nDirector for Pferd, and I have some technical\nquestions for you. - Fair enough. - I want to get into\nthis piece of plate here and I want to clean it, but\nI don't want to do what, you know, normally I would get into this with, what's the most\ncommon, I'd start out with a quarter inch wheel, it's zirconium. And I know, from doing it all these years, that it, you know, and I\ntry to remove mill scale my abrasive just kind of\nloads up and it's just sittin' here and it's not doing anything. So the first thing I would\ndo would be angle it up. Now I'm cutting and I don't\nwant to cut into this, I want to maintain the\nsurface integrity, I just want the mill scale off. - All right. First of all, let's take a quick look at what the mill scale is. When they were making this\nmaterial and it's hot, all the impurities come to\nthe surface and so there's 100% adhesion, okay? That scale is hanging on\nto all the little nooks and crannies and such that are here. - Okay. - So coming in with a regular\ngrinding wheel like you do, when it first starts to\ntake this from this kind of gray color to a shiny\nblack, because you're really not getting it all off,\nnow frustration takes over. - Yeah, it does. - And the first thing\nyou do is start picking this thing up and you're\njust gonna get it off. - I'm gonna bear down too. - But remember, you're\nrunning at 160 miles an hour, that's what this wheel\nis running at, it's your regular high speed grinder. - Okay. - And your control at that\npoint, to keep from digging too deep, is gone. So what we do is we've\nactually sat down and said, what is it gonna take to\nget rid of mill scale? And so let's start out with\nthe wheel you would have had on the pegboard. - Okay. - Grabbing that wheel and\nsaying, look, I'm gonna make a push and we're gonna take a look. Now it may, cause it's brand new. - Sure. - You may initially get some\nof the scale off, but I want you to take a look at the\namount of scratches you're putting into the material\nand remember, later on you're gonna have to paint this,\nand you want it to look halfway decent. - All right. - So let's do that. - Okay. - Wrong grain, wrong speed, wrong control. Let's see what happens. - Okay. - Okay, here's a perfect example. You see, first of all you've\ngot a really deep scratch. - I do. - And this is a standard 24 grit. And it's a brand new wheel. - It's a brand new wheel. - The other thing is, you'll\nsee how you're skipping because you're spending\nat least 40% of your time in the air. - Well, I, yeah, I'm trying\nto keep a light pressure but-- - No, but-- - Yeah, yeah, you're right,\nand then I'd have to go back and clean that off, and\nthen I'm just overlapping deep scratches with deep\nscratches and deep scratches. - Exactly. Abrasives only remove. So in reality all Yyou're\ndoing is taking more and more of your actual material\nthickness and stuff down, possibly even creating a\nweaker point, if it's gonna be a stress point later on. The other thing is you're\nnot getting it all off. - No, I'm not, mill scale-- - You've gotta get this all cleaned up. - Mill scale melts at a\nhigher temperature than the clean base metal. - Absolutely. - And so-- - Another reason that\nI want it off of there. - That's another reason. So let's go to a flap disc instead, okay. - Okay. - You're not gonna bounce,\nyou still buy these out at your local supplier,\nit's a flap disc, it doesn't bounce around as much as a hard wheel. Costs a lot more, okay. We're just gonna put\nthis one on, same thing, mounts on the same as\nanything else, speed stays the same, you're still\nusing it on your grinder. And we're gonna come a\nlittle bit above on here. Now this is actually rated at 40 grit. So we're not talking about\nanything real cosmetic. This was a 24 grit wheel. - Okay. - So this is 40 grit and\nthat's about as coarse as most of the time you\ncan find them, right? - Um hmm. - Okay, let's try that up here-- - Which you, you'd think\nwould be pretty aggressive. - Well, you-- - But I've grabbed one\nand I'm thinking, wow, this thing isn't cutting\nat all, it's just floating. - For now let's take a\nlook at what's happening. - To me, to me what it\nfelt like as an operator-- - Go ahead. - As an operator, I feel like\nI'm kinda floating out here. And when I pulled the grinder\ndown toward me a little bit, I'm changing my angle,\nobviously, it's biting. I'm making overlapping\ngouge marks in here, I'm making waves. - Right. But look at also, you've\ngone from the gray color, now you're going to a shinier black color. - Um hmm. - And you can see how it's so broken up. - Um hmm. - Here it's a very crisp edge,\nand here it's all broken up. - Um hmm. - The reason being, and you\ncan see the disc already, has started to glaze up. - Yeah. - So it isn't gonna take\nyou long, all right, when you start to pull into\nthis, because now the scale is down low, you gotta\nwork to get that out. - Right. - And that's where you start-- - That's where my frustration\nlevel goes through the roof. - Exactly. - Because again, and I'm\nlooking at it over here in the light, and it's glazed. - It's already started to glaze. - And so when that stuff,\nis it heat that's making it glaze up? Is it, I mean, I realize\nthat once it glazes up, to me it's floating, I don't feel\nanything and so that's the, that's where you get hacked\noff and you start pushing down and trying to make things work\nwhen they're not gonna work. - So, what is mill scale actually made of? It's made out of the\nimpurities from the steel. It's made out of the excess\ncoke that's in the material, it's made out of oils, it's\nmade out of drawing materials, it's made out of all the\nthings that got mixed in. Your heating them back\nup to about 1800 degrees, 'cause that's the actual\nfriction you're creating here. - Um hmm. - And what you're tending to\ndo, especially on the oils and the debris, is all\nyou're doing is starting to float 'em. And now you're floating 'em\nand now you're floating 'em and now you're floating 'em. - I'm just rearranging them. - All you're doing is\nmoving 'em back and forth. Think about a coat of paint\non a car, three four coats of paint on a car, and you\ncome in, you're gonna grind all that off, and you literally\nliquified and it lumps over here and you push it\nback over here and it lumps over here, and you say, what is going on? You've exceeded the\ntemperature of the mill scale and all you've done is\nstarting to float it all over the place. And the madder you get,\nand the harder you press, the more you just float\nthat all over the place. - Yeah, and it's not fun. - We can't give you anything\nthat you have to lean into, and we can't give you\nanything that's gonna build up a lot of heat and friction,\nwhich means you can't stay on it for any length of time. - Okay. - You can't play around with it. - So what's some, what's\na good solution here? What do you, what do you recommend here, as far as (disc clinking). - The whole idea is that\nwe have taken a look at the actual issue that\nyou've had, and we've said it cannot be done with an impact grain. Impact grains are aluminum\noxide, zirconia, ceramic. - Okay. - It just can't be done. These grains are designed\nto bang on the material. (phone rings) - You might want to turn that off. - I'm gonna, I'm thinking,\nit's Richie Rory too. - We're in the middle of a film. - I'm, 500 bucks on\nLulabella in the third. Okay, I'm fine, I'm okay right now. - You're like Jackie Chan in Rush Hour. Who leaves their phone on? - Yeah, but didn't he fire somebody? - I don't know. - Okay, I didn't think so. Anyway, so what we're\ngonna do, is instead, we're gonna completely change the grain that you're using. - Okay. - Because we, here's our constant. We know we have a lot\nof mill scale, we know we have a high speed\ngrinder, we know we have an operator that does\nnot enjoy, you did not wake up this morning and\nsay I gotta prep all this plate, I am one happy, happy boy. We know we don't have that. So what we have to do is,\nwe have to make you happy. We can do it with either a\ngrinding wheel, if you still want to go back to a grinding wheel. We can do it with a segment of flap disc. But what we're gonna\nchange, and you can see from the color even the\ndifference, the zirconia's blue and that's not natural, by\nthe way, that's done that way. This is silicon carbide, this\nis designed, for instance, to work on stone, to work on\nmasonry, to work on glass. And the idea here is instead\nof being an impact grain, it's a pick. It literally comes in\nand`picks this material up. - Okay. - So you're gonna make a pass and you don't have to lean into it. - Oh, I'm already there. - And by you not having to\nlean, it's gonna finish it. So you're not gonna get\nall these wave marks. So let's put this one on. Still 40 grit. We haven't changed the grit\nsize, we haven't changed anything else from here. - Wow. As soon as I started, I\nreduced my pressure a lot, and I tried to lay this thing\ndown as flat as I could, and I took off and walked across\nthere pretty quick, really. But I literally, when I,\nsoon as I felt it, I reduced, I wasn't pushing on it at all. Matter of fact, that was\nlike floating on there. I thought I was gonna, I\nthought I was gonna miss, like I was trying to do over\nhere, trying not to scratch it. So looking at this, I haven't\nmade those individual cuts. - Exactly. - So I'm just, like you said,\npicking it off of there. - You put in less effort,\nyou're letting the speed of the grinder do the work, you don't have to get frustrated, 'cause\nwherever you point it, it's going to come off. - Absolutely. - And so, and the idea is,\nthat you're not building up as much friction 'cause you're not pushing into the material. I mean in the same respects\nand stuff you'll see, 'cause we looked at this\ntwo of the three these and we said, you know, one of the points you brought\nup, it's really, really nice to get that mill scale off\nbut sometimes you grind further out than you need\nto weld, and then you have to, later on, you're\ngonna paint it, and you really don't want those\nmarks to come up and show. - No, really don't. - And so we've reduced that somewhat. You can see the real deep\nmarks from the grinding wheel, the lighter ones from the\nzirconia but still marks, and this kind of sculpting. - That, that right there,\npainted in the right light, it just, it looks like somebody\nwent over and hammered it. - Exactly. - Beat up. But this is still flat,\nI don't have these bumps that look like I hammered\nthe daylights out of it here from the, every time that\nit came over here and cut, so this is better. - It is. Now all that's great in a\nreality for somebody and stuff that's doing small batches,\nthat are people that are doing some, just some fab\nshop work or whatever. You don't have to make any\nbig changes or anything around here. But now you've got some\ncommercial work, you've got to do a lot of these\nplates, you gotta do a lot of this work and such,\nit's gonna be painted or powder coated, cosmetics\nare gonna be important, and you've saying to\nyourself, is there any way I can do this and get off\nthe mill scale but really control the amount of\nscratch to the point where I can reduce, later on, post work? So what we did was, we went\nback to the drawing board. And so what we did was,\nwe went back and we said, what's the biggest problem\nwe still have here? And that's a directional scratch. - Um hmm. - Even though it's lighter,\nit still has a direction that's going to show\nlight unless you later on go and sand it or do\nsome other work with it. - Um hmm. - So what we did is, we\nmanufactured a stainless steel wire brush and then we\ntook that filament, that actual wire, and we sent it\nto our manufacturing facility and they actually grew, what\nis called grew, diamond on it. - Stop it. - So this is a-- - I can see that now, that you\nturn it in the right light. - So the whole idea, you\nsee, you can see that almost half of the length\nof the wire actually has kind of a gritty appearance. - Sure. - That's pure industrial diamond. And we do that because we\nliterally can take this and grow, take diamond\nsegment and it's called growing diamond on each\none of these filaments. So now what I've done is, I've\ntaken an abrasive product, this time industrial diamond,\nand I put it into a format that you can come on to mill scale with, and very effectively. And because these wires\nare all gonna move, you're not gonna have\na directional pattern. - Not gonna have directional. - Now you're gonna lean\ninto this a little bit. It's not like a regular\nwire brush where you're just using the tips, you gotta kind drag that diamond through. - You gotta get into it some? - Right. And with about the same\neffort as you did here. - Okay. - You're gonna see it's not much. Now what you've got, is you've\ngot an area you'll notice the mill scale's off, the\nmachine isn't building up any kind of heat. - A big area. - It's doing a big swap at a time. - It's like eating it off of there. - And it just leaves\nyou with a very light, non-directional real finish. - That's strange, I\nmean, you know, when I, first of all when I started to grind it, I didn't think it was on. - Well (laughing). - I mean, it just kind of\nwent to nothing, because of the super low RPM, and\nthen I could actually feel, you know, when I got up here\nand just got the right angles, so that this would flatten\nout somewhat, you could kind of feel it just kinda\nbiting into this and then, when I pulled it back. That's amazing. - And how about, you used\nwire brushes in the past, how many wires you got sticking in you? - I don't feel any, you\nknow, this big old fat thing here catches all the\nwires and I get 'em stuck in my jeans and, that's amazing. - The reason being is, the\nwires are not running at so high a speed, that in reality\nof stuff they're allowed to do their work. - Um hmm. - And so you're just\ncompletely controlling that. - This fascinates me. I see some huge benefits to this. - The other thing is,\nbecause you haven't scratched the surface up so badly,\nfor this grinding wheel or even this initial disc,\nbecause of all the effort you have to put in, to get\nit to paint I have to do at least two more steps. - Um hmm. - With this, I can\nimmediately go to the 150 grit non-woven disc and I'm\nready to throw it to paint. - I know this helped tremendously. I mean, this answered\na lot of my questions that I've had over the years. I've tried various products. This, to me, is fascinating. I mean, there's a lot\nof our viewers that ask us technical questions\nabout abrasives on occasion and I'm lack the technology\nand the science behind abrasives, and always\nbeen fascinated by that. So you have answered\na lot of my questions. - Excellent, thank you. - Well thank you, I appreciate your time. This is very interesting\nand I know a lot of viewers are gonna benefit greatly\nby this so, seriously, I mean this is something that I've always been annoyed by mill scale,\nand this easy solution of just wiping this\nstuff right off here is pretty fascinating.

that's inside of a piece of tube [Music] so what I need is this small piece of tubing to slide over the top of this piece of two inch now what's stopping me from doing that is a stupid weld seam inside this tubing and I hate that well it's my least favorite weld of all time but if you need a telescoping fit you can buy seamless tube to do this you can get it in just about any size and get it around and you can get it in a rectangle you can get it in square and depending where you live it may not be readily available to you it's also more expensive so removing the seam out of the section small section of tubing for a small project is actually a pretty good idea I'm gonna show you the four or five different methods that I've used over the years to get rid of the weld seen from a short piece then build a cheap tool for the long sections you'd be surprised how easy it is just to peel that weld right out of there with just a simple chisel and a hammer but one I'm using is a proto this is a three quarter by 12 with a 7/8 cut on the tip this is my go-to tool I have to remove it out of a short section of tubing another tool I like to use is one of these finger Sanders it uses a 3/8 wide belt the one I'm using here is a Chicago pneumatic turns it like 22,000 rpms be sure to get lots of belts if you have one of these things because it likes to use them up pretty fast and make sure you turn them in the right direction too because if you don't belts like to break ah the die grinder which I call the devil sliver maker this thing's pretty effective at removing the weld but you get all these little filings everywhere and they're just a pain to get rid of you get a whole bunch of different style burs they're kind of expensive to purchase but once you got on they last quite a while if you have more time than patience a file also works this one's just a half round bastard file pretty coarse and it probably takes about 2 to 3 minutes you can you can rough out a weld pretty quickly if it's a small section of tubing but it's a simple and effective fire also can remove that weld seam out of there if you're good with a torch this is a great option if you're not good with a torch you'll probably destroy your tubing but it is quick and it is effective especially on larger tubing where that weld seam is pretty big scarfing tip works awesome to remove that weld you have some extra free time on your hands go to the scrap bin grab some of these small sections of tubing and bust out the torch and just practice trying to scarf that weld out of there it really will help with your torch skills and then when you do need to be able to remove that weld man you're ready to go I'm not a real big fan of grinding a groove on the outside of this tube I think it looks unprofessional but if this is your only option it does work the chisel the file all those things work great on short sections but what do we do on longer pieces I want to show you the tool that I made to remove that pesky weld out of there you need a piece of high speed steel a piece of all thread a few nuts endcap the actual slug material itself and that's about it really pretty simple we're gonna drag this piece of high speed steel through the inside diameter of this tubing much like how a shaper works if you're not familiar with the shaper so I have a video on that it's pretty interesting to watch so go check that out but we need a way to hold this piece of high speed steel so I've cut three inches off the tube that I actually want to fit inside of this then measured where the weld seam is located and transferred that on to our little slug here I've then scribed the width of the high speed steel on to the surface of the tubing and came down about an inch or so that way we got at least a good half of an inch inside of the tube to help it get started and drag straight you can use a bandsaw or you can use a skinny wheel to make this little groove after we got the groove in I just stick it in the vise and I literally peen over the two little arms that are left that way we've got a nice good little channel for this piece of high speed steel to sit in it doesn't have to be too precision now looking at the high speed steel itself it needs to measure the exact width of the the mail tube that's going inside of the female when you do cut the high speed steel to length you can't take this to the bandsaw you're gonna have to use a skinny wheel or some sort of abrasive cut off to cut it we don't need to make it oversized just make it the exact length and you can grind that really really really close with either a belt grinder or a flat disc I basically want the high speed steel to have a square back end which is gonna ride against the inside wall opposite of the weld seam the cutting edge could also be square or a neutral if you're not familiar with the way high-speed steel works you don't have to worry about sharpening it in order to drag the slug through the tubing we need to use a piece of all thread I like to use the biggest piece that I can and get as close to the cutting edge of that piece of high-speed steel and we're gonna make a basically a cap for the back we're gonna drill a hole weld a nut and we're gonna get that hole as close to the cutting edge as possible that's going to prevent the slug binding that it walks its way through the inside and of the tubing be careful not to overwhelm the nut because you'll distort it just some some good tacks to keep it from twisting off and the weld seam on these tubes are never the same so you might end up over the years making a couple different ones where different weld seams are I'm gonna cut the rod to length and then weld a nut on the end of it so I have a way to grip the all-thread and twist it to start the assembly you just need to stop on the back just to cap it just something to block it because we're gonna be pulling on the edge of the tube and I like to put a washer on the end because there's gonna be quite a bit of friction there give yourself a little bit of a starting point by chiseling out a good inch or so if you squeeze too hard on the vise you're gonna pinch the slug and too if you put a little bit of an angle your chips will roll out so they get bound up a little shot of Lube okay we're go switch to the back of the vice fry squeezing on it we are so gonna kick it back [Music] okay just clean up the ends a little bit you could also make this to where you could just use your press and punch it through that's pretty simple too but I wanted to show you the all-thread technique so this is a pretty slick option if you only need one or two of these pieces and you don't have any seamless tubing available to you at the moment over the years I've collected a couple different sizes and I keep all the rods and I just have stuff them in a drawer in my toolbox if you're looking for high speed steel you can find it on ebay or amazon this stuff is cheap and I suggest keeping some in your toolbox at all times I know what you're all thinking how do we remove the weld out of a piece of tubing or pipe we're gonna have to implement something a little bit different I think we can still pull a slug or some sort of cutting device through the center of the tubing but that's gonna pose some problems because there's no reference surface the cutting edge is probably gonna move around the tubing if we try to pull it through so here's what I'd like to try I'm gonna cut a section of this bar stock off and I want to push it through the center of this tube but this bar is way too soft to have any sort of cutting edge on it so I want to actually weld a cutting edge on the outside circumference of this bar and then we'll we'll sharpen it on the grinder and then we'll try to push it through here's the slug that I want to push through the pipe I want to put a chamfer all the way around 360 degrees around this edge I'm looking for maybe a bevel that looks something more in line with the body something like that that way we can fill it in with the metal and they come back and grind it or put it in the way and turn it back to diameter again I'm gonna be using this UTP 711 B this is a hard facing rod used in excavating equipment I keep it listed around the shop for all sorts of good stuff the UTP specs I think it says it'll get to like 60 Rockwell which is pretty hard I don't want to arc weld this weld seam around the top I actually want to use this as a TIG filler so I'm gonna knock all the flux off of it and then use the TIG to actually apply this filler metal it's going to allow me to precision place the amount and the thickness of the weld bead I want a lot of material around the edge because I'm gonna grind it off so I'm gonna use the latex just to build up a big fatty weld on top of this edge just because I'm curious we're gonna hit this weld with the file see how hard it is it's not like super super super hard or you can tell this is just mild steel back here you hear it it's just soft quiet and here's the top how's that distinct hard skating feel to it so now the what I want to do is I'm just gonna grind this the shoulder square I want to square flat top cutting edge that way when this thing decides if it wants to twist inside of that piece of pipe that it will always have a continuous cutting edge to ride against alright there's the final slug the cutting slug I've only got about ten minutes into this so far and it feels pretty sharp to my finger hopefully it's strong enough to rip that well down to the inside of the pipe I don't know how's it gonna work is it knocking hard we're gonna find out did you look at that oh it's working guys [Music] Wow that's my finger yep more chips that worked actually really really good can barely feel at my fingertip works lick nice trick that worked better than I expected here's the slug there's a little bit of edge damage right there but I mean look at that's so that's a eighth of an inch now look how much more cutting edge I have I could use this slug over and over and over again well guys this actually worked really good way better than I expected this is one of the reasons why I really love metalworking I had no idea this it would actually work it's fun to be able to experiment and try new things hopefully this might help you on a problem you might have on the future trying to remove a weld seam I know I'm gonna probably use it again - so I'm gonna stash this little slug in my toolbox for next time and I'll catch you on the next one how many time I think I've said to me at least thirty times in this video sheesh tube tubing to be tube tubing tubing tubing tubing tubing tubing and tube tubing tube tubing the tube tube tubing tubing tubes tube tubing tubing our tubing tube a tube you", "F73QtCeeQ40": "oh why date it what's up dude - boy happy - up here welcome back to another episode now look at on this one we are going to be building a simple and pretty efficient creeper farm now this is pretty similar to the other mob farm / creeper farm that we did just build a couple of weeks ago but we do have some efficiency upgrades and as well as it is a little bit bigger now so let's uh once I'll get into it here so now the items that you're gonna need for this build are pretty straightforward you're going to need four stacks of builder blocks just about two stacks of trapdoors twelve carpets two water buckets a bucket of lava twelve pieces of glass to hoppers two chests and four signs as well as two cats that you will need for this build and these can just be regular pet cats you don't have to nametag them or anything like that just make sure you feed them some salmon and get them to sit okay so the first thing you're gonna want to do for this build is just take yourself a three by two area like this in the ground in order for you to get started and then we're gonna build two two by two pillars like this on the side and each of those are going to be two blocks high okay next what we're gonna do is we're gonna come to the corner of these pillars here we're going to build out two blocks on each side okay so that should be a seven gap here in the middle okay and then what we're gonna do here is we're going to step out one more time we're gonna come back for five blocks anyways we'll do the same thing for this side okay and then you're gonna connect these two back corners up and this is what it should look like now what you're gonna do is you're going to repeat this pattern here on the other side so we want to come to this I'm just from the corner go one two and then out again and one two three four and five make sure you come across next what we're going to do is you're going to give this whole thing a second layer okay once you have your second layer on this is what everything here should look like and now what you're going to do is you're going to come to the inside here and you're going to find the center on this back wall okay so on this but back wall here and then what you're gonna do is Jana plays a trapdoor on the bottom half of the upper block there okay you can do the same thing for the other side here okay so that is on the like I said bottom half of the upper block and then what we are going to do is basically just in case this whole upper half layer here in trapdoors okay this is what everything should look like here you shouldn't be able to put a trapdoor obviously above this one because it is on that block there I'm kind of blocking away but this is also where we are going to put our cat but first let's repeat this step on this side here okay once you are done this is what everything here should look like okay so you should have your two high walls with your trapdoors on the top half of those two high walls and then this singular one on the end here okay on the lower half of the upper top wall okay and those four where you are going to put your cat which we will do now so all you have to do is just get a leash and then a cat and put him in place here and make him sit okay now the reason why you want to make sure that your cats are sitting or so that way you know right away they can't jump out of here and as well as when you do you know leave the area here your cats will not spawn or follow you or teleport to you next all we have to do is just put a layer on this thing here in order to keep the light level down so put a roof over top of every single one of these trapdoors here okay and once you are done this is what your farm should look like okay next what we're gonna do is we're just going to break into here so that way we can access the inside here okay and what we are going to do is we are going to place a carpet right here underneath the cat then we're gonna come over two blocks place another carpet same thing then come down two blocks come over two and then you are done repeat that step there for the other side here so one okay and once you have that step repeated you should be good to go next what we're gonna do is we're gonna come to the center here we're going to place down three trapdoors on either side of these or this pit here anyway so we're gonna close them all down ignore those lights for now I just put them there in order to light the area up and to stop spawns but next what we're gonna do is we're going to come into the pit here what you're going to do is you're gonna dig this down three more blocks okay like this actually let's do it four blocks just to play it safe and then what we're going to do is we're going to dig forward on the to wide section here about eight or nine blocks okay and this is where we are going to put our water but since water only travels eight blocks in total what we're going to do is count out one two three and right here on the eighth block what we're gonna do is we're going to you know carve that out and step it down one more so that way when we do place our water in here okay it flows downhill and heads that direction now all you have to do is just continue to dig this one out until you reach your you know the limit here for the water and you should be good okay so right there as you can see we're going to dig this all out and put a light source in here so that way we can see okay but once you get to the end of the water here what you're gonna do is you're going to dig it down to blocks like that and then over one you know look yourself a nice little room here to work from if you would like and then what you're gonna do is you're gonna come to the side here you're gonna place down your two chests with your hoppers running into that chest then you want to step back into the inside here and you're gonna place down some glass okay you can do it too high if you would like and then right here okay on each side of the hopper you're gonna place down a sign just like that then one block up and one block in front you're gonna place another two signs and then this is where you are going to place your lava paint next all you have to do is just put a roof above your lava like this and you are done okay and what that roof does is it prevents the creepers from swimming up and doing something like this so if you just put the roof there like that when the creepers do slide down here all they're gonna do is come into this little section here and get burnt up and then their items will drop down and into the chest to remove these weight sources here build our wall back up okay and what we're going to do is we're going to find out where our little area is here which is great here and basically what we're gonna do is we're gonna fill this all with glass and that is so that we can kind of see the mobs as they come down here okay the reason why we did to step down and brought it this far away from the mob farm obviously is so that way you know the lava because it creates a light source it's going to ensure that we do get a light level of zero in here so as you can see even with the lava down there right here on this corner block we are out of light level three so that is why we push that down you know one step and then eight blocks further next all you have to do is just go up a hundred and whatever it is twenty blocks from the chest so if we dig down here okay our chest right now is sitting on fifty eight so if we look to 178 we should see this farm start to work okay so here we are at 179 178 right there and if we just turn all of this off as you can see we already have creeper spawning in and we are good to go now somebody on one of my other videos was saying that this farm isn't really that efficient now I understand that it is a little bit slow because we are just doing one layer of you know spawning blocks here but as you can see with me just talking you know there's 8 9 10 11 so there's 11 or 12 creepers right there in just a matter of a couple of seconds so efficient non efficient yeah that's pretty subjective I would say next all you have to do is just do a little afk section and see how much you get and you are good to go okay so what I did for you here was I built the same farm that I did over there but I built it here in order to do a test so here we have this is actually one block smaller than the other farm over there as well too okay so there is like 10 or 12 less spawning platforms or spawning blocks inside this farm here than the other one but nonetheless that is the same idea of farm anyways so what I've done here is I've done you know the single layer so two and then a double layer which makes for a triple-layer which makes six quadruple layer which makes eight and then I did this sucker here okay ignore all of the design stuff around it this is for a future project that I'm doing on one of my worlds okay but this one here is I think this one is 12 hi okay but we're gonna go up here to 180 do a little afk session and see what we get out of the farms or the difference anyways okay so here we are at a hundred and eighty we are approximately one hundred and twenty one blocks above all of the farms here as you can see the ones with the triple and quadruple have already started the twelve one is raining in creepers and the single one here is slowly slowly slowly pulling in some things so what we are going to do is we're gonna leave a little AFK session here and see what we get after a few hours okay so what's up doors it's the next morning here okay I did leave this thing running all night long basically I did light up as much of the area as possible - as well in order to stop the spawns on the surface from happening so that way we can get as many mobs as possible even at nighttime but yeah let's switch our over to day here and go down and check our chests okay so we're gonna start down here at the single level one and see what we get as long as we go down here now I have connected tunnels up to all of these ones too as well so that way we can easily see what we get and yeah now keep in mind this is a seven hour session okay seven and a half seven eight-hour session whatever it's just basically me going to bed and waking up in the morning okay and after you know a full night on the single one gear what we get is you know not very good but that's a decent amount of gunpowder anyways especially for a pretty simple pretty simple farm that only involves four stacks of blocks okay the second one here remember this one is the quadruple one so one two three four stacked on top of each other and what we have here is oh we've got the chest and a quarter fill basically so that's actually not too bad either that's actually really good for something that is as small and compact as that okay if we check the third one here this is the one that has six of them stacked on top of each other we have one two so we have two full double chests plus a little bit as well too so not too bad and then we've got the big one here so this one is the eight stacked one let's see what we got out of this a one two and nearly three double chests full of gunpowder okay so that is the two four six and eight stacked one and now let's go and check the big uns here so this is the one that has 12 of them in it okay it is stacked very very very high I did one two three four and nearly four and then the fifth chest here has a little bit extra in it too as well so you know you guys make the decision which one's the best one to build would you do you know obviously the single one is something that you can use to get started if you're just gonna go afk and all you need is a few stacks of gunpowder you know this is definitely the best one to build if you want to step it up a little bit and start to actually produce gunpowder for some you know emerald results or something on a server you know you can definitely start to stack this sucker up but as I was saying okay so this one here is only four blocks from the kitty cat or as this one here is five blocks so that farm there compared to this one here which is the earlier rendition of the you know mob farm that we created there is over 20 plus more spawning blocks for the you know creepers to spawn on but we also have a few extra things of carpet but still even if you you know over weigh the carpet we still end up with like 19 or 18 extra spawn blocks in that design that we just did over there versus the old mob farm that we did so that is basically it you guys that is the farm right there you know it is stackable it is you know angle you can put it on any direction you want you can put it any way you want so as you can see those ones there are facing that direction this one here is facing this direction so as you see by this thing here that I'm designing for one of my worlds you can decorate this you know however you want basically put some fancy patterns and designs around the whole thing if you would like but that is it rate there you guys that is the Gunpowder farm set up and ready to go for you guys it's a very very easy very efficient very simple build for you to get done and yeah I hope you guys enjoyed thank you again so much for watching my videos and all I'll definitely catch you on the next video boys peace", "mTuWA6AtUCU": "[BLANK_AUDIO] [MUSIC] Hi, my name is Rodrigue Dagenais. I'm a mature student here at Algonquin\nCollege. And the reason I took the program in my\ncase, it's a second career. I retired last year from the military, and\nit's something I've always wanted to do, cabinet and furniture making, and that was a great opportunity for me to go\nback to school and take a program. And in this case with the pepper grinder,\nit was a, the staff threw a challenge at us, and we took it, and it took about\nseveral months and we got it done. like, it was like, back to work. It was a, a two year program condensed in,\nin to one year, 45 weeks. And as long days, it was like being at\nwork for, you know, 35 hours a week, plus the\nhomework assignment. So there were long weeks. But overall, great college, great program. I really enjoyed it. [MUSIC]", "1GggaKmsGHQ": "hi guys mr waffles here today i'm going to be talking tips tricks and strategies to level up fast and get loads of xp in cold war zombies and also to unlock all the ethereum crystals that you need to complete your skill trees in the menu as well i'll have a little contents page on screen right now so you can see a rough breakdown of what i'm going to be talking about in the video and i'll also have timestamps in the description so you can click through to the different chapters we'll start off with xp there are actually several different methods and techniques that you can use in order to get as much xp as you can as fast as possible and the first i'm going to recommend is the challenges nearest to completion tab this page is self-explanatory it's got all the challenges that you've nearly finished off and it's a good idea to just check this before you jump into each match and pick maybe three challenges to remember that you're gonna work on just while you do everything else in your game for example the top of my list only requires me to get two more kills with field upgrades and i'll get a thousand xp so it's really worth checking this regularly to see what you're nearly finished with i also recommend you don't only look at the top couple of them but look down the list as well because there'll be some in there that have higher xp rewards that will be a bit further from completion but it will be worth the time investment so keep an eye on the entire list on this one there are also a few challenges that you might not do you just might not think about it in your game but that give you a really nice chunk of xp and that are super easy and straightforward one of them is killing 25 distracted enemies and it gives you 1000 xp and you can do that pretty much in one go by just throwing a decoy down when you've got a full horde of zombies on let's say round 10 and then killing them all and you can repeat this challenge two more times with higher kill targets as well so lots of xp to be had there you've also got one which is killing five enemies with a single tomahawk so you throw it on the hawk get a kill pick it back up again get another kill etc up to five kills and when you've done that one twice you'll also get a load of xp and you can keep doing that one too there are also 13 dark ops challenges in the game which give you a big xp bonus when you do them but it's not explained in the menus what you need to do in order to unlock them however i'm going to call out a couple of them here because they are super effective and not too difficult to do one is completing the main quest in d machine the dark ops is called evil unleashed and it's going to give you 5k xp and a really cool calling card that's one that i've got a full guide for on my channel so i'll have that linked in the description down below and in the top right hand corner of the screen right now so you can go ahead and do that main quest there's also a really easy one for getting 50 kills with a single support the best way to do this in my opinion is to use a chopper gunner or a war machine and just go crazy bear in mind that you're gonna get about 30 zombies in a horde so if you're using a war machine you can't just kill one horde and call it a day you need to make sure that you spread it out over multiple hordes that's going to give you 5k xp and a calling card and finally if you're able to reach round 30 without going down you'll also get 10 000 xp and a calling card next let's quickly talk about what else in the game is gonna get you xp other than just those challenges when you spawn in and start killing zombies you're gonna get 14 xp per kill this does not vary if you get a knife kill nor does it vary if you get an equipment kill or a headshot it's 14 xp at base as you go through round one of your game you'll kill six zombies getting you 84 xp and then you'll get a bonus for completing the round which starts off at 50 xp the next round will then begin you'll go through the round and for completing the next one you get a hundred xp this keeps scaling until round five when you get 250 xp and every round thereafter that you complete will grant you 250 xp this means that as your game goes on you stack up more and more xp so if you complete the first 10 rounds you'll have a 1900 xp just from round completions around 20 will net you 4 400 round completion xp around 36 900 xp around 9400 xp and around 50 11 900 round completion xp this does not include the actual zombies themselves giving you xp when you kill them it's just for the completions of the rounds so if you're an observant player you'll have noticed that the cap at round five means that you're actually incentivized less and less to keep going into the high rounds because the time that you put in to go from for example round 50 to around 60 will be much greater than the time it takes to go from round 20 to around 30. but the net round completion xp that you get from completing each of those sets of 10 rounds is the same even though the round 50 to 60 takes so much longer x fills give you bonus xp depending on which round you x fill on around eleven you get a thousand bonus around sixteen you get two thousand twenty one three thousand twenty six four thousand and thirty one and thereafter 5000 xp this means if you x fill at round 51 you'll also get 5000 xp for it this is once again another hint that it's not necessarily the most efficient use of your time to just always go for the highest round x fill possible this is why i recommend if you're only going for xp x filling at round 31 you don't need to worry about missing out on future xp gains from higher round x fills because like i said they cap and this also means that you can go back to your challenges tab and see which ones are now nearest to completion and start working on those already in your next game instead of wasting even more time in the match you were already in being less efficient with your challenges doing exactly this you can earn over 100 000 xp per hour that is not an exaggeration as an example for you i did around 31x spill my runtime was about 43 and a half minutes long and i earned 71 000 xp which at an xp per hour rate would give you 97 892 also known as basically 100k and the beauty of this is that if i'd focused on a couple of extra challenges in there or if it was double xp i mean don't get me started on how far you could go then i could have got even higher however going to a lower round and next feeling is no crime either here is a chart of five different test games where i went to different rounds and x filled and noted down my xp per hour i admittedly did do different numbers of challenges across the games so this isn't a perfect comparison that we're making here but as you can see there wasn't a huge amount of difference between the numbers of xp per hour across those games the 31x spill was best don't get me wrong but the round 11 x fill is so easy you can do it with your eyes sharp whereas the round 31 one takes a little bit more skill and so if you're maybe a newer player to the mode and you're just trying to get a little bit of xp here and there then x filling on round 11 is a viable strategy it's not the best in the world but it will work for you for example if you do an x bill on round 11 and you don't do any challenges you can expect to earn about 10 000 xp in about 10 to 12 minutes and that's not so bad i mean 10k xp is the same as doing some of those dark ops challenges so take your victories where you can with that said it's time to talk about ethereum crystals there are three main ways you earn ethereum crystals one is beating certain milestone rounds two is completing an x-fill at a given round and three is completing the map's easter egg let's start with milestone rounds if you get to round 10 and complete it the game will give you one crystal the same will happen around 15 20 and 25. if you complete round 30 you'll be given two crystals for your time and around 35 will also give you two then for completing 40 you'll get three crystals same with 45 around 50 four crystals etc all the way up to nine crystals per milestone round once you reach round 101. as far as i'm aware 9 is the limit so even if you get to round 151 you'll still only get nine crystals for that milestone these are cumulative through your game as well let's say you get around 30 you get two crystals for completing around 30 one for 25 one for 20 1 for 15 and one for 10 and so you end up with six crystals the game will also stop giving you crystals when you reach the limit of how many you need in order to completely max out your loadout and so you may see your friends or streamers things like that not earning any crystals and that's why there is also sometimes a little bit of fluctuation as to how much exactly you earn on a given round so while i'm being concrete with the numbers in this video you may see a variation of plus or minus 1 in your games the second method i mentioned for getting crystals is through x fills and the pattern here follows a similar shape to what we saw with the milestones except it's generally lower so you'll quite often only see two crystals maybe three crystals for an x fill or around 41 or 46 you might get three crystals for next fill around 51 and sometimes you'll only end up getting about five crystals for the next fill on round 106. thanks kashel for those numbers it's definitely a lot lower than the milestone baseline which again is cumulative whereas the xfill only happens once obviously in your game this is just another reason why it makes more sense to try and get more x fills in in a given amount of time and thus to go to a lower round so that you can get those x-files in rather than just going for one long run and relying only on milestones and basically just null and voiding your ex-fill crystals the last crystal earning method is doing the easter egg this is not as time-efficient as the other methods that i'm talking about here and as such i'm not going to explore it too much in this video but if you want to do the easter egg i've got a guide for it like i already said it's linked in the description so let's put this to the test we need a strategy that can be repeated for x fills at all the different rounds and we'll then look at the game duration xp earned and crystals earned and calculate the most efficient x-fil round i've decided to use the knife in the spawn until around 10 because it one hits and then i'll turn on the power on round 10 and if i'm going to a higher round i'll also turn on pack a punch that round if i'm x filling around 11 i don't need to pack a punch it's fine so i can just leave it at that and it's a little bit quicker this is a benefit of x filling sooner on the way to power i will always buy jug and stamina and i'll also pack a punch as soon as i've activated the machine and give myself an ammo mod because you will always have enough points to do that by round 10 if you're knifing in spawn the last thing i might do here is buy myself armor if i haven't got free armor off the floor and then i'll move my hoarding spot from the spawn area like i said to the deadshot daiquiri room the reason being it's got really quick spawns in there it's got an escape route that i can keep shut unless i absolutely need to get out of jail free card when i'm overrun and it's close to the pack punch machine the armor machine and an ammo box so i can quickly refill there as well this means my running around and waiting for zombie spawns is minimized as much as i could now bear in mind once you start getting to the higher x bill rounds like 26 31 etc it's gonna get really tricky hoarding in that room but it is quick so if you're a less experienced zombies player you may struggle there it's a little bit of a higher skill area to be hoarding in and one thing to remember also is that using equipment in that room is such a good idea because it's so enclosed it will really speed things up you can use a c4 to kill an entire horde it's fantastic the gallow i'm using will also get its level raised if i can afford it with salvage and i'll be pack punching it to level two and three of course as i go through the rounds as well if i can afford it i'll do it straight away when i go to xvil i'll always be sure to have my ether shroud ready unless i've had to use it in an emergency and i'll also buy a war machine from the crafting bench this is vital in the later rounds cannot stress this enough so definitely grab a war machine in your game if you're doing this strategy too and i'll try and make sure that i've got some good explosive equipment like semtex or c4 c4 preferably i'll also typically have had a bit of time during dog rounds in the game to roam around the map and get perks but i won't do this during a zombie round because it'll slow spawns down with dog rounds though it doesn't really make much of a difference and so that's when i use my opportunity to buy perks and get fully set up now i want to preempt a question i'm going to be asked about this what if i find a better hoarding spot in my game that is faster well then does this invalidate the claims that i'm making in this video about the best x-fil round and thankfully the answer is no what i'm saying in this video still absolutely applies it's just that you'll have a higher crystals per minute rate compared to me for the same x-fil so if you're expelling at 26 and you've got a faster strat your crystals per minute rate is going to be higher than mine for that x bill but the overall pattern which shows which x bill is the best should in the main stay exactly the same so you can trust this result that i'm about to tell you with all of that said which x-fill round is the one that earns you the most crystals per minute the answer is round 31 just like the xp earning curve which is crazy because that means that you're really not missing out on either currency when you extract on 31 it's the perfect time to do it the reason why this is the case can be broken down into several contributing factors but i quickly want to talk about one here because i think it's the most interesting if you think about the power curve of the player through the game you start your game and you're weak and then later into the game you get single pack and then double pack and then triple pack a punch you get your perks and you become stronger this is of course countered by the fact that the game spawns in more zombies with more health later in your match the point i want to make regarding this is easier to explain in an example so i'm gonna do that now let's say on round one six zombies spawn in and you knife them all and it's a one hit on the knife and so you just knife them and that's that you are killing a certain number of zombies per second which doesn't change when more zombies are spawned in and so on the next round when more zombies are spawned in let's say you've got 12 you're still gonna kill the same number of zombies per second because your loadout is still just as effective and you are still gonna kill them just as fast however if we went 20 rounds into the future your knife would no longer be one hitting you wouldn't have any perks you'd be having to play really safe and so your number of zombies killed per second would go down drastically this is the player power curve in effect it can also be visualized as a player being on round 10 let's say and they haven't quite got enough points to pack a punch but they're nearly there and they're killing pretty slowly because of that their gun is still pretty weak but then they get to the next round and they actually kill more zombies per second on that round even though the zombies on that round have more health because the players earned enough to pack a punch and therefore has boosted their power they've had a power spike and their power curve has shot up and with it their kills per second has increased as well what i think happens as you approach round 31 is your power basically goes above and below the sort of average power that the game expects you to have at a given time so you're saving up for your pack a punch you're a bit below that average power and then you get your pack a punch and you surge up above that average power line for a few rounds until the zombie's health catches up with you and you either need to pack a punch again or risk falling below the average power once more when you're point's efficient and you get to round 10 you definitely have enough to turn on power and pack a punch once but you're definitely a ways off from getting your second pack because it goes up to 15k this means that you have your power spike but then you drop below the average power line for a bit when you're trying to claw your way up to that 15k mark and this slows down your kills per second this i think is why my round 16 x fill is a little lower than the round 21 for xp and crystals per hour because you're kind of in a little bit of a power trough for some of those rounds by round 30 though you absolutely have enough to triple pack a punch a weapon and to maximize your armor and to buy all the perks again assuming your point's efficient and as such your power spike is essentially maximized the only way you can increase it is by getting a better weapon at base values out of the box such as the raygun for instance however because in my strategy that i tested with i normalized for the weapon being used to make sure that it was consistent across everything and i avoided any rng based results such as trying to spin for a ray gun i managed to find a pretty representative view of how the player's power fluctuates through the rounds and how that affects their kills per second and thus gives you either a higher or lower xp per hour or minute or whatever beyond round 31 the x fills get a lot riskier so there's that to bear in mind you could die that is an important factor to take into account here and you also have to face the fact that your kills per second past that point is never going to increase because there is no extra perk that you can buy at that point there is no further pack a punch level like i said the only change you can make is spinning the box for a better weapon and that takes time in itself it has its own cost and so while it may seem like you're killing hordes faster getting the ray gun could really eat out of your run and means your xp per minute or hour is a lot slower so in my mind that means there is too much risk associated with going past 31 and x filling later the risk of dying and the risk of playing more slowly due to the factors previously described the rate of crystals per hour is about 11 in the strat i was using but if you have a faster strat then you could earn more crystals per hour too and also a really important note here is that while i only earned around nine crystals per hour doing the round 11 x fill which seems significantly worse than the round 31 x fill it was a lot easier first of all and also if i was able to play slightly faster i would be able to bump it up an entire crystal to around 10 crystals per hour or slightly more 10.5 the difference is made by just shaving a minute and a half or so off the run and that could be done by getting better attachments for my weapon for example so maybe when i can spawn in with a more efficient loadout i'll have a faster run time on those round 11x fills just as an example anyway that is enough from me i've talked and talked about these systems i wanted to give you as much information about them as possible so that you were the best informed zombies player on the planet and if you feel like i've done a good job then i'd be really honored if you could subscribe and maybe leave a like on the video as well thanks guys this has been a tough one to make but i hope it's been useful i'll see you next", "A4ByyUmZT28": "so how do you know if you've got the right grind size you can only tell if you have the right grind size by extracting espresso it's a combination between dose amount particle size and tamp pressure so we'll show you how to do that today we're just going to grind some coffee now so if ground our coffee now we're just going to collapse in tamp in the filter basket i tamp with about 15 kilos of pressure and i use a cap on the tamper as a guide to dose just wipe the top of the basket and the lugs insert the handle and brill mmediately one of the key guides to whether you've done a good job of grinding dosing and tamping is if you see around about 11 or 12 seconds on the shot clock before espresso starts to flow and you can see from the rate of flow of the espresso that the pores are nice and straight the color is quite dark and the flows not running away but it's not choking up and dripping at the same time so you can see we've done a pretty good job of our dosing and tamping so what if your espresso flow is not perfect there's only two elements that can affect it let's see the dose or grind size I suggest that you focus on getting the dose right first it's one of the most complex elements but it's pretty easy to solve just make sure that each time you dose your portafilter at the top of the cap that's on the tamper is level with the top of the filter basket after you attempt if you hold that particular reference point every time you dose then you only need to adjust the grind size so once you've now the dose all you need to do is adjust the grind if your espressos flowing too quickly that means you need to meet the grind finer make a small change in their grind holding dose constant and extract espresso if it's still flowing too quickly make a further change and repeat this process until you get the right rate of flow on the flip side of that if espresso is flowing to it slowly all you need to do is make the grind coarser make a small change extract another espresso and assess the rate of flow if it's still too slow take it further adjustment and repeat until you get the right rate", "U6z-3ADmH7M": "welcome to mid-south flavor I'm J today we've got a little product review we're going to take a look at this meat grinder attachment for the KitchenAid mixer I have never owned a meat grinder but this company I believe that pronounced genome they offered to send me this meat grinder attachment that works with a KitchenAid mixer so today we're gonna unbox this take a look at it and then we're gonna see how well we can grind up our own hamburger meat now we've got the food pusher cleaning brush and here is everything else so we'll toss this decide now this is a stainless steel attachment unlike some of the cheaper plastic ones so yeah this one feels pretty nice this also comes with the sausage stuffing tools so we can make our own sausages sometime and in this little envelope we have the grinding plates and the grinding blades and of course we have our instruction manual if I'm taking all of this out of the box everything feels to be very good quality I like the feel of this for sure it's got a really heavy weight to it now the little plate up here it is very thin and very lightweight so yeah it does not feel near as heavy as this other parts do even the sausage stuffing tubes feel heavier than this does so that is the only thing that feels cheap when it comes to this however I figure it will do the job just fine you probably don't need anything heavy for this this does come with three different plates for grinding here is the coarse one that it comes installed with it the blades are already installed in here as well then we have a little bit smaller grinding plate here and then our fine grinding plate so yeah I'll just leave this coarse one in it to begin with then we'll try that before we get started testing all this out the first thing we're going to do is wash this clean this and then we'll get it installed on here and see how it works completely the assemble the disassembled food grinder attachment recommend and Worf not dishwasher safe we have all the parts all washed and cleaned up we're not going to be using in the sausage stuffing attachments today we're just going to be focusing on the meat grinding and so we're fixing to see how it attaches to here this is the first time that I've done this so yeah we're gonna be learning together here see how easy that it really is first we take this is just called the ground worm and then install it into the body so yeah what'd you just go right in here the parts sticking out is what will attach to the kitchenaid next we install them blade and install it with the sharp side out next is the grinding plate and as far as I can tell it doesn't matter which side goes in or out we're starting with the course with the larger holes so we'll install that over the blade you'll see there is a little notch here on the side that's what the grinding plate sets into next we install the locking ring [Music] and we should be ready to mount it to the kitchenaid first things first we want to make sure the kitchenaid is unplugged before we install this meat grinder we're going to start by lifting this mixer part and removing all of the attachments here and removing the bowl now we've got open the front of the KitchenAid mixer so unscrew this screw pull this out and here we go it should fit in right here once it's in there it's got a little pin here you can tighten it back down now it's locked in here it's good and tight now we stall our food tray and I think we're pretty much good to go it was easy make sure and hang on to your cap you don't want to lose that so we're gonna place this over here to the side we're just gonna go ahead and use the mixing bowl that comes with this that we can catch the meat into so yeah let's see how this works for grinding some meat today we have some chuck roast that I've already cut up it's been in the freezer so it's really cold it's not frozen but it is cold from what I have read these things will heat up the meat so you want to start with really cold meat so yeah I've cut these up into small manageable sizes but this is just a chuck roast that I picked up from the grocery store the KitchenAid is plugged back up so let's see how this goes turn it on on the side keep your hand away from that little thing because that could hurt does this thing say what speed we're going to start this on the number-four setting on the KitchenAid so here we go my food pusher just drop this down in here so far so good okay that's the first pass and we have some freshly ground hamburger meat this is very coarse right now so we're going to change the grinding plate and make it a little bit finer so yeah but overall this looks really good alright the plate has been changed to the next smaller size so we're going to load this back up in here see how this works [Music] with this second pass it looks a lot better but it still isn't quite where we want it so we are going to go down and put the next smallest size plate on and go for a third pass definitely looking more like hamburger meat now all right we're ready for one more pass [Music] all right we are finished with this and it looks good it's a lot finer now so yeah there's kind of what it looks like so now we have our freshly ground hamburger meat so this will make great burgers out of we may try that later when I'm in this video this was just to review this mixer attachment and I'll have to say I'm pretty impressed with it and I think it worked great this is my first experience really with a meat grinder I think it went well you can install it on this easily so yeah I think this is a win if you're interested in one of these the price isn't bad at all I'll leave a link to it down in the description below this video so now we're going to back up this hamburger meat so we can make something with it later to clean this I actually put the coarse plate back in it and I've heard that this will work to clean this out easier we're going to put bread in this it can work any brave just so happen to have some extra hot dog buns so we're going to see if this will clean out the meat here we go there we have it so yeah it cleaned out pretty much all of that meat from it just a little bit stuck on here but yeah now we have some breadcrumbs and some meat mixture here so anybody any of this that seemed to work it'll make cleanup a lot easier I believe so there you have my review of the ki Nome a meat grinder attachment for the KitchenAid mixer thanks for liking commenting and

it a caviar just the way it's prepared and the final look of it will resemble a lot from caviar let's see what we need to make it i have 3 pounds of creamini mushrooms you can use any mushrooms of your choice including wild mushrooms 2 pounds of tomatoes i have roma tomatoes since i find them the most meatiest and the most flavorful one pound of onions i have three medium onions we also gonna need five cloves of garlic one pound of carrots i have about four medium sized ones as far as the spices i'm gonna use one teaspoon of ground coriander one bay leaf and i'm gonna use one bunch of fresh dill and also two tablespoons of salt one tablespoon of black pepper three tablespoons of olive oil 2 tablespoons of white vinegar and optional 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil if the mushrooms are too large we need to cut them in half because later we need to run them through the meat grinder and they have to fit through the opening in the meat grinder then we're going to put them in the pot and we're going to add some cold water just to cover the mushrooms and we're gonna put it on the stove to boil after the boil process have started uh you need to remove that foam that appears on on the surface and we're gonna boil mushrooms for about 10 minutes then we're gonna drain them but do not wash them because we want to preserve as much mushroom taste as we can and reserve about one cup of that mushroom broth because we might need it now out of this roma tomatoes we're gonna prepare a tomato puree but first i'm gonna discard the seeds and there's a specific reason why i'm doing that you need the seeds primarily in the sauces but since we want our mushroom caviar to be less watery i am going to remove the seeds also remove the pits from the tomatoes and cut them in quarters so it would be easier for us to run it through the food processor blend tomatoes in a food processor until they turn into a puree and i have this little tiny one which i absolutely love it's quite a helper in my kitchen then we need to chop three onions and it doesn't have to be a quite fine chop since everything is gonna get run through a meat grinder so just roughly chop three onions and then we need to cube four carrots and it doesn't have to be a fine cube like they would teach you in the culinary schools they just have to be cubed roughly because once again everything is going to get run through a meat grinder and the cubes we need so at the end this product looks like a caviar we also gonna mince five cloves of garlic and you can use a garlic press or you can use this tool i'm using which is called garlic rocker and i love this tool because just minces garlic so fine and it's easy and you don't have to do a lot of cleaning add about three tablespoons of olive oil to a large uh frying pan and i'm using just a regular olive oil not the extra virgin one since it has a little bit higher smoking point then we're gonna add our chopped onions and as soon as they get a little bit softer we're gonna add our carrot cubes we're just gonna saute this mash until it becomes the carrots become a little bit softer but kind of al dente and to help them to to sweat out we're gonna add just a teaspoon of salt and a little bit of pepper then take it off the heat and let it cool a little bit and here comes a meat grinder and i'm sure you guys have one in your house even if it's the old-fashioned one we need to put our cooled mushrooms in the meat grinder and we're gonna grind them but not a fine grind and look it already starts looking like a caviar at least i think so then we need to grind our carrots and onions and let's say you guys don't have a meat grinder i think the food processor sir would work you will just not get this kind of like grainy texture to your caviar it's gonna be a little bit smoother but i would use the pulse function on your food processor then what we just ground gets loaded into a pot it's quite a large pot so we're just gonna put the mushrooms the onions and the carrots in there and also pour our tomato puree we're gonna mix everything and we're gonna add our spices and as far as the spices i only use in one teaspoon of ground coriander and one bay leaf then we're gonna add one tablespoon of salt and also about a teaspoon of freshly ground black pepper then i remember i told you to reserve a little bit of that mushroom broth we're just gonna add about a tablespoon so it's not too dry then we're gonna put it on the stove to cook for one hour and we're gonna stir it occasionally in about 45 minutes we're gonna check on it and it's looking good if your caviar is going to start looking dry you can add another tablespoon of that mushroom broth that we reserved and at 45 minute cooking mark we're gonna add the fresh garlic the minced garlic we're gonna mix it together and continue cooking it for another 15 minutes then turn off the heat and we're going to two tablespoons of plain white vinegar vinegar here is added for the taste and mainly for preservation if you would just uh preserve it for a long time and also we're gonna add our freshly chopped dill then you're gonna taste your caviar if you're happy with the taste don't add any more salt and pepper and if it tastes a little bit under seasoned then just add to your taste and also as a finishing touch after the caviar had cooled down a little bit we're gonna add two tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and that's mainly for taste if you decided to preserve your caviar you're gonna need jars so wash them with hot water and dry them very well and we're also gonna have some stickers and i always have fun making stickers for my uh preserves so i am just gonna write on one mushroom caviar and um after we um put our caviar in the jars we can paste the stickers on them then you need to open a jar and i'm gonna use a fennel that i use for um fruit preserves like jams and strawberry preserves it has a little bit larger opening so it's easier to put things in the jars using that fennel we're going to put our caviar then we need to tap so it settles a little bit so we can put a little bit more the reason i'm doing that i want all the air out um it will help your um caviar to stay fresh in the jar and while it's still hot we need to turn it upside down and that pushes all the air out from the jar and of course when you would open it after it's been preserved you just need to let the air out like you would do in any jar should we taste our caviar and you would serve it on a piece of crusty bread and i'm using the french baguette or you can use the black bread that would normally we would eat this caviar with and we're just gonna open the jar and before that i let the air out with just the tip of the knife and we're gonna taste our mushroom caviar and it tastes so good in russia we call this type of spread zakuska which means it goes very well with vodka okay i didn't just say that but it does i hope you enjoyed this video guys and i hope you like the recipe thank you so much for watching please like and subscribe and i will see you soon bye", "7YZb7ZmnRHI": "  Oh!

talking about ink and what do you need to know it's you need an ink stick called Sumi and you need an ink stone called Suzuki the ink stone is basically just like ink stone what you want to have is that it has a well to put the water in there or to hold the ink and it has a surface over here to grind the stick into the surface here to make the ink this doesn't have to be expensive it doesn't have to be fancy this is just a plain one not too big not too small if you're not using if you're not grinding an ink stick to make ink you can basically just have a plastic bowl to hold the ink but if you wanted to practice traditionally when you're grinding the ink into the stone we will talk about that later you want to have one of these things and the ink stick what you need to know about it it basically is it's ink made out of soot by burning different types of wood they put it together with some binding agents and it dissolves in water so when you put the water on the stone and you grind it that's how the ink comes to be there's another option that you have it that is to buy bottle ink and so you can see I have a big bottle because I use these a lot and this this helps because it saves you time from grinding it's also more consistent because the the entire bottle has the same thickness and the same dark color it's not a lot it's not too light it's not too dark and mostly I just use it because it saves time that's the main reason when you're doing a lot of a lot of practice sessions and you only have a certain amount of time in your day you may not want to spend 15-20 minutes grinding the ink stone the ink stick into the stone but having said that there's a purpose for using the doing the stick into the stone and that is because it the process has to be a slow process where you grind in the the ink running the stone until the ink kind of like forms and there's a mental preparation to that there's a there's a concentration when all you're doing is just grinding and making the ink and then that sort of kind of relaxes you it gives you like a 15 minutes of just peace and then just developing the ink and that's all you're doing and then you kind of like want to take care of it too because it takes a long time and you know heats up your shoulder to make a little bit of ink so you don't want to waste it and once you make the ink you know it's you're not going to like just brush one or two characters and throw it out like you are going to use it so you end up practicing for a longer session because you want it you want to take advantage of the ink that you grind it because it took you some time some effort to make it so there is a mental preparation to good to do good calligraphy when you do traditionally and you grind the ink the stick into the stone so I I still do it every once in a while when I have when I have the time and I want to kind of like set my mind to the right state to do to do a piece however if I'm brushing if I need a lot of ink or if I'm kind of like don't have a lot of time to brush then you know most of the time I will use the bottle and that's perfectly acceptable so let me show you now how you're going to grind the stick into the stone to prepare the ink okay so here I have my stone in my ink so I'm gonna put that to the side and you need to start with a little bit of water and I'm gonna use just a little bit this much that's it grab my ink and then I'm gonna start grinding the ink stone the ink stick into the stone so you're gonna do this until that water becomes ink and if he goes down the wells fine you can dip the ink stick into it and then keep grinding and you're gonna do this until this water is converted into dark ink once you have it done you're going to start pushing the Inc down the well like this with using the stick and you're going to repeat the process as many times as you need to make as much ink as you need to so I'm going to put a little bit more water and we're gonna grab that stick and do the whole thing all over again so again this can take a little while if you need to prepare a lot of ink and you want to make sure you keep grinding as much as you need to so here we're just gonna keep pushing the ink down the well and once you're done you want to test it out and you want to see if the the ink is dark enough it's not too watery so you're gonna use a brush and do a couple lines on the paper and see if if the ink is basically at the right consistency in the right color so there you have it that's how you make ink to practice Japanese calligraphy or you know that's how you buy ink to make Japanese calligraphy so please feel free to subscribe to the channel more videos are coming up like this where I'm going to be putting some basic techniques for beginners of Japanese calligraphy plus all the things that I like to talk about like Zen and Aikido martial arts and so on and so forth if you haven't check out the website do so the link is gonna be on the description below and that's it and I'll see you in the next one [Music]", "JMh1spHQn5g": "today I am reviewing the Dremel POC control dog nail grinder I have reviewed a couple of other nail grinders that Dremel sells for specifically for grooming purposes but this one is they've kind of remodeled it and taken it up a notch and added some new features that are really specific to dog groomers so as opposed to the other Dremel tools which are kind of an all-purpose tool and can be used for dog nail grooming so I wanted to check this out and see if it was all it was cracked up to be and easier to use than the other products so this has a nail guard you'll see on the top you don't have to have the nail guard on but there are three different settings that you can adjust to and I'll show you up closer in a minute so that you can get the the blade that's in here closer to the paw or closer I should say to the nail or further away so you just adjust it and it goes on closer to the grinder or further away it has a hole right here for the dog toenail and allows you to get the perfect angle and it also catches the dust inside this little cairn container here on the end of the tip of the drill bit so that is really nice to not have that dust flying everywhere this is also a rechargeable tool which is a step up from the other tool this one can be used with a USB charger whereas the other one had a battery that you had to take out and actually put in the battery charger so I thought this was just kind of easier and I say is that step of taking out the battery so let me show you an up close look at this tool and then I will show you how it works on my dog's nails here is my dremel pot control nail grinder up close you can see the tip that I was telling you about in this plastic guard here all it takes is just a quick turn and you can adjust it to the one two or three setting to get it closer to the nail or a little bit further away depending on the length that you want so this is one and it's pretty much rate on the nail file there there's no space but the guard in the file if you want the nails a little longer or you're just a little more nervous about clipping the quick you can have it out extended a little bit more so this part screws on I'm going to take this off first then you just unsnap it and if you don't want to worry about the guard at all you can just use the grinder it comes with nine different attachments here's the flat grinder you can also do that's kind of more of the traditional grinding tool that we see if you want you can switch those out it's really easy to switch they give you a little wrench you just loosen this pop the new one in and then tighten it so super simple to use and then the sliding speed button which I love this is really easy use as you can see one-handed with just your thumb so you don't have to worry if you're in the middle of cutting the guards nails you're holding the PAS with one hands you can use this completely with your thumb the lock button is also here too if you want to make it so that I can't spin for a period of time and then as I mentioned it comes with the charger so it comes with everything that you need some don't come with the wall adapter so it's kind of nice that this one does now I'll take a look and I'll show you how I use it with my dogs and how easy it is here is our chocolate lab Sadie's paws I am hoping that she will let me use this nail grinder with her I have used a nail grinder with her before I prefer Clippers just because it's quicker and Sadie is kind of skittish so she doesn't really like the noise of a grinder so that's something to keep in mind when you're deciding which product to use with your dog if you want information on the types of products to use to cut dog's nails and the pros and cons of each if you click the link below this video you can see a guide on that on our website that's got information about the different styles of Clippers and grinders and which one might be best for your dog but the Dremel paw control has as I mention the rechargeable battery it can fully charge in about three hours and there is an LED light as well we'll come on to notify you when the battery's low the drawback to that is that you cannot use it while it's charging so if you run out charge in the middle of doing your drugs nails you will have to wait until it's charged to use it again I do like the cordless design and I also like as I mentioned the comfortable grip and the slide button that you can use easily with your thumb because it makes it really easy to clip your dog's nails you don't get hand fatigue very easily so if you're a professional groomer or you have multiple dogs like I do and you want to do everybody at the same time this definitely could work for that so I will show you here's with the guard on as I mentioned what you'll do is just hold your dog's nail it gets as I mentioned that 45-degree angle you can easily turn it on grind the nail all the dust stays right in there I think you can see now the dust that's in there just from doing that one tip of Sadie's nail so it keeps all of that doesn't make a mess which is nice if I wanted to I can just pop this off you can see where it's going around on Sadie's nail but you can pop that guard off CD's not super happy about this but she is letting it happen you can do the nail like that you can see a little bit of the dust now floating around so that's the drawback to not using the guard but it is a little bit easier for me I think without it the Dremel pop control nail rounder sells for $49.99 on Amazon if you guys have any questions feel free to email me thanks for watching this video review", "QTyqqEgL1sM": "hey guys and welcome back to Catan Cracker Jacks today I'm going to show you how to make an awesome Italian sub now whether you call these things sub submarines grinders hoagies deli sandwiches whatever you want to call it this sandwich is a fantastic sandwich to make for holidays for get-togethers for picnics or simply just for a good decent lunch so let me show you how to make these now the first thing I'm going to do is get my vegetables ready because every good sub has decent Mount of vegetables so I'm going to use some iceberg lettuce here I'm just cutting off just a little portion of it just enough for one sandwich you don't want to pre-cut all these ingredients because they kind of get soggy anyway iceberg lettuce here I'm just going to use a knife and cut this into fine shreds slices shreds maybe an eighth of an inch now the secret to a good Italian sub is thinly sliced everything and that includes the vegetables on top so just shred this as finely as you possibly can and since I'm kind of particular about my lettuce I'm going to go through and pick out all the the crunchy ribs that are in there I don't like those in my lettuce on my sandwiches so I was up those out next I'm going to get my tomato ready using a knife I'm just going to core this and then I'm going to again slice this into very thin slices about an eighth of an inch max you want to make sure and use a very sharp knife for this and it is best to get a tomato locally that's been locally grown from a farmers market if you have tomatoes in your backyard go ahead and use those you want something with a lot of flavor so you use the best tomato that you can find and then finally I'm going to get my onion ready this is a yellow onion you could also use a white onion or even a red onion if you wanted to again it slices very thinly and only enough slices for one sandwich once I get those sliced up I'm just going to break those rings apart so I have little shreds if you will of onion now for my lunch meats I'm going to start off with some ham this happens to be Black Forest here I've got some hard salami here you could also use Genoa salami prosciutto which is a dry cured ham as well as capocollo which is another dry cured pork product if you will and then for the cheese I'm going to use provolone because every good Italian sub has provolone on it these lunch meats are pretty much standard with all Italian subs for the bread I'm going to use a loaf of bread here you want something that's kind of has a crunch on the outside but is soft and chewy on the inside this happens to be a French bread you could use either French or Italian and using a knife I'm just going to cut this in half lengthwise this is about a foot long or so but depending on what store you go to this could be a French bread or it could be an Italian bread it just depends on what story vo - I don't really know what the difference is if you want to leave the difference or if you guys know what the difference is go ahead with that down in the comment section and I'm going to start building my sandwich on the bottom so on the bottom half of my bread here I'm going to layer up a layer of my onions and use as much or as little onions as you wish on your sandwich I'm going to follow that up with a layer of my tomatoes and just layer those as many or as little as you want just enough to cover the sandwich then I'm going to do a layer of my lettuce again use as much or as little lettuce as you wish I like kind of a lot of lettuce on mine it kind of squishes down in the end so it may look like a lot now it really won't be in the end and I'm going to top this just like every good Italian sub is with salt and pepper this is completely optional but it really does make the difference in a good as sub if you go to a deli a good deli they're gonna salt and pepper their lettuce their sandwich so go ahead and add just a little bit of salt and freshly ground pepper no Italian sub is complete without a sprinkle of oregano so just use dried oregano here and sprinkle some of that on top really it's what makes an Italian sub as well as this oil and vinegar I'm going to take some extra virgin olive oil here and just do a little drizzle right on top of my lettuce and this will actually soak down through the letters through the tomato through the onions and into the bread for the vinegar you want to use red wine vinegar there really is no substitute for the red wine vinegar you can find it at any grocery store it's really not that expensive you know it'll last you forever it's also really good in spaghetti sauce so I suppose if you could or if you wanted to you could use just you know regular red wine but red wine vinegar is the best here and now I'm going to go ahead and build up the top half of my sandwich with the cold cuts I'm gonna start off with my hand here like I said this is black forest ham you could use whatever kind of ham is your favorite if you like honey ham go ahead and use that if you like a smoked ham go ahead and use that black Boris's what I like it's what I had on hand so that's what I'm using I'm going to top that off with the hard salami again you could use Genoa Genoa Genoa we pronounce that salami on top of that I'm going to put on two slices of prosciutto and a little prosciutto goes a long way it's kind of an expensive meat really is no substitute for that and there's also really no substitute for capocollo which again is a little goes a long way you don't need a whole lot for each sandwich one ounce of meat is enough for two to three sandwiches so so go ahead and get some prosciutto in cup of Cola for your sandwich I'm going to top that off with my provolone cheese and then I'm going to flip the meat side on top of my vegetable side it's just a lot easier way to make a sandwich like that then you want to give this a firm press here you don't want to smash everything down but you know make sure that the sandwich is nicely seated together so it doesn't fall apart on you go ahead and cut it in half and then you can go ahead and serve this up with whatever side that you like my favorite is just plain old potato chips just thin-cut Lay's potato chips is the best and there you go there that is how easy it is to make an Italian sub whether you call them subs grinders Huggies submarines whatever they're super easy to make and these really are a great sandwich for the summer I'm nice refreshing it's not heavy it's just a good all-around sandwich so there you go that's how you see is to make the Italian subs I hope you guys enjoy if you give this recipe a try go ahead and leave me a comment down below subscribe for more deliciousness and keep up to date on all my latest videos thanks so much for watching and we will see you next time", "E20kwSJqjdQ": "whoo I gotta tell you I'm glad to get this off [Music] hi everybody I'm Liam CJ drill and I got to ask you I got to ask you this have you been wanting to use one of these tools it's an angle grinder and if you have this is a video you definitely want to watch mistake number one is removing the guard that's what this is here the thing is an angle grinder is a very dangerous tool in fact it may be the most dangerous tool in a workshop right next to the table saw now this guard here this guard is to make certain that you keep these your fingers right it keeps you safe so when this disc is spinning in the tool its spinning at over ten thousand rotations a minute and little chunks are flying at an incredible speed usually at you now that leads the mistake number two the thing these angle grinders you can get an angle grinder easy for under fifty dollars it can be an inexpensive tool but the mistake folks make and or can make is well then they've purchased discs on the cheap you really want to go with a high quality disc a grinding disc it's not like a saw blade a saw blade gets dull a grinding disc it wears down so imagine you buy an expensive disc and it's a composite material chunks are flying off you don't want your disc to fell on you on a tool that's rotating over ten thousand rotations a minute and that's where accidents happen which leads into mistake number three mistake number three is not wearing the appropriate safety gear leather gloves I like the gauntlet stop because it protects my farms hearing protection it does get loud now this may seem like overkill I got to tell you what happens is the air gets full of debris when you're grinding you don't want to breathe that stuff in so wide the shield in combination with the glasses well here's the thing you're up close on an object where debris is full in your face so it's going to protect your face and I got to tell you it can hurt that stuff coming off that disk it can hurt you so I always wear a shield in combination with my eye protection because it protects my face and it gives double protection to my eyes all that personal protection is cumbersome but you got to use it I've seen too many accidents on job sites so where this stuff the next mistake is you don't want to use your grinder around flammables so oily rags anything that could easily catch fire from a spark because as you can see there's a lot of sparks so in closing angle grinder is a great tool you can grind you can cut you can buff and do a lot of things that you can do with other tools in the shop but here's the thing just don't take it lightly it's a it's a serious and can be dangerous tool if you don't use it properly this is alia saying you can do this see you next time", "Y56_hflq-BA": "when it's time to get high go to Goliath throwers Godhead and go to Goliath roars god [Music] what do some you - got a little big for you this is actually a grinder review that I'm doing and it is all thanks to my friends over at Northeast Michigan indoor garden supply they are great they help me out and I need it and they've been doing some of my live shows alright and I'm one of my live shows you saw me I was using this grinder right here I got the thickness grinder up about a year ago this is a tsunami [Music] says premium vapor on it but it's got a little concave [Music] let's open this up so what I've been using it's got all kinds of stuff on [Music] got basically the normal teeth that everybody's been using lately the only difference is its concave it's got a little magnet in the middle all right he's got a pretty decent screen it's got a decent screen yes see that [Music] [Music] does collect keys and it come with like the little blue state water here I'll show you show you what it looks like a brand new person you see this one is worn out put this one back together [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] came wrapped up in this but I'd already taken it out I don't [Music] lies all right this one [Music] brand-new one dreamy one sitting next to as I used up man I used to crap out of this [Music] [Music] super [Music] [Music] [Music] going up to this [Music] [Music] super frosty super sticky all right what you want to do is you don't want to fill that middle in you want to keep that magnet exposed just filling around it break your buns down to little pieces you know you don't ever want to over pack your grinder that causes problems that's about the maximum [Music] I want to open up the bottom and get that stick out first [Music] shiny [Music] all right first run right here that's of course a four-piece grinder oh man that's so smooth [Music] what you want to do is you want to try not to bang it around is this top piece right here even though it's concave it can get oblong shape real quick and real easily just from a drop got it up nice and good what I usually do is I actually put a nickel in there put a nickel in here it sits on top of the steaming that pushes more deep down through it try and keep your stream clean it's all hard to turn super hard turn and squeeze that's for banging it around or dropping in on concrete floor or something but all in all it's good right [Music] I would give it at least a three out of five stars all right four out of five stars it only costs 20 bucks I believe that the Dro star so you should be able to find it for 20 bucks just about anywhere so here it is one more time the tsunami grinder check it out all right [Music] weirdest time to get high go to Goliath throwers Gardena go to the lion roars garden [Music]", "OIXJo-4_2as": "hi guys today I'm reviewing the KitchenAid 6 quart professional 600 stand mixer the mixer is sixteen and a half inches told 11 and a quarter inches wide and fourteen and a half inches deep the cord length is about forty-five inches long it weighs 29 pounds so you probably want to leave it on your countertop or find a spot for it there are thirty colors to choose from this is tangerine it's a beautiful creamy orange the unit is 575 watts and has ten speeds the stainless steel bowl has a handle and whole six quarts included is a burnished metal flat beater used for cakes frosting and cookie dough burnished spiral dough for bread and pizza dough and the six wire wick for heavy cream and egg whites a plastic pouring shield and the instruction manual the burnished metal flat beater and dough hook are hand wash only if you put them in the dishwasher they'll be discoloured and ruined all wire whips are stainless steel and they're hand wash only the bowl is stainless steel and dishwasher safe it would have been really nice if the attachments were plastic coated this way you don't have to worry about discoloration or the extra cleaning there's always gonna be residue on here when you first get the unit and these take more time to clean than plastic coated attachments if you've watched my previous KitchenAid mixer reviews I think you know what I'm gonna say now and it's about the bowl the bowl looks nice and shiny on the outside it's stainless steel it's pretty comfortable to hold the problem is always on the inside there's a lot of residue the black stuff that comes off in your hand if you do with a paper towel you'll see that there's a lot of residue coming off on it this is really something that should be cleaned at the factory with an acid wash I hope you can see all the dirt and the black residue on the paper towel it's really disgusting a lot of people save up for this KitchenAid and other kitchen aid so it's really unfair of KitchenAid not to spend the extra a little bit of money to do the acid wash at the factory so the customer doesn't have to come home and scrub clean this about three times to get all of this off and if you don't do all extra work you're gonna get black residue all over your whipped cream or your butter or your pizza dough and that has happened to me and I know it's happened to many of you I'll wash this bowl a few times and then test this KitchenAid as you can see this KitchenAid is not gonna fit under my kitchen cabinets and I don't think it'll fit under most kitchen cabinets because this is very tall although this mixer is tall the head it does not tilt up like other KitchenAid models so you don't have to worry about the extra height of it tilting up the paint and finishing overall on the KitchenAid is pretty decent but there are a few chips like here underneath the band all around here and here the surface is very rough it's not smooth at all so there's still some quality control issues again for our mixer at this price there really should be no quality control issues this is the bowl lift handle to attach the bowl leave the handle in the down position the tabs on the side of the bowl go right over the pins and the middle part will fit right into this hole put the tabs over the pins and then put both hands on the back of the bowl and push it down take your attachment and slide it straight up the shaft and turn it'll lock over the pin before using the mixer just lift the handle and it'll lock now you can turn the machine on and use it if you're using the pouring shield just put it on the rim of the bowl and you can pour ingredients through the chute the pouring shield is useful when whipping cream or adding flour it'll keep the ingredients from splashing out of the bowl it slides easily and you can position it anywhere the pouring shields can be washed in warm soapy water or on the top rack of your dishwasher after you're done mixing just pull the handle down to remove the whisk push it straight up turn and it'll slide out to remove the bowl hold a handle and go straight up wipe the shaft an entire mixer down with a damp cloth and dry loosen the screw flip up the attachment knob and you can attach one of over 10 KitchenAid attachments back here is the bowl height adjustment screw if any of your attachments are hitting the bottom of the bowl turn the screw slightly counter clockwise to raise and clockwise to lower the bowl before using watch the beater hook and wire wick and I always check to make sure there's no residue left in the bowl by wiping with a paper towel I've watched the bowl a couple of times with a stainless steel scrubby attach the wire whip pull the handle up lock that pour in two cups of heavy cream you want to move the speed gradually to 8 when you're mixing anything always start at a low speed and go up slowly on today's website there is a recipe book and there's also some good tips regarding the correct speed to use for different ingredients this unit sounds very loud that took about three minutes looks good and it looks like the beater did reach to the bottom there's no unwept cream and I don't see any black streaks so I think the bowl was cleaned up pretty well there's no unwept cream on the sides either the bowl is 6 quarts so we can handle a lot more whipped cream than those 2 cups you can see how small the two cups of whipped cream look in this large bowl next we'll make cookies the maximum amount of cookies you can make with this unit is 13 dozen for cookies it's best to go up to speed for attach the flat beater pull the handle up I'll add two sticks of softened butter [Music] a lot of white sugar brown sugar scrape down the sides [Music] it's cream nicely now we'll add eggs one at a time [Music] [Music] the X don't look like they're incorporating well I think the bowl is so big and the paddle doesn't seem to want to pull the rest of the butter and sugar from the sides so I'm just gonna give it a mix could also be because I'm making a standard cookie batter with two cups of flour two sticks of butter since this bowl is so big it might do well with a double batch of cookies just a larger batch none of the eggs are incorporated into the butter and sugar I'll add two teaspoons of vanilla extract I'll add the flour on star speed and move up to two if I need to [Music] now I'll add my chocolate chips and toffee you stir speed [Music] the handle down so did a good job of making the cookie dough like I said I think bigger batches would work better in the six quart Bowl now we'll make white bread put a packet of yeast in the bowl a little bit of milk leave that the dissolve for a few minutes when the yeast is dissolved add the rest of the milk little vinegar salt and sugar melted butter and two eggs the flat beater is already attached I'll give this a mix just done speed to [Music] now I'm gonna mix in five cups of flour on low speed [Music] mix this for two minutes it's been two minutes I'll turn the Machine off I'll take the flat beater off the dough is coming off nicely from the flat beater and there's no unmixed dill on the bottom of the bowl attach the dough hook and I'll mix this on speed 2 for about 10 minutes if the dough is sticky I'll add a little bit more flour [Music] the goal of secure but does move around a little bit it's been 10 minutes the motor head is warm and that's normal the dough comes off easily looks really good beautiful soft dough is gonna make great bread I'll put this into my buttered Bowl roll it around turn it over cover this put it in a warm spot and let it rise until doubled when I use the flat beater it just cleared the bottom of the bowl and that's how it should be but the dough hook has too much space between it and the bottom of the bowl so I'll show you how to adjust it I had to turn the screw counterclockwise all the way as far as it would go so for the flat beater attachment these screws all the way to the right as far as you can go and all the way to the left as far as you can go for the dough hook your mixer might be different depending on how it was adjusted at the factory so you saw how this professional 600 did on the whipped cream cookie dough and bread dough the 2 cups of cream was whipped perfectly with the cookie dough I found it's best to use a larger batch the bread dough was perfect I use 5 cups of flour and the dough came out beautifully the maximum amount of flour you can use in this unit is 13 to 14 cups or eight and a quarter loaves of bread cookies is 13 dozen 10 mashed potatoes is 8 pounds if you make a lot of bread or just baked in general in larger quantities then this mixture would work for you if you want to try this KitchenAid out I've put a link in the description below as always I hope you found this review helpful subscribe for more reviews and I'll see you next time thanks for watching", "l-nSUKZA_zM": "hi I'm Mary Rogers and this is the Cuisinart two-speed handheld blender with chopper attachment and also your chef's whisk so let me show you all the features of benefits of the product first and foremost is the main part of your product which is the handheld blender and you'll notice this all stainless steel in the front and also has a stainless steel shaft the shaft is removed by pressing this little button here and you detach it and then to reattach it you just press it down and it pops right into place this when you detach this you should rinse it in the sink or put it in your dishwasher but when you put it in the dishwasher and my dishwasher fits right in the flatware tray so the other thing I want to mention is you should never ever put your hands anywhere near the blade that's what we have the blade guard on the top and how this works is it actually the food goes in through the bottom and comes out these slits right here and that's what helps to keep incorporating it the other thing is you should never lift from the blade Bart guard portion down you should never lift that above whatever surface you're trying to mix because it will splash around quite a bit and so you should keep that in mind the nice thing about handheld blenders is are very versatile you can do everything from vinaigrettes you can do any type of smoothie drink without ice in it and we recommend what you do is use frozen fruit because that's what will help it keep cold and it won't dilute the flavors and like I mentioned this also comes with a chopper attachment and I'm just going to take this apart so you can see it this is the lid this is the chopping blade and the chopping blade is reversible so you can very carefully twist this so it loosens up and you can actually take the blade off put it back down and that way you can use the sharp side for soft foods and the hard side for things that are hard such as Parmesan cheese or if you wanted to chop up anything that's like nutmeg because nutmegs very hard that works really well for that and this is also really great too because you can make small batches of salsa what I did today was I chopped up some scallions and garlic and cilantro for the salad in advance and I'm going to show you how to make a vinaigrette the other thing I forgot to mention was that this handheld blender is 300 watts you can do lots of different things with it one of the additional things you can do is attack your whisk attachment and you can make whipped toppings you can make meringue you can you could actually mix the vinaigrette in a bowl if you preferred and then toss your salad right into the bowl which is a very efficient way to do it the whisk attachment has a nice balloon shape it's made out of thin stainless steel tines and that's really important to incorporate air into whatever you're preparing because that's what a whisk is for to incorporate air this is your mixing Cup which we're going to use today and you'll notice in the front you have measure markings right here so you have once's and cups and it holds up to two cups its microwave and dishwasher safe has a pour spout here and then the other thing is on the reverse side it has measurements in milliliters up to 500 milliliters so I'm just going to put this like that because we're going to use it in a minute now the one thing I don't believe I talked about is how to actually activate your handheld blender so you'll notice in the front there's two speeds the top one is low the bottom one is high this is made out of like a slip proof plastic it's nice and soft but to activate your handheld blender what you would do is you pick your speed I'm just going to put it in here so you can see it you pick your speed and you're press your speed down then you unlock the unit by pressing this button on the very top and the minute you let go of it it will not activate again and that's a really great added feature for your product so remember you pick your speed and then I'm just going to show you the unlock button that's the unlock button and then you press your unlock button and your unit will start working so let's go ahead now that we've shown you all the things that come with your handheld blender and let's go ahead and make a beautiful vinaigrette so here are some of our ingredients this is the mustard this is whole-grain mustard mustard is an important element when you're making a vinaigrette because it actually helps emulsify and bring all the ingredients together because you have to remember you know you're mixing oil and vinegar which are not easy to incorporate together now what I'm going to do is I'm going to actually add the vinegar first this is more than I need mostly it's like 1/3 vinegar to 2/3 oil or your measure or your basic measurements if you like it a little more tangy add more vinegar then I'm just going to add the oil some salt just a little bit I tend not to add a lot of salt foods and then pepper black pepper now what we're going to do is we're going to actually put it in the mixing Cup we're going to pick our speed I'm going to pick low today and then turn it on so there you go you saw how quickly and easily that came together it's um I actually like to make homemade dressings because they have no preservatives in and I know all the ingredients that are going into my food this is you know a little bit on the thicker side if you like it's thinner you can adjust accordingly then you just pour it right out using your mixing cup and anything that you have left over just put a piece of plastic film wrap on the top and you put it right in your refrigerator to save it for another day so there you have it the Cuisinart handheld blender with mixing attachment and chef's whisk", "bTr84fW7PVc": "hi this is Bogart and today we're going to be reviewing the Space Case two piece titanium coated space grade aluminum grinder this is the medium size with the 2.5 inch diameter with 1 inch depth the Space Case is very lightweight and the teeth are machined well if there are very sharp teeth and they're very durable teeth so when you're gonna grind up your marijuana just make sure that you've removed any stems or seeds or whatever you have put it in there pretty well put the top on close it down and the teeth being very sharp you are gonna have a smooth operation of being it you don't need to grind it many times before it actually grinds it to a smooth consistency it's easy to empty and it fine grinds all of your buds so our overall review of the Space Case grinder is it is a really great grinder it is actually made in the USA it has a lifetime warranty this is the medium sized grinder and this one was purchased for around $25 they do range in price for the smaller ones on down up to the $80 price range for the larger four-piece grinder now this grinder we've had other people tell us that they were very happy with their space case grinders and we'll continue to get back to you guys as we continue to use the space crease finder and let you know if there's anything that happens too in the future is a up front you know it's really great grinder the first 5-10 times we've used it already we've been grinding it for uses and vaporizers and we've been pretty happy with the way it's ground up to marijuana very well so you guys make sure you click the like button leave us your comments especially if you own a space case yourself and subscribe if you haven't already it is free thank you guys for watching [Music]", "AI4ynXzkSQo": "- Today we're gonna be talking about how to brew with the Hario V60. How to get the best results you can through a simple, repeatable technique that will give you a\ndelicious cup of coffee. Now I have designed this technique to work in a cafe as well as at home. To work whether you have\na beautiful pouring kettle or whether you just have a regular kettle. It shouldn't matter. And even if you have your\nown preferred technique and way of brewing, I think there's gonna be\nsomething in this video that you'll find useful to just elevate what you're\ndoing a little bit more. So this video is focused just on the V60 for a couple of reasons. It's quite a different brewer\nto other brewers out there. It is a pure kind of cone shape, unlike say a flat bottom brewer\nor the Melitta style brewers and the brewer itself provides really no resistance whatsoever. Other brewers typically have\nthree sort of small holes that will slow the water as\nit drains out of the cone. So the Hario has a large open area at the bottom of the cone, which means it provides no resistance. For those reasons, I wanted to make a video\njust focused on this, because techniques that work here may not perfectly apply\nto the other brewers. So before we jump into the technique, I wanna run through the list of kit that I would recommend you have on hand before you start brewing. And first and most\nobviously, you need a V60. I like the plastic ones. They're the cheapest, they're really hard to break and they do a great job from a sort of heat retention perspective. Most of the time, I actually use this which\nis the Hario drip decanter, which is a nice glass\nbody and a plastic insert so it's all of the best bits. These are actually pretty cheap now, and I recommend them quite highly. When it comes to filter papers I have made a video previously\nthat are linked down below covering the differences between the sort of Hario filter papers out there. I'd recommend giving that a\nquick watch after this one and you're gonna need a digital scale. Now this thing is gonna make\nyour life 100 times easier. It's gonna make brews more reputable. It's gonna take all the\nguesswork out of it. You want something\naccurate to .1 of a gram, ideally some sort of spoon, teaspoon, soup spoon, dessert spoon, I don't really care,\njust some sort of spoon and you're gonna need\na kettle of some sort. Now my preference is that you\npour the water into the V60 from the kettle that you boil it in. Which means something like this, which is an electric pouring kettle is kind of the best possible outcome. This, a regular electric\nkettle is absolutely fine. It's perfectly good. You can pour from this\nwith no real issues. These things, just\nstraight pouring kettles, they're okay if you're\ngonna heat the water in it, but if you're decanting from\na kettle into one of these, you're gonna lose some temperature and that is gonna affect your brew and then you need coffee beans. Great technique, it's just\ngonna give you transparency on your ingredients. The best technique in the\nworld, beautifully executed but with low quality coffee will just give you a perfectly\nterrible cup of coffee. Now the other ingredient\nis of course water and it's a hugely important ingredient It's gonna make up 98%\nplus of your cup of coffee and it's gonna have a huge\nimpact on the extraction itself. Now what you want basically is good tasting, relatively soft water. In some cases, you can fix it with something\nlike a Brita filter, if your water, it's a little bit hard. In other cases, it might be worth buying bottled water as much as I dislike that idea. It is possible to make\nyour own recipe water with the right combination\nof minerals in there. I will leave some links in the description down below on water if you want to dig in a little bit deeper. Now while this will work\nwith pre ground coffee, I would absolutely recommend\nyou buy a Burr Grinder. On the cheaper end there are\nthings like hand grinders if you're willing to\ndo a little bit of work but these days electric Burr Grinders are pretty approachably priced, they are a fantastic investment\nin how you start your day and will give you that\nextra layer of control to get the best out of\nthe coffee that you buy. So let's get into the technique. Now here I'm gonna recommend a ratio of 60 grams per\nliter or per kilo of water. That's kinda of the point of preference. If you wanna use 65, 70\nor if you wanna use 55, that's entirely up to you. It's not right or wrong. I just think it gives you a nice resulting strength in your cup of coffee. In the example today I'm gonna be brewing\n30 grams to 500 grams, which is enough coffee for two people. I think it's a nice amount to share. Now in terms of grind, I would recommend something that's on the slightly finer\nend of kind of medium. Now, it's really hard to\ncommunicate grand size in a video. I can show you some examples of the ideal grand size\nfor a 30 to 500 ratio, next to say some espresso grounds or next to something for scale but we'll talk at the end about sort of tuning your grind to taste. So you wanna weigh your\nbeans right before you brew and grind them fresh and at the same time you also wanna rinse\nout your filter paper. That will help remove any\npotential papery tastes and it will also preheat the brewer. If you have a plastic V60, then you can probably do that\nwith a really hot tap water, but if you have a glass or\nceramic or even metal V60 I would recommend doing that with the hottest water possible. Add your grounds carefully\nto the center of the V60 and then once you've done that, create a little well in\nthe middle of the grounds. This is gonna be really\nhelpful in the next phase, which is the bloom phase, to make sure that we're evenly saturating all of the grounds. You wanna make sure you're using your water\nas hot as possible. Certainly with lighter roasts. If you're using a pretty\ndark roasted coffee, it's okay to wait 15, 20, 25 seconds after the water is boiled\nbefore starting to pour but if you're brewing\nsomething very light, the hotter the better. So make sure your scale is zeroed, start your timer and\nimmediately start to pour and we're gonna gently pour two grams of water per gram of coffee. So here about 60 grams of water and we wanna make sure that we're trying to get\nall of the coffee wet in that initial phase. If you've got a large\npocket of still dry coffee, you can use more water but I really wouldn't use more than three to one in the bloom phase. As soon as you've added your\nwater put the kettle down and grab your brewer and begin to swirl in a circular motion. Now what we're trying to do here is make sure that all of the water and coffee are nice and\nevenly mixed together. Some people like to do this with a spoon and to stir it together, but in testing, swirling\ntasted much better, and you're gonna keep an eye on the sort of slurry as you swirl, until you see it look\nnice and evenly mixed. If it looks lumpy, keep swirling. We're gonna let it rest and\nbloom for up to 45 seconds. If you're in a cafe, you\nmay only wanna wait 30 as the returns do diminish\na little bit beyond that, and I certainly wouldn't\nwait longer than 45 seconds. The theory is that we're\nallowing CO2 out of the grounds, making those grounds easier to extract in the remaining phase of our brew. And then we're gonna pour\nthe rest of our water in in kind of two phases. Even though it's gonna be\none pretty continuous pour. Here's what we're trying to do. We're trying to get 60%\nof our total liquid in, in the next 30 seconds. So we're gonna aim to\nhave 300 grams in total poured into the V60 by\none minute and 15 seconds. This phase is actually really critical. Now when you pour water into a V60 you disrupt that coffee bed, right? You churn it up a little bit. And it seems to me that in testing, there's a kinda of ideal amount of churn. In situations where you\ndon't disturb the bed at all they've produced very slow brews\nthat didn't taste that good and will encourage you to grind coarser, which will mean you extract less. Pour too aggressively and you create channels and pockets through which water seems\nto run very quickly, essentially, under extracting the coffee and making it taste bad. Here, we do just a\nlittle bit of agitation, but not so much that we\nhave an uneven extraction. Now this means that with a smaller V60, if\nwe're brewing just a one cup and say 15 to 250, you actually want a gentler pour because there's a smaller bed, which is why aiming for 60% gives you a kind of matching flow rate for the dose that you're using. So once you've hit 60% of\nyour total brew weight, you'll see your cone is pretty\nfull and that's a good thing. We want the cone to be full for most of the brew to\nmaintain that thermal mass, keeping the temperature high is actually really, really important. What we're gonna do now\nis pour a little slower and keep that cone topped up. We're gonna aim to have a\n100% of our brew weight in in the next 30 seconds. During this phase we're gonna pour gently. We're gonna pour slowly. If you're pouring with a\nkettle without a pouring spout, it's okay to pulse a little bit. Just try not to pour too aggressively because you will disrupt the coffee bed unnecessarily at this point. Once you get to your total brew weight, pop the kettle down and grab a spoon and give the V60 a little stir in one direction and then a little stir\nin the other direction. What we're doing here is trying to knock off any grounds stuck to the sidewalls of the paper and not create a sort of\nswirling motion that lasts 'cause that'll create a dome in our ground coffee which we don't want. Allow the V60 to drain just a little bit more\nuntil it feels safe to do so and give it one final swirl and that's really gonna\nhelp keep the bed flat. At the bottom at the end of the brew and give you the most\neven possible extraction. But now we're into the draw down and the draw down is a really interesting phase of this brew. Lots of different factors\nwill affect your draw down and they're not always\nwhat you would think. One of the most surprising\nfor me was temperature. In brewing identical brews, side by side with 95 Celsius\nand 85 Celsius water, the draw down in the cooler\nbrew took 30 seconds more. Not only did this taste\nworse, it was a waste of time. So that's why I'm not a huge fan of taking water from a hot water source and putting it into a cold pouring kettle. I think often about\ncafes, I see doing this. This is just a waste of the baristas time and the customers time. If we brew hotter, we brew faster. As I mentioned before, the paper that you use will have an impact on\nyour draw down time. My preference is always\nfor the faster papers. It doesn't have a massive\nimpact on extraction if your paper slows your\ndraw down a little bit. Most of the brewing is\ndone at this point already. It doesn't taste quite as\ngood as a faster paper to me, but your results may vary. So one more quick thing. Most of V60 videos will tell you not to pour directly onto the paper. You've always got to pour into the coffee or into that kind of slurry. They'll tell you this, because they say that if\nyou pour on the paper, the water goes through the paper, misses the coffee and you dilute your coffee\nand it'll make it taste bad. This is not true. In my testing, I poured\nsolely on the paper. I aimed to miss the\ncoffee for the entire brew and what happened is that the water just ran\ndown the side of the paper, and in doing so it didn't\ndisturb the coffee bed at all. In fact, it resulted in the single longest draw down of any brew that I had and as a result, a slightly higher extraction\nthan the other brews, but it tasted really bad. Now, the end when the\ncone has fully drained out what you wanna see is a\nnice flat bed of coffee. There will always be some\nfine pieces of coffee stuck to the edges of the walls. They will not come off but there should be no\nlarge pieces of coffee left. It should've all fallen into the middle. Throw that paper away, drink\nyour coffee, and enjoy it. And I would recommend for the most part, changing your extraction solely\nthrough changing your grind. If you find that coffee\nto be empty, hollow, a little acidic and\nunpleasant, go a little finer. In fact, most of the\ntime keep pushing finer until you hit this sudden wall of bitterness, harshness and astringency. At that point, you've gone too far and you do want to come\nback a little bit coarser but when you come back that little bit, you are kinda of at the maximum extraction for your grounder, for your setup, for your coffee, and it should taste really, really great. This is my ultimate technique. This is what works the best for me. I really like the results from it. I'm not saying other\npeople's techniques are wrong or that there's nothing to learn from them but I think there's lots\nhere that is hopefully useful to improve the coffee\nthat you make every day. Let me know your thoughts\nin the comments below. I'll say, thank you so much for watching and I hope you have a great day.", "F5mBOGte5Zo": "if you love to bake you need a stand mixer it's hard work to need heavy wet bread dough by hand or mix thick cookie dough but stand mixers are expensive they're up in the hundreds of dollars so how do you decide which one to invest in which size do you need which of all the fancy features are important which mixer can handle it when you're doing a huge amount of holiday baking that's where we can help we bought nine stand mixers price from 230 to a stunning eight hundred and fifty dollars we set up a series of tests based on the three major functions of a stand mixer whipping cream and kneading now along the way we kept note of the features and functions of the mixers that helped us out are the ones that annoyed us to death now after paying all that money you should be getting a stand mixer that can do anything you need it to so first we whip the very smallest amounts to egg whites one cup of cream and a few of these mixers failed their very first test their whisk attachment just couldn't reach quantities that small and nothing happened and when we whipped two cups of cream most models did a little better because the whisk could then reach the liquid when we whipped four egg whites while adding hot sugar syrup to make meringue and that was interesting for instance it was absolutely no fun to try to pour hot syrup into the tiny chute on the splash guard of this model by Vollrath it dribble down the chute it hardened up and it was a huge pain to clean off why not just slide it open and skip the tiny chute that shuts off the machine as a safety feature this is a commercial model it's scaled down for home use but it weighs more than 40 pounds and with these industrial safety features it's just not worth getting especially for $850 now the best models at whipping had a good whisk to bowl relationship so food didn't stay out of reach just look at this whisk from our favorite with twenty four tines bent out at almost right angles it can really snug up to the bowl sides and bottom we also liked the rounder wider bowls these tall v-shaped bowls sometimes let liquid pool at the bottom out of reach next we creamed butter and sugar for cookie dough and cake batter now this testing uses the paddle attachment the mixers that succeeded had a few things in common now first like the whisks is important for this attachment to be able to really get it everything in the bowl so it's shape and position in relation to the bowl is important some of these made us spend a lot of time scraping dough off the size of the bowl now this one by Breville has a silicone scraper attached to the paddle which is a real time-saver because you never have to stop and scrape second look at the shape of the branches inside these paddles see the Z shape it trap dough in the corner so ingredients just went for a ride instead of mixing the gentle curves of this style of paddle didn't trap dose everything mixed thoroughly now at this point we also noticed a few other things we likely didn't first the splash guards now we really liked the open sea shape better than ones that attach to the mixer this was a huge pain because you forget to put it on before the attachment then you'd have to take the attachment back off to put it on it was a real pain that open sea just pops on and off as needed we also like shoots that were nice and wide when you want to add food to the bowl as you're working now Bowl handles they're more important than you think this big vertical handle gives you great leverage like when you're dividing cake powder between two pans teensy little horizontal handles on big heavy bowls or hard to hold and the bowl just swings while you're trying to dig out the batter on the bottom to test how well these mixers need we made a wet sticky pizza dough we used a recipe that calls for a high ratio of water so that's literally impossible to knead by hand and this was a real eye-opener a few the models including this Breville that was formerly a front runner completely choked this thing got hot it shook it slowed down and it stalled out a backup copy did the same thing and ever after it started making horrible grinding noises now look if a stand mixer can only whip and cream the easy stuff there is no reason to spend hundreds of dollars buy a good hand mixer our favorite one of those is just fifty dollars now often you see claims of mixers with high horsepower but sheer horsepower isn't everything it comes down to torque which is the rotational force the motor can apply our favorites clearly had more torque because they were able to move that dough around the bowl and even our smallest and cheapest mixer this four and a half quart kitchenaid classic plus could need much better than the bigger expensive ones that clearly had less torque which made us think about capacity stand mixers are sold by size and ours are four and a half quarts to 7 quarts we wanted to push the envelope and really find out their actual maximum capacity so we made double batches of the pizza dough and guess what a smaller mixer could handle it bigger ones struggled and why because those sizes are based on the total volume of the bowl right up to the rim but if the top of the attachment hangs very low down in the bowl the way some of these do that shrinks your actual usable capacity so don't judge a mixer by its stated size now finally has an abuse test of the motor strength we made a really stiff dry bagel dough and again some of the motors really struggled and the machines lurched around the counter we had to keep stopping and breaking up the dough to get it engaged again with the dough hooks in the end we had two favorites both by KitchenAid the KitchenAid 7-quart Pro Line series and the KitchenAid four and a half quart classic plus so we did a final faceoff making ten pizza dough's ten batches of bagel dough in each one right in a row with cool down breaks between batches and that's where we got our top winner after ten pizza dough's and six bagel dough's the tilt head mechanism on the smaller kitchenaid classic plus got out of alignment and broke although we found that its motor kept working fine if we just held it down the larger 7-quart Pro line trucked right on through to the end no struggle so our new favorite is the kitchenaid seven quart proline stand mixer Singh had it all a powerful motor with plenty of torque to keep up for the toughest kneading a wide generous Bowl in well shaped attachments that don't miss a drop had that great C shaped splash guard that pops on and off in a flash and the big vertical handle on the bowl that gives you great leverage now at $549 it's an investment but one that we think is worthwhile if you want to spend less our Best Buy is the KitchenAid four and a half quart classic plus at $230 it's a compact basic mixer with the stamina of a much bigger more pricey

My name is Dan Delavan. I am the Owner/Operator of Plaza Cutlery in\nCosta Mesa, CA. We have a great selection. We also have a website; plazacutlery.com. Today we are going to be talking about knives. A sharpening stone is a stone that has got\na coarse side and usually a finer side, and that is going to take and re-shape your edge\nand get it back down thin enough in order to sharpen it. You are basically taking something that is\nblunt and thinning it back down. You have to remove all of this extra metal\nand get it back down to where it is thin enough to cut. Very simply, all a knife is is a very thin\npiece of steel to split whatever you are cutting. If the knife is obviously thicker, it is like\ntrying to cut something with a chisel; it is not going to happen. There are two stones. There is the India and there is the crystolon. Once you feel them, obviously the difference\nis coarseness. The one thing about the India stone, it is\na harder stone and the brown is the finer side, you have to use oil with it. You cannot use it dry, so therefore it is\nmessy. The coarse stone will cut the metal off quicker\nbut it is going to give you a rougher edge but that way the job gets done quicker, without\nthe oil. It is not as messy. This is just a real simple set up. If you do wood work you can make a little\nwooden box and rout it out. In this particular case it is just a 2x4,\nstone traced out, finishing nails tapped down so they are deeper than the stone so when\nyou drop the stone in, if you are at a workbench you can C-clamp it down in place or you can\nhold on to it. So you are going to start at the heel and\nyou are going to time it so that it goes all the way across. You go from one side to the other. You also want to make sure that your stone,\nI am not going to use as much pressure as I normally would because I cannot mount it\non this showcase, you want to alternate from side to side to keep your bevel centered. Some people will take and do three times on\none side and then three times on the other, the problem is that your backhand is never\nas good as your forehand and you end up cheating and you are going to end up with a blade that\nis offset. That is going to take it and thin down, you\nare going to get a thin bevel right on the edge. Once you get that V established, you can go\nfrom the coarser side to the finer side. It is the same thing; you want to alternate\nfrom one side to the other. Just keep working it until it smooths out. Usually it does not take quite as long on\nthis side because you are just smoothing it out. As you go through the finer stones, if you\njust choose to do that you are just polishing.

Skiz fernando your roving gastronomic and I'm about to take you behind the scenes the mccurry spice factory where curry literally comes from we strategies between popular versions 1985 from the first day I am here so mainly we start with the right spice processing operations right that means re mixes backgrounders and continents all those things okay after later on we introduce very create products like packing gas jumper that somehow those Walker which resembles muscle team those things that from now we have a limited special so we wanted to expand so we built other factory in double

"hey i'm mike finnegan host of Finnegan's garage and roadkill and today I want to go air compressor shopping with you guys now here's what you need to know when you're buying a compressor first things first be honest with yourself what are you really going to use this compressor for is it gonna be occasionally used in your home garage just to fill the tires on your hot rod or are you gonna be running air tools as you sand down the entire body of your car this is important because some of those tools can consume a lot of air and the more air they consume the larger tank you're gonna need the more horsepower you're gonna need and ultimately the more input voltage you're gonna need to run that compressor so let's talk about electricity most houses you're in your home garage you have 120 volt outlets throughout that's no problem those are the things powering the light bulbs in your garage very few of them have 230 or 240 volt outlets those are the kind of things that power your clothes washer got a washroom your garage you can unplug it you can plug in a larger compressor you can also have a certified electrician come to your house and rewire outlets in your garage to add more power again more power bigger compressor better tools you can run now the next thing you need to think about is how much space do you have in your garage and how much noise can you make before you anger your neighbors and that's important because a lot of compressors make a lot of noise and in general an oilless compressor or a single stage compressor that thing can make upwards of 90 or 100 decibels and what is ninety or hundred decibels that's a loud car going by so if you plan to work late at night you need to make sure you can position that compressor in your garage where it's gonna be muffled a little bit while still having a lot of free air around it thank you there are compressors out there you can buy that have wheels on them they're very portable you know if you've got jobs at the front of the garage or outside of the house or you're gonna help out your neighbors you might want to look at a compressor with wheels on it the one thing you need to think about though is that in general if a compressors got wheels on it it's portable but it's not as large as one that's meant it on the ground that one there has a sixty gallon air intake it's perfect for running high-volume tools like a dual action sander or a grinder that sort of thing the kind of tool you'll use for long periods of time that eats up a lot of air that is not portable you need to set it down you need to bolt it down you make sure it's positioned properly it has the proper input voltage and that thing is a workhorse it's gonna do anything in your garage you need so let's talk about applications for an air compressor there's two guys I think at home right now there is a kind of guy who's gonna work all the time on cars and you're gonna use tools like this this is a six-inch random orbit palm sander this is about 15 CFM of air this is a three inch cut off tool this at full song will eat up 31 CFM of air which is a lot what does that tell you you need as much reserve tank and as much compressor power as you can afford if you're a guy who's at home and you're probably only filling up tires or your kids pool toys or you have the patience of a monk you don't need a ton of compressor because what ends up happening is when you use this tool you're gonna stand a bit and then you're gonna stop because this thing's not going to run very efficiently you're gonna wait for that compressor to fill up the air tank and then you can keep going like I said if you're super patient you don't need a monster compressor but if you're gonna hurry or you want to work efficiently or you're gonna use tools like this buy as much tank and as much compressor as you can afford so you know what tools you're gonna be running and you know how much air each tool consumes choose the right compressor you should add up the CFM requirements of each of those tools assuming you and your buddy are gonna work at the same time in the garage and then add thirty percent to that number that'll tell you exactly how much compressor you need well you picked out the compressor it's at home it's ready to go to work you've got brand new air tools let's not screw this up by picking the wrong fittings in the wrong hose these two fittings right here have the exact same thread size but they have a radically different orifice ease and if you choose the small one and you choose the small hose your half inch drive impact gun may not take the lug nuts off your truck and the reason for that is the longer your hose and the smaller the diameter the less air pressure you have coming into the tool good example of this you have 90 psi coming out of your air tank you feed it through this 3/8 hose and this tiny fitting when you go and pull the trigger on your air pack gun you don't have 90 psi anymore you know about 75 but pick the bigger fitting upgrade to a half inch hose and you can adjust your regulator and get full air pressure to make that tool work the way the manufacturing kit let's talk applications let's say you're at home and you're just gonna put some air in the tires on your car maybe do a home renovation project you don't need a giant air compressor to do that a three gallon air tank a one horsepower engine maybe a pancake style air compressor it's perfect for you you want to do a little more than that Campbell Haas field makes quiet six and eight gallon air compressors that'll do a lot of jobs if you are really serious about working on cars like I am you need a monster compressor to do that job let's say you're gonna work on an orbital sander an air drill you know lug nuts all those different jobs maybe you're running more than one tool at once because your buddies are over that one there is perfect that's a 60 gallon air tank that's a single-stage engine that puts out over three horsepower this thing will make over 10 CFM at 90 psi and if you crank it up to 135 psi which is its max output it still makes over 9 CFM of airflow this thing is amazing when shopping for a compressor there's two specs you want to focus on the first one is psi that stands for pound per square inch that's a measurement of the force of air coming out of the compressor that's important but not nearly as this next spec CFM that stands for cubic feet per minute that is a measurement of the volume of air coming out of you the higher the CFM the more efficient your compressor is and the better your air tools will operate so get as much CFM as you possibly can whenever you shop for a compressor here's what you need to be careful there is CFM and there's s CFM SCFM is corrected to atmospheric conditions that number will always be higher than CFM so when you're looking at air tools you want air tools that consume as little air as possible so when you're comparing apples to apples all the tools you look at when you're shopping need to have an SCFM rating for instance you look at two palm Sanders from two different manufacturers one may say it only consumes 4 CFM it sounds great right wrong you look at the other tool it says it consumes 30 s CFM well when you correct the first one that only had 4 CF an American sumption it may actually be more than the one that had 30 everything has to be standard okay so shop look for SCFM you'll know exactly what you're comparing a lot more information go to Campbell hostel comm to find out about all of these awesome tools and if you want to see more of what I'm doing in my garage go to youtube and search for Finnegan's garage", "nuIXRM-SXFE": "hey guys Jackson legend and today I will a minecraft redstone tutorial in this week's tutorial I'm gonna be showing you guys how to make a spider spawn a farm so let's go and have a look at it did you do headed down my ladder through my farm now you will of course will need a regular spice one this does not work for a case but just pointing that out but if you would like to see a case by to spawn a tutorial make sure to leave a comment down below so down here we have our spider spawner spiders here that would we have sat in our way of caring for a bit and they have sort of clogged up there and now if we grab a sword out of our inventory we can whack them you'll see they'll start to die and they will then we'll get their XP and their drops will go into our hopper just like that then this hopper will lead into our chests here you can see I've got quite a few drops from hitting it for a little while so this isn't the best XP farm I definitely recommend making Enderman farm if you're doing that but for it is a really good XP farm for when you're starting off and it is super useful to get loads of string and spider eyes for persons okay so let's close this up and head to our redstone flat world see you guys there okay I'm now in my super-awesome redstone flat board and you can see behind me we have the spider farm now it is a pretty simple design this is all above ground but I will be showing you guys how to go underground book in the tutorial but this is all above ground so you can see the sort of redstone behind it which there isn't any but there is some mechanisms going on here we have a water column to push up the spiders to the killing chamber and then some fence gates to stop the water flowing back into it and that's about it so now if you stand on this um block here you can attack the spiders without any issues say this and you'll get a load of XP if you've got sleeping edge and there are quite a few here so on this sword right here I've got sharpness fives looting three and sleeping edge three you can see I'm getting a load of things and quite a few of it is going into a chest and I am picking up a few odd blocks you can see there is an odd chance of a spider spawning I mean the skeletons on it like a 1% chance but you want to base you want to try and kill those straightaway because sometimes if you get three in there they can clog up the system but now that you've seen that farm in action let's hop into the tutorial world okay I'm back in the earth war now back from my register and land and you can see that I found a spider spawner now this like I said before only work for a regular spider so key spiders are going to be slightly different because they can walk through half slab blocks and they're smaller but to start you want to find out find your spider spawner and remove all the chests around it and place torches service spiders don't spawn then you want to make sure there's a three block gap between the spawner and the ceiling then you want to dig out so there's a full block gap between this arm spawn and the war so one two three four like this and do this on all sides and then down make sure it's four like this on two three four three four blocks between the floor and the spider spawner week I'll come back to a cup until all once I've finished that and then we'll move on to the next bit oh and while I'm digging this out I thought I would like to mention that spiders can spawn mid-air so you might want to build a few pillars like these yeah and placing play some torches on them because otherwise of spiders might spawn where you're  out where it might be a bit darker okay back to digging okay you can now see that I've dug out this area and I've got multiple pillars to show you how far away they should be so this orange here shows you that it should be four blocks away from the sides one two three four and then I've got another one here and then from the corner it should also be four one two three four and then from from the ceiling it should be three one two three and from the bottom it should be one two three four my box messed up there let me just quickly fix that so one two three four from the bottom just like that so now I'm just gonna break all these you can play some blocks sort of like this if you want to count but I just need to quickly play some torches so these don't spawn and then we can get ready to start building just like that okay you want to start by grabbing any sort of blocks I'm just gonna use a block above this so starting in creating a three high pillar going straight up like this so that the spiders do not spawn directly on top of the spawner and get stuck there because that is super annoying now once you have done that you want to come to the side that you want to kill your spiders from so I'm gonna be having it on this side here and go to the center and dig out three like this one two and three so you have a center one and one on each side like this just like that and then dig three down here as well then drop into that hole and dig out this layer here and one layer above that so you should have a 3x3 thing here but the last row is in the ground and then you shape two here like that now you want to step on to this block here and dig another four blocks in one two three four and then do this on all sides like this just fully dig that out so you should have something that looks like this now you also dig out this top row here just like that so you should have something that looks like this okay so now you want to grab out three water buckets my bad you'll need one more three birch fence gates and three regular signs you can use any type fence game iPad or any sign so now you want to place three signs are straight across this row here one two and three now you have to you don't have to put anything in these but you can but make sure they're all along here and on this bottom road like that then walk two blocks back for me at one two and then directly in front of you place three birch offense gates like this and open them like that or you can open them the other way then place three water pockets directly behind the signs just like that sir yep signs walk through fence gates through it water vent fence gates just like that so this is what it should look like okay so now you need to grab out some water you'll probably need nine buckets of it if you want to make it super easy or you can make a arm sort of water source nearby nine fence gates and three trap doors okay start by coming to the sides one block in front of them so stem like in this water source iam I can push and dig directly upper one then dig that right to the very back like this so it's one block up above the fence gates is not dug out but these ones are then place to fence gates on top of these ones here by holding shift and placing two on every single one of these and opening them all just like that then hold shift and place a fence gate behind there and open it and then you want to place a trap door no matter what the rotation is so you can place it like this way so to rotate it that way or this way or the other way but it doesn't matter just place three trap doors close that are closed going straight across the top here like that now go about some water you want to place three here one two three and then you want to fill this up using the rest of your water and the best way of filling it up is going one two three there now on the other side one two three just like that so that should use your nine your nine water buckets because you've got three here and three here that's six and three across at the top that's nine so this is what you should have so far should have a cool looking water system alrighty so now it's time to grab out some salsa now you have to be careful when placing these because you don't want to get trapped off the top thing you want to walk forward and stand sort of inside of these fence gates but not super inside of them just like this and break these with the bottom box here and then place all sand at the bottom you need three salsa and it should push you push bubbles right up to the top and if you throw an item and then it item in there the item should spring up at the top okay so now it's time to work on the killing chamber on the other side okay to start the killing chamber all I need to do is dig out the location so I like to dig up in this corner here that's one block away and then dig seven back so that's one two three four five six seven here and then dig out a space here going three to the side one two three and just dig out the space here a bit and then a few blocks here you should be able to start to see a your water chamber your water system so now I just want to go around here and just check out your area so you can sort of move around in here I'll get back to you once I've done that okay so now you want to grab out some blocks any type of blocks six stone bricks slabs or a six slabs through minimum three hoppers two chests some stone brick stairs or like to store em brick stairs or two extra stone bricks labs and some water buckets you might need these water buckets I just have one or two handy on you okay so to start find your water bowl the blocks where your water is like this so you should be at eye level with them like this then place a chest in a corner here so wherever you want it to be I'm gonna have mine here so just like this one's gonna be under this block and I'm gonna break that block there then grab at your hoppers and hold shift and brake and place it in going into the chest you don't have to be super quick with this just like this so you should have a hobbit chain leading into the chest so when you drop one in this end hopper and it sort of what it should end up in the chest then you can either place an extra slab here or an extra stair on this chest to make sure you've got a solid face so just like this you can place a stair there and I'm going to place a stand there then I'm gonna place either a block or if you want an another stand you don't it's your choice I'm gonna place another stare here like this going out one more then place some slabs going across like this two three across on the top level like that and then some blocks in front of that just like this then break these three blocks here and replace them with slabs one two three on the bottom half so you can walk down and attack your spiders now you might notice now that your water isn't being pushed up directly to you it there so it stopped one block before and we do not want that so we have to fix that so now you want to come to the side here and break this block around here and find your water like this then you want to grab at your blocks and at the level of this fence gate to place some so on every single one so the water get to push forward then you can break these blocks now like I said before depending on like what version you are the mechanics of your world if it glitches out or not the bubbles might stop at one block below but mine haven't here so you can see the bubbles are pushing up and popping out outside of the water which is what we want so it is completely working so now you have to fill these blocks in at the top it is crucial that they finish directly above the water and then pop back out and have a look at your killing killing station and the water should be right up at your face okay so now we've got that you can see I can open my chest because we have the two stairs here and I've also got two stairs on this side this is optional that's why I really listed to in the item list but I think it looks nicer because it's symmetrical now you've now made our killing chamber so now it's time to activate the farm and to put the water system in let's go and do that now okay to start you want to pick up all the torches from the floor and place them on to the wall so you don't break them when you place your water and you want to grab out two buckets of water like this and a pickaxe if you're in survival now you want to place a water bucket in the corner here one block up one block higher and say that so it flows out and then the same in the other corner now I have to place these torches somewhere else here just like that so it should end here just like that this is what you should have so far then around the edge of the where the water ends break your blocks just like this then underneath the block the water ends on break that as well every single one so the water should all flow towards here so no matter where you jump into the water you should eventually get pushed into your system now you can test this like by yourself just as a player or it'll normally work just like this theory I'm having pushed him now I can't just walk back out so now that you've got this in you can remove all your torches and your spider farm is good to go so let's do that now okay so you can now see I've destroyed all the torches and you can see spiders the spawning in bunches now just to point out you'll have to a of case somewhere closer than on that grinder area over there so let's block this up and head back to the ground to see how many spider spawner so that spiders are there so you can see we have a load of spiders here now if you add sleeping edge this can might grow faster but also if you have losing you'll get more drops and you can see you're peeing up almost all of the XP and all the drops are going into the chest here so like I said before you do get an odd skeleton now you normally don't get the drops for them because they don't go into the hoppers because they're not like sitting by these hoppers because they're not one block tall but the main thing is just getting them out of the way because they can block off the system okay so I'm now back in my decorated farm area as you can see and I would like to just point out again if you'd like to see a spider cave spider farm tutorial make sure leave a comment down below so with that said that is gonna be the end of this video guys I hope guys enjoyed learning how to build a manual spider farm remember that if you try to make this automatic you will not get spider eyes because the spider eyes only drop when gets killed by a player but I hope you guys enjoyed please leave a like comment and remember to sub another sub scrap in you and I'll see you

reviewing the Black and Decker fruit and vegetable juice extractor it measures about 12 inches tall and about 12 inches wide with the juice spout the motor is 400 watts and the unit has a simple on/off switch the removable pulp container is integrated so it makes the size of the unit very compact to disassemble the unit take the feeder out unlock the latches there's one on each side remove the cover hold the juice spout and pull up the pulp separator the unit comes with a stainless-steel cutter and strainer this can be removed by simply pushing up from the bottom the pulp container just slides out to put the unit back together slide in the pulp container put the pulp separator on top make sure the strainer is pushed down put the cover on and lock the latches on both sides and place your feet are right in the chute we'll test the unit by juicing carrots apples and kale the feed chute is small so you will have to spend more time cutting up your produce first I'll juice the carrots I've cut them up into about two inch pieces and sliced my apples to fit the chute we'll turn the machine on so we juice the two carrots pretty quickly let's see how the pulp is unplug the machine unlatch you can see that the pulp is pretty dry and I have about three ounces of juice it's a good idea to tilt the machine to get the excess juice out next I'm going to juice the apples I have about two apples sliced turn the machine on as you heard the machine is pretty loud now there are quite a few pieces of Apple that has not been processed it's sort of flew up into the cover and the apple pulp is moist it's not completely dry there are also quite a few pieces of Apple in the pulp container so from the two small-to-medium apples I have a little over four ounces of juice next I'm going to juice kale like some of these smart subscribers out there have suggested I will ball up the kale just a tip when you're feeding things into the chute make sure to quickly cover it with the feeder otherwise things might fly out the kale is pretty dry but there are a lot of big pieces that were not processed so I wouldn't recommend this juicer to juice leafy greens all that kale gave us a little under two ounces of juice but to be fair most centrifugal juicers don't do a great job on the leafy greens it's better to get a masticating juicer to process leafy greens there's a lot of pulp in the container you can use that in baked goods soups or even add it back into your juice the removable parts of the unit are dishwasher safe on the top rock but I always recommend just cleaning out the strainer right away after juicing so the food particles don't get caked on making it harder to clean but toothbrush is a great tool for cleaning out the strainer I just recommend washing the parts in hot soapy water remember that this juicer is one of the most inexpensive juicers on the market juicing takes more time and there is more prep work however if you're an occasional juicer or new to juicing and don't want to spend too much on a high end unit this Black & Decker should work fine for you I hope you found this review useful please subscribe and thanks for watching", "unI-KNY0LMY":

wire a three-quarter horsepower Leeson motor with a switch we've had a number of questions on how to do this so that's what we're gonna do so where do we start Frank drilled 7:15 30 seconds hole 15 30 second side there for the switch so now we'll take the cord connector in oh yeah that's fun so that's just like a regular box like a box connector we're using the host wing type thing yep put that there can I cut the cord back a little bit that's a three prong cord a little tape on it makes it safer that's just to prevent where the inside of that connector pretty good this how many times have you done this so what did you do there just tight you take it so you know oh you're knocking the little nut on the inside I got you now we need a ground screw can you see in the box puts the motor a little bit so weaken so you're grounding the green wire there's a ground screw and here at the very bottom of the box that's just the red Robbie that you're taking Anila no that's not a quarter-inch the quarter inch have another hole in the middle that's easier access okay now is this similar on most motors or is leasing kind of special Tulsa well it's all very similar right now we're gonna take the black wire the black wire from run the cord the cord unison so that's the hot we're gonna hook it to the switch one side of the switch does it make a difference which side no connect time and you just put little pigtails on your switch yeah so you can see a little better here okay and then we're gonna go from the switch we're gonna find p1 in the motor is that a black or it's a p1 it's written on there oh I got your p1 sorry switch will go to p1 from so that's our one line hooked up when we have I made a diagram of the motor hookup so p1 is line so that comes from the switch yes so now we have to insulate blue and t1 and in slate means means separate doing them join them okay okay now we're taking the blue and the t1 we're joining them together because we're looking the motor for 110 volts okay and then we're gotta join as we go to the diagram it says red p2 and orange all three of them together they go together yeah p2 red orange okay now wouldn't make a difference if you were soldering these together but Moretz is just the easiest way after okay and then the other line is black white and yellow so this black you have to make sure that has no lettering on it there's a black yep and then white and yellow and that goes to our other power line which is the white lead okay so now we're wearing it right now for clockwise yeah clockwise looking at the shop looking at the shaft now if you wanted to switch it to counterclockwise is it that a difficult thing or no then you just take the black wire yeah it is with the yellow and white and you switch it with the red wire that is with the orange and black oh my gosh yeah and you just switch those two around take these up and that's just a little added extra protection there yeah especially when you're on something that's vibrating vibrating and dusty and yeah so just so you guys know the fly masters I always like to run them a cloth why some that way the dust port is sitting away from you so you don't want to stand in front of the vacuum hose you can run it counterclockwise but you'll be standing right beside your vacuum hose so clockwise is ideal there everybody secured now we can notice which in the hole that was drilled you just tighten that up with a 9/16 wrench gotcha okay so we love to switch so that it's facing the bottom so that when it's hanging under your machine and you have to turn it off quickly make sense test now I test it for grounds to make sure nothing's grounded so you got that to neutral in the ground yeah now I've got it so this hold is on see so we got it at all okay I check for grounds should I ground this hooked up properly yeah to the machine business very nice beautiful and then all that's left is to put the faceplate on it and it's done you're ready to go well thank you very much Frank if anyone else has any other questions email me at info at Stockham supply.com or comment on the video and if you need any motor help Frank's motor shop here in well import which is in

coffee is the way that you like it best here's what you'll need a metal pot also known as an e-brake preferably made from copper but other metals are fine some grounded coffee and if you like some sugar sugar is optional it's important to use medium roasted and finely grounded coffee this is absolutely essential you can buy this from most supermarkets and delicatessens the coffee needs to be ultra fine like powder or you can just grind the coffee beans yourself if you do grind them make sure it's powdered like flour otherwise the texture the coffee won't be right I'm making coffee for three people so I'm filling the pot with three of these cups of water these are Turkish coffee cups which are like expresso cups but with vertical sides the water I'm using is room-temperature and adding three teaspoons of sugar one for each person let the sugar sink to the bottom without stirring as it heats the sugar will caramelize and disperse through the water which will give it a very palatable taste add one heaped teaspoon of coffee for each person you can vary this according to your preference if you like your coffee strong add a little extra place the pot on the stove with low heat don't stir just yet let it heat up for a minute or two and then stir slowly you after a few minutes the coffee will come to the boil notice the ring of foam forming at the top remove the pot from the heat before it overflows spoon a little of the foam or crema into each cup before returning a pot to the stove for most aficionados of Turkish coffee this is a benchmark of quality the more foam the better coffee when the coffee Frost's up a second time remove the pot and pour the coffee with the remaining froth into the cups do this nice and slowly so that you preserve the texture of the crema the phone already in the cups Turkish coffee is best served with a glass of water to clean a pallet before taking your first sip this will allow you to really enjoy the rich flavor of the coffee

years I wanted to show you some accessories that have made for it that make this a very important part of my current workshop so a recent addition that I incorporated was this mobile base that I built for it and the workmate has two sets of legs the tall legs fold up underneath and that's the configuration that it's in right now but it's the mobile base was made so that it's at the same height of the original workmate which is 32 inches from the floor I used double locking casters which means when you lock the caster it won't wheels won't rotate and they also won't swivel and then when all four are locked this way the workmate is rock-solid so you wouldn't think that having Casarez would be that big of improvement for this but I think it's huge before the casters the workmate would tend to stay in one spot because it was a I didn't feel like dragging along the floor or we're lifting it but now that it's on casters it's easy I can just put out of the way or move it to the side of the shop I just think this is a big improvement now one of the improvements that some of you may have seen kind of earlier video 9 are these supports that I made for I use mostly for assignment carcasses the supports are padded to protect anything you're going to put on it and you can imagine this chair is carcass that you're glowing up and you need access to both sides for your clamps and with it raised above the surface easy for your clamps to get where they need to be put so installing this I made these slotted this is would rust on the metal framework allows me to just slide this in and now using more secure and they won't slide around up here this next improvement is a replacement or an accessory top to the work mate I use 1 inch thick melamine and I think 1 inch is important because a 3/4 inch is just not nearly as stiff as this 1 inch material I bolted on a section of 2x4 that gets clamped in the jaws of the work mate this is the configuration that workmates in the majority of the time but it's very easy to take on and off as you just saw me do this accessory top is nice and flat which is great for doing all kinds of assembly work on here I can glue anything on here and I don't have to worry about the glue it basically comes off so it's very easy to keep clean and it's just a great general-purpose surface to work on and finally I just wanted to show you I also use it to hold some of my bench top tools so great all on surface something well worth considering any tier your work mate now I do most hand planning operations my primary bench but I do use work mate periodically for some hand planning let me show you how I'm going to make a simple planning stop with this quarter inch piece of cheek good really use in anything couple clamps and then another piece of material I just need to clamp that on one side so now Sam I want to plane this put my whip my foot on the workmate shelf which puts additional weight and add it to keep it from moving now I can easily plane now why do I want to do this again I have my primary workbench but that's 38 inches high which works good for me but sometimes when you're planning you want to be able to really put your weight lean over it sometimes and this is at 32 inches there abouts so it just makes it easier to do that and as you can see this works great and I can easily work on wood that's 2 plus 2 to 3 feet 2 to 3 feet long in this configuration and of course I can use work on wider pieces or even narrower pieces now let's see I want to do some cross cuts using piece of wood this will be my stop one clamp here using the old board now we can do easy cross cuts very versatile the final accessory I'd like to show you it's called a bench bowl that's B you ll this is what I made when I first read about these I thought immediately that I need to build one it all it is is an accessory that you can use in any workbench so I use it on my workmate and also on my primary bench to clamp your workplace to in multitude of different ways you can you can rip with it you can cross cut with it you can hand plane on it you can chop on it and I'll just show you a few of those operations you give or give you a flavor for it but it's it's really almost infinite possibilities first thing I'll do is secure it to my bench put one clamp here and another clamp on the other and let's say I'm doing some work and a piece of wood such as this this is just an extension of my workbench so in this case it's work made it could be my main bench and if your main bench is rock-solid then this just becomes an extension of that that bench if I'm doing some chiseling work I don't have to bend over at this height it puts at it very comfortable height and on my main bench which is which is about four to six inches taller than this it places it even more comfortable to do detail work like chopping dovetails for instance or paring dovetails very comfortable now let's say I want to do some planing on a piece of wood such as this I made a planning stop then I'll just secure with a clamp now I can very comfortably plane small pieces of wood like this and it's very comfortable at this height for small pieces now as told you that you could crosscut with this so you see these three dog holes just general-purpose using whatever you want in this case I'm going to use a holdfast use this piece of wood you've been seeing me carry around this won't budge now I can I can crosscut at this height and I can also use in some combination with my stop bench top now I have I'm constrained both this way and this way so I can make it plain across use them too let me show you how you might be doing you might do some dovetailing with this so to clamp the board to the front and use this Veritas clamp so I'm going to do some tough tale work on this often you want your board to be vertical so I can use my bench top which has a 90 degree face to sure that it's that it's 90 degrees like that I'm good finally I said you could rip well say I want to rip enough edge off this board and decide where I want to use a clamp let's see right here looks good I hope you enjoyed my tour of the workmate in bench accessories and maybe there's a few ideas that you will be able to use a new workshop thanks for stopping by", "yN4Nm1ASXx0": "hey everyone is david from david's ohio barbecue do you want to take your old dirty griddle and go from this to this in this video i'm gonna show you how stick around so in an earlier video you may have seen i was gifted a 17 inch black stone griddle from chris at the hobo nickel he's got a youtube channel i'll leave the link down below and what i did in the first video was I kind of just scrape down any excess gunk on there and re seasoned it but I didn't really take the griddle and resurface it I didn't take the the metal flat top and actually like grind off all the years of use and get it back to pure metal so what I'm gonna do in today's episode is I'm gonna try three different methods for removing the years of gunk and grime to see which is easiest to get back to the pure just metal of the original black stone now I've looked around on the internet to find three different methods for doing this I watched a lot of videos I read a lot of articles and I kind of picked out the three that were most commonly used so the first method that is most commonly used is a sander of some sort a random orbital sander or in my case I'm gonna be using one of those multi tools that you can use for cutting and sanding and all that stuff start with something pretty rough I'm going to start with some 80 grit if it seems to be working well or if it seems to be leaving a rough surface I'll probably step it up to some 120 the second method that I've seen a lot of people talk about is wire wheels now I actually have two wire wheels I've got one that's kind of a wire cup I got it at Harbor Freight for like two dollars and then I've got one that's about a four and a half inch wire wheel that actually looks like a wheel of a car that one was three hours at Harbor Freight and then the last method I hear people using is a grill stone which I picked up at Lowe's where I think five dollars and thirty cents it's basically a brick almost like a hard sponge made out of recycled glass so I'm going to try all three of those first section will be sandpaper the middle section is going to be the wire wheels and then at the gonna use the the grillstone so that when I'm done testing all three of them out I will pick a winner and I will use that tool to do the rest of the griddle so before I go and start taking power tools to the top of my griddle here first thing I'm gonna do heat it up try to loosen up any you know debris that's on there and scrape it down with the metal scraper get any chunks or rust any chunks of you know whatever is on there that needs to come off then I'm gonna let it fully cool before I start going at it with the sander one of the handy things about the blackstone griddle is the top is removable so before I really start going to town sanding everything I'm actually going to take the base and put it aside that way I don't worry you know I don't have to worry about messing it up somehow or hit me with a wire wheel and then I'm just gonna work on the actual griddle itself here on a towel outside on my table to kind of collect any dust that gets thrown around the orbital sander worked pretty well um I sped up this video so that you know you didn't have to watch me sanding for all this time the amount that I got done in this first little section right here took about three minutes of sanding now pretty quick it doesn't really get down into all the pits and everything it but it does a pretty decent job of getting the grit and grime up off of the grill second one I tried the I started off by trying the wire cup and it worked but it wasn't really going very quick it was just kind of grinding little sections I wasn't getting much I think like I was getting much grab anything so I switched over to the four inch wheel and that's that's the one that really kicked it into high gear this this seem that you're seeing right here again is sped up but it took about a minute took about a minute in total to grind off this entire area Oh with the wire wheel I think it has something to do with the fact that since the circumference is you know wider than the drill it's getting more torque and it's really really grinding away on that surface so next up was the grill stone I only used it for about 30 seconds it really started turning to powder and it left it left you know ground-up glass particles all over the surface it wasn't really a fan of it and it didn't really seem to cut through the gunk all that quickly it just it was it was making a dent but not not at any sort of speed so I'm gonna call that one useless so after deciding the winner was the wire wheel the actual four inch wire wheel I started to work on the entire surface of the griddle again this is sped up but it took me about 20 minutes to get the bulk of the grime off of the surface and even a little bit off the sides with that wire wheel not a lot of time and it really got it down to bare metal got in all the pits it got any little rust marks out of God like everything it really looked like super clean the only thing he couldn't do was corners not a very good job in the corners but since my handy tool has the sandpaper in this triangular shape it actually works perfect for the corner so to be honest I'm using a combination of two tools to resurface this griddle I'm using the wire wheel to get the bulk of it off and in any fine detail stuff I'm gonna use the Handy tool the orbital sander to finish that up if you have a big round orbital sander it's not gonna help you out much you might have to do the corners by hand or find some other means of getting it all scraped out so now that this thing is completely resurfaced and I'm loving the way it looks the first thing you want to do you know hit it with a vacuum get any big chunks of dust off there get a damp cotton cloth that way won't leave any lint or anything and wipe it down get anything off of there you don't want any of that ended up in your food and now it's time to re season I'm just gonna turn this thing on high and I'm gonna let it heat up and then I'm gonna take in my case coconut oil but whatever oil you prefer to use grapeseed I know some people who use canola oil whatever it is and spread it around you can see it definitely in the middle where the hot spots are you've got that burner underneath here that's shaped like an H and you can see that shape kind of burning into the middle there I'm just gonna keep it kind of wet with oil I'm not going to get the entire surface of this darkened right now I'm just going to get a little bit of it as I cook food is make some bacon on here's I cook some burgers things like that it's gonna season the rest of it so I'm not too worried about it make sure you follow me on social media I'm on Twitter and Instagram at Dave's Ohio barbecue make sure you subscribe to my channel

[Music]", "JKABO1cVWLE": "sometimes my crazy ideas are actually my good ones but I guarantee it this one it's actually better than the time I tried to melt down plastic to make a face mask that's a guarantee [Music] how's it going welcome to another all about RVs I'm jarred Gillis and today we're gonna be sharing with you a technique that some might say is a little risky a little crazy but for us it's actually been working well so I want to share with you our technique for how we empty our RV tanks when we don't have hookups and we don't have hookups nearby in our areas and we don't want to tear down our RV pack it all up so that we have to go to a dump station so that's what this is all about today and the products that we have that we're going to be using today to show you what we do is we have a tote some kind of a container to be able to to handle your wastewater and then we're going to be using the macerator so those are going to be the two key components in what we're doing here today so I'm sure that you've seen these totes around the one that we have is the thetford tote - it's the 27 gallon has some decent features some nice features that come with it it has this level indicator to make sure that you don't overflow it you can hook it directly to your tanks well today we're going to place that tank in the back of our truck so that we can travel across town to get to a dump station so if you're wanting to know the exact products of what we're using here today I'm gonna put a link in the description below so it's easy for users to to check those out if you're interested in doing something like this so let's move on to the mass Raider now a mass Raider is something that maybe not all our viewers know about but it's basically a pump that's going to hook to your wastewater system and it allows you to dump your great tanks and your black tanks it's going to basically be a garbage disposal it's going to make all the solids and everything else smaller so that it can go through a smaller hose and go farther distances and even be able to be pumped up hill so that's what a macerator is I know it's not pretty but that's what we're dealing with today now that you get a picture of kind of the direction that I'm heading I cannot stress this enough as I communicate this to you is if you're going to do this you want to check every connection every time you do this and test it you do not want to take anything for granted otherwise there's going to be user error system failure and it's not going to be fun we haven't had any failure yet but I just I can assume I would not be having fun if this failed the macerator that we're going to be using today is made by flojet and there's a chart that you can look at it that comes in the manual and it'll show you how far you can pump or how high an elevation you can pump up depending on the size of hose that you use so we're just gonna be using your your typical garden hose and we're not going to be pumping far I think we just have a 25-foot hose and it's just gonna be pumping to the back of our truck that's right next to our RV now that we're ready to hook up our masquerader a great little tip is we're gonna put a clear 45 degree elbow on to our waste water system that way we can see if we still have fluid that's backing up against that pump and also angles it down so that it's not half air and and half water when we're trying to pump and then you deal with a mess at the end so if we can get that water to go down into the pump it's gonna make things a lot easier and cleaner because the system actually works out fairly clean if you do it right so we're gonna hook the macerator up to the the clear 45-degree elbow and then we're gonna check our seals I checked the seals every time I hook this system up to the garden hose we're gonna connect that to the macerator and we're gonna make sure our fittings are tight and then we're going to make all of our connections at the tote that's now in the back of the truck now I had to make my own little fitting I'm sure there was an easier way to do this but these are the parts that I had and it worked for us so I needed to get from the larger three inch hose to be able to get to the garden hose and be able to have a direct attachment that made it real simple I then need to connect the 12 volt to the macerator to get everything working so now that I've checked everything over I'm going to test it with some fresh water I'm going to if I'm going to do my black tanks I'm still gonna test it with some grey water first because I want to know that everything is connected well before I dive into dealing with the black tank so I test it with the grey water and once I see everything is good water tight no issues I'll actually set a timer on my phone to begin my my black tank because I know to fill that tote this macerator can do that in about three and a half actually it takes like just over four minutes so I'm gonna set my timer for three and a half so that way I can stop pumping the black water tank and be able to flush it out with the grey at the end so at this time we have pumped our waste water that we wanted to we flushed out the system with grey water to clean the macerator and a lot of the pipes going to the tote and now we want to disconnect everything clean it up I usually sanitize things before I put them away and get ready to go empty our tote at the dump station across town before we move on to emptying the tote I want to make sure that I mentioned two things that I almost forgot when you're using the mass Raider you want to make sure that those valves are open you don't want to create a vacuum system by pumping with the macerator out of your waste water pipes from your RV so you want to make sure that those valves are open when you're pumping and you also want to make sure that there's a way for the air to get out of your tote so that you don't build pressure on that side so you don't want to create a vacuum from where it's pumping from and you don't want to build pressure where you're pumping too so make sure that you have those proper valves open to do that now emptying the tote really is pretty simple we take some extra hose because we're gonna leave the tote in the back of our truck and we're going to make these connections I actually make the connection to the dump station and then I bring the pipes over to the back the truck because ours does not have a valve on our tote there are some totes that have that and I can always add a valve to this tote but as long as I make sure that my pipes are elevated my hoses are elevated and I make the connection and then I lower them that's what's gonna release everything that's in there to flow into the dump station and empty out our tote once it seems like it's empty I'm gonna lift up on the one side of the tote to make sure everything flows out and then I'm going to hose it out at this point we're pretty much done everything's empty and everything's put away at the RV I'm just gonna sanitize the stuff that I have here to make it as clean as I can for next time that I go to use it well you can see why doing it this way might be a little bit too risky for some people they may not like the thought of doing it this way but for us it's worked out great whether we're at families houses for an extended period of time and we don't have a way to empty our tanks there or if we're out boondocking and we don't want to lose our spot they're really a lot of circumstances where this technique might come in handy so

you can make smoothies nut butters and soup with a 7-minute heated cycle it comes with the powerbase short cup the short cup holds 30 ounces with a comfort lip ring screws right on top of the cup in case you want to drink out of it there is a max line on the cup so don't feel above that this is the oversized cup that holds 45 ounces the max line is marked right up here this is great for multiple servings a resealable lid you can use a lid with either the short cup or the oversized cup and this is the picture for making soups it comes with a two piece lid the pitcher also has a max line this is the blade that you can use with the pitcher the 45 ounce cup or the short cup there's also a two-piece lid that you can use with the pitcher a blade remover and cleaning brush are also included there's a user guide Quick Start Guide and a hardcover recipe book there are recipes based on different color categories you could take a quiz in the beginning and figure out which color category you fit under like the oranges yellows greens etc there's some nutritional information on fruits and vegetables towards the end of the book there are recipes for soups nut butters and some coffee drinks you can't grind dry things like grains or coffee with this unit also don't blend hot liquids the height of the nutribullet with the soup pitcher in place is about 19 inches and it definitely won't fit under my cupboards if I'm using the short cup it will fit underneath my cupboards the width is a little over 6 inches so it's not very large and shouldn't take up too much space on your countertop the cord length is about 37 inches the base is very simple it just has a power on/off button here and Ag button in the middle it's very simple to operate there's no turning no twisting all you do is place your cup with the blade directly in the base it just drops in the nutribullet rx starts blending as soon as you put the cup with the blade directly into the base it's extremely simple to use when you first get the unit wash all the parts in warm soapy water and dry all the cups and lids our top rack dishwasher you're safe the blade is hand wash only and nothing here is removable there's a rubber liner inside the base don't remove it if anything spills inside you can just wipe it with a warm sponge and dry the base can be wiped down with a damp cloth and dried I'll make a tropical smoothie and the short cup I'm using some frozen pineapple chunks about a half a cup frozen mango chunks same amount half a cup and I'll use coconut water as my liquid it's a little over a cup screw on the blade just hand tighten it plug in the base press the power button on the side and it'll turn blue once you put the cup into the base the G button will be green it'll automatically run for one minute and the G button will stop glowing green if you want to stop it before the minute lift the cup off the base or press the power button after each use press the power button to turn it off the cycle stops automatically after a minute during the cycle you noticed it was slow and then fast that's normal pull the cup straight up and press the power button to turn off the base has suction feet unscrew the blade here's our tropical smoothie the pineapple especially smells really good if you want to try out this nutribullet rx I've put a link in the description below there are no chunks everything looks smooth taste it it's perfectly smooth there are absolutely no bits of fruit really nice smoothie will make a smoothie in the 45 ounce cup there's also a max line on this cup don't fill above that I'll start with some baby spinach leaves about 2 cups blueberries about 1 cup 1 pear cut up quarter cup of raw cashew pieces 2 tablespoons of cocoa powder and some milk you can use any kind of milk here's the max line so you can see how much we can fit in this 45 ounce cup let's screw the plate on minute is up pull the cop up you can see this makes at least two or three servings there are no chunks it is smooth the blueberries are broken down the spinach is broken down the nuts they're broken down but you could taste a little bit of the graininess pretty decent job on this smoothie make sure to clean the blade right after using the souperblast or nutriblast nutriblast recipes are in the recipe book and contain Hardy or stickier ingredients like oats nuts and powders if something is stuck on and need some more thorough cleaning fill the cup or pitcher two-thirds full with warm soapy water and run for thirty seconds you can also use the included cleaning brush now let's try making soup screw the blade onto the pitcher some spinach cut-up tomatoes to medium tomatoes 2 carrots cut-up and two stalks of celery cut up I'm also adding a little bit of celery leaves and flat leaf parsley splash of hot sauce for the liquid you can add vegetable broth or water about two cups when making soup always remember to put the cover on after you put the pitcher into the base to turn into super blast mode you're just gonna push down the G button for two seconds and it'll turn red once it turns red it'll run for seven minutes after seven minutes the cycle will end so I'm turning the machine off because it looks like it's overflowing a little bit I'll pour some of the contents out the container is very warm I hope you can see the steam it is it is very hot I'll use a soup plaster mode again but just blend it for about three minutes you don't want to blend it again for the full seven minutes you're not supposed to run two cycles in a row of the soup plaster mode the motor may overheat so it was a total of seven minutes between the first time and the second time it is steamy hot see all the steam coming out of the cap the pitcher is also very hot so you can use a cloth or a mitt that gives you about four cups of liquid filters taste this it doesn't look very good but it does taste pretty good and it's piping hot it should be about 70 degrees Celsius or 150 degrees Fahrenheit there is a max line here on the pitcher and I did fill above that a little bit and that's why the pitcher overflowed when I was making the soup I was following this garden party soup recipe from the recipe book the measurements I follow it almost exactly except I did not add half of a beat so be very careful if you're gonna use the recipes in the recipe book and always make sure your ingredients including the liquid don't go above the max line this nutribullet is very powerful it blended the smoothies nicely and the soup function works fine as long as you don't fill above the max line again don't follow the recipes in the book blindly like I did if you want to try out this nutribullet rx have put a link in the description below as always I hope you found this review helpful

swollen and I can't get the ring off and it's swelling and it hurts and I'm afraid that if I wake up tomorrow morning and the finger is blue I'm gonna have to go to the emergency room and they're gonna cut it off so I'm actually gonna cut the ring off myself oh god please no no no [Music] to do this I'm going to use some paper towels to collect the blood just kidding just to collect the water the waters from the ice I'm gonna use ice to keep the ring cool while I'm cutting it with the dremel and what I'm gonna do is use a clothes pin I'm gonna take it apart and use a clothes pin just to wedge underneath it just so that I keep this blade away from my skin wish me luck all right I'm just gonna take one part of the clothespin my ring has a thin part on the back and then a thicker part on the front and it's very dated and of course it's yellow gold so I'm gonna replace it but it's a little sentimental here I'm gonna turn it around so that the thinner part is on the top and then I'm gonna wedge this underneath as best I can there now I'm gonna hold the ice cube underneath it yes dear so I'm just using the ice cube to keep the ring cold as long as the metal is touching it it shouldn't be a problem and I have to do it quickly before my finger gets to purple [Music] [Music] okay I am through whoo okay you know I just have to spread it apart thought my finger feels better already oh uh amen thirty two and a half years and at one point I had lost a lot of weight probably about I don't know 20 years ago and had it resized to make it smaller then I guess over the past 20 years put some more weight on and guess what never had it resized eventually I had it's been about a month now and my finger has healed fine it never felt better and it was such a relief to get that ring off all right there's the original dated gold one from 32 years ago and this is what I got this is titanium it is no it's not idiot the new one I got is tungsten it is significantly heavier than the old one and chunkier and it's a sandblasted finish they also make tungsten rings that are shiny if you want that too and they come in different colors you can get them in gray or silver or various different things but tungsten is a whole lot cheaper than then a than gold these days so that's why I went with this and the sandblasted look in the sharp edges it's just perfect for my personality and this one is a Triton raw as the brand of this one I'll put a link in the video description if you're interested but I really like it alright thanks for watching", "XN8dlNku0vk": "[Music] now I gotta ask you this is your oscillating multi-tool not cutting as well as it used to if not stay tuned [Music] hi everybody I'm Leo CJ drill now if this is your first time here I just want to say welcome now you know today's video has to do with these oscillating multi tools in the blade here it goes dull so if you're thinking about buying new blades guess what you don't have to people never talk about this but these high carbon steel blades they're easily sharpened and I'm gonna show you how easy it is so let's get started so this is where we tried to cut and it wasn't very effective definitely we have a dull blade so let's take a look at it okay I want you to take a look at the blade I put it in a vise and ask the camera person they're coming close notice how there's teeth on the end here but in the middle there are a lot of missing teeth I can fix that and I'm going to show you how to do it so you don't have to buy a new blade so these are the files we're gonna need now this file here normally this is the only file I use for sharpening my saws and this is what's called a trice where now I'm gonna spin it a little bit so you can see it's three-sided okay this is an extra extra slim but because there are teeth missing we're gonna have to use a mil of file as well now this mil file is gonna level the teeth up a little bit so we have teeth all at the same level now the back file here you don't have to have this not one bit but it's called a needle file and its really great for detail work I might need it we'll see so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take my a blade here and I'm gonna sandwich it in between two pieces of wood I'm gonna stick it in the vise but I'm gonna pull this blade down just barely showing the teeth now I've got my blade in the vise and I've got a stand which between two pieces of wood now you can skip this step if you have all of your teeth okay that's it if if you have all your teeth in the blade alright now what we have to do is we have to cut new teeth so I have to flatten this down a little bit so I'm going to take my mill file here and I'm gonna run it across the top in one direction okay no need to go back and forth we're just gonna go in one direction so there we go that's all we need we're pretty even there cross now it's time to raise that blade now I've raised the blade a little bit now it's time to take our try square that's that extra extra slim file and cut teeth let us set it all right point right there right there that gap that's called the gullet okay there we go so as you can see we've got our first one cut your wood is actually stopping us and our wood is acting like a guide and that's really what you want you know what that's really nice I've cut two I'm just gonna continue on down okay I'm satisfied with the way it turned down that took me about five minutes to do now let's put it to the test now we're ready to put it to the test let's try cutting this 2x4 like we did initially [Music] [Applause] well I got to tell you that made all the difference in the world right and this was the most difficult cut because it's a crosscut we're cutting across fibers [Music] so I just want to say this it's a very simple process anybody can do this they don't tell you that those blades can be sharpened and I wanted to show you that even on an extremely damaged blade like the one we had those things can be sharpen and they can cut just like new so what I'll do is I'll leave a link in the description below the video to the files that I use so you can check them out for yourself now as always this is alia saying you can do this see you next time", "mMMQPTd0DHE": "it's the Magic Bullet the incredible countertop food prep magician that's a food processor a mixer and a blender

about this device by furry kid now this is really great because it is a pet nail grinder that you can use on all different kinds of pets so even dogs as large as jacks or cats as small as hash brown this device will work on both of them which is really great i wanted to go ahead and give you a closer look at the nail grinder because i think it's actually made really really well i love that they have this protective cap on there that's really nice to go ahead and make sure that um this metal that it stays nice and well protected even if it happens to turn on then that way you don't have to worry about like any children um kind of getting into it speaking of turning it on you turn it on with this button right here so if you go up once then you're gonna see one light goes on and that is um the slowest setting and then if you go up again you use it on a little bit of a higher setting you also end up charging it right at the very bottom it takes a c port charger which they end up providing you with and you can get quite a bit of use out of this with just one charge and take a look at the textured metal here you end up having two sides so this side is for your smaller pets this side is actually for your larger pets now i ended up using this on our cat hashbrown and i'm going to show you just what it looks like when you use both sides but i think it's really great that this is such a universal kind of tool plus it keeps you from constantly having to go either to the vet or the groomers to go ahead and take care of your pet's nails i know that that can be really expensive so i love that this is really cost effective too now you can see here that hash brown does not mind this at all it's still very gentle for him with also like being effective his paw isn't jerking back or anything and i really love that the frequency is so low so it's not going to startle them and you can see even on the larger side this still works really great now before you can see his claw was very large and then i did trim it but it was still had a sharp edge and after it is nice and rounded which i love so if you're out there and you are looking for a pet nail grinder then definitely go ahead and check out this one we absolutely love it and i have a feeling that you guys are going to as well thank you so much for checking out this review we hope it was helpful and we also hope that you guys enjoy your pet nail grinder take care everybody", "mc6ftOt1Hf0": "hello my friends let me show you how you condition a rough cut mortar and pestle mortar and pestle has been used for thousands of years between all the cultures and this is what they would used to grind their dry seed or nuts or even their herbs spices this is a mortar and pestle that I just purchased and what I'm gonna do is break it in but the first thing I did is I got felt pads that has a two-sided tape and I attach those to the feet and this is a granite granite stone and it's pretty rough and before you use it you need to break it in and let me show you what you need to do if you look closely at this pestle you can see here that there's flat areas and the surface is rough and the same on this you can see the the grind marks the grooves in at the bottom there is bumps and a rough area well all this needs to be worked down and smooth and what a lot of people do is they'll put white rice in here and grind the rice well I think that's too soon what I'm going to do is rub the stones together but what I'm going to also do is put water in here and rub the stone with that and they will wear each other in and I'll have to do both sides because this pesto is used for both ends so let me put some water in there now I'm doing this outside because this is going to take a while I have to wear the stone down and I'm gonna be rubbing on all the surfaces that I would use as grinding so it'll be the entire interior and you can see the water is starting to get graves removing stone see the center is starting to become a perfect sphere where it was flat and I keep rotating each side in the water you can see this is the stone being ground away and all you have to do is keep it wet as you're doing this keep going up the sides and the very center in the bottom is a indentation so that's gonna be the toughest and it'll have to keep crossing through the middle at the bottom to get it worn down getting very smooth and I'm rubbing even up in on the inside walls you could peel grooves at first now it's starting to get very smooth this is after about an hour of grinding you can see this surface is perfectly smooth on both sides this is I let it set overnight and here's the water and you can see inside there's a slurry and the inside is perfectly smooth also the center still has a little bit of a pit in it so I'll continue grinding but these surfaces here are perfectly smooth when you come up near the ridge you can still feel some of the rough tool marks from when it was ground and in a comparison to the outside this is about as smooth as my conner tops so I'll continue this grinding concentrating near the middle and what I was doing as I was grinding this is the area that would be used most so that's what needs to be conditioned better and I am going all the way up to the top but for right now I need to eliminate that Center pit here you can see the pestle and I rinsed it off and both sides perfectly smooth and you can see the difference between the surface that was provided that was not polished and this smooth finished and inside the mortar you can see this slurry and it's like a cream or a paste in the bottom and I leave that in there when I'm grinding it kind of works like a valve grinding compound and it helps lubricate and also helps the two surfaces to smooth each other that Potter is particles of the granite so it's also an abrasive so we'll rinse that out and here's the bowl rinsed out and you can see that it's really smooth in comparison to the rough edges that were machined and this is ready to be used any little imperfections eventually with use will be worn down and I remember walking through the woods in north western Pennsylvania and coming across large stones laying on the ground ones that were too big to be moved and they had worn areas in the stone where the natives used to camp and grind their grains on these stones by taking flat river rocks and rubbing onto the stone where it eventually wore indentations in so next what we're going to do is take some rice in a little bit of water grind that up and that will help pull any of the raziel grinding dust that might be in the pores it'll pull that out after a few minutes of grinding we're down to a coarse flour and this is good enough after running this through the grinding process we have a coarse ground flour and it's ready to be used all we need to do rinse it out dry it and it's seasoned thanks for watching my friends bye", "pPKiOD5PTXc": "hey dungeon ears Luke here and welcome to a new tutorial video in in today's video we are going to be going over settings for black desert online what settings I use what ones I think are good which ones I think are bad and we're just gonna be doing a quick rundown on how I have it set up so I can still get a really really good framerate keep the game looking good keep it looking clean everything great like that so we're gonna open up the menu here guys now this is the new menu and there is also the old menu if you have this menu the one on the left hand side here you can click this little switch menu button at the very top left and then I'll bring you back to the old-school menu which is actually the one that I prefer I want as few clicks as possible you know I don't want to have a whole bunch of sub menus I just want it in the regular settings so open up settings here and first things first let's go to performance is the very first tab there and under optimization so have Auto frame optimization turned on automatically set the optimal frame rate for game performance I think that's a bad translation as far as I can tell it's basically saying that it is going to adjust the game's quality to keep the frame rate that you have it set to I obviously have mine set all the way up at 60 if it could go higher I would have it higher I haven't really noticed a massive difference between having this on and having this off in terms of the game quality but it does definitely run better so without means definitely have that odd alright next up I'm scale this basically runs the game at a lower resolution and then stretches it to fit your screen and it looks really really awful I'm not gonna turn it on if you have this on unless you desperately need it on like if you're getting 12 frames per second on like 1024 by 768 I mean first off maybe look at a different game to play the outside of that maybe turn on upscale now a little power option low power options a weird one low power option says turn off in-game perfor to him turn off to improve game performance by using up more of your computer's resources this is basically if you play on a laptop you can limit the game's framerate in order to say battery power now well that sounds like a horrible idea and it is yeah apparently the game actually has this enabled by default I don't know why but when I whenever I start up the game on a fresh install this is always turned on so if you're lagging and you have a good PC and you don't know why check that low power option see if it's turned on turn on that off and you'll be totally fine attack decisions so the attack decisions are basically colors that will come up to help show you your opponent's telegraphing their abilities I have it turned off I don't really notice that much I mean a lot of the time the only thing you really need to Telegraph are things like world bosses abilities and stuff like that and most of them have red circles on the floor anyway so I don't really see that need to have that on we don't want any unnecessary effects you know cuz that sort of cuts the framerate so we're gonna go to the optimization beta tab I have everything in here turned on effect optimization I have it prioritized performance yes the effects in this game look really really good but I like getting a hundred and forty-four frames per second at all times so have it turned to basically it turns and down the effects if it starts cutting your framerate a little bit so I have that turned on character optimization this one's sort of a weird one it says adjust from how far away other adventurers will be visible I haven't sent currently at fifty you could crank this all the way down and pretty much not see other people but it doesn't really matter that much if you have high to other adventurers turned on now if you go now I'll explain that one in a second movement frame optimization I don't actually know how this one functions it says optimize how others characters movement frames are updated as far as I can tell that basically shows less animations for other players to sort of keep your frame rate higher I'm gonna actually have this turned off if you ever are pvping I recommend you turn this off because it might actually hide an animation that you needed to know like somebody's stun is coming in something like that it might actually not show that and you don't really want to mess around with that now if you're just you know regular grinder you don't really big PvP or whatever turn it on you might get a couple extra frames out of it now hide other adventures this one was actually brought over from Korea and people were really excited about it but it doesn't function the way they thought it did it basically says hi to other adventurers depending on the situation now when it says depending on the situation it basically means while you're out in the wilderness if your framerate is kind of low it will hide other players as long as they don't flag up or if they are not in combat essentially so if there's somebody running by on their horse and you know your frame rates getting kind of low it'll recognize that it'll actually hide them now the issue with that however is if they flag up they will still be visible and it seems to not really work in towns too well as well I don't I think it's just in the field in a non-combat situation it'll hide other people I think people were sort of hoping that it was going to be a literal hi to all other players unless they're flagged up including in towns which would be really really nice I don't know why they didn't implement that but unfortunately they didn't and it's just that's what we have so if you want to occasionally hide people out in the wilderness if they're not flagged up turn that on you might get a couple extra frames out of it now moving on to graphics and textures I have my texture quality on high because you know blurry textures really ruin immersion as far as I as far as I go anyway when I'm watching around you know when it's a beautiful area and I look at a cliff wall and it's just like playdough across the wall I don't really like that it look it looks really really bad to me so I make sure I have the textures on high at all times now under graphics however this is interesting I haven't set two slightly high I don't know what it is but between very high and slightly high I seem to literally get like a twenty to thirty frame rate increase by switching it to slightly high and I notice next to zero difference whatsoever like you know very slight shadows here and there you know the occasional light ray you know stuff like that who stuff like that sort of changes but really realistically when you're out you know running around and fighting you're not gonna notice any difference at all and it gives you a massive frame rate increase like absolutely massive I can't stress it enough guys try slightly high rather than very high see how it plays and we'll go into this stuff here anti-aliasing so anti-aliasing is a basically if you don't know what it is it's an anti jagged line blurring system the games will use to give itself a more smooth appearance now black deserts is sort of hit or miss some people love it some people hate it I personally have it on if you turn it off I find the game seems very very jagged it almost looks like a PlayStation 2 game but unfortunately you can't adjust and I think it might use FX AAA not MSAA which is the more less blurry looking better type of one but harder on your framerate I personally have it on I don't really notice that much but I notice when it's off so I turned that on now screen space ambient occlusion ssao is basically I like to stop it up to people as contact shadows like so you'll have shadows under characters and stuff like that but you know where their feet touch the ground you can tell there's an obvious shadow and a foot and it's just sort of like two separate entities ssao will put like a blur shadow on it which will make it look more realistic but it does actually lower your framerate quite a lot so if you are having serious framerate issues I recommend turning that off I'll have you look down here towards the grass when I turn it off see how the sort of contact shadows around the ground turn off that's what I'm talking about it sort of gets rid of stuff like that and I mean some I don't necessarily think it makes a huge difference whether it's on or off it it definitely makes a huge difference in towns at least - like how the game looks and turns of framerate you'll notice a huge difference having it off but play around with it some people can play with it some people can't play the game without it they just think it looks too unrealistic and video game II with it off so try having that now display filter display filter basically that guys this game things far away don't look good as far as like anybody can tell like anything even slightly far away like look at that tree in the background there if you were to turn the display filter off and apply it it basically doesn't blur the background but the problem is the stuff in the background looks really bad so what it's kind of up to you if you want to have it on I don't really notice a huge difference whether it's on or off in terms of like when you're out playing it doesn't seem to have huge impact on frame rate either but if you want to see stuff farther away more clearly for some reason turn that on or turn it off I haven't personally turned on because the stuff far away is very sort of blobby and gross and I kind of like you know the fade effect makes it look more you know sort of like you actually would in real life when it's farther away things get blurry err and all that sort of stuff far away objects you cannot actually adjust this if you were on slightly high it basically just slightly improves the effects of faraway objects but I don't think the faraway objects look good with it on anyway so there's no real need to have it depth of field all right so this one is an interesting one depth of field basically blurs the background of focuses on your character but people don't understand when they have it on or off that it actually only applies when you hide your UI with cat or control you now see here now see how the background is so blurry but when I take it off it's not it is only for UI off screenshots and videos now actually what you can't do while holding down control in this mode you can actually adjust the focus of that depth of field as well which is really really cool but for the most part guys it's not going to have a huge impact unless you're just taking screenshots or you're grinding with your with your HUD off essentially now going back into this faraway NPCs do you want to see them as a generic model or do you want to have them with their actual clothes on I have not noticed any framerate difference with this on or off whatsoever might as well have them on it makes the game a little bit more immersive but it like I said if you have a slower computer and you're going into a town maybe have this turned off it might give you that little extra boost you need in effects have this turned on you know when you're getting hit that's pretty much it it doesn't have a huge impact on framerate but it helps you sort of understand what's going on in the game and it will really really help you sort of understand a little bit more what's going on sorry I had a bit of a cough there it'll copy sort of understand a little bit more of what's going on and when you're taking damage if you don't realize there's a couple mobs in the game for example that are arranged you might not understand that they're hitting you while you're standing there in your inventory if you have this all it'll actually let you know that you're getting attacked so I recommend you have that on we're doing snow buildup I have no idea what this ability does I it says snow slowly melts away upon entering combat zones while it builds up in safe zones it only applies during the winter anyway and I didn't really notice a big difference with it on or off I'm not sure but I'm going to come back to this when it's actually winter time because right now it makes no difference there's no snow in the game so don't worry about that blood splatter and blood stains I don't know why these are turned off blood splatter basically shows monsters blood on the ground when you hit them blood stains is like when you get hit and blood lands on your screen that that's totally up to you guys if you're a blood person you're not a blood person that's really down to you guys I like having it on I think it makes the game look a little bit more you know hardcore whatever I just think it looks better I have it on you can turn it off if you like that's really up to you and out here there's a second optimization tab the optimization tab and the first one I guess wasn't good enough now we need more optimization and a lot of the options are shared Auto frame optimization we already had that remove others effects this basically makes it someone other people are using abilities you only see their character animation you don't see all their particle effects if you are going to go and do world bosses I highly recommend you turn this off because when you're doing world bosses there is like 30 people all using high end frame abilities and you're just watching it and your your frame rate tanks and it's a bad time but if you can handle it you know keep them on I have it personally turned off there's no real reason to see other people's effects unless you're like actively pvping anyway but you can just flip this you know whenever you go to a world boss have that on or off that's really up to you room other remove other people's lanterns this is a weird one so lanterns in this game basically you can equip them and it makes it lighter around you when it's dark outside but I don't have any issues seeing in the game when it's dark outside maybe if you do you know either your screens too dark or something like that but I mean realistically if you have any issues with it you know I just have them turned off because the the lanterns introduce more framerate issues I don't know anybody who uses a lantern anyway I don't use a lantern it's sort of just a weird thing but I have a turned off remove far away adventurers effect is pretty much worth it if somebody is like 300 feet away from you you don't need to see their particle effects there's no real reason for it have that turned off seeing yourself some frames and an upscale and low-power option we already went over now onto the effects tab I have my display color scheme on vibrance there is a whole bunch of color filters here to match your instagramming needs I personally have it on vibrant vibrant says I think the default one I think it's recommended one or recommended two is no contrast however I like to combine the two of them I go to vibrance and then turn the contrast to zero this basically gives you more color but it doesn't darken the image at all so you still have just as good of clarity in dark areas if you really want to you know keep it super realistic you could turn that contrast back up a little bit but I keep it at zero gamma that's your brightness boys that's pretty much it everyone should know a gamma is it just adjust your brightness I have it at zero contrast adjust how dark if the blacks are and how light the lights are if you have it at negative fifty it looks really really terrible if you have it at 50 the game looks really Moody default for vibrance is zero gamma and 20 I believe contrast I keep mine at zero contrast like I said get that extra color but don't get any of the extra darkness it'll help you see better effect op acity this is essentially how hard you want your effects to be seen if you want the full vision particle effects or just sort of like ghosts let's say of a particle effect it's literally how clear your effects are I have mine at the default but you can pretty much turn these all the way up if you really want if you were getting some framerate problems while grinding turn these all the way to 30 and you won't necessarily see them anywhere near as much combat focus now this is sort of a weird effect it's sort of like a like a tunnel vision effect you have on your character I have mine at default I'll also recommend you turn it to zero if you were getting any sort of like motion sickness or anything like that it might be worth it to turn your combat focus to zero it doesn't make a huge difference it's all just a sort of visual effect and then color vision aid if you have any sort of colorblindness this will help you with different things like colors are the mini-map dots certain abilities stuff like that will change their colors camera graphics so camera graphics the very first one is camera vision range this is your field of view again if you are getting motion sickness while playing this game please please please turn the camera vision range to 70 no matter what you're doing turn your camera vision to 70 it'll give you a bigger field of view as you can see when I turn this down it looks like it's oom Zin on my character but they stay nearly the same size it's because it's cutting off the sides of the image and then stretching it out make sure you have that at 70 guys biggest field of view possible best vision possible the lowest amount of camera spinning motion sickness all that great stuff turn that 270 overall camera effects this is essentially how you want your game to look while you are in combat as you can see I have everything on zero while I'm using effects here you can see that pretty much nothing happens to the screen I just have my camera you know it stays behind my character and I do the abilities but if we were to crank this all the way up all the way to a hundred you'll see that it gets a little more let's say a little more action movie ish lots of camera shake you know blurriness zooming in and out it makes it look a little bit more like an action movie I personally don't like it I don't see the need for it and it does actually lower your frame rate quite a bit so I usually just tend to have it turned off the only one I will recommend is if you I think if you have the camera effect turned all the way up yeah you don't even get any motion blur I believe the blur one is the motion blur from what I know blur effect yeah that's so that one's motion blur so if you're a motion blur kind of guy that's the one you're looking for again I don't really have it on it sort of has this effective might be hard to tell in the video where it sort of blurs in and out when you're using abilities I find it makes me feel kind of queasy I don't really know what it is it feels like I'm sort of like moving in and out I'm not I don't like any of the camera effects if you're but if you're doing you know like a montage or you know like a machinima or something like that in black desert maybe keep them on it'll make it look cooler but when you're actually you know trying to practically grind and stuff like that it's not so good it's not that great but I mean that's all preference again a harder set up to you now for screenshots you can screenshot at a higher resolution than normal if you are doing current resolution I mean that's fine 4k resolution if you are taking photos for you know I'll lose mine and discord I always use mine at 4k resolution the aka looks even better but if you are sharing your screenshots in certain areas like discord and maybe Facebook stuff like that they do actually have a resolution cap and image file size cap so I keep mine at 4k screenshot format keep it at JPEG I don't know why mine was on PNG this will also affect your image size and it doesn't really affect the quality because it's a 4k screen shot watermark how much do you want the black desert logo in the bottom right hand corner of your screen you can basically affect if you want it sort of halfway clear if you want it fully you know visible I don't really care I tend to sort of edit it out anyway so I just keep mine at 100% I mean you can keep it at 20 but I just crop it out anyway watermark size do you want it small normal or big that's the size of the logo and then you can put it wherever you want to top left top right bottom left or bottom right I keep mine on the bottom right that's the default and what region do you want to say if you are from any of these other regions you can keep it somewhere else or you can just hit no watermark and hit confirm I didn't actually remember recognizing that before so I didn't even know that was in there we're all learning something today but yep that's what I have it at for my settings now for audio settings I have music sound effects and ambient sound turned on but I have the Mount music turned off I don't like the Mount music in this game it's kind of cool at first but eventually you're on a horse a lot and you hear that same like 10 second loop of music over and over and over again I'd rather if I'm gonna be listening to in-game music just hear the city music the field music and not just have the same you know galloping horse song over and over and over again whisper alerts turn that on so you can tell when someone whispers you and system trace out is essentially do you still want to hear the in-game sounds while you have the game minimized to your system tray I very rarely minimize the system tray anyway I don't really care and if I did have it I don't know why I would want to continue hearing the noise if I was gonna continue hearing the noise I would just keep the game not minimize so I have that turned off bat music I have that always off the combat music is in the same vein to me as the riding music I would rather just hear the zone music and keep that rather than have it you know always on or switching back and forth I don't really care about the combat music I just keep the regular zone music toggle fairies voice come on do you want that ferry talking to you 24/7 if you have a ferry absolutely not you want that turned off turn that off now for general settings these ones are actually fairly important if you guys have been wondering how to turn off those notifications at the top of the screen turn off different things like that I have those right here for you activate aiming assistance this basically means suicide of aiming at your crosshair if you put your crosshair near an enemy it'll automatically lock onto it great for target and abilities characters like Ranger stuff like that it doesn't matter how good your aim is guys just turn on aiming assistance there's no real need not to quick slot this was sort of weird I don't really know how it functions it like separates your quick slots so you can like move them around and stuff I I just leave it off I don't really mess around that type of thing it's kind of weird simplify UI simplify the user interface to display only important information definitely have this turn off because the game doesn't show you enough information as it is and limiting the amount of information that it just happens to piece out to you doesn't make any sense you want as much information as possible so keep that turned on or teared off sorry screen saver this basically means when you're afk at your screen for a while it'll do sort of like it'll put on different color effects and move around and you know give you like rotating camera view basically means that you're not just sitting staring at the one spot for a long time I like it I don't really see the need to turn it off I mean I've never liked standing still for a long period of time and needed it to not be on anyway so I just keep it turned on show/hide so this is a whole bunch of stuff always show my name always hide my name display my name when attacked I have always hide my name turned off I feel like having text floating um of people's heads really breaks the immersion in the game for me so I have everyone's names turned off again here display others names I have those turned off display party member names this one I find really convenient so if you're in a party and there's other people around you can track who is on your team who is not there identify that one on but outside of that I have everything else turn off show stacked HP bar might be good if you're at PvP aim because it'll show you how much high HP the person has left so it says here each character's HP bar will display a different color for every thousand HP and kind of get an idea how tanky the player is characters don't change highlight your character when entering and exiting safe combat zones I have this turned on if I'm ever trying to go fishing and want to be as close to the combat zone as possible but not quite in it maybe fishing at V Lea stuff like that I have that turret on all these ones I have turned off because I don't really care about any of those how late your enemy's right you read you want to have this on so you can tell if someone's attacking you have this turned on highlight guild members in blue this one basically means on your mini-map you will see a blue icon if somebody is in your guild it's really really cool sometimes just walking around town you'll see someone you're like hey I recognize that guy so that's kind of cool I have that turned on same party again same thing your party members are green on your mini-map I have that turned on and display your party members head effects if it's it's sort of similar to that Hyde character effects from before if you want to see your party members effects you can have that one turned on as for pets do you want to see every single pet in the game probably not do you want to see your pets that's up to you I have a bunch of red pandas and they're super cute so I keep them turned on or you can just hide all your pets if you don't really care and you just look at them as loot picker-uppers you monster now as for your fairy I have my fairy hidden I don't actually have a fairy it but even if I did I would have it hidden just more stuff visual clutter floating around on screen doesn't really matter but if you're one of those people like again you like having all your pets out you like seeing as much as possible have that turned on how many maids you have you can see this at your residence I haven't set to zero I don't have a residence as far as I even remember so it doesn't really matter but if you want to see all your maids around and have yourself a little harem turn that up show/hide miscellaneous attack decisions during combat that was another option before combo video guide but low level 35 this basically will show you a combo like tutorial in the bottom right hand corner of your screen whenever you use an ability and once you hit level 35 and past that it basically stops showing you anyway I have it turned off because I'd like to figure out the combos myself and the ones they show you aren't even that great anyway so I have that turned off transparent mast uh if you're on a ship do you want to be able to see through the master do you like to be invisible behind it that's really up to you it doesn't really make a huge difference and you want to show your workers progress I don't have any workers set up on this account right now so I don't have them turned on but whatever that's really up to you again alerts this are these are the things that show up at the top of your screen so where it has you know this person registered this to the marketplace this person failed this enhancement this buhbuh buhbuh buhbuh one of those do you want to see I don't really care about train events I don't care about imperial training I don't care if other people get a good horse and I don't care what life skill level other people hit so I have all those turned off I have the enhancement success and fails turned on sometimes it's kind of cool you know you're gonna pop up at the top of the screen like hey this guy got a pen serifs necklace and you're like oh good for him you know that guy there just got a try new ver vambrace I think it said if you don't care though turn that off I like having it on because sometimes when you're grinding it gives you something to read you're just kind of like rooting for other people you see some people sometimes you know you win sometimes you lose you'll see people fail really high-end enhancement sometimes you'll see them win it just sort of something you know feel a little more entertained if you want like I said turn those on or off marketplaces for item registrations I recommend you turn this off it will be going 24/7 no matter what as far as I can tell it notifies you anytime anybody list something over like a million silver and that happens literally like four hundred times a second have that turn spot in the horse market worker exchange that's really if you're really into like horse training or you're really into you know the worker exchange stuff like that maybe have that turned on again I have that turned off I don't really care don't change that'll just pop up on screen whether you're entering a safe zone or combat zone I have that turned on get alerts when your fitness levels up this is your breath your strength and your health it'll basically pop up whenever you get it I like knowing when I get a new breath level also my Stamkos for 2000 Conquest can't Guild Wars I do not care I have them turned off if you want to get alerts for when Guild Wars are popping up when people deck on other people's stuff like that have those turned on black spirit alert black spirit I want him on screen as little as possible so I have his alert turned off parole item suggestions these are basically ads if you're running around and your inventory hits 100% weight limit you know pop up saying hey come to our store and buy weight limit and I don't like ads so I turn their ads off guild members login if you're part of a big guild and you got a lot of friends in it maybe you want to see when they log in and out have that turned on I don't get me wrong I love my guilt but I don't need to know when they're all logging in and logging out because I can just check the guild menus so I don't really care about that Guild missions I'm actually going to turn this on we are doing more guild missions now if you are part of a guild that requires you to do guild missions as much as possible maybe you don't want to check the menu all the time that'll pop up as soon as the new guild mission gets registered and you can go out and do it and get alert what strong monsters are nearby I mean I just look for the purple health bars realistically but if you want to have your whole string get really dark and scary and warn you that there's you know high-level things nearby maybe have that turned on as for the world map you know this this is pretty much nothing like what camera angle do you want your broad map on it stuff like that but it's all adjustable in the world map while you're using your mouse so now that really matters what language you're in that's pretty much yeah I mean that's pretty self-explanatory what language you're in some like that so are they worried about that under miscellaneous navigation guide if you are going towards a quest or a location do you want to have anything on the road you can see if I put on like guide arrows or guidelines it'll basically put like a long line on the floor sort of like you ever played dead space I don't really care I feel like it breaks it sort of breaks an immersion in the game and I already have like an auto path to it and a line on my mini-map I don't need a line on the floor as well I feel like it's sort of unnecessary you can auto how to reject party and guild invites I guess if you're like a super antisocial person you want to literally say no parties no guild invites stop it you can turn that on I guess I don't know why you'd never be that way unless you're like someone's super famous and literally getting you know 24/7 invites haven't turned off I don't I don't mind if people invite me to parties it's whatever automatically turned out dual request you get if you're getting spammed for duels maybe have that turned on if you don't really care I mean I just hit escape trade requests again nobody really trades in this game that often like trading is really not like a thing it's not like runescape where there's a lot of person-to-person training it's very marketplace focused I've the only time I've ever been asked to trade is if somebody was giving me like health potions out on the road or something so I don't I don't really get those very often rotate mini-map police have this turned off at all times this will basically make it so that you are always looking for words and your map rotates around you that sounds like a good idea at first until you are in the desert and you definitely need to know which direction is north south east and west I actually had this turned on at one point when I was out in the desert and I could not find my way back because even though I knew I had to go south east to get to sand grain I didn't know which direction southeast was because I didn't have it set so that you know my character rotated and the map was always fixed and so the map was rotating and then you're just screwed at that point so there's no sense having a map if you don't know what directions north so I have that rotate mini-map turn off hides the UI window when attacked I don't really think this works very well I've never really noticed what it does so I just have it turned off on a run camera when you're Auto running how much do you want the camera to basically follow when you turn so if your character turns like this do you want the camera to follow you or do you want the camera to stay still while your character runs to the side it's all a preference thing it's not going to make any difference on your frame rate and then how fast you you want the auto run camera to rotate and that's pretty much it as for interface settings this is all up to you guys you know what hotkey you want everything at yeah that's pretty much all of it you can turn on UI mode locks so that when you're in borderless window mode your mouse won't go past the edge of the screen stuff like that but you can also unclick use mouse to move I'm gonna have this on so when you click on the floor your character won't run there it's very good depending on the situation I know some people who actually use click on the floor and move just with it has weird interactions with certain abilities and stuff like that but I have it turned off because sometimes when you're trying to click like an interface button you'll miss it and you'll click over there and you'll start running over there and it closes all your stuff which is really really annoying but there are two options I want to show you guys in here that I find are super important one of them is under I believe where is that it was under there's no like interface thing here there's one very specific one that I wanted to show you guys that you have turned on I'll find it in a second so I can show you guys but the second one I wanted to show you is this bad boy right here action hotkeys scrolled down with hotkey evasion button you can basically make it so that instead of double tapping at one of your movement abilities to evade you can actually bind that directional dodge to a mouse button now I personally have it for my WW because double pressing W is sort of weird and awkward so I you can bind this to a mouse button which is super convenient for certain classes I would recommend you turn that on on some people but that's really up to you again if you find you're not evading very often you don't necessarily need to have it I thought I would find out while I was going through here oh sorry that is what I was talking about hi DUI oh my god I'm an idiot hi DUI when attacked I have this turned off this basically means when you're trying to show off your gear or open up a menu if somebody attacks you it will automatically close all your menus and it's super frustrating especially if you're in like a really low elbow level area that has ranged mobs out like you know be trying to show people my gear and it'll like Auto close it so I have it turned off that's what it is sorry that's what I was planning on showing you so I have this turned off so some people who are really annoyed when they're trying to you know switch your inventory put something on there hotbar use a man opposed to something like that and it keeps closing it because you're gonna hit that is the option for you and outside that guys that is what I have my options on the main ones of course being slightly high graphics with high textures turning off all the camera effects stuff like that and outside of that guys those are the settings that I use for black desert hopefully you enjoyed this video if you did go on down and hit the like button we are actually moving up in those search rankings pretty high so if you hit that search butter if you hit that like button we can maybe move up and when people search for what the optimal settings are for black desert it will come up now because I don't think there's a lot of 2018 guides now I might have to update this video tomorrow because the remaster is coming out tomorrow as far as I know it's just the graphics update and that a few gameplay changes I don't think like I believe you can pick if you want to be in the remaster graphics or not so none of the rest of this should have any changes whatsoever but if it does I will post an update video after that and you guys have a great night if you want to join the guild again come in discord and message me I will invite you to the guild or one of the guild members will and you guys all have a fantastic evening this has been Luke for dungeon ears see you in the next one", "w1XDPhQIOJU": "This process does not work on Ethiopian Opal This process does not work on Ethiopian Opal", "jCBklOUCDrU": "hello I'm on right here and today we're looking at the Bower grinder here this is a bower cordless grinder here 20 volt lithium battery here one-and-a-half amp when you buy this tool this is a Harbor Freight tool by the way when you buy this tool you get just the tool and of course you know the wrench that goes on on it there that is literally all you do not get a battery so something to keep mind if you do want a battery either have to buy one of the other tools like the drill here or compact come with a battery or you have to buy one separately so again this is the power 20 volt cordless grinder here that's a handle on it you can change the handle to either side there is no top position that is one thing I do actually rather likens having a top position on the grinder makes a when you're doing cuts here for example so if you're gonna do a cut you can have it here and you can hold it and cut but this doesn't have that doesn't necessarily need it I guess it just doesn't have it the well for what it's worth I got a D wall 60 volt this does not have a top position either so I will say you do get spoiled though if you do have one that has a top position so three position side and top let's uh let's give this a try here we'll see what's how it works the one thing I already don't like about it is this trigger here it's not I know it's a weird trigger [Applause] yeah just uh I don't know not I'm not a fan of the trigger system I don't know why they did it that way also if you noticed how long it takes to spin up here so yes it takes a moment there for it to spin up Walt here it does not that's you know 60 bolt versus 20 volt here not gonna hold that against it I've got a quarter inch grinding disk out of here we're gonna try grinding some stuff also we got a cutting wheel here as well we'll try cutting something as well and maybe just make a cut to see once how far it gets in my experience here so far and this is using the D Walt the battery does not last very long so even though this is a six amp hour battery 6 amp hour battery at 20 volts there it doesn't last long and of course it's that would be 60 volt application there this is only one and a half so we'll see what's how it goes let's all let's get set up here we'll do some grinding with it we'll switch over to the cutting wheel see how it cuts and uh see what we think okay we just got a half inch piece of steel clamp down here I'm just gonna try grinding an edge on it see what's how it goes and then we'll switch over to the cutting wheel maybe just cut a piece of this off see once how it does once I get started here looks I just clamped down to the table that should be good hopefully they're in protection of course actually I think I'm gonna switch handle sides here so I can hold like that [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] okay you can definitely tell this doesn't have the power at least compared to again to my my D you alt anyway and even compared to the corded grinders that I have here it does not have the power that it corded or in case in my case the D wolf has here well that being said however it does do the job you can't like put a lot of weight into it you could probably hear as I was grinding there like well it definitely blogs it out and I could bog it out if I push too hard but as long as you go ahead at somewhat lightly it does do the job I guess I can't really fault them for that it's obviously again it that's 20 volt here it's not gonna have the power of the 60 volt I don't know what amp power this is necessary considered here this is the four and a half inch one by the way 7,000 rpms doesn't really have an amp power on it I guess I know a lot of grinders they they rape rape rape them in amp power so I've got a 70 up on one I think my big ones like a nine or something like that so the position of the guard here is adjustable which we will be making use of here when we go to cutting which I guess will offset up for that right now here so let's uh switch over to the cutting wheel when I try cut across this here again this is half inch plate so it's it's fairly thick but at least something in the case of all my grinders they can easily do that okay and then do I change out disc types on here we're gonna hold in the lock there a wrench Bend that off and a lot of times when you're going to a thinner wheel like this this up piece here has to be flipped over you notice there's our Ridge on that that will sit down in the disc there but when you got a thin one you already have this top piece that's sitting in that and it's not gonna meet properly so you got to flip this over and now goes on that way down okay alright cut here let's see how it does and this also is where you want to adjust the guard so when you're cutting you kind of cut like that you don't have to cut like this so so I'll fire up [Applause] [Music] [Applause] okay just like that we're out to bars okay let's try it again [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] okay when I think I've done enough to draw some conclusions here one I did not finish the cut here I want ma maybe 3/4 of an inch here so it's like no okay this just as hot working you tried to bear into it a little bit it would just stuck Quay Tania yeah the only thing you could do is go at it like really lightly which would take forever and again this is half inch plate so I get it is a little bit thicker but that would take a while to uh cut with us just unacceptable in my opinion the grinding it did okay it did okay with that again you couldn't really put a whole lot of weight into it drying hard you had to go pretty lightly at it but it didn't do the job there one thing that might help here is if I had brand-name cutting discs I just got some cheap ones here but with that being said the cheap ones do work with all my other grinders so I know I don't think that's the fault of the grinding disc necessarily cuz like said they work with all my cheaper or my other grinders so yes not I don't think this is gonna get my recommendation it's okay for grinding and just okay for cutting at least done half inch absolutely not not good at all we could be attract smaller piece I don't think I'm gonna bother doing that though see it maybe like a quarter-inch see if it'll cut that it might might not either gun just guessing here it'll probably still cut it anyway we'll cut this too it's just gonna take a while so not my recommendation if you are looking for a cheaper grinder I think probably still better off going with a corded this is just a Harbor Freight one here too I think one of they like $35 or something like that these work really nice no complaints but it also has the three position with the handle there so that is kind of nice so yeah this uh this follower tool here is not gonna get my recommendation of all the ones I've tested here so far the other three you have any great no complaints the drill the impact even those saw here quite to my surprise was actually quite good how surprised in it I didn't think he's so good but it was so this however was not so good and it doesn't particularly surprise me and I mentioned this to my other videos here I did try to order bigger batteries they are backordered I could not get them don't know if I will get them either but uh that might help I don't know that was again I seen that right away it's like oh they got bigger batteries and knowing my DeWulf tools here bigger batteries for some of these like grinders and saws is definitely very beneficial so it might be in part to the battery the batteries just not big enough for this grinder don't know if not shirts don't have the bigger battery I can't test it again don't know if I would get the bare battery because they are backordered and backorder for like two months so at this point don't know that is down to uh two bars here by the way or two yeah two lights i watch boys are steamed fresh off the yet charger before I started this video so that shouldn't be an issue anyway you folks have any comments or questions about this be sure to leave them below all something like me to test any other Bauer tools let me know we'll see what's what we can get our hands on so as always thanks for watching and until next time", "_SidCppOfJY": "welcome to our live demo on bluffing today we're going to talk about the\nbasics of buffing so I recover what happens when you're buff different\nwheels two different compounds and some safety and some tips and tricks like\nwe've been doing with the previous one so let's get started so buffing buffing is basically just hit\na pretty basic concept you're just getting rid of the extreme\nhighs and lows when you're doing buffing in metal so if you have a really high spot or\nreally low spot trying to even those all out so it's as flat as possible so you\ncan bring up the brilliant finish of whatever metal that you're that you're\nbluffing or polishing is so now you got the basics of that i'm going to get into\nthis showing you the different wheels first we're going to start with the most\naggressive and work our way up to the the most fine it's going to give you the\nreally high luster so the first one here that we have\navailable is this it's an expanding wheel is what we call it so this wheel has a rubber core Center\nand it's pretty soft so you can see they have some voids cut\nin this and that allows it to have some give to it now this may just look like kind of like\na grinder you know like a big grinder wheel but that give is the key to\nunderstanding you get into the recesses and things like that you can't hog out make a groove in your\nmetal this will give some and of just smooth so this comes with different\nbands that come on the outside and a number of different grits so you can get it up even to just real\nfine almost 1,200 great if we work it well enough but this is really most\neffective when you're doing casting or rough or metal or pits or things like\nthat this is going to really blast it really\neasily so that's the first one here now we'll move on to the buff wheels so the first one here is a sisal is what\nit's called say this is a really heavy cutting heavy aggressive cutting wheel so this one is good for steel iron\nstainless those types of metals a little harder metals or something again that\nsand cast it's really rough start with something like this now it uses most times are going to be\nusing like Emery or a compound like that are great greaseless solutions which\nwill show you a little bit with this wheel now the material it's\nmade out of its it's actually similar to the material that's used in like binders\ntwine like you'd see foreign newspapers or magazines this is a similar material or even like\nif you look at it it's like balers twine so when you run your hand on this you\ncan feel it's it's pretty rough and this is going to cut really fast so this is\nkind of like your first step when you're doing anything that's that's really\nheavy cast or really hard to both materials that's the first one now the next thing\nwe're going to be talking about here i'm going to pick up a couple of them these are our spiral stone so these can be sown and a little\ndifferent on each one and it's just for the different configuration a little\nsofter or this one its own has a lot more stitching in it and was going to\ncut a little harder but they're both basically considered a medium cut off\nwheels and use these generally with Tripoli this is going to be your workhorse\nbasically this is going to be the the buff wheel so you're probably be using\nthe most because these are going to be working it out and getting it basically\ngets that nice shiny finish so you want to keep a bunch of these\naround four different compounds and you can do a two-step process we can work\nwith one that's more that's the heavily stitch like this and\nwork up to one like this it's going to have a little more gift to it so that's those basic to remember these\nare going to be the ones are going to be probably most important for you now another one that's this is the one\nthat a lot of guys basically just stop with this is our loose section buff so this is basically just a bunch of\nreal fine pieces of cotton I'm almost feels like felt there on the\nedge but these ones just have a single stitch in the center and a really loose so this isn't going to do much cutting\nit all this is more for final buffing or coloring coloring is basically just\ndetermined they use an industry for like a mirror finish this is going to bring\nout the final natural shine of the metal that you're polishing buffing so you're going to use this with white\nthe white rouge which will be showing you the different types of compounds in\na little bit but this is the white rouge one that you'll be using most guys are\nfine with what looking up to this this wheel and the\nweight Rouge that's going to give you a holly close\nto mirror polish by doing that that's that's fine for most people but if you\nwant to take it to the next step and get there like show finish the real mirror\nfinish that out you know your your wife to do her makeup in this is the one\nyou're going to want to hear you want to use our canton wheel here a sec and\nflannel wheel and yet this is the the most delicate wheel that you're going to\nuse it's going to bring out the brilliant shine of the metal and it's\nused basically only for coloring or the really high polishing this one you only want to use this with the white\nor jewellers Rouge so this again this is the final one and\na little tip is you don't want to mix this at all even if it's your last Buffy more you\ngot waiting around don't mix this one with the emory of the Triple A or\nanything like that because it doesn't work well with this and if you try to\nreuse this again no matter how much you Queen it at this\nstage where you need to be with this it's probably scratch the metal to keep\nthese separate aside and only use them for jewelers or white Rouge so those are the basic buff wheels that\nwe have available for a buff motors now we also have which we are going to\nshow in a little bit we have a kit that comes with our small buff kit that you\ncan basically use a drill and it comes with all these different shapes of Bob's\nin buff we also it comes with the loose the loose section and the spiral soon\nlike we showed you already but this is a cheap affordable kit that's around 40 bucks you can get this\nkit but this is great for getting the tight areas you can do like wheels and\nmore dealt like things are more intricate these are great for using that\nfor so it's really good to have this kid around and also a buff motor with the\nbig wheels to really effectively buff most anything you're going to come\nacross an automotive restoration so now we showed you different wheels\nand give you a rundown we're gonna go through the compounds now it's a\nmulti-step process like we talked about so you're gonna have a bunch of\ncompounds and a lot of times our customers we have questions which\ncompounds are used for here and there and you know when to get to the next\ncompound so i'm going to show you each of those and we are again we're going to\ngo from it the most aggressive down to the other\nbrilliant shine at the end so this one here is our memory it's probably be tough to see but this\none is generally black or dark gray color you'll find each company's\ncompounds may different color so you may come across one that you know ours is\nours is black or gray here and there's might be you know why you're here with\ngray or not black or whatever you want to make sure you check with whatever kit\nor brand you're buying to make sure that what they they consider you know Emery is whatever colors so yeah after all that this is emery this is\ngoing to be your heaviest cutting fast cutting compound of these compounds are\nmade up basically of a wax type substance and then there's an additive\nthat's put into it that's like a that's aggressive additive put in here that's actually going to do the cutting\nnow each of these compounds they have different grits just like you would\nsandpaper that are added in with the waxy substance that's what actually does\nthe cutting so when you have these and you put it on\nthe wheel the reason i have the waxy substance is when you put the heat from\nputting against the buff wheel it's going to actually melt it on and\nthat's what makes it become like the glue to grip your buff wheel so this one here again is the emory it's\na really fast cutting it's great for hard metals this is going to basically\nbe your step one that's going to be four irons stainless steel those type of\nthings you want to start with this if you've got a really rough part and\nthen you can go from there so that's the first one again that's like a black\ncolor generally the next one this is this is\nbasically mainly for stainless steel only it can be used on some irons and\nthings like that on harder materials but this is we generally quarters are\nstainless compound but you want to use this on spiral or vented ventilated\nwheels and this is basically step 24 stainless or real hard metals basically\nstainless so it's gonna be like your intermediate step vs so many other metals so this one for us\nis generally again a gray in color so it's good to you know put a piece of\ntape or mark your your compounds because as they wear down your get rid of the little notches we put a\nlittle ticks on the back of these just to tell you what it is but as you get\ndown you're going to end up ripping that piece of cardboard off and forget what\nit is so make a mark was there is a big step difference between the memory and\nthe step to here so you can be going backwards if the internet if you switch\nthem between themselves so the next one is a like we said the\nspiral stone is like the workhorse of the buffing wheels this is the Tripoli Tripoli is the\nworkhorse your compounds so this is going to be the compound\nyou're probably going to be using the most this one does a lot of work you probably\ngo through this twice as fast as you're going to go through wake the the weight\nroom for the jewellers Rouge so this was great to keep around this is\nreally step one for a woman home and copper and brass some of the softer\nmetals this is going to be your step one the\nother the other ones are a little too aggressive and probably are going to cut\na little too fast so you use this with a woman on you can even use this on like\nplated so if you have something that's anodized or chrome plated could use this\ntoo lightly bring up the shine in those you're going to be using spiral so again or eventually are ventilated a\nbuffing wheels with this compounds as you can see it's a bunch of compounds\nare going to be using with those wheels but this one you're going to really take\nsome time on this one is where you're going to start to see some shine there's\nother ones are just going to kind of smooth it out you're going to start seeing a shine\nhere uses almost start to see a light reflection to kind of run your finger\nabove the part where you're going through this that's what it's about time\nto move to the next one you can start seeing a reflection with your finger so after you have the Tripoli you then\ngoing to move on to your weight Rouge so this is pretty much almost every\nmanufacturer obviously it's in the name white roots going to be white so this is\nkind of step 2 for a woman home copper brass steal this is the one that\na lot of guys are fine with stopping with you just to give this is where you\ncan work it with the different both wheels and work your way up to the\nCanton and you can get a pretty pretty darn good mirror finish with this so this one is\nreally considered for the final coloring and that's that's gonna be a brilliant\nshine that you that you looking for you see on most cars and for\ninstance I'll grab from here this wheel is what they did with the\nwith the Tripoli so it's a little dirty because it's been\nsitting around but you can see that sweet it's really really pretty darn\nshiny and this is fine for most people but if you want that you know really top\nshowcar quality finish then you're going to want to move on to the next compound\nhere set this down carefully about dropping it that's going to be our jewelers Rouge so this is generally like a red or\nmaroon color most most brands have seen out there for that way so this is really step 3 for pretty much\nany metal this is going to be your final polish this is basically has no cutting\nagent in it that's going to be abrasive at all so\nthis one's just for final coloring mirror polishing you're going to want to\nreally only use this one with like the flannel the flannel captain wheel or\nlike the like a final flaw I'm sorry I felt like a tough wheel so this is just for the real fine ones\nand it's only going to do that it's just going to take it from the White ruse\nthat's pretty darn more reflective to like a mirror this is going to be almost\nchrome if you work it well enough with this so this was a great final step if you\nhave the patience to go that far this really makes a difference between a\nyou know pretty good polish part 2 like a wow this is amazing polish bar so this is this is a really good one so\nthe West compound here I know we're talking about metal but this is the last\none that we offer a lot of our kits for good I just show it while we're there is\na blue bruise that we offer this is basically really only for plastic it's\nreally really hot really light cutting so it's not much cutting it all but it\ndoes have a little bit of a cut to it and it's for plastic so a good idea you know like wax and windows or\nsomething like that you can use this to kind of bring them back and make a mom\nto bring the clarity back in those I'm use this with the spiral stone wheel really that's the only one you're going\nto be using it with it's a kind of one-step process it's good to mention if you have\nanything that's plastic that so this will bring it back if you work it\nlightly so now that we've shown you those the\nWest one that i mentioned i alluded to hence not very appealing looks wise but\nthis is our greaseless compound that we offer a friend in a number of different\ngrits but this is more of a really highly aggressive compound so the grease this compound is it goes\nfrom like an 80 grit which this is all the way up to a 320 this is what you're\ngoing to want to use if it's like a cast like a cast manifold or if you have an\nold set up cat sand castle women on wheels this is what you want to start with you\nput this on your buff wheels on the bus murder you can really blast through some\nrough pieces of metal and get them nice and flat and smooth that out so it's\ngood to have these kits these are a little different you're\ngoing to actually apply this and you have to sit and wait it out let it dry\nbefore you actually start a point before you start buffing and make sure they\nkeep these at a really high heat I've had instances where I had these in\nthe garage and hundred-degree weather and actually starts to melt a little bit\nso they are susceptible to that so make sure you keep a minute you know kind of\nclimate controlled area so we're not going to show you this one in action\nit's a little bit Messier to show you on camera but this one is really good for\nfor fixing the the casting have one part here that we just hit up real quick that\nI want to show it's just an old supercharger casing here so you could\nsee if I can hold it well enough for the camera this is the\noriginal really rough casting used uh we use the expander wheel and you know a\nlittle bit of the greaseless compound in here to smooth it out so this made it way smoother and just\nyou know it's been a few minutes on just in this little section here smooth it out versus the rough casting\nside makes a big difference and you know trying to do a buff wheel with this is\nnot going to work you're going to spend hours and hours you're not even going to\nbe to this smooth so remember it's easy to start with the\nmore aggressive compounds on something like this and work your way up and spent\nhours trying to you know but it was just the Tripoli or something like that so hope we can see with that so now that\nwe've got the compounds down and we've got the wheels down now we're\ngoing to talk about safety first thing about safety with bluffing now you got a wheel on a bluff motor on\nthe drill that spinning pretty fast and get things caught it so you want to make sure that you're\nwearing pretty tight clothing you have long hair you got it tied back and you\nwant to make sure you make where the see the proper safety protection I got one of our East would work jackets\non here always but in the sleeves here make sure it's nice and tight so I don't\nget anything caught in the wheel so the first thing that you need is uh\nof course just safety glasses so I want to put on some safety glasses make sure\nnothing gets in your eye of course just like anything when you're working the\nnext thing is our dust mask here his face shield we sell these these are\nreally good a lot of times guys don't use these and they regret when you're\nbluffing it's throwing compound is throwing\nmaterial back at you so if you if you didn't wear this in a few minutes you're\ngoing to have a black face so it's really good to wear this to you\nknow both save your face from getting covered in dirt but it's also you know\nfor safety precautions if anything flies off its not going to you know puncture\nyou if you put you know its interface so put that one on and of course i like to use just some\nlike just generic whether work wats and get these at the you know the tractor\nsupply store or something like that you put something on your hand so if you\nif you get you know against the wheel a lot of times when you're bluffing\nwe're getting pretty close to the two that spinning wheel and you don't want\nto accidentally get your finger quarter or hit in it so i want to put those on\nand then generally what I'm doing a lot of buffing i'm going to use like a\nlittle dust dust mask some kind of face you know respiratory type protection so\ntoday I'm just doing really white coffee i'm just going to do a few seconds here\nand there so so you guys can still hear me i'm gonna i'm going to not wear this for\njust a little bit but if you're doing heavy cutting and rough buffing you know\nif you're spending hours buffing definitely sure you wear that yet those\nare those black bodies that you put out you see you come out at the end of the\nday they're not good they're going through your system you don't you don't\nwant this so now we get all our safety protection\nfor going next thing we're going to show you on the buff wheel here is the safe\narea of a buff motor there's a safe area when you're bluffing\nand we're using today just the half horsepower single speed buff motor that\nthat we sell at eastwood and also you know it's on our just our economies that\nstand so this is the most basic setup you can\nget and it's really affordable for about basically two hundred bucks you have a nice little box thing set up\nthat this can do ninety percent of the work that a guy who is going to be\ndealing we offer also offer a two-speed one\nhorse model that's a little more towards the professional side if you're doing a\nlot of bluffing you may want to step up to that one but\nwe're going to show you this one today it's really good it works well so the\nsafe half of the buff wheel so this buff motor here spins down like this so it's spinning\ndown towards the ground there's a safe part you want to stay on\nthis on the side here you want stable well you want to stay\ntowards the bottom half of that you don't want to get up above that into\nthis area because that's going to want to catch whatever you're bluffing throw it actually is going to do the\nstroll across the room so you need to make sure that everything around you\njust in case that happens to your worker you don't have anything that can get\ndamaged you know you don't want a car window or\nyou know people to be standing around you when you're doing this even if\nyou're really skilled it can happen you could get grabbed and you know throw a\nconstant across the room so i'm going to show you just real quick and lightly what you know just how the kick is when\nthat happens and show you where the safe area of the wheel is and then we'll show\nyou how to put some compound on next and then I'll just do a little bit of\nbuffing with some trip away on the compound so i'm gonna show you just a we\ngrab a part here just a little scoop that we've been you know we use for\ntesting and things so it's a little piece you have here so put this on like I said it's rotating down so you're\nbluffing you want you know have a nice wide stance and want to grip the part\nreally firmly that you know the second you start wedding go with this part and\nloosen your grip it could grab and throw it across the room to make sure you're\nalways grabbing this pretty tightly so you want to stay like I said it was\nthe bottom part of the wheel yeah and you can work it back and forth so\nthat's you know just a quick demonstration of safe part another now\nthe bad part that you don't want it you know obviously get towards the top and\nI'm going to try and kind of dramatize it for you but you want it you don't\nwant to get up to the top because it's gonna be going to start kicking and you\ncan hear it kind of grab when you get you can get there it's not it's not nice you know it wants to throw throw it back\nyou so you want to stay again was the bottom half of the wheel and just work\nthe front or the face of the wheel so what we have that on i'm going to\nshow you next how to apply some compounds and then\nI'll just do a little bonding section and kind of show you the action a little\nbit and I'm going to do the backside of this here you can see we buff to hear it\nright in there is an area we haven't touched yet so I'm going to work in that\narea real quick with the Tripoli just to do some quick smoothie and bring the\nPolish a little bit to see how quickly you can get you know an area like that buffed up so i set this down for a\nmoment and we'll get the just a small that's a small this is out of the small\nkit that we have opened up this is the trip away so now this straight here when\nyou're doing the compound a lot of mistakes that people make is they put\ntoo much compound on the put to have a really just jamming into the wheel and\ndiscount get on that's bad you don't want to do that you\nonly really want to put it on for like a second or two at a time and that's it light pressure second or two at a time\nbut the will do the work it will put sufficient amount of\ncompound on the wheel so again you want to stay towards the\nbottom half of the wheel now we're doing this tightly sewn spiral\nsoon peace here so just go back and forth that's like you know two seconds that's\nthat's basically all you need to start buffing it's better to put on a little\nbit of compound often than to put on too much compound and that and then have a\nproblem so let me to show you here on this piece how to buff this so I'm gonna against a\ntowards the bottom half yeah yeah you got to be careful of those edges\neven when you're towards the bottom there you know you saw a little bit when i get\ntoo close to the edge if you're going against the edge and wants to pull it in\nthat's where it's good to have your hands you know just right so i have an edge\nhere I don't want to go against that you want to work with it so I'm going to turn the piece here and work down like that so I don't catch\nany edges yeah yeah even get little this a little bit of\ndivision line here so that's just a quick now brought it up\nyou can see how it took a lot of the corrosion away there pretty quickly with\nthe trip away so this one I probably put a little more\ncompound on work this area a little more and you can eventually once i get\neverything nice and smooth I can work to another wheel that's maybe\na little with some more loosely sown and some more Tripoli to get it you know start bringing it up so that\ngives you an idea kind of your the angle you need to stand and you know how you\nwork the peace so we just have this buff motor here let's fight me a little bit moving just\nfor this for this display here we moved in area could see you can see in our\nstudio here but you really want to try if you're doing a lot of buffing you\nwant to try and both this down we just have some sandbags on just for a\ntemporary thing so you guys can get the best angle when we're doing this but\nnormally we have this any other side of the shop we have this bolted down to the\nconcrete that's right that's really the best thing that you need to do but I'm\nsacrificing my safety just for you guys a little bit so now we showed you those basic some\nthe buffing with the with that piece there you were going to move on\nbasically to the drill with the small kit here this kid again you can just put it on\nthe drill really easy to use and i'm gonna show you what this wheel here just\npull the cord out of the way here so right so this wheel used to you know\nstarted out life like the one we showed you and it has a little bit of Tripoli\nthat I wear it on here so we're going to just show you how to do this this corner\nhere and i actually forgot the last time for my mast down I apologize hope you guys can hear me\nwith this down so but this down here and i'm going to do just this little area\nhere best to have this clamped in advice but\nagain just for this is you guys could see it the best i'm going to just work\nit right here and this is where these conical shaped stuff pads are really\ngood yeah so this works in the edge really nice so let me set this down and show it to\nthe camera here to see you guys can see that good kind of like this in here\nworked versus the area its kind of dull so it's just a quick quick little both\nare brought up and now it's probably hard to see here on the on the live\nstream but just a quick little buff they're already bringing that shine back\nso that again that was just with the Tripoli really fast you guys can see but\nthat's why those cone-shaped wheels are really good because if you try and fit\nthis around the buff motor have actually had times where with doing a lip just\nlike this I was bluffing kind of stuffing inside\nand get around to that that bad area of the wheel and according throwing so\ntrying to fit this around the wheel is really dangerous you don't want to try\nand do that you know this is way faster you want to\ntry and use the those conical shaped ones to get into all the corners and\nbuff these areas on something like a wheel you know we will whip especially like a\ndeep-dish well it might get caught you know in the buff wheel so now we showed you the buff you know\nthe different buffing ways to buff and you know some things to watch out for we've got a handful of tips and tricks\nthat I was just going to kind of go over we know everybody here is always buff\nand stuff for the car is kind of quiz a few guys some stuff that I've done they may help you along the way so one\nof the first things is when you're trying to determine what you want to\nbuff so if you have something you know apart\nthe one above again we'll use this use this wheel for you know instance you\nhave this wheel here and it's you know you're not sure if this thing's been\nclear coated at some point if it's anodized or whatever how can you tell before you start if\nthis is bare metal or not a really quick way one of our guys Nick kind of told me that he uses and\nits really really great so use a sum Otto saw just a white rag\nlike this and you basically put some auto saw on the rag and you wipe the the\npiece that you're curious about with the white rag now if this piece is bare metal what will happen is it's going to turn\nblack when you're robbing this so when i'm running this here turns\nblack so that's bare metal we know this is\nbare metal I could start polishing this now if this was Anna dies if this was\nclear coated some point it may be difficult to tell especially if it's\nsomething that's been sitting for a while and you're not sure where even\npowder coating have some clear powders it's hard to tell this isn't going to turn black like this\nit's not going to really do much of anything except just be the weight all\nthe salt when you rub it so if you rub it really quick that you\nget a black rag that's when you know that your bare metal and you can start\npolishing or buffing if it does not need to strip it mechanically or chemically\nbefore you even start doing any of this process we're talking about so where you know you need to blast it\nwhere you need to go move it with a grinder or something like that or you\nknow a paint remover so that's that's one cool little trick\nthat you know to save you some time and headaches if you're you're doing that\nnow another thing I'm i hinted to a little bit was you know keeping your\nyour butt pads separate along the way so if you have stuff pads that you have a\nbunch of both pads you know sitting around like this and\nyou want to keep them separate so you don't want to mix you know a pad that\nyou're using mostly only trip away on with the pad that you may be one time\nuse the memory on or something else so you want to keep these separate and\nlabeled so the thing that you know we like to do and I do it around my shop\ntake a ziploc bag like this just a big one throw your compound you're using with\nwhatever wheels in here and then label it you set the ghost so that way if the if\nthe tube of compound gets worn down you can't see where the writing on it\nanymore as you rip away the cardboard and you can't tell us we can keep it all\ntogether and labeled so you don't go backwards when you accidentally use a\nwheel that's got you know some other compound on it so it makes saves time\nbecause you're not you're not fumbling around and you know keep so much more\norganized in the garage and even though the compounds are different color the biggest turn black in the end you\nknow as soon as you start buffing they turn black so you're not going to tell\nwhat the heck was on the wheel previously so that that's a cool the thing to keep your keep you\norganized so another thing if in between muffing in between your different stages\nof bluffing when you switch compounds and even you know when you start with a\nwheel even if you haven't separated like I\nsaid one thing you want to use is uh we have a buff break is one way to do it so\nbasically with this you can clean out your wheels so you want to use this in\nbetween every compound so this is really good to put on the wheel between every\ncompound so you basically hold it like that it's\ngoing to spin down and it's going to take off the gunk so I did a little bit\nhere and you can it's quite impossible to see but it's\ngoing to pick up all that gunk and you can easily pick it off but that's going\nto clean your wheel in between so this is a necessity if you don't have\ndifferent stuff wheels for different compounds you need to be doing this between each\none and thoroughly because otherwise it's going to your mixing compounds your\noxen also miss mixing a little fine pieces of metal they caught get caught\nin this especially when you're doing a woman armor and a softer metals so if you don't have one of these and\nyou're in a bind or if you have the small kit like we talked about you know\nwhat one of these it's a lot more difficult to use the\nrake with you know the smaller small job get like that you can use a screwdriver\njust a hat and usual flathead screwdriver so you can just hold it\nagainst and I drag it across lightly and it will pull it out so same thing on the on this over here\nyou can put it on there and work it now you have to be it's a little more dangerous with this\nwith the bottom over here because it can get caught throw it across the room so that's\nanother cool little thing that you can do make sure you clean in between so now that we've covered you know some\nof those things last couple things is how to maintain or how to keep your your\nyour parts are already highly polished shine how to keep them from doing up so it can\nhappen really quick with a lot of metals so if you're using something that\ndoesn't necessarily rust like steel you know just a mild steel the Polish\nmild steel you need to coat it somehow because it's going to flash rust just\nthat quick you know any moisture in air is going to start rusting so you need to\nput something on it the other other metals like no copper aluminum obviously stainless\nsteel don't have that issue but like a women especially it's going to start doing or slowly\ncorroding over time so the first thing you can do that's kind of a temporary\nsolution is again the other song so you can use the auto saw on the white\nrag like I said wipe it around the park that's polished and then wipe it off\nwith a clean rag and that's going to basically bring that lost her back and also we have is a really fine film\non it that keeps the part from you know corroding this is good for short term or\nsomething that's all it's only garage kept it doesn't really\never see bad weather it's good for that is going to last a\nwhile you doing our cars sees whether a little more it's going to be short term you might\nhave to do this a little more often or every time you watch the car you might want to put a little film of\nthis on but this does work pretty well this is a tried true thing that guys\nhave been using since you know being a beginning of time so the next thing that we came out with\nits kind of a little more medium to semi permanent solution at least one metal\nprotect so this comes in an aerosol can and it works on that nano barrier\ntechnology so this is actually like a film that goes on it's not a paint it's a film that\nactually you like we spray on the idea what this you spray on real light dust\ncoats along the way and this leaves a film and you can actually watch it kind\nof self level as you put it on this is nearly invisible once it's on if you if\nyou apply it correctly will be nearly invisible so you want to apply this let it sit put another coat on you put\nmaybe two three coats on tops and this is going to leave that barrier on that\nwill hold up to rain and weather and you know even washing the car this will hold up to it so the way you\ncan remove this is with like an acetone or are free you can wipe it off you\ndon't want to use any kind of etching type chemicals you know trying to remove this but it\nwill come off that way I've had a car that I used the idea we drove for a year\nthrough east coast weather you know winter and summer and I had it all set\nof wheels that I left this on for a year and it worked pretty well about after a\nyear that's a nice i decided to you know take\nit off and reapply it so this stuff's pretty good if you put\nthis on the corner of your garage -  sixty  only a\nweekend show car this is probably the last a wife for\nthat you know the life until you decide to change your wheels to change the\nparts or whatever you know painted flat black if it's in\nthat season so that's that the other thing here is diamond clear Dominique where is pretty much our\npermanent solution to your ceiling up polished parts or bare metal parts so this particular we have a number of\ndifferent versions for painted and unpainted this one here is our gloss for\nunpainted services for bare metal surfaces this is the one you're gonna want to use\nfor really highly polished parts now it is a clear coat so it's gonna\ndull highly polished finish finishes a little bit but again if you apply in\nlight coats you can you can keep that to the minimum\nbut I this is going to seal it up and basically again it's a clear coat so you\ncan you can polish this one not you know not bought for polish it but you can rub\nit you can spray you know when you wash the\ncar and it's not going to come off you don't have to worry about it as much so that's it that's a cool little\nproduct that you can use to seal it up if you're not the kind of guy that wants\nto polish your car polisher parts every time you wash it and the last one here\nthat i just i forgot to mention i just want to circle back on before were take\nsome questions when you apply too much compound you're going to see a black black build\nup here and this is where where I try to do this on the before we started but a\nlittle too much compound on there where bluffing and you can see there's a black\nresidue that's that's left is a greasy residue the more compound you have the\nworst this is going to get so if you're bluffing an area and you see like a\ngreasy black circle around where you're bluffing you probably have too much compound on\nyour way all you need to start over so you need to use the rake Queen it out\nfully and then play a little bit of compound when you're done so to remove\nthat you can use our pre that we that we say for you know cleaning before\npainting this is great for removing compound\nwithout damaging your finish so i like to use the pre and spray it on wipe it\noff and that'll take it off this is also great in between compounds\nuse this with a month microfiber wipe the part real good before you changed your new we\nare new compound and this solo this will take off all the oak old compound so\nyou're not you know again fighting yourself so this is a good one it's also really\ncool when you get what's the N use this spray it on weight\ndown every so often and it's really it's really cool to see your progress where\nyou're coming when you wipe off that little bit of compound you like while this thing is really shiny so keep\nthis around it's always good to use no matter what\nyou're doing in the shop so that's all my tips that I have today and puffing\ntalk that we have hope you guys found in informational you have anything else\nquestion wise i'd love to take some questions to play can answer amount do\nthe best so what's the first question that we\nhave guys are anodized is actually it's it's like a it's really it's a plating\nis the best way to to go into it and like a lot of pleadings they seem to work best when you when you\nhave a they work and look best when you have a highly polished surface so\nsomething its polished especially again with chrome chrome is the perfect one\nthat needs to be as highly polished as per as possible to get the best finish\nso energizing a similar way it's gonna you know if you have a cast part of\nsomething like that it's not going to work nearly as nice yes it may stick to\nit but it's not going to look as nice ok so the question was how much mill\nmarks in a part can be removed when you're polishing so if anybody is not understanding the\nquestion when some parts that are coming out like wheels and things like that\ntheir spawn or milled and you actually see the Tony marks on a mobile wheel is\na perfect example that's a spun wheel on the whip you might see just a bunch of rings\nlines around the whip that's the marks that we're talking\nabout here if you can feel them with your fingernail if you drag them across and you can feel\nwith your fingernail they're probably too deep to polish out\nwith just a good just a buffing wheel and compound you may need to go to the expander wheel\nwith a graceless compound where you may even go all the way to some kind of\nsandpaper you know do it old school and just blocks and it out you need to get those marks out to a\npoint where you can't film with your fingernail and then at that point you\ncan probably really move to the greaseless compound blast through any\nremnants of that marks and then start buffing now that's a really good\nquestion i don't i don't know if there's a professional answer as far as what the\nindustry standard is my experience is just a guy in the garage I use these things till they start frame\npretty brat badly if you have a spiral stone wheel you get down to that first\nbit of stitching it's it's probably time to replace that we are once you start\ngetting into the stitching because it's going to start coming apart and creating\na mess wheels like like the the loose the loose\nwheels like this that have done for more than finishing those wheels are probably\nWest you know a number of these wheels before you have to replace this one but\nplacing buffing wheels are special but murder you don't have to do it very often if\nyou're using the ones that are in the drope the smaller kit that that may be a\nlittle more often but you know once you get down to that stitching starts coming\napart frame really badly probably a good time to you know throw\nit in the trash well a lot of guys I'm sorry the\nquestion I keep forgetting to give us do the question was how do we deal with the\ndust buildup when you're doing a lot of heavy\nbluffing so a lot of a lot of people if they have the room it's best to build a corner your shot\nyou can kind of just make a little isolated area where you're only doing\nyour you're polishing and buffing your grinding in that area because that's\ngoing to keep it consolidated other than having some kind\nof hvac system that you can you can pull it out there's not really a good way to keep it\ncontained other than making yourself a little room so one thing you could do\nthat I did in my own little shop is I made a little curtain in my dirty work\narea you can pull across and kind of separate yourself that that's going to\nkeep most of the you know the heavy dust and compounds getting thrown around just\nin that side that will look at the shop you know and then the rest of some nicer\ncars sitting or you know whatever you don't want that getting on not too much it's going to get on it so\nyou could do that just make a little little shield or a little curtain you can put up to you block that kind of\nstuff any other questions we have what metals cannot be polished I don't know if there is a metal that\ncan't be polished per se some metals are better or polish easier\nbut I mean you can polish if you take the time you can't polish a cast-iron manifold so\nyou can take a cast iron manifold working with the expander wheel you can\nwork with the compounds you can eventually get that pretty darn shine now each metal naturally has a higher\nluster than others so if you have a you know something that's a woman vs a\ncast-iron they're not going to you know it's not going to be quite the same but\nyou can you know you can get most any metal polished it's all about how much time and\npatience you have any tips for buffing really small parts\nthe small buff kit is a definite if you're doing something really intricate\nbecause if you get too small you really you can't hold it in in in\nyour hands and get in here and buff because it'll grab it and throw it\nacross the room now I've done pretty small stuff like\nsay oh like right now a project that i'm doing a button head stainless Allen bolt so I'm like\neverything in the engine bay so I'm bluffing every single bolt in the bay I've been\nusing pliers like but like you know some walking grip pliers and I've been\nclamping down on them a little bit and holy and just like we doing it you can do something like that with\npliers if you can put in a vice you know no matter if you have some of\nthe soft gels for your advice you could put it in that lightly and\nwork your way around it it's def way more difficult but i would\nadvise just trying to hold it with your hand and buff around probably gonna get\nhurt or damage the parts I'm system will ya that you could I'm sorry when the question was when is\ngood to use the system will how often should you use it since the wheel like I mentioned is step one for really\nhard metals or roughcast items so you could use it on that the rough cast on\ncharger case that i showed you you could use it on that with either the\ngreaseless compound or the emory and you can work with that so it depends on the part generally with\nmost of the women on parts and softer metals you wouldn't be using that you\nwould mainly use that on stainless steel cast cast iron and you know things like\nthat little harder materials if you have to you could use it on a woman on that's\na rough sand casting you need to be careful because that could take away a\nlot of material and even with a woman on you could take away too much you can dig\nyourself a little valley with if you're not careful but it's really up to you\nwhat to use it's always better to start with a\ncompound or a wheel that's too soft then too rough so if you work with\nsomething that's a spiral soon and it's not really making a dent in it then\nmaybe you need to jump up the sisal but unless you want something rough like\ncast-iron you may wanna you may want to start with something smooth something\nmore delicate and work your way back to that really I wouldn't I wouldn't I wouldn't advise\nit I'm sorry the mic you find the question\nwas can you put a buffing wheel like we're showing here on just a normal like\norbital car buffer for paint I it may be able to be done but I don't think it\nwould be the best situation because when you're doing those those are designed\nwhen you see a buff pad it's like the top of the buff pad you're\nusing so when you're pushing down using the top of the buff pad to push down on\nthe paint and using the top of that wheel these wheels so it basically you imagine\nto be this part you need to be using this is the face of a buffing of a buff\npad right here so it's actually the I you know a different part of it that\nyou're using so it'd be difficult to hold up normal\nbus sander you have to be so kind of hold it like straight up and down really awkward like\nto to buff with that and you probably it's so awkward he probably just causing\nmore damage than good so i would really advise that i'm not even sure if these\nwould blow it up correctly with that so you're really you're better to use this\nor use the small kit with the drill so that was all the questions we had\nthat we're going to answer on air there's any additional questions that we\ndidn't answer that our tech online didn't answer will be posting them\nonline to our blog next week will also be uploading this to our East which\nchannel so you tube .

This was a follow-up to a previous video, which was the best espresso\nmachine under 100 pounds. Here we are, 500 pounds and anything between 100 and 500 was on the table. First up, we have the Lelit\nAnna that was 350 pounds, we have the DeLonghi Dedica, 189 pounds. By far the cheapest in this category, but had a lot of requests to look at this and this seemed like the\nbest opportunity to do so. We've got the Rancilio Silvia,\n529 pounds is what I paid, so technically out of budget, but I've seen it for around 500 so it was worthy of inclusion here. We've got the Sage Bambino Plus, that was 399 pounds and at the end here, we've got the Gaggia Classic\nPro, also 399 pounds. Important note here, I'm gonna\nuse these as mostly stock. I'm not going to modify them heavily, with one small exception. Where I can I'll be using a better basket. These two machines both came with pressurized portafilters only and it was such an easy\nthing to switch out that it seemed worthwhile doing and in this case with the\nGaggia and the Rancilio, they're both 50 ml portafilters, I'm gonna use a better basket for them too for the espresso testing. That does put the Lelit\nat a slight disadvantage, because it will be using its stock basket which isn't as good as a VST basket but it's a 57 mm portafilter and I just couldn't find a basket in time that was of a standard\nthat I was looking for. As to how these were chosen, there was really one criteria, which is that they were broadly available in lots of different parts of the world. There were other machines\nthat were proposed, mostly by my patron\ngroup, but I picked these because they're kind of the most available and easier to get and\ntherefore giving this the widest utility, I\nhope, to you, the viewer. So here's how testing is gonna work. Firstly, I'm going to talk\nthrough each individual model in terms of its build, construction, how it's kind of felt to use,\nsome of the ergonomics there then the important stuff, we're gonna pull some shots of espresso with each of them and I'll talk through the kind of espresso I was able to get and if one of them maybe pulls better espresso than another. We'll do some simple milk steaming tests, both how quick it is and\nthe kind of quality of milk that the steam ones on these produce. At the end, we'll wrap up,\ntalk through which one of these will suit you the best\nbased on what you want from an espresso machine\nowning experience. Let's start with the Lelit Anna. Now I'll be honest, going into this Lelit was not a brand I\nknew particularly well. 350 pounds buys you a pretty solid build. Using this didn't result in the machine sliding around very much. It's got a nice weight to it. The things I like bless about\nthe build, if I'm honest, well, the water tank. Now, it just feels a little bit cheap. The way it works, you've\ngot a couple of horses that go in here and then\njust a large plastic tank and the cutout in the side, I don't think it's a great way to assess how much water is in your tank. As a common theme today,\nwe're gonna complain about the valves, the steam ones. Generally they just feel\na bit cheap and plasticy and I know I'm used to\ncommercial equipment, but yeah, it feels okay. The buttons, fine. Nicely made, work well enough. What is a nice inclusion\nis the pressure gauge here. That is very helpful. That's a big plus for me\non the build of this thing. However, the drip tray is one part of this that I don't particularly like. It's quite fussy to get in and out. There's no float in the drip tray, so you have no real way\nof knowing how full it is. So I always feel nervous, if I have to tip a drip\ntray to lift it out. That makes me concerned if I've got this a little bit too full. Now the DeLonghi Dedica is\ncoming in at a disadvantage. It is substantially cheaper\nthan anything else here. And you can tell that from the build. Where there might be a lot\nof metal in other machines, there's a lot of plastic here, even with that kind of\nchromed finish at the top. Its footprint is tiny and\nthat might be a big advantage for a lot of people, but it is light and you definitely have to grip this thing when you lock it in. And for me, my instinct to\ngrip, is to grip it around here and with my big old hands, I've\noccasionally pushed buttons while trying to hold the\nmachine in a funny sort of way. And the drip tray is really very small, but it has the convenience\nat least of having a float to let you know when you're about to make a terrible mess of your kitchen. Water tank, removable,\neasy to use, clear plastic. Overall, it's what you'd\nexpect for the money. The Rancilio Silvia is\nbuilt like an absolute tank. It is by far the heaviest\nof the units here. Once it's on the counter\nwhere you want it to be, it's going nowhere. This was the easiest to lock in or remove the portafilter from, simply because of its weight. It was not going anywhere on the counter. Buttons, switches, very nice\nhigh quality stuff on here. You can feel the sort of build quality of kind of parts here. The steam valve is\nprobably the best of them in terms of feel, though\nit still does feel like a domestic steam valve in many ways. The water tank is again, a\nbit of a weak point for me. It's not a great experience to remove. You've got your two horses, again it's that white plastic material, but you have no real insight\ninto how full your tank is unless you open the lid and have a look. Drip tray, the depth and size isn't bad, but it's actually quite difficult to see how much liquid is inside it and there's no float or indicator on here to let you know that it's too full. So again, this drip\ntray has caught me out. The Sage Bambino Plus is\na more expensive machine, but it has the build quality of something a little bit cheaper,\nbecause they spent the money on features rather than build. So lots of plastic all over\nthe machine everywhere. It's very light and that makes it a little bit annoying to get a portafilter into and out of, it will move around on the counter unless you're holding the machine. But the other details are\ngenerally pretty good. The water tank, easily removed and it\ndoes have instructions for cleaning printed on the back. The portafilter, a little\ncheap and plasticy. The buttons at least feel reliable. They are a manufacturer making a lot of things with a lot of buttons, so you would expect those\nto be of good quality. It's not a steam valved machine. It's an electronic steam controller, which I think is interesting, but we'll talk about that when\nit's time to steam some milk. The drip tray is a little bit small, but it does at least have a float in there to let you know that\nyou've got too much liquid and it's time for a little cleaning. It's a tricky one. The build doesn't feel as\nnice as other machines. It doesn't feel as solid, it doesn't feel as hefty but their design decision\nwas to spend money on features, not on build and we'll see later on how that pans out. Before I get into the Gaggia, actually I need to have a quick disclaimer or disclosure, I guess\nmy first ever coffee job was working for a company\nthat was Gaggia UK, selling Gaggia Classics. This was back in 2003. That company no longer exists. It was a great company, I'm very grateful to my\nfirst boss, Raj Beadle for encouraging me into a\ncoffee career, shout out to Raj. And he now has a separate\nbusiness that sells these and I bought this from him. So full disclosure about\nthe whole backstory of me and Gaggia there. The build is really very good. This is the Classic Pro, which\nis new to me in some ways. It has better switches\nacross the top here, it's got a different steam\nwand to the kind of traditional I think they're called Panorella wands, but the build is solid. Brushed stainless everywhere, water tank can be accessed from the front and you can pull it out through\nthe front if you want to, which makes changing water very easy, but you can just still pour\nin the top and fill this way, but one little gripe, we could say, the portafilter on this\nthing doesn't feel great. It's solid and it's hefty, it's a 58mm portafilter, but\njust the finish around here didn't feel premium in a way that some of the other portafilters do. Drip tray is reasonably deep, but again, no float to indicate that you're about to make\na horrible horrible mess. Overall, for 399, the kind of build you would expect from a premium machine. So here's how espresso\ntesting is gonna work. I'm gonna take a coffee\nthat I know very well, I'm gonna use a fix recipe\nacross all the machines, which is going to be about\n18 in, to 38 grams out, in the region of 28 to maybe 32 seconds depending on the machine\nand the kind of setup. I want the machines to\ndo the best job they can with the recipe, but by\nkeeping this kind of fixed and using the same grinder,\nwe'll be able to understand something about the pressures that the machines are putting out. Now, the first one up the Lelit,\ndoes have a pressure gauge. The others do not and they\ndo not as the standard, all run at nine bars, which\nis massively frustrating, but we'll discuss more later\nand I'll share at the end, the different grinds settings\nused on the same grinder for the same recipe, just so\nwe can see some differences. But first up, let's discuss\nespresso on the Lelit and having a gauge on here is really nice. Let's pull a shot. Now, before we taste, we need to stir. So I've upgraded my spoon selection. That's very important. So I'll be stirring with the\nfanciest little teaspoons from the 1940s, cause I'm a fancy man. Now I have to say, I have\nenjoyed the shots from the Anna. They have been generally\nsweet and balanced. What they're lacking often,\nis a little bit of heft, a little bit of texture,\na little bit of body. That might be a function of the basket maybe not being quite good enough to allow a really fine grind for the kind of recipe I would want. So I would hope for a touch\nmore body in the mouthfeel of the shots that I've had, but overall it has made\nme very tasty espresso. A little bit impressed by the Lelit. DeLonghi Dedica is a funny little machine. It has a very frustrating portafilter. So I changed the basket on this. It came with a standard\npressurized portafilter basket which I don't wanna use, so I put a normal 50 formula\nbasket in, but to do that, I had to have sort of damaged\nthe portafilter further. It has a little insert inside it. Looks a little bit like this. I couldn't get the basket\nin without taking this out and in taking this out,\nthere's a little screw here that holds the plastic piece in place. The coffee now drips out of this too. So it's a bit messy, but it's the only way I could\nget proper espresso from this. You don't have a ton of height between portafilter spouts and drip tray, which makes getting scales\nand cups under there not impossible, but not super easy. A little bit more clearance\nis always appreciated there. Let's pull a shot. Hmm. Now this needed a\ncoarser grind than the Lelit and I think that's interesting and the extraction is notably lower. Now this doesn't air on the side of hot and if anything this tastes\nlike a slightly cool shot to me. The acidity is very pronounced,\nthe texture is okay. It doesn't feel like we've\nhad a great extraction here. And I would say for lighter roasts, this will be a difficult setup\nto get good espresso from. It's running, I think at\nquite a high pump pressure, it's not running at a hybrid temperature. Those two things in\ncombination, with lighter roasts will make it an enormous uphill battle. The more developed the coffee gets, the easier it's gonna be to extract and I suspect the better\nthe shots you'll have and if you like medium\nthrough to dark espresso roast then you may have a good experience here. It's not light years better\nthan the cheap DeLonghi that we tested in the\nsub-hundred pounds category. It is a little better for sure, in terms of shock quality,\nbut not light years better. So broadly, pulling shots with the Silvia is quite a pleasant experience. The buttons are very nice, the\nportafilter feels very nice, but my complaint is brew\ntemperature actually on this one. It runs a little hot. Often, you can hear and see a good amount of steam coming\nout of that group head. That's not ideal. So you might have to do\nsome temperature surfing, where you pull out that very hot water by dumping it into the drip tray and then you try to catch it as it reheats at the right point to get\nthe best possible shot. People have other mods for this but we'll talk about modding at the end. I've changed out the basket\nin this to a VST basket, 'cause I don't really rate\nthe basket that came as stock. So I'm gonna use that instead. Well, economically while the drip tray is a little bit annoying,\nit doesn't drain super well, having that width to\nwork with is very nice. Let's talk about the espresso. Now I've had a range of\nshots from the Silvia and they've all been pretty good. Having a good basket in\nthere lets me grind finer, that's good, extractions have been even when I've used them naked portafilter. The frustration for me\nhas been temperature. I've had shots that have had a harshness from brewing a little bit too hot, a sourness from brewing\na little bit too cool. It wanders around a bit in temperature and that for me is a frustration. You can get very very\ngood espresso from this, but you'll also get\noccasionally frustratingly, just kind of off espresso, from the brew temp being in a funny place. So the Sage Bambino is an\ninteresting little machine, but unfortunately it does come with that pressurized portafilter that I just don't want\nor particularly need. I get that they exist for people who just want an easier life\nand don't want a nice grinder, but we're trying to get good espresso here and these things are worthless. So we're gonna use a proper basket in this and pull some proper shot. It's a full featured\nmachine and you can play with stuff like pre-infusion. It's quite easy to do manual pre-infusion if you want to get into that thing, which seems contrary to having\na pressurized portafilter, but they really do seem\nto be trying to capture the whole wide audience. There's a ton of distance\nfrom spouts to drip tray which suggests that people\nwanna put scales underneath. The shots, well, let's pull one now. Texture is actually okay, but it has used the coarsest ground setting\nso far for that flow and that doesn't yield\nthe best tasting shots. If you're using a lighter roast like me, again we're back to that sour espresso, reasonable texture, reasonable mouthfeel but I think it's gonna\nbe a difficult machine to absolutely get the best\nout of with lighter roasts. I'm just frustrated by my\ninability to access more features in the machine that are\nso key to good espresso when it has so much, you\nknow control over other stuff like pre-infusion and shot volumes and all that sort of stuff you would want. Not bad, simply not the best of the group. So now the Gaggia Classic Pro, a machine that I'm sort\nof familiar with, but not. Now pulling shots from this\nwas broadly pretty enjoyable. Again, got rid of the stock basket. Get rid of the stock\nbasket, put a VST basket and still in there's the portafilter that I don't really love it and with a different basket, the fit is a bit frustrating here. Now one feature, this thing has, is it has a solenoid valve\nas a pressure release valve that dumps any excess pressure\nat the end of the shot into the drip tray. That does make back-to-back\nshots quickly, relatively easy. You don't get what\nsomeone once described as portafilter sneeze, when you immediately release the portafilter and some pressure leaks out like that. So the shots, let's pull a shot. Now, as you can see from the shot, one frustration that's very clear is the spout to drip tray height. There's not a lot of room to get a scale and a set of espresso cups\nin there or a cappuccino cup or whatever you want to use. Secondly, this thing definitely\nruns at high pressures. That's kind of a well known thing. And we'll talk about modding that later, but it did allow me to pull shots at a much finer grind\nsetting than anything else. However, like the Rancilio, the temperature does\nwander around a little bit. It is possible to have it\noverheat and have some steam when you flush the group head or have it run below temperature. So a bit of a temperature\nsurfing routine will yield you the best tasting espresso. As for how this shot is, pretty good. Not overly acidic, but it has\na certain sort of harshness that I associate with\nhigher pump pressures. Now that could be, and may well\nbe confirmation bias, right? Like I'm seeing something\nthat I expect to be there but that shot floated\nat a nice kind of time, 18 in 38 out in 28 to 29 seconds. That shouldn't have kind of\ntexture and quality of woodiness and bitterness that hasn't\nbeen present in other shots. Again, we'll talk about\nmodding, but as stock, it is frustratingly close to great, but the espressos aren't superb. Milk steaming it's a really important part of a good espresso machine at home, so that's what we're\ngoing to look at next. First test is very simple. It's just power. I've got 150 grams of cold milk, I'm gonna steam it to 60 degrees Celsius on each of the machines and we're going to see how quick it is. So aside from the speed\ntest, which was interesting, let's talk about the actual\nexperience of steaming milk. Now the Lelit was okay. It has underneath it, sort\nof auto frothing attachment, a regular steam wand that I wanted to use because that's significantly better, than using the little\nattachments that it comes with. It wasn't super well powered, but I got some reasonably\ngood milk texture out of it. I wasn't upset by it. Not the slowest, not the worst. Steaming was okay. The DeLonghi Dedica has this automated sort of steam wand part\nthat helps add foam, add air to your milk for you. This was the most difficult\nto get great texture from. You've got pleasantly fluffy milk, but if you wanted\nsomething a little silkier, a little bit easier to\npour a latte out with, you'd really kind of struggle here. The Silvia was a beast. This was the closest to steaming with a commercial steam wand of any of these machines. It was incredibly quick,\nincredibly powerful. I've been steaming milk for a long time and so I loved that, but if\nI was new to steaming milk, this would be intimidating,\nthis would be tricky. I would make a mess a whole bunch of times before I got my milk texturing down. So not the easiest, but if\nyou know what you're doing, a real pleasure to steam with. Now the Sage was a surprise. You could tell going in, that milk was a big part of it's sell. It's got a full featured\nset around milk steaming, so you can use it as a\nmanual sort of milk steamer, which is what I would do and what I did and the results were really very good. I thought it would be slow,\nbut actually it gave me lots of time to do what I needed to do, to have a phase of adding air, and sort of stretching the milk and then going into a phase\nof kind of rolling it around. The end result was very\ngood, not the quickest, but kind of easy to learn with. If I was teaching someone to\nsteam milk for the first time, this would be a good machine to do it on. Now it does have some extras. It's got some automated milk steaming that lets you choose your end temperature. There's a little thermometer\nbuilt into the drip tray and it'll let you choose\nyour texture as well. That's great, if you don't\nwanna get into how to steam milk and you want some good results, that's kind of impressive to me. And again, where they've skimped on build, they've really gone hard on features and milk is a big one here. So this was a pleasant surprise. The manual stealing was very good. Now with the Gaggia, I was\nactually a little disappointed. It felt underpowered. So much so that I had to steam twice to check that I hadn't\ndone something wrong or you know, something had\ngone awry, but actually we repeated exactly the\nsame result on both tests. I had no problem stretching the milk, but where I wanted to\nkind of roll it around and texture it and mix it. That's where it just didn't seem to have enough pressure and power and that was a bit disappointing and it was notable that it\nwas the slowest of them. I got some great texture out of it. I just wanted a bit more pressure from it. So what I'll do now is I'll\nsummarize very quickly, the kind of overall experience\nof each of the machines. The Lelit, I was a\nlittle bit impressed by. It's a new brand to me, it's the first time I've\nused one of their machines, there's a couple of\nlittle weak points on it, the milk steaming and the\nbasket that its ships with and the fact that it has a\n57 millimeter portafilter for me is a slight frustration, but it produced good results. And I think with a better basket, you'd get a notable\nincrease in shock quality. I think it's very good value\nfor the money at 350 pounds and comparing it to say\nsomething at 190 pounds, you could absolutely see\nwhere your money is going. That DeLonghi is okay, for the money, but it's a machine at that price point that says to me it's worth spending more. You get better milk steaming,\nyou get better shots, you get a better build, you get a better experience all around. So I really wouldn't recommend\nthe DeLonghi necessarily, but I would understand if you\nwere really budget-constricted you can get okay espresso from it. It might frustrate you if you\nwant really great textured flat whites or cafe lattes. The Silvia is the closest to a commercial machine of the group here. It's right at the\nbeginning of that kind of prosumer category where you get sort of miniature commercial\nmachines for the home. The steaming on this\nthing really impressed me. The build is fantastic. It is heavy, it's hefty,\nit's very well made. All of the componentry\nseems extremely good, but for 529 pounds, I'm\nannoyed that if I owned this I would wanna mod it further and that would cost me at\nleast a hundred pounds plus to add a PID to it, to control\nthe temperature for it. Now there is a substantial\ncommunity out there of Silvia owners who will help you out. There's tons of guides,\nthere's tons of kits. You would be joining a\nkind of ecosystem of owners and people who modeled these machines if that's what you're into. I would just be slightly frustrated that at the most expensive machine, there's still stuff I\nwant to tweak and change. That has a pretty substantial\nimpact on the espresso. Now the Sage is super interesting. It's about the same price as the Gaggia, but they couldn't be further apart where you might have a\nsubstantial modifying community for the Rancilio or\nactually for the Gaggia, you're not going to find one for the Sage. This is not a machine you're\ngonna tinker with or play with, it's not one you're going to get under the hood and mess with. It's too complicated. It's just not built that way. It does have a ton of features and I think they've really identified an audience of people\nwho want good espresso, great milk drinks who don't necessarily wanna become hobbyist baristas. This is for somebody who wants\na very enjoyable experience, who maybe wants to go through the process of making their own coffee,\nbut they don't want to have to spend too much time investing\nin their own skillset. Now to round us out, we've\ngot the Gaggia Classic Pro. Now I did enjoy using this, I know there's a little\nbit nostalgia for me, but it's well-built it\ncan pull good shots. Like the Silvia, I would want to modify it to have better brew temperatures and actually I'd probably\nwant to modify it to do better brew pressures. All you would need to do\nis change some springs and bits inside the over-pressure valve, it's not very expensive and\nyou'll get much better shots. But it requires you voiding your warranty, opening this thing up,\ntinkering with parts inside and that's not for everyone. And the way that they're built, they seem to carry a lasting value and that's kind of the difference. I expect these two machines\nto hold their value much better than these two machines. The Gaggia, was pretty good. I like this machine, I think\nfor the money it's good value. I wish it had a bit more steaming power. I wish the temperature was\na little bit more stable. I wish it brewed at nine bars, but you can fix those problems. Personally, if I got to keep one of these, which one would I keep? Well, I'd be torn between\nthese two probably, because I'm open to modding\nand I'm interested in that. So these two are in a similar category. But if milk is important, this really is a fantastic\nlittle espresso machine for milk steaming. But of course, I don't get to keep these. These all get given away\nto my patron supporters. I'm very grateful to all of them for supporting this channel, giving me budget to just go and buy these. And at the end of it,\nwhen I've tested them, when I've shared my opinion,\nI can give them away. But I'd be interested\nto hear your thoughts down in the comments below. Do you have one of these machines? Are you having a very\ndifferent experience to me? Have you found other\nthings you like about them or other things you dislike about them? I'd be super interested to hear from you down in the comments below, but for now, I'll say thank\nyou so much for watching and I hope you have a great day.", "NLp14AauTNg": "hey guys i'm nisha homie today i'm sharing a high protein high fiber oil free salad recipe for dinner this healthy salad is loaded with fiber proteins and natural healthy fats and will help to keep you feel fuller for a longer time and thus ideal to include in your weight loss journey so let's get started with the recipe to make high protein millet salad i am using raggy flakes ragi or finger millet is a whole grain it's a highly nutritious millet it is completely gluten free so i am using raggy flakes also known as aragi poha or ragi aval ragi is rich in fiber hence it's ideal for weight loss and diabetes the high fiber in ragi helps to keep you feel fuller for a longer time and thus helps in weight loss and weight management it's a good source of calcium good carbs amino acids and vitamin d the high iron content in ragi helps to combat iron deficiency anemia i am heating my cast iron pan and into that i'm adding in half cup of raggy flakes and on medium flame i'm lightly roasting the raggy flakes i'm roasting the raggy flakes until they are crisp now the reason why i use cast and pans in my cooking is that cast iron helps in better iron absorption and those who has iron deficiency anemia must try to include cast iron cookware in your daily cooking at least one of your meal should be cooked in a cast iron cookware for better iron absorption roasting the ragi flakes will help to make it very crispy and that will help to make this salad crunchy as well keep stirring it on and off so that it does not get burnt remember that cast iron cookware is heavy bottomed hence heat retention is more in cast and cookware roast it until you start to see steam coming out so as you can see steam has started to release out at this stage i'm turning off the flame and i'm transferring the roasted ragi poha or ragi flakes onto another plate i'm going to allow it to cool down completely while the raggy flakes are cooling down i'm getting the other ingredients ready for the salad so what i've done is i have taken a handful of shallots i like to use shallots in my recipes because they are a good source of iron and folate however if you don't have shallots at hand you can use half of an onion instead a small piece of ginger ginger will help with digestion and about three to four cloves of garlic one medium sized cucumber which i have finely chopped one medium sized tomato which i have finely chopped two green chilies finely chopped green chillies you can increase or decrease as per your taste half of lemon one medium sized carrot grated half of a capsicum finely chopped to assemble the salad into a bowl i am adding in the chopped cucumber chopped tomato chopped green chilies green chillies you can increase or decrease as per your taste grated carrot i have a handful of shallots and i'm slicing in the shallots shallots are a good source of antioxidants and that is also one of the reason why i like to use them in my recipes into this i'm grating in the ginger ginger will help with digestion and also gives a subtle flavor i'm grating in the garlic cloves about three to four garlic cloves will be ideal for some protein fiber and healthy fats i am adding in half cup of roasted peanuts 2 tbsp roasted sesame seeds for some natural healthy fats sesame seeds also will help to balance your hormones so that is 2 tablespoon roasted sesame seeds 1 tablespoon cashew nuts finely chopped for extra natural healthy fats and for an added crunch along with the roasted raggy flakes the seeds and nuts will give an added crunch and the much needed healthy fats healthy fats are a must to help in better assimilation of fat soluble vitamin especially vitamin d so the vitamin d in ragi needs a good source of healthy fat either you try to use natural healthy fats in the form of seeds and nuts or you can add in one tablespoon of any wood pressed or cold pressed oil of your choice like sesame oil mustard oil coconut oil or even desi ghee any good source of healthy fat is a must for better assimilation of fat soluble vitamins so do not skip adding a good source of healthy fat another important thing which healthy fats does is that it will help to keep you feel fuller for a longer time and also prevents sugar cravings for some extra protein and fiber i'm adding in 1 cup of boiled chickpeas also known as chana so what i have done is i soaked the chana overnight and then i pressure cooked with little salt so that is one cup of boiled chickpea or chana and to this i'm adding in pink himalayan salt as needed there is already little salt in the boiled chana so add salt accordingly for an added flavor and for better digestion i'm adding in half teaspoon roasted jeera powder also known as cumin powder 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper powder since pudina or mint leaves are in season i'm using a couple of sprigs of mint leaves i'm just tearing the leaves and adding in two tablespoons of finely chopped coriander leaves squeeze in half a lemon for some healthy gut friendly probiotics i am adding in one teaspoon apple cider vinegar you can use any organic vinegar of your choice you don't need to use apple cider vinegar if you don't have any organic vinegar would be ideal i also like to use coconut vinegar i've already shared how to make coconut vinegar at home please do check it out make sure that the vinegar you're using has the mother the mother is actually the gut friendly healthy bacteria and now i'm going to give it a good mix at this stage you can check salt if you feel you need more salt you can add in if you feel you need more spiciness you can add in another green chili finely chopped or half a teaspoon of black pepper freshly ground you can just play around with your taste and preference and lastly i'm adding in the roasted raggy flakes now the reason why i'm adding the ragi flakes towards the end is to keep it fresh and crispy and now i'm going to mix it really well this is an excellent high protein filling meal for dinner but you can also enjoy it as a meal for lunch and the best part of this recipe is that no one will guess there is ragi or finger millet in this recipe the salad can be enjoyed by the whole family children will really enjoy this amazingly filling and high protein salad and i'm gonna transfer to a salad bowl and my high protein filling salad is ready to serve so guys do try this healthy filling and super crispy high protein salad and let me know how it turned out thank you for watching and until next time take care bye", "MZeNjdvknGY": "customizable intelligent design features take the

a\nlook at how to cut acrylic sheet there are many different types, many different\ncolors many different thicknesses and also many different finishes of acrylic\nfor example this one is in non reflective finish that is an opal colour\nI actually bought this for  a project and I can't remember what I bought it by now but that's\none of the benefits of getting old, you  can also get clear like that, that is 10 millimeters\nthick I've then got some blue non reflective finish and then we've got some colorful\ngreen gloss finish and then this piece is a piece of Lucite this would normally be used for sanitary work such as their bath or a shower tray so\nwe're going to look at a few different ways of cutting this at home.\nobviously one of the best ways of cutting this is using a laser cutter but\nnot everybody has access to a laser cutter\nthe first technique we're going to look at is scribe breaking and that can be\ndone on acrylic up to about 4 millimeters thick these two pieces are\nabout three millimeters that one's 3.2 that's three millimetres, that''s five\nmillimeters so you could probably cut the 5 millimeter piece by scribe\nbreaking if you scribed it on both sides we'll start off by scribe breaking this\npiece of 3.2 millimeter lucite there are quite a lot of trade names of acrylic\nsheet such as perspex plexiglass lucite etc so we've got one straight edge on\nthis piece already so I'm going to use the square I'm going to put it on the\nedge and then I'm just going to scribe a line in down here on the masking you can\nuse a marker for doing this and if use a marker it is much easier to see but for\nthis demonstration I'm just going to use the scriber so I've now got a line there where I\nneed to cut it I'm going to align that with the edge on the bench I'm then\ngoing to take a straight edge I'm going to put that on the line and then I'm\ngoing to clamp that down in position now I've done that I'm going to take a knife and\nI'm going to score along there a couple of times. because I have such a small\npiece I'm actually going to release the clamps, I'm going to turn that around, clamp\nthe short piece and then I'm going to scribe break the larger piece trying to\naddress something like almost impossible because you cannot grip it I'm going to\nensure that the scribed line is perfectly in line with the bench and then I'm\ngoing to clamp that down. now that I've done that you simply take hold of the piece of\nacrylic and press down on it firmly I'll now just put that down whilst I cut the masking on the\nback and I'll just give you a close-up then you can see the quality of the\ncut like I said the quality is not that Good\nBut it is a very quick and a very easy way of cutting the acrylic obviously that\nwould need a good sanding down now to get a good finish on that edge. Like I say \nyou can do that up to four millimeters no problem at all you may even be able\nto do five millimeters or even six millimeters if you were to scribe both\nsides. I'm now going to take the knife I'm going to scribe that a few times on the top I'm also going to scribe it underneath I'm going to take hold of it and give it\na firm push downwards and as you can see that block very cleanly, so I have got a\nstraight cut but obviously it's going to take a bit of work to sand that down to\ngive us a nice clean finish you can easily cut acrylic using a jigsaw but\nyou do need to use a metal cutting blade so you need one with small fine teeth\nlike that or even like that that will cut acrylic absolutely no problem at\nall what you don't want to do is use a blade\nlike that because that will give you a really bad finish and will chip the\nacrylic really badly obviously you're going to need a pair of safety glasses on\nwhen you do this I've now got a metal cutting blade in this jigsaw and I'm\ngoing to cut this going very slowly you do need to have a jigsaw that's got\nvariable speed so that you can go slow you don't want to go at full speed when\nyou're cutting acrylic also you don't want to put orbital action on because\nthat will also chip the acrylic if you go too fast when you're cutting\nacrylic it will weld itself back together once you have cut it if for any reason you need to stop when\nyou're cutting the acrylic you need to pull the Machine backwards and then\nstart the machine going before you try cutting the acrylic again or there is a \nchance that you will crack it so that's the kind of cut that you\ncan get if you've got the correct speed I'll show you what happens if you try\ngoing too fast and of course if you've got to fast it\nwill weld itself back together like that! the advantage of using jigsaw is that it\nis absolutely superb for doing radiuses and\ncurved lines like so. A circular saw can be\nused like this it doesn't matter if it's mains powered or battery the important thing\nis adjusting it so that you get the correct depth of cut, if you were to\ncut the acrylic with the blade as it is there that depth you're going to waste a\nlot of energy by the friction which is caused when you are cutting the material\nso what you would do is just ensure that the teeth of the blade go through to the\nother side of the acrylic that you are cutting again you're going to need a pair of safety glasses when you do this and some hearing protection. The\nimportant thing with this is to start the machine before you touch the\nacrylic and go at a slow steady speed and take your time when you're exiting\nthe cut because that is where it could possibly chip you'll notice I'm using\nthe straight edge I've set that up so that the circular saw will use that as a guide  to guide it perfectly across the sheet so as you can see that cut that very\neasily there is a big difference when you're cutting acrylic depending on the\nblade that you use if you use a general wood blade you don't get that good of a\nfinish if you can get one that's got a lot more teeth you do tend to get a\nbetter quality cut which I'll demonstrate on the table saw but you can\nalways use a hand held circular saw like for cutting acrylic. This is the\nevolution Rage 5 and I have actually installed a special blade on that which has got\n120 teeth so that blade has got a lot more teeth than the normal blade that it\nshipped with the machine, I have to say this is very good at cutting acrylic\nI've cut quite a bit on it you can cut single pieces or you can stack them up\non top of one another and you can do what's called a pack cut and push\nthem all through the blade at once it does give you a very good cut on\nacrylic when you're setting this machine up you do need to adjust the depth of\nthe blade obviously that's far too high though so we need to lower that down\nand with this machine you just need to ensure that you can get under the guard\nat the back there so that's about as low as we can go\nthe beauty of this machine is that when you start with the vacuum cleaner it\ndoes take away at the majority of the swarf the beauty of a machine like this is \nthat you can get extremely straight cuts and also you can get really good finish\non the acrylic if you use a quality blade like that of course you can cut it\nusing the normal blade that is supplied with the machine but it doesn't give you\nthe quality of cut that a specialist blade will you need to set\nthe machine going and ensure the blades going at full speed before you\nslowly push the material through the blade this is a piece of acrylic which has\nbeen cut and then line bent if you take a look at that side you can see\nthat that has given us a really good cut and that's not been sanded or\npolished or anything that is just a cut from that blade that is in the machine\nIf we take a look at the other edge that was actually cut using a normal\ncircular saw blade so you can see that the quality of the cut is nowhere\nnear as good so that is the difference that a specific blade for cutting acrylic\ncan make when you are cutting acrylic sheet you can see that we've got an\nabsolutely fantastic cut along that edge and no further work was required\non that few months ago I made a gift for a\nfriend it was fifty and the base was actually made from several pieces of\nacrylic which were glued together actually cut that on this which is the\nrage 3 dB using the supplied blade with the\nmachine and that give us a very good quality cut which didn't take too much\npolishing to get out the saw marks obviously if you've got a CNC machine or you've got a laser machine you can cut acrylic absolutely no problem at all.

almost always recommend to do a test because there are so many ghouls in the market that is difficult to determine if our material is going to remove every deal plus there so we always recommend a test here is a list of the items that you will need to do a test on your floor and then also a list of every salt from the application alliterative are looking for select a small area one area where they're heavy glue apply about a 2x2 square foot area apply the material let it sit there for 12 min 12 hours and after 12 hours come back and give it dry apply a little more material make it wet and then give it about five minutes and then scraping if all the glue comes off at that point in time then you have a good positive test which means that you can do your project quite easily removing the glue that is in your floor here's the list of the items you will need to do the large project you planning and preparing and the job site it's also important that you prepare just that ahead of time and planned we always place cardboard if I saw the door of the projects well because shoes can be wiped on and that track the product all over the place we also figure out the way to exit easiest way to exit from the project as you notice and maybe steps to curl go up and then in access to go outside where you need to wash your tools and everything else the product is environmentally safe so it could be washed the drain or with no issues behind it the second part to look at is also you have to make sure the product is very thin and it runs and if the first not level it will all the possible tend to go one direction so we always create a small one-inch barrier of absorbent at each door so that way the product doesn't go outside the project area that we're trying to treat applying the fielding SGR 1500 remover here's the method that we love to follow that makes it easy to apply and then prevents from splashing and getting the area too messy we use a 9-inch very thick natural at least an inch thick and now and then we slowly apply it you want to apply it richly into the floor so that way it has time to sit there for 12 hours and not dry and penetrate through the blue now some glues maybe 6 or might be sent so you want to make sure you put a nice thick coat of the material on top of it as you can see we try to avoid walking on it simply because a material it is tracked very easily and also creates a slippery surface so be careful as you apply this and if you have to walk on it be careful when you walk on top of it as well this is a soy-based product which totally environmentally safe so there is no issues there's no smell there's no BOC so we could be working in this office as well as people working in the office next to us and there will be no smoke affecting them the probable remain in place for at least 12 hours you after 12 hours a path or today we come back and you will notice that in the in the video that the center of the room is higher so therefore most of the remove it has rolled down to the edges of the room you can see where has patil that means the old lighter areas are clean but wherever patil it dry it out so what we do is we do a really quick light treatment over it and let it remain there for about 10-15 minutes so that way a reenergize --is the blue remover and it's easier for us to scrape it off as you can see just rolling at a quick pace of the holes work just enough to get the floor wet we can come back later on and then scrape it try to make the Java sufficient as possible so therefore by reapplying a little more material it makes it easier to remove the glue of the floor you removing and collecting the glue if you need to walk on that web product sometimes we use what we called spikes use their shoes with little spikes on the bottom and those allows us to walk on the floor without getting a shirts dirty we usually don't use them because the floor it is slippery and sometimes it's difficult to walk on them so therefore what we do is we try to use some as little as possible but they're very effective if you have to walk on a wet floor and that issue is dirty the next step is we get a trash can with a liner in it so it's easier to dispose the material as we collect it we start by using the scraper or I spatula sometimes people like use the squeegee we like to use the scraper because it's a little bit stiffer than the squeegee and it does conform better to the surface of the concrete so therefore it picks more of the glue and Lisa - passes through it as you can see we're collecting the glue here and as we collect the glue we are spreading the absorbent the absorbent is designed for two purposes one is to reduce the puddles and collect the liquid and two is to prevent us from spreading a splashing on the wall as we collect the material in the floor as you can see he creates a small blick wa T area and then he moves the absorbent to that area the absorber starts serving the material and eliminating having a lot of this material running all over the place you also notice that we work from the door into the room and therefore we don't have to step on the material that is wet at the present time and allows us to clean other material a lot faster more efficient one of the most challenging areas and this jobs are removing the glue off the edges near the wall two reasons in this case on this job we have to be careful not to damage the freshly painted walls so therefore we try to keep any splashing or any material off the walls and when we work near the wall typically they're the ones that require most attention we will use another scraping tool for that which you'll see later in the video but as you can see here we apply the absorbent as we collect the material puddles and then we just basically moving around until we create a nice Mountain or material absorb and we can collect all this material and then dispose of it rather easily as you can see in the video you will see also notice that there's still some areas on the floor that look dark those areas still have a glow and and what happens is that the floor is not perfectly even so you're going to have some peaks on the floor in some valleys even though they're not this will officially available to us this still there and that's what the dark areas are so therefore they're going to require a little bit more treating in those areas so first we also reapply a little more around the edges because as I mentioned before they're the ones are more challenging and any main big spot in the middle that flow we quickly just touch it up with the material so it has an opportunity to work a little more into it in that area usually a 5-10 minute application that's all it really requires and then we get the product off the wall we will follow after we do that with a little scraper hand scraper that we have to remove the edges anything that might be in the edge that we cannot reach with a large spatula allows us to get very close to the wall without any damage and square those areas that may need a little more attention we will follow the complete edge of the wall just to make sure that everything gets cleaned up as this as possible you notice that the center spot already melting so therefore they read to wash washing the floor the first thing that we do when we wash the floor is to mix the seal Green oil cleaner degreaser that comes with a product we use this as I mentioned before is a soy-based product it does leave an oily base on top of the floor may be slippery and also we want to make sure that that oily surface is completely removed so that whatever the following tips that we're going to be doing with this floor will not fail at this point in time what we do is we mix it we shall pour everything into the bucket fill up the five gallon bucket the product comes in different sizes you may need different size containers we use a mop just to apply the material so we don't need to do that and then we in this skate you're watching us using the scrub brush it's a stiff bristle scrub brush just to try to remove whatever things are there that may be a little tight in the floor this helps us do that this is one method of doing it we also will be showing you here in the video the other method to do it if you want to do floors a little faster or you have such machine but it's a scrub brush will also work as well in doing the final wash once you press it a little bit we apply water from the whole clean water from the hose we always try to mist it so that way we don't have a lot of water just enough to collect and then we follow the shop back as you can see as he shot back to the floor it is collecting all the dirt blew and everything else all at once a lot of our customers like to do a second just clean water job which means they just basically after you clean up all this you come back and you spray just clean water shut back it up and that will make sure that your floor has nothing left on it of impurities to prevent you from doing your next flooring here's the other example that we use we use a sealed green diamond pad it's a pad that scrubs the floor it has impregnated diamonds so it really gives it a good scrub to the floor and removes whatever is there in the floor is not designed to remove the blue is designed to scrub the floor well as you can see he is preparing the device called the floor maintainer that applies the oil cleaner degreaser just enough to get a wet a heavy wet is better this machines the way to the floor the better they were and then he just goes ahead and start scrubbing the floor in a simple motion not too fast not too slow just enough to give it a good scrub to the floor in that area a lot of that professionals which is what they use to get a little more efficiency in cleaning the floor homeowners also some of them use this too as well because they don't want to smell that I'm brushing it is an option if you're doing very large floors highly recommend to use a scrub pad with a diamond and a machine they do give you a lot of square footage rather quickly with very little effort we follow by spraying a little water on the floor and then we immediately shot back and you can see there how clean the floor is getting at that point in time a lot of times up for it slip at that area and now you have remove all the glue from the floor completely and a lot of time so sick a second wash just takes place just to make sure that the floor is perfectly clean then we allow the floor to dry you Drive floor and final touch is dry we can we follow again the floor and make sure it with the skin scrapers now there is no items that are left behind sometimes just a little touch of sheer and they're mostly next to the wall where the most challenging part of the job typically is so we go around and just scrape them up and then sweep them off the floor and then the floor has been basically completed we allow the floor than to dry it's also important to know that you have several options you can do with this floor after the floor is dry as you can see in the picture this is a two hour drive floor a lot of character on the floor a lot of stains are there this is a 70-year concrete floor with a tile pattern that's embedded in the concrete which is really nearly impossible to remove off even if you go under for quite deeply so here you can see what the floor looks like a couple hours drive some of the options that you have from us is that once your first nice and clean you can come back and stain

All right, like I said, this\nis a very special recipe for me because the chicken-fried cheeseburger, it's the first dish that\nI ever made for Mythical. This is back in 2015 when\nthe only cooking equipment in the studio was a toaster\noven and a hot plate. Oh gosh.\nLook at that. Oh, I know the answer to this\none just by looking at it. Then you got the gravy here. Now I will finally\nreveal to you the secret that I just took the pre-made cheeseburger and kind of deep fried it. So I don't know what to tell ya, but I will show you how to do that. And I'm also gonna make my updated 2021 version of the dish. It's gonna get a little bit weirder. I mean like real weird stuff. Like delete your browser history stuff. And hey, if you like podcasts, me and Nicole have one of those. It's called \"A Hot Dog is a Sandwich.\" We got new episodes every Wednesday. Go check out the latest episode. It just dropped yesterday, because yesterday was Wednesday on account of now is Thursday, provided that you are\none of the 63% of viewers who watches on first day, thank you. Broken the recipe down\nto three easy steps. You can find the time codes right there, but we also get a full written recipe down in the description. Let's go back to the past of 2015, the thing that I said\nearlier, let's get cooking. All right, so we are making\nthe chicken-fried cheeseburger. That all starts obviously\nwith bacon gravy. So I'm gonna take some\ncold bacon and I'm gonna, there we go, I'm just gonna\nadd the cold bacon to a pan. We're gonna get that fat\nrendering out of the bacon. And then that fat is gonna act as the liquid to our roux. So instead of butter, we're\nusing bacon fat in there. So the whole story. Look, it's like \"Stomp.\" The whole story behind the\nchicken-fried cheeseburger. This is one of the rounds\nfor \"Will It Burger\" back in like 2016, the first\nthing I ever made for Mythical. And back then we can say the food program wasn't as advanced as it is today. And so literally the directive was just to take a whole\nburger and deep fry it as if it were a chicken fried steak. And so the bun really gets\nlogged with a lot of oil. It is a very delicious dish,\nbut it is incredibly indulgent. So I'm gonna show you all of the nuance that went into Mythical\ncooking about five years ago. Also, if you want to hear the full story behind my first ever time\nat the Mythical studio, I literally just talked to Chase about it on \"Good Mythical Crew,\" the podcast that you can listen to\nif you are a second tier society member and you can watch the video if you're a third-year society member. Head to mythical.com,\nsign up for the society if that's something that you are into. It's a really wacky story. It involves Chase and\na lewd Russian website. I don't know how else to\ndescribe it, but watch the story. So we're waiting, we're\nwaking for this bacon. I'm waking for the bacon. We're waiting for the\nbacon fat to render out and for this to get crispy. But meanwhile, we got to\nstart cooking cheeseburgers. So I got a nice little\ngrass-fed beef patty right here. I'm just gonna season it\nup a little bit of salt on one side, a little pepper, a little bit of oil in\nthe pan, check it out. This is the ultimate\nburger cooking technique. You hit him with like a step back then you kind of\nunderground finger roll it. And then I'm using a two slices of your finest American cheese. So I'm gonna put one on\nthe bottom of the bun, one of the top of the bun, that's gonna act as an\nadhesive for the burger so when we fry it, it\ndoesn't all just splay apart. Bacon is looking nice and crispy. You're getting all that fat. I'm gonna take the paper\nand just peel it away. Always season both sides\nof your burger, obvi, duh. I remember the first time\nI heard someone say \"obvi\" instead of obviously, and\nI was in a fit of rage. You shortened that word. So if you see, I got Maggie, look at, look at how much fat. Are you proud of me? Yeah. Now I'm gonna take this\nflour and dump it in. You've seen this before. This is a roux, typically\nmade with butter, but when you do it with\nbacon fat, it just gets nice. Gonna hit this with a little bit of salt and a whole lot of black pepper. Black pepper gravy on\na chicken-fried steak, what a treat, shout out\nto the state of Oklahoma, inventor of chicken-fried steak, one of the world's great foods. So burger patty should\nbe cooked on one side. Give it a little flip, then I'm gonna add a slice\nof cheese right to that. The roux looks nice and\ncooked in that gravy. I'm gonna add a little bit of milk to it. Then we're gonna whisk that milk in there. That's gorgeous. I said \"that's gorgeous.\" That's just a thing that cooks say. They just go \"Oh, that's gorgeous.\" Like Gordon Ramsey, when he salts meat, just goes like, \"Oh, that's gorgeous.\" Like yeah, are the white\nflecks on normal meat gorgeous? No, you just didn't hear\nyourself speak for three seconds so you said a word, and I know a little something about that. Anyways, we got this gorgeous milk sludge and then we let that come to the boil and it's gonna tighten\nup very beautifully. Beautifully. What? Have you heard of the hamburger bun? It's like bread, but it's\ngot like more film on top. You can look it up on the internet. You can find it. I'm gonna take a little bit of mustard. I'm using the Irish\nburger chain's formula. The burger chain, it was\nowned by two Irishmen. So what I'm doing, I got ketchup, mustard, I got pickles on the top bun. No, not yet. What was on that? Was there raw meat on that? Cheese! Cheese, cheese,\ncheese, okay, we're good. Anyways, what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna take this bottom bun, I'm gonna add a slice of cheese to it, and then I'm gonna take my hamburger, which coincidentally not made of ham, a little false advertising much? And I'm gonna take that and I'm gonna put it\nright onto this cheese. Again, if you look at\nthe architecture of this, which is very important,\ncheese on the bottom, that's gonna melt into the\nbun, hot meat, more cheese, melt into the top bun,\nshould seal it all together. What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\nflatten it out a little bit. I'm just gonna add it back to the pan. Kind of really smash it, get\nyour hands down in there. There we go. There we go. There we go. Give that gravy a sir. Just need the gravy to\nboil for about 10 minutes, really want it to tighten up. Yeah, there we go, that's nice. Flatten out the burger, 'cause again, we are taking this whole cheeseburger and we're gonna dunk it\nin flour and egg wash and then deep fry it, stay tuned. Hey everybody, welcome back. So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take this here cheeseburger, and I'm just gonna\nsimply dunk it in flour. You know what's about to happen. And then we're just gonna take it and I'm gonna dunk it in this here egg. Yeah, yeah, yeah, kind\nof roll it all around. And again, you could use\nany battering method. You could tempura fry your cheeseburger, you can panko crust your cheeseburger, but I'm chicken frying it, which to me means seasoned flour just a nice, you know,\nCajun-esque seasoning going on in there, you can use whatever you want. And now that we've got all\nthe flour packed in there, we're just gonna throw\nit into a thing a hot oil and see what happens. Well not see what happens\nbecause we've done it before. And there it is. Now we're gonna do that for a little bit and then we're gonna flip it. I'll wash my hands, give me a sec. I wish I could tell you like\nthe key to chicken frying a whole cheeseburger is there's no key. It's all a raw animal instinct, I think. You know, your body craves the\nchicken fried cheeseburger, the way I look at it,\nevolutionarily speaking. Also anyone who ever starts a sentence with \"evolutionarily speaking,\" probably run from that conversation. It's not gonna be good. Evolutionarily speaking,\nyour body is trained to want carbohydrates\nand fats and proteins. And this has got a lot of all of them. All right, so I'm gonna\ntake this here cheeseburger and I'm gonna flip it, and you see that gorgeous\nlittle browning crust on there? That is why we don't deep fry it. That's why we use something\nlike a cast iron skillet because you're gonna\nget that lovely browning from the direct contact with the pan. This cast iron skillet, it's been in my family for 19 generations. That's right, 19, we've been\nchicken frying cheeseburgers in that for all 19 of those generations. My Amish great, great, great,\ngreat, great, great, great, great, great, great, great,\ngreat, great grandfather. Amish was actually his name as well. He founded Amish-ism. So this is really kind of\na cultural recipe for me. Is the gravy doing okay? Yeah, it's looking pretty good. I actually do have a lot\nof Mennonite relatives, been in America for a long time. So splashed some oil\non top of that burger, really get the grease soaking in there. So I'm gonna pull these here\nchicken-fried cheeseburger. You don't want to drain any of the oil off because that is what we call flavor. That's the, like the water\nslide to Flavorville. It's all the oil that's gonna be just dripping off this\nright here, see that? That's the waterfall. That's the waterfall to Flavortown. People hike to this spot. They get married there, Maggie. So now simply plate this up. I don't have any garnish planned. I don't know if you guys think there's any good garnish ideas for this. I didn't have any. So all I'm gonna do,\nyou see we got a whole chicken-fried cheeseburger right here, and now I'm just gonna take, I don't know why I'm using a spoon. Should just use like a, like a mug. You get a mug of bacon gravy on there. I mean, say what you want though, this is good eating, come on. And garnish, you're gonna\ntake a single slice of pickle and place it next to the plate. All right, we got our gorgeous original chicken-fried cheeseburger, first dish I ever made for Mythical. But now I'm gonna show you\nmy updated 2021 version and like everything in\nthe Mythical Kitchen, it doesn't taste better, but\nit is a lot harder to make. All right, the 2021, this\nis the futuristic burger. This is the self-actualized version of the chicken-fried cheeseburger. What I'm gonna do is\nI'm gonna take the spoon that I had hiding in\nthe gravy the whole time and I'm gonna dollop it\ninto this here muffin tin, because what we're gonna do is we're gonna make frozen gravy disks, and then we're gonna take the cheeseburger and we're gonna stuff it\nwith the frozen gravy disc. Then when we cook that cheeseburger, the frozen gravy disc is gonna loosen up into a molten gravy core, and then we're gonna\ndeep fry that whole thing in panko to give it that crunch. So it's like a Juicy Lucy, except it's like, I call\nthis the Gravy Gary. All right, Trevor! All right, so we're gonna\nput that in the freezer. That's where our freezer is. I throw things over there and\na small robot named Nicole grabs it and puts it into the freezer. Also the updated version\ninvolves me grinding my own meat. Honestly, a really awesome thing to do is grind your own meat\nfor your cheeseburgers. I'm using a little bit\nof a leaner beef here. These are sirloin, sirloin. I'm using a little bit\nof a leaner meat here. I'm using sirloin tips 'cause I'm gonna be\ngrinding it with bacon, and that has fatties in it. There's fatty, fatty, boombalatty bacon, and then we're using some\nlean sirloin tips here because I want the best\nof both of those worlds to really coincide, and then\nyou're gonna marry the flavor of the actual burger. You're gonna marry the\nflavor of the actual burger with the bacon and the gravy. So I'm gonna this meat grinder on and then I'm gonna mash the beef in it. Yeah, yeah, there we go. There we go. You want to mash the beef. Make sure your beef is cold\nwhen you're grinding it. And now I'm gonna shove\nsome bacon through there. Whoa, go meat, go! You want about a three to\n1.6 ratio of meat to bacon. So I'm taking the bacon fat and I'm tossing that\nwith these sirloin tips. One of the best parts about\nmaking your own burger out of fresh ground meat is that you can sort of like loosely pack it. And so it doesn't just\nget like hard and compact. Hold on. Hey, do you remember the\ngravy that I freezed? I did it. So they're gonna take a gravy disk. If you see, you can play just\na little ice hockey with it, you know, kind of go back\nand forth and whatnot. So we got a frozen gravy disk. Just take a nice claw full of meat and then we want to hit, oh gosh, let's say an 11-ounce burger patty. And then we're gonna pop that\nonto some panko crunch buns to sort of like reify? No one says, who says reify? Anyways, to reify the\nchicken fried steak motif. Nice little thick burger\npatty, disc of gravy. And now we're gonna create\na thin little burger hat. Pop that on there. Now you're gonna pick up the whole thing. just gonna use your fingers\nto work around the sides and make sure to really\npress that together. I might be terrible at folding dumplings. I might be terrible at being a father, but I'm really great at\nhand forming burger patties. I've used the joke enough\nthat I have children. I don't. All right, so you see, this is a little bit of a prego burger. It's pregnant with a\ndisc of gravy, you see. So what I'm gonna do,\nI'm gonna sear this off just to get a nice crust on the outside, and then I am going to put it in the oven to get it cooked all the way through. And then we're actually gonna\nbe double panko crusting this because I really want\na really thick crust. And then we're gonna drop\nthat in the deep fryer and cover it in stuff. Now that we have this setup, what I was gonna do is I\nwas gonna pull this out and I was gonna put some cheese on it and then put that in\nthe oven to melt cheese. But I really want to\ndeep fry the cheese now. Any objections? Thank you. Flour up that cheese, get it into the egg. And then you're just gonna\npanko up that cheese, and cheese is gonna go\nright into the fryer on top of the burger. What you're gonna do is\nyou're gonna angle the cheese right above the burger\nand just pull it out and there you have your crispy cheese hat atop of your burger. The prestige! Yeah, that's good. That's fun, but this isn't\nmy vision for the burger. What I'm going to do, it was gonna be three slices of Gouda. I'm gonna take two slices of Gouda. I'll pop that on top of the burger and we're gonna pop it in the oven at 350, just for, oh look at that slide around. This is ridiculous. Look at that. You can pop in the oven at\n350 for about two minutes just to melt it, and then we're gonna put the rest of our\ntoppings on our burger. Fancy, it's French, idiots. So, what we got here, this\nis a panko crunch bun. Trevor made this from scratch. Trevor, you got glorious buns. They're supple yet I can tell weighty. So what we've done is\nwe've just brushed the top of the bun with egg wash,\nand then hit it with panko and that's gonna get the\ncrunch right off the bat. So what I'm gonna do\nis gonna open that up, we're gonna fly that in there, but first we gotta make our condiments. I'm calling this, I'm calling\nthis 2001 a space island. I'm making gravy thousand\nisland, that's what I'm doing. Gonna take some pickles\nand add that to ketchup, and then hey, you\nremember that bacon gravy that we made a while ago? I'm gonna take bacon gravy\nand add that right there. Thousand island looks a\nlot different than this. Well, whatever we're doing it. All right, so you're gonna\ntake some of that gravy island that's got all that bacon\nin there and give a nice, it looks less good than\nI thought it would. No, no, no, it's gonna be great. The flavors are there, and now I'm gonna take\na little bit of lettuce and then I'm just gonna throw\nit right in the garbage can. We're gonna take our burger\nand we're gonna put that, just nestle it atop the bun. And then now I'm taking roasted tomato. It's one of my favorite\nthings to add to a burger. This is a lovely beefsteak tomato that we've just roasted\noff a very hot oven, olive oil, salt and pepper. Now pickled fennel, add\nsome pickled your burger. I'm gonna put a nest right on top. All right, now we're gonna\ntake the rest of that 2002 space island odyssey, and then crown that bun right on top. There you have it, there's\nthe updated 2021 version of the chicken-fried cheeseburger, the first dish I ever made for Mythical. I cannot freaking wait to eat this. Man, I'm getting all emotional here. We got the old school in the new school. I can't wait to dig in. I'm gonna try the old school first. This is a bite of nostalgia for me, and honestly it still\nlooks pretty freaking good. Make sure to swipe it in the gravy. Oh yeah, burger is still\na little bit medium. Okay. Yeah. I get the appeal of that. That's a really freaking good though, but can't wait to try and\ncut into this bad boy. This is a big Bertha of a burger. Oh no. Oh, look at that. Maggie, I call you Maggie? Okay, I'm just gonna go upside down. I'm gonna have to split the hips and I'm just gonna bite into it and try and slurp out all\nthe inside gravies, okay? Meg, are you getting this? I'm going right to you. Um, I uh, I wish I had a beer, man. It's actually really\nstupid how well this works and how incredibly that\ngravy cooked inside there, because you get the meat\njuices falling into the gravy. Then when you slurp it\nlike a nice juicy burger, not only are you getting\nthose burger juices and it's really good beef, but you're getting all the gravy\njust slurp into your mouth. It's un-freaking-real. I need Jake to taste it. Jake, you ready to be sporked? Hey Josh, I'm ready to\nspork, how's it going? It's going good, we've been talking for the last like seven\nhours consistently. Yeah. Jake, I don't exactly know how I'm gonna spork\nthis, but I'm gonna try. I'm at least gonna get you a bottom bun. I trust you. Guys, not every dish can\nbe eaten with a spork. Did we ever think about this\nwhen we thought of this idea? Jake, I've made you a burger salad. Jake, choo choo, also the spork's now\nloose and it's swiveling. Oh, awesome. How is that? Amazing. Did Nicole cook this? What? I did it this time. I mean, it's pretty great. Are you sure Nicole didn't cook this? I'm telling you, my sweat is in that. Okay. That's the seasoning. It's a 10 out of 10. Yes! A little gymnastics, they're not even, I don't even know if they're\nscored on a scale of 10. Jake, thank you so much. Thank you for sharing in this\nsentimental moment with me, and thank you all so much for sticking by the Mythical Kitchen and believing in me and\nNicole and Trevor and V and the whole crew here, your\nenergy flows through me today.

Today lets see how to make crispy Medu / Ulundhu Vada. For making this vada, I have soaked 1 cup of skinless black gram in water for 4 hours. Now lets drain the water completely and add it to a blender. Do not add too much of water while grinding. Add less at the beginning, if required we can add more. Now lets transfer this to a mixer jar Add little amount of water,  if required we can add more later. Grind it to a smooth paste. Now lets transfer this to a big bowl. Also add in finely chopped Ginger 3 chopped Green Chilies 10-15 black pepper 1 spring Curry leaves 1 onion-  chopped 1/4 tsp Asafoetida and finally add required Salt. After adding all the ingredients Mix it nicely. Beat it nicely with hands to incorporate air into the batter it helps in aeration and keeps the vada fluffy and light. If you feel that the batter is little watery add 1 tbsp of rice flour Do not add too much of rice flour it makes the vadas hard. Mix it nicely. Check by dropping a small portion of the batter it should float on the top without sinking to the bottom. The batter for our Medu vada is ready, lets fry them Oil should be on a medium heat. Wet your hands with water take some batter and  make a small ball and make a small hole at the center with your thumb and drop it in Oil. Let it fry for some time. Now lets flip it to the other side and let it fry for some more time until golden brown. That's it our crispy Ulunthu Vadais are ready to be served. It is a great companion for breakfast recipes also makes a perfect tea time snack.

would like to share some tips on using asphalt millings for driveways and parking lots recycled millings have become a popular economic alternative to hot mix asphalt and concrete however getting a smooth non erodible non raveling and non-tracking surface has been a challenge starting with good quality milled asphalt that has been screened provides a more uniform material to spread and compact buildings from newer roadways are preferred over older dried-out millings these rough on screen millings will not spread out smooth and will be very difficult to work with as a finish layer they would work well for less expensive fill material to build the base for your project of course non screen millings will not compact evenly large pieces and fines will separate large aggregate will continue to grind defines loose and make them prone to washing and tracking they will not provide that asphalt paved look that property owners are looking for another advantage of asphalt millings is they can be stockpiled and worked with as time permits there's no urgency of getting them spread or LEED as there is with hot asphalt or concrete we recommend three to five inches of screen to recycle milling spread over a good solid well-drained base a good driver can dump and spread the millions in the desired depth you want reducing the time and expense in grading and leveling the millings milling can be spread directly with dump trucks for large projects such as parking lots reducing construction time and expense no specialized or large equipment is needed to place level millings for your project there even see you can use a skid loader you can use the polarizer as we have on our 3-point tractor small compact tractors or medium-sized tractors with a box blade Harley reeks or other pieces of equipment can be used to level unspread your millings the disadvantage of raw millings is they tend to Ravel the finds tend to track into vehicles and buildings and can stain the surfaces with the tar in the asphalt millings are also subject to erosion from heavy rain causing ruts and bitching this photo shows the most common disadvantage of using millings which is erosion from heavy rains on steeper roadways and drives notice the ditching which in some places is as much as six inches deep property owners have tried everything from applying waste oil diesel fuel and burning millings to get a non-tracking non eroding surface but dismal results some suggest pouring diesel fuel on the milling since setting the millings on fire burning them to create heat to make asphalt sticky this actually reduces the asphalt in the millings which is needed to Bondi aggregate together also the heat rises and does not actually warm the asphalt to any amount adding oil gas and diesel fuel to milling actually breaks down the molecular structure of the asphalt and also causes a deterioration which allows moisture to enter the surface setting it up for further failure from freeze-thaw cycles we've all seen how oil drippings damages asphalt and create pox and holes in the asphalt at convenience stores or on the streets for engine oil drips onto the asphalt pavement proving the the oil and gasoline damages the asphalt in the mix so what is the solution to Ruud rejuvenate the asphalt in the millings to bond the aggregate in the mailings into a strong durable service with that new asphalt look that everybody wants we believe the answer is Haq steel e blend it's non hazardous it's safe for the environment doesn't kill grass birds animals or insects it contains a proprietary blend of acid copolymers and binder that rejuvenates the asphalt and reminds the aggregate in the millings incorporating hak-seon millings blend will create a tight durable waterproof surface and reduces raveling erosion and tracking Axio a blend was developed as an asphalt preservative the first treated asphalt streets were treated in 1998 and still show no cracking or deterioration the first millings roadway constructed with Hawk Co was in Montana in 2002 as an entrance road into a light industrial site the road is required no maintenance to date in fact auxilary blend streets thrive on traffic once the mailings are graded and leveled we recommend one gallon of mock Co blend solution be incorporated into the top three inches of millings for maximum strength and durability property owners in Michigan regraded this street and then applied Hawk CLE blend this is the before photo of their Street project that is required serious maintenance over the years along with a lot of tolerance of the washing and ditching this is a photo of the simple sprayer setup they constructed to apply Hawk CLE blend and consists of a two inch water trash pump a boom constructed of 2-inch PVC 8050 fan jet nozzles 12 inches apart moderate and PVC adapters for half-inch thread and mounted 18 inches off the ground it has a couple valves to control the solution going to the nozzles and also to recirculate the solution back into the tank the 12-inch nozzle spacing worked out perfectly for them here the hawk sealant solution is being surface applied we recommend three passes to allow the solution to soak the millings from the bottom up the first paths will use about half of your solution the second trip will take less and the third will take less than that but by doing three passes it allows you to make sure you get it a good coverage all across it allows you to identify any spots that dry out quicker which indicates more solution is needed but applying Axio blend to previously compacted or driven on millings we recommend compacting the millings after the application we recommend compacting the millings three to four times in the first 24 hours compaction can be done with a roller or heavy smooth tired vehicle this is the finished street after applying the hawk seal millings lin andrey compacting the millings on that street in michigan ideally we recommend the gallon of Hawk co blend solution be incorporated into the top three inches of the Milly's a disc or heavy drag or similar equipment can be used for incorporating the solution Roxio blend will rejuvenate and soften the asphalt in the milling while copolymers and binders help rebound the millings to create a smooth durable water resistant surface you'll want to allow the treated milling sufficient time to set up before beginning compaction to prevent running and rippling new feelings feelings can be compacted with a steel or rubber tyred roller or a heavy rubber tyred vehicle with smooth tires smooth rollers will provide a smoother surface and a better finished look toxiel blend softens the asphalt in the millings which enhances the bonding you will notice a cushion feel as you walk on the freshly treated and compacted millings this cushion field will disappear as the milling spear and hardened into a durable service in about 10 to 14 days colder temps may add another week to fully curing flight traffic can begin immediately though notice the rain puddle due to water proofing of the hawk seal in this divot from a parked truck overnight but during the curing stage you'll want to avoid heavy traffic heavy farm tractors and aggressive four-wheelers and also you'll want to avoid extended parking until the milling shift fully cured here is a photo of a newly constructed millings road the mailings were placed over four inches of compacted 2-inch rock for a base and treated with one gallon per square yard epoxy OE blend and then compacted Axio products do not require high-tech equipment to apply pumps and things can be mounted on trucks or trailers in fact the sprinkle cans can be used for small projects you can visit our website at hawk co.com or our facebook page at hawk seal distributing and of course you can email us at Hawk CO gmail.com we'll be happy to send you a quote if you provide us your dimensions and in your project whether it's for preserving asphalt or

"[Music] [Applause] uh [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] i have been grinding the mess out of flour with this this has never been cleaned yet this has only been blown with air it's just me blowing on it i've never cleaned this grinder you've seen me if you if you watch my hip flower reviews you've seen me grinding flower constantly with these and basically it it's amazing it is so smooth uh this this is a fantastic grinder i i absolutely love this centerpiece right here this centerpiece go ahead and and scrapes that magnet right there so it doesn't get all gunked up and then like whatever they've done in the design against the walls it just keeps it from getting gunked up i don't know exactly what what they did but it's perfect man and the way that these the way that they they sit on top of each other it's just it's so smooth man it's it's it's so smooth this is by far the best grinder i have ever touched okay i'm i'm absolutely in love with this product it never gunks up it it it has not you can see some build up on it you can definitely see some build up on it but it doesn't build up where it doesn't build up in spots that cause any type of grinding issues obviously i'll have to clean this as it gets as that buildup gets pretty bad but point being is is i've i've hammered through a lot of product and it's still just as smooth it's still just as smooth as the day i bought it man these have been given some outstanding reviews the smaller ones and so when they decided to make a large i really needed to jump on it i've been grinding material for over a month now easily more than two to three ounces have been grinded through this okay and so uh yeah we're gonna go ahead and turn the camera around and just grind the crap out of material just so you can see it work [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] right [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] hey [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] oh [Music] bed [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] uh [Music] cheers i have never cleaned it still haven't cleaned it and uh that's freaking incredible walls are clean magnets clean buttery smooth no build up like no build up on the inside of here no build up on the outside of there after all that all that grinding and all the weeks i've just been pounding it this thing is amazing large brilliant cut grinder go get you one", "9Su-b8qgu78": "black cardamom or golly elechi these little beauties they are not related to green cardamom as such they've got a similar pod like structure but what's really key about black cardamom is its wonderful smoky flavor the way that they are harvested means that they are dried and then smoked and that's what gives them that wonderful really smoky smoky flavor so the way the image to use these pods is you would temper them in oil they're there to impart their smoky flavor and they're very gentle musky aromatic in the oil you wouldn't eat them because they're they're pretty solid but they're just there to push that flavor into your dish mutton Ron is a dish that's marinated 48 hours with two different marinades and I love to use this in that marinade because it just adds something really quite special so do have a look at that recipe you", "JPhqBsQNN6A": "[Applause] [Music] hi guys Dave Wilson here again now traditionally jewelers would have used Tripoli and Rouge for polishing precious metals but nowadays companies like dialogues offer a whole range of different products for different metals and different finishes so today we're gonna check them all out so come with me let's do some polishing follow me these dialogues polishes made in Germany so they should be pretty good I have seven here for a range of different materials and they also make an orange warm for steel these come in small birds which are ideal for a jeweler either using the flex shaft or a dremel the burst consists of a greasy compound with pigments and binders each one contains an abrasive compound such as aluminium oxide Rouge Tripoli etc I rather like sandpaper by varying the size of the particles and the material you can create different levels of abrasiveness and therefore different finishes on different materials if you google dialogues polishing chert then you'll see something like this and this shows a different polishes and it also tells you what material is suitable for and the level of finish you will get it's important to say that these are simply guidelines for example you may have a piece of 9 karat gold that's been hammered or put to a rolling mill and it may be quite hard so perhaps you might want to use a harsher compound vice-versa you may have a thin 22 karat gold ring which is very soft so you may wish to use a more gentle polish so whatever works for you but it's a general idea in case your hunt already noticed just be aware that the yellow burr is actually more of a brownish color looks a bit like chocolate also not the blue and the gray because they're also very similar in color to each other so don't mix them up you must start with an even sanded surface I like to walk to 800 at the very least an insurer you've removed any dents tool marks or deep scratches so we start with three polishes these are the most abrasive and we remove small scratches left over from your buff sticks with the dialogues here these will be the yellow which is a pre polish for softer metals this is a great stir with silver and gold there's also orange which is a pre polish for steel I don't have that one with these pre polishes you should use a stiched mop as you can see here it keeps the mop rigid and it gives you something to push against if using a small flex shaft or a dremel then you might use a heard felt wheel again this allows you to apply a little bit more pressure as the pre polish is more abrasive than the others go slower to reduce heat from friction once you've removed all your sanding mercs clean the piece it's important that you remove all traces of previous polish and keep all your mops separate don't allow any cross-contamination especially on your final finishing mops or you won't get the desired effect next you can use polish to get a shine here you have a range of choices depending on your material the white is great for silver and gold and use this with a soft mop like a soft loose cotton mop here or in a dremel you might want to use a little calico mop [Music] if you finish off with a very very soft mop you may find with silver and gone that the white is sufficient on its own dialogues also make a gray bar which is designed for polishing steel it's useful to have this in your workshop urn even if you don't specifically work with steel it's great for polishing tools such as bench blocks punches and hammer faces again use it with a heard stitch mark or even a sisal mop the green is a final polish for herb metals like steel so this makes a great combination for your hammers and your tools you can also use green on things like platinum because it's designed for herding materials so you've polished earn your pre polished you might find that that's sufficient but when working with silver and gold jewelry you really want that extra Sparkle saw dialogs offer several super finishes black is for use with silver and this really does give a great result use it with a very soft cotton mop or a swans dog mop they also have the red which is sorta like traditional Rouge so this is great for silver and gold again using the soft mop or a swans don't the blue is a more general finished polish so perhaps better for non precious metals like copper brass and other things if you prefer your pieces well then you should only need three polishes to get a great finish so the pre polish the Polish and the finish you might even get away in some cases just using two so personal a few suggestions for gold I use yellow white and red for silver I again use yellow or sometimes the gray if want something tougher and then the white and black on my tools using steel I gray and then green so if you just want to test the water I would suggest perhaps try the yellow on followed up with a white that should get your reasonably good finish on most items so I'll do experiment and see what works for you again there's no reason why you can't use a her chacon Pony if you need more cutting power or rely to compound if you want that extra bit of shine it's all depends on the finish the speed the firmness of your marks how we'll finish your pieces so experiment I like the size of these little bursts I think they're small enough for use for the pendant drill but still big enough for use on the bench polisher - they're not too greasy so the very easy to clean up in between stages with warm soapy water I think the great value from what I can see the offer good consistent Street free finish so personally I highly recommend them the dialogues range of solid polishing compounds I've been Dave Wilson thanks for watching and I'll see you real soon on the next video bye for now [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "HIyIGJcJejU": "in this video I'm gonna teach you how to install a subway tile as a kitchen backsplash now I know a lot of you think this might be an easy task but I got a lot of tips and tricks that are going to help make this job flawless and look perfect alright so kitchen backsplash is they're generally the basic home do-it-yourself kind of tile project right and everybody can install 20 square feet of tile or can you here's the trick this is a three by six subway tile traditionally subway tile is 50% offset so you get a nice little stagger you generally think that you'd start at the bottom and then you work your way up now for argument's sake here this wall is going to be its minimalist kitchen so it's open-concept it's just gonna be some floating shelves so we're gonna tile right to the ceiling which makes my project simple but generally the upper cabinets are sitting at 18 inches which is this mark here and they make these tiles so that if you put them on the wall they pretty much finished right a full room okay so there are a lot of tiles out there there if you're gonna buy them double check the size do the math from 18 inches and you'll find that in a lot of those cases they won't go install without any cuts that makes your life simple but what you they aren't gonna tell you is that most kitchens aren't installed level so every countertop section is going to be leveled independently of itself most guys don't install kitchens and throw a laser on the wall and then make sure the whole room is all the same height so if you start in one corner start working away around the room you'll find you'll go behind a stove you get to the other side all of a sudden you'll be doing all these ugly cuts and it's a disaster so what I do is I generally start on a wall like this I'll put one tile on this side one tile on the other side and then I'll throw the laser level on the other corner I make sure that my laser level is always set a little bit higher than the tile that's completely in the picture if the other tile has got a laser line like that that's fine I'm not worried about it because I can always come and do a little bit of grinding off the bottom and fit this row in so that it has the appearance of a full tile because when I'm done don't forget I'm gonna be using a thin line of silicone here so after grout and silicon the I will never pick up if the tile has got a little bit of a grind cut to it but if you try to just install it on the flat surface and assume it's level your tile will start going like this you're gonna get bunched for space your grout lines will be a disaster and that can be seen from a mile away so the basic tools of this job and when you're dealing with a backsplash you're not and you're dealing with a small tile you have the advantage to continue as an adhesive now this is a type one adhesive from a PI it's designed for wet areas so I usually buy this in a big bucket because blue or not I still end up doing some situations where we're tiling showers for people who aren't using waterproofing systems just because the code doesn't require it and some people's budget just don't allow it so I'll buy a big bucket like this and that's wonderful I buy myself a cheap little trowel like this because I find this adhesive especially if you're doing this at home you're gonna do one side of your kitchen the other in a couple of days it doesn't clean off very well with soap and water you have to use a knife to cut the glue off and after two or three tries I generally just throw this in the garbage and go for another one so I got tired of spending 20 or 30 dollars on a good one so I just use these ones there's a available to hardware store I think - like 4 bucks not a big deal so this adhesive is pre-mixed all right and so you're just gonna scoop it up nope just throw it on the wall and you can see it sticks generally speaking less is more here it's kind of like glue so you really want to trowel exactly lay it on and then run it off ok so that's the basics behind how to get the glue on the other things you're going to need for the tile job of this sort of course measuring tape you don't want a knife so you can open your spacer bag these things here are 1/8 inch rubber spacers depending on your tile this one does not have any ridges on the backside of the tile if it did when you put them together they would have a built-in grid line but it doesn't so it collapses so what I have to do is I have to put a spacer and every one of these tiles to make sure I can grout it later I also want to have a magic marker this is a glossy tile that makes a great mark and because it's glossy it won't be permanent if you try to do this with a pencil here's a pencil doesn't really show up okay you don't want to be sitting here fussing around with the tile all day long you want to just make your mark and go all right so get these markers I think I think these Milwaukee sharpies are available pretty much everywhere nowadays the next thing you need is your trusty little tile cutter make sure that the cutting wheel on there is in good condition if it's not check the handle in a lot of cases there's another cutting wheel laying in there it's a gift from the tile store a lot of people don't know that there's another wheel you just change the then not here right at the bottom and boom you got a brand new tile cutter so that's available if you need it and you need a drill with a Philips pit because all of your wall plugs have to be removed now if this kind of thing makes you nervous working with live power then by all means there's our kitchen plug is just go down to the panel this should be labeled and just turn all the breakers off okay and in this jobs this is new construction I actually already asked my electrician to change out the screws and put in nice and long ones for me so that when I'm done I can install this over the tile and still connect to the box and so he was happy to help me out with that okay so when you get started on a tile job like this you have two options you can start in the middle and work left and right for me that's maddening when I'm working with adhesive because then you're always having to clean it off and your work surface starts to get bigger and bigger and bigger and the glue is drying as it sits there so you're over here tiling on the third row and you got to go over there and then do the fourth fifth to sixth seventh eighth ninth and then start over here at the bottom again I Drive you insane so what I try to do is start on the side advantage a new build is I built it so the walls level so that means before I get started since I'm doing a 50% offset I can just measure and Mark my tiles this isn't actual 5 and 7/8 lovely so that's 2 in 9 60s I know my tile cutter so I'm gonna put a mark here and that'll be my half tile i'll just confirm that i got that right scratch creak that's pretty darn close all right so we'll just line that up again this time here we go all right now I'm gonna have 20 some-odd rose so these tools work really quite easy um if you're starting out and you haven't done much of this before push it up against a wall all right that'll give you a little bit of and you're not looking for a lot of pressure here just a quick scratch it's called the scratch 2 will not a cutting tool you really want to just touch the wheel on the edge roll it up over and then push it along and the wheel doesn't really roll as much as it scratches through the glaze so when you add the pressure the breaks nice and clean relatively speaking all right that gets us started we're gonna keep this out of trouble for a little while with this out of our way so max just asked me why do they call it subway tile and I was like well it's because of those old subway stations that's how they cover all their walls you remember the subway stations they used to be hand dug not machine dug so the walls weren't all straight and then they didn't have steel supports everything was curved and so these tiles are designed to take on all kinds of different movement because they're so small you can wrap them around bends and all kinds of great stuff well that's why they use these just for their practicality in there so I made my mark there for my laser line and I've just thrown a couple screws and some metal transition here it's just a straight edge and I'm just gonna build on this generally the glue holds everything just fine but because I'm using spacers and I'm going to the way I'm gonna do this is I'm gonna put a bunch on the wall and then add some spacers and then push it all back together again okay so there will be some pressure on the bottom row so I just put that there to keep everything from sliding around no really I find it easier to put the glue on from the bottom same as when I'm grouting a wall in a bathroom okay and then you can take the time pull it across following all your voice fill them in and then very similar to drywall just put a bit of a turn on your your trowel and it keeps it all from running out the back side it won't have big globs of it land everywhere hey that's a lot and then we're gonna just kind of anticipate our spaces for now there's no back butter on this because it's a subway tile and adhesive and that v-notch gives me perfect adhesion I'm gonna do is just kind of guess for my Crouch paces to start with if you do one tile at a time and then add your own space you're okay will drive you insane and it'll take forever I'd like to just do this get a few rows on start it up the tile and push up so you're always cleaning the glue out of the way go tight and then go up to the side okay try to keep yourself clean as you go if you're clean your job will be clean if you start getting covered in heat so just take a minute and get rid of it I'll be everywhere and then you'll spend all kinds of time trying to clean your table okay it's about as far as I want to go these spacers are rubber which makes them very easy to work with easy to pull out which is an important aspect of this too easy to pull out sometimes with a small little wall tile if you're using rigid plastic spacers you can't grab them with a pair of pliers and yank them out sometimes they get stuck right in there with the compression you can see what I mean just having a bunch in your hand and then running along to all these different joints move this process along open it close it okay [Music] and you won't of course put one at the end of each piece of tile and this seems a little bit monotonous the reality is it gets a great look right this is visual effect having as much texture very common way to finish a wall like this nowadays is actually to use a contrasting grout color so this client has got new gray flooring concrete countertops so we're going to be finishing this job using a really light gray on the grout so they'll be a contrast which is why these spacers are so necessary if I was just going with a white grout I might be able to just cheap I got enough experience for this sort of thing I could probably just put all these tiles on the wall stand back align them all the way I want and not even use the spacers grout it the next day and no one would ever be any wiser but if you're using a contrasting grout color no no you got to deal with the level of precision that just you need to use your spacers there's no way you can cheat so we've got our tile up to the point now where I'm dealing with the electrical plug no I'm not gonna go any higher than this for now I want to try to finish this this size of a spread all the way across the wall and then we'll come back and start the roll over again that way I'm always working where the adhesive is wet and I don't have it at drying out on me so the way you do this is really simple you just put this bad boy back in the box and you put this tile on your edge now if the hole where the screw in this plate is above the this rim then you're fine and that's what we are we are fine now you don't want to get in here with the trowel messing around just put the ISA right onto the tile okay make sure you've got good coverage here because there's gonna be compression with the electrical slide it in behind then push it to the wall all right that way you're not going to accidentally park and blow something up including your finger when it comes time for a cuts around the flood line your tile up with the hole in the wall not on the plug itself you want to maintain the gap on the box okay and then mark your grout line so that you keep that consistent all right I might take a little practice for you to know where exactly that blade is going to cut I actually put a little black mark on my cutter so I have an idea so I was lining up like that perfect okay and again we'll just step all this back up here keep working in the use of while it's still wet this type one adhesive generally has a setting time of about ten minutes so if you can't get it done in 10 minutes scrape it off put it back in the bucket that way at least it's staying with the rest of the moisture and won't dry out and on his own okay no we're here I don't want to be putting all the adhesive on every tile as I go I'm gonna make sure it's nice and clean between the between the stone okay keep that there for when we're ready no secret here is maintaining your line what you have to do is measure two and 1560s there we are that makes more sense put it on the wall and put it right on the grout line okay that is your space end the discussion get that on I know what you want to do have yourself a cover plate handy put it on your plug and put that back in position and see if it covers again if it does you're gonna be fine if it doesn't you'll have to add a sliver I found that generally speaking any gap between the tile on the box that's a quarter-inch you're fine 3/8 you run into an area where you might want to buy a different size plate you can actually buy the medium or the large size the king plates if you do buy one for every every electrical plug in your kitchen or it'll look funny now we check this one we're definitely gonna have to grind it so here's what we do we want to hover knowing that this area here all right that's all I have to take out now I have options for this if you're good with the tile scissors you can use your nips you can nip that out because this is a ceramic it's easy to work with or if you like me you always keep your grinder handy so basically [Music] when the grinder wheel stops moving then you can let go you learn that one the hard way all right there we go boom tayo huh feel like Gordon Ramsay so here we go wherever you can get a space rent at the end of each tile alright especially around your plug cuts it's a lot of times when there's a problem with the your tile later on it's because somebody got this area wrong once we get all these spacers in we're gonna just back up and bend over and have a good visual look make sure that it all makes sense just gotta move quick here because my stuff is drying on the wall subway tile always makes me think about the first time I've ever tiled the bathroom it was my own house and I was young married had two little babies and I was living in a rental and the place was a dive I was broke working in an Italian kitchen trying to be an apprentice chef till of course one day I found out that they worked every night every weekend every holiday and they don't get early any money so I changed careers anyway I was working in this Italian kitchen and figures the Italian chef was also a tile set and so he gave me a crash course well in the kitchen one day and let me borrow a couple of his tools and I did my first subway tile job all by myself off of a conversation I had with the guy in the kitchen no YouTube back in those days and it wasn't bad wasn't bad it'd have been a lot better and here we go that's pretty much all the information you need for doing a backsplash one quick note the reason I use garbage bags to cover my countertops is because most tarps that you buy are at least four feet wide and I don't like to have a bunch of them on the countertop then there's too much weight they're always falling off this is quick and simple you can get glue all over it and at the end of the day just roll it up and all the garbage is gone and there's nothing to clean so this is why I use garbage bags other than that this process we're gonna go right to the ceiling so it's just over and over and over again so just remember get a straight edge to keep a laser level straight and then you can build and not gonna have any issues so this is a perfect DIY project subway tile it's clean simple lots of cool designs out there so check your building stores you can get them with different details on the edges and kind of like a golf ball scalloped look there's a lot of cool little things so lots of options you can also go with the soldier row and then do angles herringbone these are easy to work with okay same applications lots of glue use the spacers and you can do anything you can dream up so if you like this kind of video hey subscribe don't forget to hit the blue button down there like the video for real these kinds of things are real important to us so we know what to bring

still\nvisible in isolated places ... from a time when it\nwas dubbed a \u201cGreen hell\u201d. In the closing stages of\nthe Second World War, it was the scene of bloody fighting\nbetween US and German forces. The path to the western Allies\u2019\nadvance from Belgium into Germany led straight through the forest\naround the village of H\u00fcrtgen. For local people, the battle is\nstill a key part of their history. I really came into contact with\nthe history of the H\u00fcrtgen forest when I rode around here\non my bike as a teenager. I\u2019d suddenly come across ruins\namong the trees \u2014 massive concrete walls. When I asked my parents, they told\nme they were the remains of bunkers from the Second\nWorld War. And once you know what to\nlook for in this wartime landscape, you can also see bomb\ncraters, trenches and foxholes. If you really take the time, you can\nfind a lot of these World War Two relics in the\nH\u00fcrtgen forest. For around five months the\nforest was the scene of successive, bitterly fought battles between\nthe American and German armies. Although the Americans had more\ntroops and were better equipped, their attempt to drive the Germans\nout of the forest was a military disaster. Progress was slow and costly as they became\nbogged down in the treacherous terrain. It was a nightmare. I don\u2019t think\nthere can be a worse hell. It was awful. It was freezing, and these damn\nshells, they hit the top of the tree and came down in\nthousands of fragments. They could\nkill anybody. I was in combat there for ten\ndays, at the height of the battle. I was trembling for\npractically the entire ten days. I knew I could die, of\ncourse, and I was terrified. An estimated 25,000 American and\nGerman soldiers died in the forest. To survive Hurtgen Forest was a miracle.\nBut here I am. I don't know how I survived. The forest was a death\ntrap for the US troops. They called it \u201cH\u00fcrtgen Forest\u201d after the small\nvillage that was at the heart of the fighting. The Battle in the H\u00fcrtgenwald was\none of the longest and deadliest battles on German\nsoil in the West. It left a lot of scars, not only on the\ninhabitants and their descendants, but also on the landscape itself, in\nthe forest and also on local buildings. For the German troops, the\nwar was in effect already long lost. Even the young soldiers \u2014 those who\ncould reflect - did not believe in victory. You just wanted to survive,\nto come home safe and sound. Nazi war propaganda, however,\nportrayed a completely different picture: By then everyone knew\nthe Allies would win the war. Everything that happened\nin the H\u00fcrtgenwald meant just a minimal\ndelay of the inevitable. And it indirectly contributed to\nthe continuation of the murders in the concentration and extermination\ncamps and in the prisons and other places, until the very last\nsecond of the Third Reich. Since D-Day in June 1944,\nthe Western Allied troops had been advancing from Normandy through\nFrance and Belgium towards Germany ... ... in the process liberating Paris,\nBrussels and Antwerp from Nazi occupation. We were told\nto, or ordered to, take the ground that they were\non and take it away from them, and that\u2019s how we\nadvanced to win the war. We\u2019re the ones that\ngonna win, not them. On September\n11, 1944, the first US divisions reached the\nBelgian-German border near Aachen ... ... more than 3 months\nearlier than expected. One day later, the 3rd US Armored Division\ncrossed into Germany near the town of Roetgen. We just went through the\ntown, and went on the other side. Then we got into the real trouble\nwith the first sight of the Siegfried Line. The Siegfried Line was the defensive wall\nbuilt to secure Germany\u2019s western border. We saw steel gates on the\nroad and Dragon's Teeth. And that was the first Dragon's\nTeeth that we had seen. Anti-tank obstacles known as \u201cdragon's\nteeth\u201d accompanied a line of bunkers stretching over 600 kilometers from\nthe Dutch border down to Switzerland. For western Allied troops,\na formidable obstacle. They had no precise idea what\nto expect at the Siegfried Line. So the closer they got to the\nactual territory of the Third Reich, the more insecure they became,\nbecause they thought they would still face strongly fortified and heavily\nmanned defensive positions. The Allies had been taken in by the\nNazi propaganda of the pre-war years. This went so far that the\nAmerican military\u2019s films, used excerpts from\nGerman propaganda films showing the Siegfried Line\nas an insurmountable obstacle. to explain to its troops\nwhat they were up against. As many as half a million men\nworked as much as 20 hours a day to build 22,000 fortified\npositions on land. We knew that the Germans\nhad built the Siegfried Line and that they were hoping that that\nwould stop us, but it didn't happen. Because we broke\nthrough the Siegfried Line, we took a hell of a lot of\ncasualties, but we did it. But we knew that the Siegfried\nLine was a bad place to go to. Psychologically, the Siegfried\nLine was effective on both sides, but its military value in the\nactual fighting was very limited. US troops succeeded in breaking through\nthe anti-tank barriers near Roetgen. But on the other side they met with\nstubborn resistance from German troops who were firmly dug in - in\nthe bunkers and in the woods. James Cullen was wounded in\nthe fighting near the village of Rott. Oh (expletive)! I got hit. I got hit.\nAnd, it was a tremendous blow. And I looked down and I saw the blood\npouring out right where my heart was. And I said: God, am I I gonna\ndie here on a lousy German field? Because it\nlooked deadly. A few weeks later, Cullen\u2019s\nparents back home received the news that their son had been wounded\nin action after being hit by shrapnel. He was away from\nactive duty for two months. With American troops progressing\nmuch faster than expected, supply lines were stretched, which in\nparticular meant fuel shortages for tanks. The advance ground to a halt\njust behind the German border. That gave German forces time\nto rebuild their lines of defense. Until then, the Wehrmacht had only stationed\nisolated units in the northern Eifel. Meanwhile, preparations were underway\nfor the \u201cVolkssturm\u201d \u2014 old men and boys, the \u201chome guard\u201d for\nGermany\u2019s last-ditch defense. In a televised\naddress, propaganda minister Josef Goebbels\ncalled on his compatriots\u2019 determination. As usual Goebbels\nwas lying, of course. He claimed that the enemy was not\nyet on German soil, although they were, and tried to mobilize\nany remaining forces. It has to be said that the German population\nwere all too happy to go along with that. They were tired of war\nand wanted it to be over. But they were also terrified of what\nthe Allies would do to them if they came. The Americans wanted to advance further\ninto Germany and finally see the war ended. Their aim was to reach the Rhine\nand then the Ruhr industrial region. But ahead of them lay a dense forest,\nalmost 10km wide, which blocked their path: The\nH\u00fcrtgenwald. In local villages, the war had been\nall too present for several months, especially due to the Allied\nair raids on cities like Aachen. The civilians sought\nrefuge in air-raid shelters. There were constant air raid alerts,\nand one day we came out of the bunker and six buildings had\nburned down in the night. The cattle were screaming, the pigs\nwere screaming, the people were screaming. It was\nawful. In September\n1944, the villages were evacuated as the invading\ntroops and the front line came ever closer. One morning our parents\nsaid: We have to leave. The artillery shells\nwere landing all around. We were the last\nones left in Harscheidt. My parents said: This is too\nmuch, we\u2019re going to leavse too. Instead of going around\nthe forest to the north, the American commanders decided to\nadvance eastward right through the middle, where they hoped German\ndefenses would be weak. But they completely misjudged the\nterrain \u2014 with disastrous consequences. A first push in October\n1944 ended after just 3km. It's not as if forests\nare alien to Americans. It's always highly problematic for\nan army to fight in wooded terrain. Tanks can't just drive through\nforests and over large trees. First you have to cut\npaths through them. The ground was also\nlittered with land mines, and the Americans ran into a\nchain of bunkers in the forest. This was where the Germans\nhad dug themselves in. The Americans managed to\ndestroy some of the bunkers ... But after ten days, the losses\non both sides were so great that the fighting\ndied down for a while. Shortly afterwards, American forces further\nnorth achieved a decisive breakthrough, taking Aachen on October\n21st after fierce fighting. It was the first German\ncity to fall into Allied hands. But this was of little help to the American\nsoldiers in the nearby H\u00fcrtgenwald. As the autumn rains began, the weather\nwas worsening from one day to the next. The US troops were\nliterally bogged down. Plans for a second advance\nhad to be repeatedly delayed. As one GI\nlater said: Anyone who says he knows\nwhere he\u2019d been in the forest is lying... On November 2, the Americans\nattacked the village of Vossenack, from there they took the villages of\nKommerscheidt and Schmidt via the Kall valley. But once again they\nunderestimated the difficult terrain. Some of the hills they had\nto cross were 150m high. When you reach\nthe top of a hill, you immediately experience the\nphenomenon of looking over the landscape, from one plateau\nto another. But you have no idea how deep\nand steep the valleys in-between are. The 28th US Infantry Division reached\nthe village of Schmidt relatively quickly. But then its supply\nlines were interrupted. If you look at Vossenack and\nSchmidt, with the valley in between, the only link between them is a\nfootpath that winds down into the valley and then up again\non the other side. The Americans thought this path would\nbe easy enough to drive and walk along, and that they\u2019d be able to move\nthe necessary troops, vehicles, heavy weapons and\nother supplies along it. Everything. But\nthat was nonsense. The remains of tank\ntracks are a stark reminder that the battle for Vossenack and Schmidt\nended in disaster for the Americans. The invaders retreated in panic, only for\nGerman units to cut them off in the valley. Tanks crashed down the slopes and\nmany soldiers collapsed from exhaustion. The battle in\nthe Kall Valley, which the Americans subsequently\nreferred to as Death Valley, claimed countless\nlives on both sides. A few days after the defeat, General Dwight\nD. Eisenhower came to the H\u00fcrtgenwald to meet his troops on the\nground and assess the situation. Neither the Allied Supreme\nCommander, nor his officers, had expected so\nmany casualties. The mood was\ndespondent. Autumn 1944 remained unusually wet and cold,\nthe terrain became more impassable every day. The Americans' hopes for\na quick victory were fading. They had already spent two\nmonths in the H\u00fcrtgenwald, the forest they had hoped\nto cross in just a few days. In mid-November 1944, the\nAmericans launched a third offensive. This time they tried to\nadvance by going further north, passing through the villages of Kleinhau\nand Gro\u00dfhau, and then heading east. A 22-year-old Italian-American from\nPennsylvania arrived in the H\u00fcrtgenwald. In his youth he\u2019d hoped\nto become a photographer. We were there, I would say a\nmonth. A month in war is a long time. The German artillery was in... it just\nnever stopped. They really bombed us. The days followed the same pattern. It began\nwith heavy artillery fire from the Americans ... Then tanks were deployed, Sherman\ntanks, which advanced on a broad front. And then of course you could\nhear the shells and machine guns. That was the actual\nmoment you realized there were other people\nnearby who were shooting at you. Paul Verbeek was sent to the H\u00fcrtgenwald\nwith other young recruits in mid-December to lay anti-tank\nmines. The US forces were constantly\ngetting reinforced with more men, and more vehicles\nand equipment. But they were not prepared for the\nextreme weather conditions in the Eifel. Whenever they got stuck\nin the forest, they dug in. But foxholes offered little\nprotection against the German artillery and the cold\nonset of winter. It would rain sometime,\nor the snow would melt, and the fox hole was\nalways filled with water. I was fortunate to have this camera\nwith me. And if you look at my pictures: I have hundreds and\nhundreds of pictures of officers. I didn't take those because I liked\nit, I took them to make them happy, so that they would give me freedom\nto take more pictures, you know. I tricked all of them, I\nused them like little boys. Both the Germans and the\nAmericans spent most of their nights in their foxholes\nin the woods, poorly protected from the cold and\nwet with makeshift tarpaulin shelters. I transformed the nature\naround me into a dark room. I would ask three of my best friends to\nlet me use the metal part of the helmet and those became the trays\nfor my darkroom at night. I would mix my chemicals,\nmost GIs were all asleep, I was working because the\ndark room was only the night, the earth was the\ndark room, you see. Tony Vaccaro took hundreds\nof photos in the H\u00fcrtgenwald, although he waited over 50 years\nbefore publishing a selection of them. All I wanted to take was take\nphotographs, photographs, photographs. And that's why I am here today, otherwise\nI would have gotten killed a long time ago. Some of the fiercest fighting took\nplace in a valley west of Kleinhau, in the heart\nof the forest. In mid-November, author Ernest Hemingway\nwas witness to the bloody battles there. In his novel \u201cAcross the River and into the\nTrees\u201d, based on his experiences, he wrote: \u201cIt was a place where it was extremely\ndifficult for a man to stay alive, even if all he did\nwas be there.\u201c In December, Tony Vaccaro also photographed\nhis comrades preparing for Christmas season. Gift parcels with canned food from home\narrived for soldiers long since perished. They began to give this food of those\nGIs to the local people, to the Germans. On December 16, 1944, a hundred\nmiles further south in the Ardennes, the Germans launched\na final surprise offensive. Once again the Allies were hard-pressed\nin this likewise heavily forested region, and had to bring in reinforcements at\nshort notice to stem the German advance \u2014 many from the\nH\u00fcrtgenwald. Even during the Battle of the\nBulge there was fighting here, but both the Wehrmacht and the Allies were\nso busy with the offensive further south that there was a period of two or\nthree weeks without any major combat. Then the war returned\nto H\u00fcrtgenwald. In the course\nof January 1945, the Americans managed to advance in\nthe face of weakening German resistance. The defeat in the Ardennes counter-offensive\nhad cost the defenders their last reserves. I particularly remember the first time I\nsaw the Americans as prisoners of war, I was amazed at how\nwell fed they were. And they were clean and\ntidy, including their uniforms, while we were a\nlice-ridden, dirty rabble. Once the Americans reached the Rur \u2014\nnot to be confused with the more famous, similar-sounding\nvalley further north \u2014 their way to the Rhine and\nCologne was finally clear. The Germans tried to blow up the dams to\nflood the valley and halt the US advance. But by now the end of the war\nseemed to be fast approaching. In February 1945, US troops liberated\nSoviet prisoners of war and forced laborers in the Arnoldsweiler\nconcentration camp near D\u00fcren. Many were also held in inhuman conditions\nat a second camp near H\u00fcrtgenwald. Over 2,000 inmates were later buried\nat the Soviet war cemetery in Simmerath. Most of them had died of\nhunger and maltreatment. Most of the towns and\nvillages in the H\u00fcrtgenwald were barely recognizable\nafter the fighting. The Allied troops pushed on, and within\na few weeks had conquered the Rhineland and the industrial Ruhr Valley\nas they advanced towards Berlin. The evacuated residents now hoped\nto be able to return to their villages. When the Americans passed through,\none of them asked us where we were from. We said we were\nfrom Schmidt. He said he had fought there,\nand that we shouldn't go back there because the whole place was in\nruins and the village had been mined. But we said:\n\"We're going home.\u201d The fighting in the\nH\u00fcrtgen Forest was over. But the war had left\na trail of destruction: a ravaged landscape whose\nscars are still clearly visible today. First, American soldiers cleared the\nmines that were buried everywhere. German prisoners of war\nwere also forced to help them. But they could only remove only a\nsmall number of the deadly devices. Again and again we\u2019d hear this huge bang,\nand another person flew through the air. So many people\nlost their lives. One little girl had been playing with a hand\ngrenade. She thought it had perfume inside. The hand grenades had rings on\nthem, and when you pulled them, you had to throw\nthem away quickly. The girl\u2019s hand\nwas blown off. A very central aspect of the post-war\nexperiences of people living in the Eifel was that they actually had to rebuild\ntheir lives on a former battlefield. Children died because\nthey played with munitions. It was dangerous to plough\nand cultivate the fields. It took decades to clear the most severely\naffected parts of the forest of ordnance, debris and the dead\nwho had been left there. It would take the forest\ndecades to recover. At the same time, nearby towns\nhad been destroyed by air raids. In September 1945, August\nScholl returned home from the war. After being demobbed, me\nand another guy arrived in D\u00fcren on a freight train from Bonn\nat the beginning of September. We looked at each other and I\nsaid: \u201cMartin, is this actually D\u00fcren?\u201d \u201cSure,\u201d he said,\n\u201cthere\u2019s the signpost!\u201d It was a bit lop-sided,\nbut it said \u201cD\u00fcren\u201d. And then we looked across the\nold town, it was one big pile of rubble. You couldn't see a single\nbuilding still standing, and the really depressing\nthing was this eerie silence. He continued to his home\nvillage of Gro\u00dfhau on foot. It had been almost completely\ndestroyed during the fighting. The locals resorted to scavenging\namongst the wrecked American tanks. The Americans had left\nbehind lots of canned food. Canned corned beef was\none of the main meats. There were also soups and other kinds\nof meat, but these tins of corned beef were big enough to make a\nhuge pot of soup for a large family. So temporarily, they helped us\nto get more or less enough to eat. In the first summer\nafter the war, large parts of the woods that had survived\nthe fighting would suddenly catch fire. During the fighting, the Americans\nhad used phosphorus in their ammunition, which ignited very\neasily in the heat. The locals repeatedly found the\nbodies of dead soldiers in the forest. Some I\nburied myself. And I don't need to explain what\nhalf-rotten dead people look like. You have to take a deep breath \u2014 mentally,\ntoo \u2014 when you do something like that. The first war cemetery in the area was built\nin Vossenack several years after the war. Many of the dead were recovered by\nformer Germany army captain Julius Erasmus, who dedicated the rest of his life to\nsearching the forest for fallen soldiers. The war cemetery in Vossenack became the last\nresting place for around 2,300 dead soldiers, and a meeting place for veterans\nand relatives of the German fallen. Another war cemetery was set up a few\nkm away in neighboring H\u00fcrtgen in 1952. Nearly 3,000 soldiers are buried\nthere, many of them in unmarked graves. Since the Americans didn't want soldiers\nburied in Germany, the former enemy, many were laid to rest in the\nNetherlands, Luxembourg or Belgium \u2014 at the military cemetery of\nHenri-Chapelle, for example. It was not until four\ndecades after the battle that the first groups of American\nveterans returned to the H\u00fcrtgenwald - to the place where they\nhad fought as young men. You can understand why it became the\nmurky - as they call it - H\u00fcrtgen Forest. The whole battle itself, like the\nman said this morning, it was futile, it was foolish, but the fact remains\nthat it was done to satisfy the whims of a few superior officers\nthat thought it had to be done. Well, I didn't\nenjoy it at the time. I don't mind being here now because\nnone of you fellows are wearing uniforms. So it's ok as far as that's\nconcerned. But it was pretty difficult. The commemorative events sometimes brought\ntogether American and German veterans: former\nenemies. The battle also left its\nlegacy in the forest itself. Over the\nsubsequent years, bomb disposal experts have frequently\nbeen called in to remove bombs, hand grenades\nand other ordnance. The dangers here will continue to affect\nfuture generations of people in the region. Even now, 75\nyears after the battle, the war is still present in the\nground of the Hurtgen Forest. This is an area that has\nobviously not been searched, like so many areas\nin the H\u00fcrtgenwald. Here you might still unearth a\ngrenade by scratching away the topsoil. Sometimes these things\ndon't look like munitions at all. For example, there\u2019s a German grenade that\nlooks like a cigar, it\u2019s about the same size. But if it goes off,\nyou\u2019re gone. In the first decades\nafter the war, hundreds of tons of ordnance\nwere found in the forest every year. This footage from 1984 shows the\nyield of a search lasting two weeks. You have to imagine that here, by\nnoon in a single day, in a single attack, the Americans fired\nabout 12,000 grenades. 12,000 \u2014 not 1,200. Given the typical\nassumption that 15% of these are duds, then we have to assume there are about\n1,500 duds in an area of 3.5-4 hectares. For a number\nof years now, researchers have been studying the H\u00fcrtgenwald\nusing the latest scientific methods. They\u2019ve been able to\nreconstruct the course of the battle in places where this\nwasn\u2019t previously possible. When you walk\nthrough the woods here, you encounter signs of\nthe battle at every turn. In all the open spaces, however, the former\nbattlefield has been completely cleared. In other words, we always see half of\nthe battlefield. And we can see that here. We are standing in what appears\nto be a completely level green field, with nothing to indicate that\nwe\u2019re on a former battlefield. But in fact, we\u2019re in the middle\nof a highly fortified section of the Germans\u2019\nsecond line of defense. Many local people have kept\nthe memory of the battle alive. In addition to\nthe German dead, thousands of Americans who had been sent\nto Europe to end Nazi terror perished here. Although this is by no\nmeans clear everywhere. Take the memorial stones for American\nor German soldiers, for example. The way they are treated on equal\nterms is actually quite questionable. It ought to be made clear that\nthe Americans were fighting for something very different\nthan the German soldiers. But you\u2019ll find them dotted around\nthe landscape without any comment. The forest is still frequented by people\nforaging around for relics of the battle. Even today the area is a popular\nsite among war enthusiasts. But many locals are annoyed by these\ngroups of individuals in American uniforms, repeatedly re-enacting\nscenes from the battle. It's kind of like replaying the war.\nSome people even dig new trenches here. So they don't leave this\ncommemorative landscape as it was. Of course, they don't shoot at\neach other with live ammunition, but people still\nfind it fascinating. I take a critical view, because\nthere were so many fatalities here. Whether it's fun or\nnot is beside the point. Today there are now signs for\nwalkers and hikers in various places, telling the story of the\nBattle of the H\u00fcrtgen Forest. They also remind us of its\nimportance for the Western allies' advance through Germany. But the H\u00fcrtgenwald will probably\nnever be a normal forest again. Certainly not now, some\n75 years after the battle. I went back to Hurtgen\nForest maybe ten years ago. I cried like a baby because I\nsuddenly remembered my best friends that got killed in\nthe Hurtgen Forest. It was ugly, ugly for\nmankind to have wars. The trouble mankind makes is he thinks\nhe's Italian, he's German, he's Spanish. We're all humans on this beautiful,\nparadise that is our earth. Beautiful!", "1pydKENqWL4": "hi I'm Phil McKnight Revels coffee guru and today I'd like to introduce you to our BS 870 we call it the Brewster Express at the heart of this machine is the stainless steel conical burr grinder that's built right into the machine it also has dose control which allows you to dose the same amount of coffee into the portafilter every time having the grinder built-in unlocks one of the secrets to making great espresso and that's grinding right before you extract espresso so on the left hand side of the machine we have a grind size adjustment dial this allows you to fine-tune the rate of extraction of your espresso also in the machine we've included a lot of features and functions and technology that we developed in our BS 900 dual boiler espresso machine and they include low pressure pre-infusion and PID temperature control PID temperature control is really important because that controls water temperature that's delivered to the ground coffee and that's the secret to getting maximum flavor also we have programmable one cup and two cup buttons please allow you to extract 30 mils and 60 mils of espresso but we also have a program function which allows you to customize these volumes so you get exactly the right flavor in your cup every time we also have a pressure gauge the pressure gage is your key to consistency if you aim to hit the same mark on the gauge every time you extract espresso you'll know that you're getting consistent flavors the dedicated water spout is really convenient because it allows you to preheat cups and it also allows you to fill a cup two-thirds full of hot water so you can make a long black we also have a large water tank which is removable at the rear it has a carbon resin integrated filter so there helps reduce scale buildup to keep your espresso tasting great so another really cool feature that we built into this machine is the ability to adjust brew water temperature why would we do that because it's critical to get the best flavor out of the coffee by delivering water at exactly the right temperature for that particular coffee so you can adjust the water temperature plus or minus two degrees C in one degree C increments another convenient feature is we have a removable hopper and our grind all you do is just turn the dial shuts off the bean flow so you can lift the hopper up then you can store your beans conveniently in an airtight or vacuum sealed container that way you'll keep your beans fresh and that's one of the keys to making great tasting coffee so let's make a coffee we're just going to insert our Porta filter directly into our grind cradle and just bump to start so you can see here we're grinding right before extract and that's one of the secrets to making great tasting espresso is grinding really really fresh we've got our dosed adjustment dial set here so that we should get the right amount of coffee in the filter basket every time one of the really really important things to making great espresso so we carefully remove our porter filter from the grinder cradle you can see here we've got what looks like a lot of coffee but that's how freshly roasted freshly ground coffee looks like all we need to do is distribute collapse and then using our integrated tamper tamp down nice and firmly and you can see there we've got the right dose because we've just got our top of our cap on our tamper is level with the top and our filter basket just replace our tamper wipe the top of the basket insert into the group head and brew immediately so right now we've got the machine is just in it's low-pressure pre-infusion zone and now we have full pump pressure and we've got nice really dark viscous flows of espresso and that's exactly what we're looking for so espresso extraction is finished now we're just going to switch to steam and this is where a large capacity thermacore comes into action because we have a really quick transition to steam only around 30 seconds so that's really quite quick we have our jug filled up to the V full of really fresh nice cold milk we're just going to pause our steam insert into the jug and restart our steam so what we're doing here now is we're just texturing and stretching our milk and what we're looking for is we're looking for some really really small microphone bubbles and the texture of our milk when we're finished should be really really glossy it should be like wet paint now I'm just using my hand to judge the temperature of the milk with a bit of experience it's pretty easy to do that when it's up to temperature it's just a little bit too hot to touch which it is right now so I'm just going to turn the steam dial to stand by drop the jug down use a wet cloth to wipe the steam wand and then we're just going to search the steam on we're just going to grab our espresso swirl to break the surface tension of the espresso and then we're just going to integrate the two together you so there we have a coffee made on our barista Express just like you get in your local cafe you", "FZRrfnwk6pk": "this is a real thick callus here how does this one I will make 19th April right about two months

this usually it's from twisting motions so when we walk we're twisting our toes pivoting and then that's what causes bleeding and then it causes that dark spots there and this is really text so we need to very carefully get down to it and then we'll see if she has a deep seated corn inside so you haven't done anything unusual but grew so fast I was sitting as scrotus fast I thought you went out and partied what did you put like a cat yeah for the cows is that like a phone thing yeah I just see it I'm trying to keep it yeah well this is the one I had decisional oh it's from the scar oh when was that Wow today Thursday you had a lot of bone underneath it huh yeah yeah now I remember removing that it could be like scar tissue here scar tissue can bring out the decals on this case but I've never seen it this like thick like this usually it's not this big to do something to it I mean it does get a little callous but not like this yeah yeah kind of shoes did you change your shoes twice no were they yeah well something happened if you didn't do more than usual then it could be like like you said could be your shoes something to not put too much pressure there but there's some deep spots in there you see a couple of spots in there that so something like this I would use some medication to burn up that deep-seated corn that usually helps quite a bit that's better huh make a prominent Nick yeah yeah you had a extra bone underneath here that we removed and part of that is a scar tissue from from the surgery which can cause this because you don't have a lot of padding in here so it becomes kind of irritated and then you know callous forms to protect your toe your body's trying to help you but it does a little too much sometimes so that's what you have two days a week oh yeah I want to put a little bit of medicine on so since the corn is really deep what we do is we put a little medicine right there to burn the cone so put very little not too much because it's really strong stuff protect the area and also not allowed that too is a tender or yeah it is raw so put a little duct tape there and I instruct patients to put new ones on every day after shower but keep this dried tonight keep it dry tonight so it doesn't get the water in I'll see you in a couple of weeks and who may have to do this again okay [Music]", "h1yPTt5IyMs": "Today we're taking a look\nat an automatic sheep farm. Now this will automatically shear\nsheep to get you tons and tons of wool. Now why is this super nice to have other\nthan the fact that maybe you just want a ton of wool, well because of village, you're trading in 1.14 you\ncan actually trade that wool. It takes 18 wool at the base\nlevel trade for a single emerald. And if that shepherd villager\nreally, really likes you, you could trade emeralds\nfor a lot less wool. So having stockpiles of wool is\nincredible for villager trading. So let's go ahead and build an awesome\nautomatic sheep shearing system. [inaudible] So here we are inside of Minecraft, and this is what we are going\nto be making, it is a very, very simple sheep farm. It's only downside is that it is\na little bit slow for two reasons. There's two things we have to wait on. One is for the sheep to want to\nactually eat the grass to refill. It's back of wool. And the other thing is the grass block\nthat it stands on to turn from dirt back into grass. So that the sheep can decide to eat on\nthe grass and then turn it back to a dirt block. How this works is that there\nis an observer observing\nthe block that the sheep is standing on the moment that the sheep\neats that grass block and it turns into a dirt block. This dispenser, well take the shears inside of\nit and shear the sheep are uh, our dirt turned into grass. And so the\ndispenser tried to shoot the sheep, but it can't and that does not hurt the\ndurability of the shears when it tries to do that. So that's completely fine. And then as the sheep will eat that grass, then it will know that the\nblock has changed states. So it'll try to shear the sheep. This\nhopper minecart down here, will grab it, then it'll go into the hopper,\nthen it will go into the chest. There goes in the grass. There we\ngo. That's where we wanted to see. So once the grass grows, it'll eat it. It'll get it's wool back and I can\nget out of this view, oh my gosh. And now we have some\nextra wool in the chest. So we are gonna make this\nall in survival right now. So here we are on a survival server. This is actually my subscriber server\nor if you subscribe to me on twitch then you can play on this server. But these are all the materials\nthat we are going to need. I'm going to personally make four of\nthese to speed up wool gathering just a little bit. But this bottom row is\neverything you need for just a single one. So you need two hoppers, two chests,\na hopper, Minecart, Observer, a dispenser, one piece of\nredstone dust, seven glass, one rail and at least one pair of\nshears. Although shears are really cheap. So I would suggest that you like over\nfill this with shears because they aren't renewable and they will degrade\nover time. So let's get building, we have all this in our inventory already. I'm just using this chest just to\nkeep some extra stuff in there. I'm going to go ahead and keep some of\nmy building blocks and such in there. So first we need to figure out where\nwe are actually going to build our farm here. And we're gonna want to choose a block\nthat the sheep is going to stand on and we'll build everything\naround that one block. So we're going to use this dirt block\nthat happens to already be dirt and we're going to start from there. So right\nbehind or to the side of that block, go ahead and dig out a space. We're going to put our observer facing\ninto the block that the sheep will stand on. Whoops. Not like that there was going\nto face into the block, uh, that, uh, is, uh, the sheep\nstanding on, like I said, and then put the dispenser facing\ntowards that block and put redstone dust behind and inside throw in\nat least one pair of shears. Now we're going to dig below that\nblock. So this is that block. We're gonna make sure to hollow\nout directly at behind it. And I'm also going to go ahead and hollow\nout a space for me to just be able to play some blocks a little bit\nbetter so we can get rid of that. We're going to place our chests and our\nhopper minecarts and such like that. So if this is the block that the sheep\nis standing on directly below that, we're going to eventually, we're\ngoing to put a hopper here, but we need that to point to a chest.\nSo we're going to put down our chest, we're going to take our hopper, point it into that so that the little\nnozzle here at the bottom is pointing into that chest. Then we take a rail,\nthrow it on top of the hopper, and then take our mind cart with a hopper\ninside of it and place it on top of that. And that'll make sure\nthat a hopper minecart, we'll grab things that land\non top of that grass block. So now we can fill this\nall up, just like so, uh, we will eventually need to\nbe able to get down there. So we might want to like\ndo something like this. So that we can easily get in there.\nAnd let me just make that like that. I will, I am going to put\ndown back some dirt, uh, right next to where the sheep will be\nbecause that dirt will eventually turn into grass and that grass will help\nmake this grass become this dirt, become grass faster and not. Now all we have to do is take some of\nthe glass and place it around our area that we want the sheep\nto stay in just like so. And the sheep will fall into\nthere and stay in there. Right before we grab the sheep, we're\ngoing to take the, our second hopper, we're going to place it into the\ndispenser there and we're going to place a chest on top of that. And then this\nwould be where you add extra shears. And so we could fill up, this\nentire dispenser was shears fill up. This was shears because\niron is pretty cheap. So you'd probably be able\nto do that just fine. So now it is time for us to get our sheep\nand in order to do that I'm going to make a little bit of a stairway up. I'm also going to grab my wheat from\nmy chest and we happen to already have sheep ready for a, for grabbing over here. And so I'm just going to go\nahead and grab one of those. If you're in your own little world, you probably need to get a few\nsheep or you'd have one. Uh, just happen to be around and\ndid not want a green one. But apparently we're getting a green one.\nOkay, follow me a little green sheep, and this is obviously fairly simple\nbecause sheep will walk after wheat, so we're just going to get him to a\npoint where he's kind of close there and we're going to switch away from the wheat\nand then try to push him the rest of the way in just with using\ncollision here. There we go. We got him in. I used F3 and B to\nsee, his hit box to push him in, but now he is inside of that little thing. We do need to shear him at least\nonce to get the process started. So let me just go ahead and shear\nhim up and that wool will actually be collected just fine. We're going to put that those shears\nback in there and now we can remove this little stepping stone and eventually\nhe will eat. There you go. He gets his wool back and then it shears\nhim and already we have three wool inside of our chest down here and I was\njust going to go ahead and make a few of these and they are very,\nvery, very stackable. So if I didn't want to use all that\nglass, here we go. There's my glass. I don't want to get in there. We\ncould set up another just right here. So an observer goes there,\na dispenser goes here, a piece of redstone goes back\nhere. So there we have it. These are my four little\nsheep thing set up. Obviously the bottom chest can be\nswitched to a double chest. If you want, that would make it super easy.\nAnd I've already added, oh, actually I took one of\nthe shears out of there. I've added all of the shears\ninto these dispensers. So this should run for thousands and\nthousands and thousands of shears just fine. And already we have a small amount\nof wool out of each of these sheep. And obviously this is more of a long\nrunning sort of situation than a very, very fast situation. And\nthis is super tileable. I could keep going with\nthis and add, you know, just a ton of sheep in here to get\nlots and lots of wool and then you go, that's how you make an\nautomatic sheep shearing system.

choice detail like a pro Mike Phillips Auto geek.com this is a metal polish by Blackfyre and it can be used on stainless steel chrome aluminum nickel finishes brass pretty much any polished metal and the problem is is any metal that's exposed to the atmosphere to oxygen and water primarily it's gonna oxidize over time and oxidation is where actual molecules of the metal surface actually attach onto free radicals in the oxygen and the moisture in the air and it takes it away and it shows up this as a dulling or a chalky look to the surface now this is a normal process and the remedy is really simple you just grab a metal polish and apply it over the surface and you can usually remove the oxidation and restore a brilliant shine there's a lot of metal polishes on the market most of them rely on either harsh solvents and coarse abrasives and they'll do the job but this product here actually does it safer it doesn't use harsh solvents and it uses very safe abrasive technology and that's really the key to removing the oxidation and restoring a scratch free brilliant shine now this is an aluminum velocity stack it actually came off a set of dual 660 Center scores off of a race boat and over time it has become oxidized so let me just kind of show you how to take and use this product to remove the oxidation and restore a chrome-like finish because the aluminum is going to come off and it's kind of a black color when it's oxidized it's important to wear some gloves this will just keep your hand from getting stained and when it comes to applying the product you can use a variety of different materials you can work by hand or machine I'm just gonna show you how to work by hand and over here I've got three things just let me just show you these this is an old-school style terry cloth i just cut this out of an old towel this is a foam applicator pad here's a microfiber applicator pad and which style you would choose to apply the polish depends on how bad the aluminum is the worse the aluminum the more aggressive cleaning power you're gonna need an old-school terry cloth like this actually has a little bit of a bite to it so it works with the paws to remove severe oxidation if you just have light oxidation microfiber would be a good choice if you're trying to maintain any kind of polished metal surface that's actually in good shape then foam would be a safe alternative okay so the first thing you wanna do is you want to just shake this up and this product is fairly thin but don't let that fool you it's actually very very effective then I'm just gonna take and apply some right onto my cloth just like that then we'll come down here and use some old-fashioned elbow grease but not a lot mostly just kind of agitate this what's going to happen is the chemical cleaners and the abrasives are gonna go to work for me as I just push these over the surface using that terry cloth as my application material and as you can see some of that black coming off that shows that the oxidation is being removed its uncovering a fresh base of aluminum when I wipe this off it's gonna have a chrome-like appearance and one thing you want to notice is I'm actually not pushing really hard I'm just kind of massaging this over the surface a lot of polishes you would actually have to really push hard to get this kind of polishing action okay and that's what I'm talking about that is what you'd call oxidation this is normal this is what you would see anytime your passion any type of uncoated metal and you're removing particles of it that's the oxidized metal is coming off and what's gonna do is gonna reveal a fresh clean base let's take a look at that and that looks like a brand-new chrome and of course just repeat this to the rest of surface until the entire thing looks like that that's the new black fire metal polish a great polish for any type of uncoated metal surface to remove the oxidation or move staining and restore a brilliant clear shine for more information on black fire metal polish go to auto geek.com for more videos like these and tattoos subscribe to our YouTube channel and I am NOT gonna leave just one shiny spot on this velocity stack the owner would kill me so let me just finish this out [Music] you", "LAquntA5Ba0": "[Music] hey YouTube Chris with RC Wurst here welcome back to another great video today we're gonna be showing you six tips that every sump pump owner should know so let's get started okay so here we are with tip number one this one's pretty easy you'll need you five-gallon bucket and all you do take the take the cover off your sump with everything plugged up and energized ready for ready for action on any other given day and we'll just start dumping water in here until it activates the pump what we're trying to do is confirm that the pump is working the more critical the application that you have or the more likely that you could have a flood then the more often you're probably going to want to perform this check so we're gonna fill this up and make it work [Music] alright so here we are with tip number two you saw tip number one cycle in the pump tip number two is on a regular basis and and you're gonna learn as you go how often you need to do this but clean the interior of your sump out sumps that don't run as frequently or more prone usually to getting a lot of sediment and stuff and as you can see this sump doesn't have the best lid so things can easily get kicked into there so it's extremely important to clear stuff out we grabbed this little piece of dryer lint here and that's definitely something that's going to stop your pump up if you don't really feel like digging around in there a lot you can use something like a shop vac like a wet vac those work really well in these situations and in this particular instance instance the sump pump is actually on a gravel bed so underneath the pump is a bunch of gravel because this sump doesn't operate very frequently most of the water that gets introduced just saturates into the ground it's only in in real bad situations that the sump pump actually engages in this particular instance so that's why it's again critical to clean this out and make sure the pump is working for when those heavy and things come then you're not sitting there at the flooded basement so on to tip number three okay so tip number three here we are and we don't really have a lot to show you but if you are interested in what we're about to talk about we did make a video about this particular subject and we'll put that in the description below so what is that subject well now that I've left you hanging long enough we're talking about battery backup systems so in the event that you've got a sump pump that runs pretty regularly or in the event that you don't necessarily want to worry about the system in the long term they make battery backup systems where you would have a secondary pump down in your sump basin that operates off of a battery in the instance of a power outage that battery backup pump is going to run off of the battery when the primary pump doesn't have electricity or in the situation where your primary pump is not keeping up with the inflow and it does have power this backup pump can lend a little bit of additional volume so there's multiple reasons to have a battery backup system and I think that it's a great investment in the long term because it can definitely save you some money and you know save in your basement is definitely a priority for most people so here we go with tip number four okay so tip number four this one's pretty straightforward sump pumps like any other mechanical thing with moving parts do wear out from time to time now some pumps are kind of unique in a way that when they fail usually there's not a whole lot of time between the failure and when things start to go bad so being proactive knowing what pump you have and how available that pump is those are things to keep in mind when it comes to owning a sump pump primarily because you want to make sure that you're not finding yourself in a bit of a pickle in the event that something goes wrong so tying all these tips together this is just one more tip where we wanted to emphasize the importance of knowing what equipment you've got and whether or not it's working so that you can be proactive and keep things from floodings essentially so on the tip number six five on the tip number five so here our tip number five we're well on our way and only one away from the final and fantastic tip so what we've got for tip number five this kind of relates to tip number four a little bit but it's a little bit different at the same time so be proactive again with the ownership of your system knowing the workings of the system how it operates what each individual component is these are all things they're going to be things that help you to save money in the long run because the more you know about your system the more you're going to be able to troubleshoot and determine on your own and thus allowing you to save money and also preventing you from being taken advantage of by professionals one additional thing that I would recommend that everyone do when you have a sump pump system is take all of your ownership documents and receipts and everything that's related to the sump pump purchase and installation and put that in a ziplock baggie and hang that on the wall next to where your sump is so that you've always got easy access you always know when and where and what with relation to the equipment that you've got installed so keep that in mind and now we're on to the exciting tip number six okay here we are tip number six now if you recognize what this is then you're not in for much of a surprise but if you don't recognize what this is then aren't you glad that you stuck around through tip number six so here we are with an alarm system what this does is it actually mounts to the wall and it can be mounted close to your sump or it can be mounted a little farther away depending on where you are in your home in relation to where the sump is so these have a very loud audible alarm that will notify you when the sump has failed now this particular unit this is the original let's see tank alert one series now this one doesn't actually have a battery backup but they do have plenty of options with a battery backup so if you're in a situation where you want to protect yourself or no in the instance for example that you don't have a battery backup sump pump you would definitely want to invest in the battery backup alarm because if that something becomes full and starts overflowing at least then you have an opportunity to do something about it whereas this alarm just operates off a 120-volt if it doesn't have power it's not going to work but the idea is that when the sub pump isn't turning on you've got a secondary float that when it raises it's gonna sound the alarm just like that that's I think this is a 92 decibel alarm that's in this thing so very loud and chances are you'd be able to hear it anywhere within your house relatively easily and another thing that you can do once you have one of these systems or if you already have one of these systems is regularly test it with the test button to determine if the buzzer is still working properly just to assure yourself that you're gonna know when that alarm does go off so that's tip number six get a battery backup alarm system or a standard alarm system I would say a standard alarm system is going to be more than sufficient if you have a battery backup system in your home for your sump if you don't then I would highly recommend going with the battery backup alarm so that you always know what's going on with your system so thanks for joining us today have a great day we hope that you enjoyed this video and be sure to LIKE and subscribe if you did if you have any questions leave those in the

"[Music] hey everyone what's up it's joshua here from alternative brewing and today we're checking out the fellow ode brew grinder now this is a product that many of you may have seen and the first reports of it are that it doesn't seem to have a direct competitor in the home market this is a grinder that may just set the bar it was the last piece of the puzzle for fellow products who offer everything else you need to brew a delicious cup of coffee now the odd brew coffee grinder is designed to be used as a filter coffee grinder using large stainless steel burrs it's practical to use super quick to grind and has a variety of deliberately engineered features that make the ode an enticing option for home coffee brewers and lovers alike so we're going to run down through the rest of the grinder now but first be sure to smash that like button as it does help the youtube algorithm and we'd really appreciate it so without further ado let's jump straight back into the video now the grinder is built on an aluminium frame with stainless steel parts and other than the hopper grinds catcher lid and the base of the grinder that are food grade plastics it weighs 4.5 kilograms feels really solid and well built and if you've already got some of fellowes other products then the aesthetics of the ode are gonna fit right in and at first glance you would say that it's almost looking like a baby ek now having a coffee grinder allows you to prepare your grounds right before you brew and it nearly goes without saying that freshly ground beans will always make a better tasting coffee to operate the fellow oat you just need to press the one button at the front of the base now the fellow oats hopper will hold 80 grams of beans at a time and it is intended as a single dosing hopper so you're first weighing your beans out and then grinding them straight through the ode we're not necessarily keeping beans up top inside the hopper you have the chute cover that acts against popcorning of beans during operation the compact size without that large unnecessary hopper of other grinders keeps the ode under 24 centimeters tall and it'll pack in nicely under any kitchen cupboard or even stored away inside it now the ode brew uses vertical mounted 64 millimeter flat stainless steel burs powered by a pid controlled motor and we could really take each part of that sentence and break it down a little further because for a home grinder targeting filter coffee brewing this arrangement really places the ode in a league of its own the two considerations when using flat burs that could be unfavorable but are intelligently mitigated in the design of the ode are heat created during grinding that will transfer from the beans to the grinds and having hot grinds just makes bad coffee altogether and there's usually a noise produced from flatburr grinders these two factors are generally related to the power output required from most flat bird grinders so the motor and the burrs do have this reciprocal relationship first up larger burs means a larger surface area for cutting the beams and this assists in the astonishing speed of the odbrew grinder in my testing with the ode using a full 80 grams of coffee across several grind settings it averaged an impressive 3.5 grams per second of grinding taking that to the daily use for say a regular filter brew of like 17 grams that's less than four seconds for a total dose so with such little time spent operating the ode i'm not overly worried about the issues arising from heat buildup in the burrs it's just not going to be an issue at home unless you're brewing say 19 filter coffees back to back or you are going to grind more than 300 grams of beans at a time for say a cobra immersion so one of the better features that goes unseen in the ode is that smart speed pid controller in the motor fellow adopted this design to stabilize the motor at a consistent 1400 rpm from start to finish so whether there's a whole dose of beans in your hopper or you're coming to the end of grinding a dose the pid controller will adjust accordingly to ensure that the same forces and speed of the burs are exerted to the whole dose this feature keeps the ode operating under a consistent 60 decibels when grinding and also contributes to a better grind size distribution so the smart controller will also monitor the load on the motor to know exactly when those last beams have been ground through the burrs so you have to turn the grinder on but it will automatically turn off once all your beams have been ground and it's something to get used to but certainly should be a standard feature on all single dosing grinders now the ode also features a grinds declumper that stretches across the exit of the chute it's two metal wires that stop the grinds from sticking together as they pass out of the burrs into the grinds cup now in changing the grind size on the ode it is a stepped grinder and on the front dial you can't miss it is the very large and easy to change grind adjustment wheel smooth clicks take you to each of the 31 step settings with a range of options from 1 being the finest to 11 being the coarsest and you also have two steps in between each of those numbers now there's no zero setting on the ode but the burs will touch around the one setting whilst new and it is suggested that the ode will take around five kilograms of coffee for this to wear off and you will also see an increase in the performance regarding consistent and accurate grind sizes once the ode burs have been properly seasoned and this is typical of most grinders now the ode brew is calibrated for all filter coffee brewing methods and fellow have placed a grind size adjustment chart under the lid of the hopper for reference i found this to be most accurate for a majority of brews i tested it on and it was only marginally adjusted due to the beans or the recipe i was using so i'll place this in the description down below at its finest setting of 1 the ode produces a grind size perfect to be used with the fellow prismo aeropress attachment that makes espresso you can find the link for that product in the top corner of your screen now my approximate crew sifting of these grinds it came out at around 500 to 600 microns the ranges from two to five on the ode i could see these being used the most as this will incorporate a majority of manual pour over brewers like the v60 collider and chemex also aeropress and the delta coffee press around the six and you're getting into mocha master and larger batch brews and you'll find french press is at around 7.5 and if you're cold brewing you'll find that perfect for around the 8 to 11 mark 11 being too coarse even for the 1100 microns of the crew now the fellow ode would not be anywhere close to my choice for a home espresso grinder or for any brew method that relies on a fine grind similar to espresso as it really doesn't have that range suitable for grinding fine it is designed to offer accuracy and a large range of grind adjustments so i suppose it does mirror espresso grinder's capabilities but it does so for dialing in the perfect filter coffees so if you're already convinced that this is the grinder for you you can shop it by following this link up above so i've always considered when grinding coffee there's going to be a mess involved it's just unavoidable but fellow have specifically added several features to help alleviate this mess and placed in a clever grinds knocker on the side found here and this you want to use before and after grinding to clear the chute out of any of those stubborn grinds and it will work to limit the amount of grounds found stuck up in the chute now the fellow ode uses an electronically grounded chute and chamber which also works to reduce the static build up during grinding now i have found static to still build up and i do continue to find grounds get everywhere but i'm not shocked by this it's not a lot and the grind retention in the ode is around one gram or under so long as you use the grinds knocker and perhaps give it some time after grinding for that static to disperse you'll have no problems keeping the mess to a minimum and to add one more further detail to the clean workflow is the magnetically aligned catch cut with plastic lid the benefit here is when you place it under the chute it'll always slip into place where you need it the one small dilemma though of having magnets on the catch cup means you really shouldn't be placing this on a set of electrical scales as scales themselves use magnets and it will interfere with an accurate reading so if you don't have scales or you don't have an extra container to weigh your dose out into fellow have provided ratio aid dots on the inside of the catch cup to measure in 20 gram increments up to 80 grams and the catch cup also includes easy pour fins to provide a smooth flow of grinds into the coffee brewer of choice without any grinds flying out left or right and that pretty much sums up the whole performance of the grinder except for one further detail that should be mentioned and it is how incredibly easy it is to disassemble and clean which is something you want to do with any grinder fellow have made it pretty straightforward here and so long as you turn the grinder off from the power to access where the burrs are the setting plate pops off with no fuss undo the four screws behind the large dial and then that will come away you've got a small shear plate you want to remove and then the rotating burrs will slide out you'll then be able to access the stationary bows at the back and each burst set has three screws holding it to a plate remove those brush everything down with a cloth to remove any dust or oil build up and place it all back together in reverse and that's the fellow ode brew coffee grinder for you now fellow industries do very well at pushing boundaries and they've proved this time and time again with multiple quality products that each seek to offer something unique to the user helping you enjoy make delicious coffee the ode is no exception to this and it brings without question commercial grade quality features to the home coffee brewer at the fraction of the size and cost so if you have any questions on the ode throw them in the comment section down

it looks like so you need a ton of batteries but it shows you exactly how to put them in a nifty little sticker and this is the part that grinds it so it looks like you put this is heavy um you put the batteries in you put the salt or pepper in here you stick this back on on there and then you lock it and then how do you have you actually turn it on you just like think you just well if you point

"PkyLWUWB9wo": "ok today we're going to demonstrate for you a Bryant Universal ID grinder some people call it a chucking grinder but this is a Bryant ID grinder it's currently wired for 220 volts and let me go through a few features on it for you obviously we have the hydraulic unit here back in the machine is the coolant system mounted over here on the side of the electric cabinet is the oil a system miss system for the lubrication of the ID spindle we have a wood a W a Woodward diaphragm Chuck here with one two three four five six jaws this is a very expensive chuck this is being made today by a company called for cart which is a division of hard edge company very high precision very high tolerance a very expensive Chuck actually so this is a nice item and with the machine comes a lot of these jaws for this of course most of them are custom made and people would make their own for their own particular jobs we have the headstock here which has that electric motor but a hydraulic motor through the spindle here is the air for driving the diaphragm collet this is your work head slide and this is your cross slide now on a Bryant like a heeled this cross slide is hydrostatic weighs in other words the machine doesn't actually ride on the ways it floats on the waist and if we come up to close here we can get a an idea I have the rear cover I have some of the guards off the machine just for us hooking it up and unhooking it and for the video so you see here the the front block here is which is actually the part that floats and guides the machine in this direction and in this direction and in the back it's kind of pushing forward but this is beautiful scraping yet because it just never gets worn out it never actually rides on the weighs themselves okay so moving along here this is your cross feed this is your table movement you pull this out to engage it push it in to disengage it this is your feed control box this is your in feed hand wheel and it's calibrated in I think tenths I'm not sure and half thousands and you have a zero stop at that stop pin you have a fine feed wheel here to feed this in very finally as you go along if you want it just to work manually over here you can disengage this hand wheel or engage it into the automatic feed this is a dead stop that you can engage or disengage now when this starts feeding this knob here is to adjust the the frequency that it feeds and the knob on the side is the amount that it feeds so I'm gonna go ahead and on the hydraulic headstock we're off now and this would be one position and this would be rotating the other direction and in the center position it would be off and the speed is controlled by this hydraulic switch here we're gonna go ahead and start the hydraulic pump now these machines are kind of noisy but you see here we have our table it's got a nice float I mean this is a big heavy table and I can I can it practically wants to roll just because the floor in here is not straight so I'm gonna turn this on it won't move as long as this hand wheel is out so we'll put the hand wheel back in and we get our stroke here and we want to start the headstock [Music] and up here is where we change the rpm and this is your headstock adjustment here for in-and-out so you see here as this goes along it feeds [Music] and I can control the amount that that feeds or how often it feeds you like to set it so that the wheel comes out of the part and then it feeds and then goes back in now on a Bryant unlike a heel if you just you could shut off your table and actually let this continue to plunge in because the infeed here doesn't depend on your table reversal lever here like a lot of grinders do this will continue to feed [Music]", "aI_ZGQW5OTM": "hey everybody I get lots of non cooking related questions concerning the Blackstone I originally seasoned this black stone 36 inch griddle 2 years ago it's seen lots of heavy use but as you can see the seasoning on the grill top is starting to get slightly uneven nothing out of the ordinary here because the griddle top seasoning is an ever-changing surface the more you cook on it the more seasoning you're gonna have so today I'm going to show you one way to remove the seasoning to strip the seasoning off of your griddle [Music] the griddle top is made out of cold rolled steel you're not gonna hurt it I could take a hammer to it and I'm not gonna do much damage there are a number of ways that you can strip off the old seasoning this year at black stone we're gonna be coming out with a griddle recovery kit for the method that I'll show you how to do today you'll need an orbital sander sanding disk safety glasses and oil it really doesn't matter what grit you're going to use I happen to have some sixty grit on my sander right now and you'll obviously cover a lot of sanding discs but it'll be worth it in the end when I have a brand-new griddle top surface as you sand down you'll start to reveal the weld marks from the underside of the griddle that's just where the supports and the legs on the bottom side of the griddle are welded be sure to make the most of your sanding disc switching from sanding at an angle to sanding flatly it's dirty work as you can see you're gonna be covered in dust from head to toe [Music] [Music] it's definitely hard work it's tedious it took me a good hour and 15 minutes of sanding to sand off that old seasoning [Music] and you're left with a smooth clean surface you can even see the reflection of our gigantic ponderosa pines in my sanded griddle top and now I can go ahead and fire up the griddle all four burners on high of course so we can dry out that steel [Music] great value canola oil from Walmart nothing fancy and this is the birthing process of my brand-new griddle top there's so much misinformation out there on how to correctly season a griddle top granted you do have some room for creativity but I see lots of people on forums and on videos insisting that you use high-dollar flaxseed oil and that is absurd I do this for a living last year probably the last year conservatively I've set up and used 28 36 22 and 17 inch of black stone griddles across the country probably seasoned at least 40 45 brand new griddles canola oil or olive oil now listen if you want to use flaxseed oil you're welcome to there's nothing wrong with that a canola oil and olive oil will do the trick perfectly you can see my new steel is starting to develop a little bit of color this is what a griddle warrior looks like the way I do this when I'm setting up a new griddle I let it burn on high I keep rubbing in oil to keep that top nice and wet and then you just start cooking 30 45 minutes in I start cooking online there are a lot of people that say you have to see he's had hit four times one guy said he sees in his six times I read one guy that seasoned his ten or twelve times not necessary as you start to cook that's gonna give you all the seasoning you need I pulled a couple pounds of frozen Zaycon bacon out of our freezer I'll melt this down and we'll cook up the whole batch and as the bacon starts to melt and cook you just start spreading that bacon all over your griddle table [Music] and that's all there is to it the griddle is ready to give to my friend Kevin I don't need it anymore because I just got my brand-new black stone 36 inch griddle cooking station with rear grease management you saw me using that in the Orlando show so Kevin just keep it oiled and after you've cooked a few meals on here maybe a stir fry dish a bunch of burgers with sauteed onions and mushrooms this griddle top will start to completely blacken and be beautifully seasoned make sure you subscribe if you haven't subscribed leave me a thumbs up and until next time this is plod saying praise the Lord", "O6bFWVB2BRY": "hey Luke here at the outdoor boys YouTube channel and I've got a bunch of cast iron cookware here that needs repair needs restoration and need some seasoning and we're gonna walk you through how to do just that [Music] welcome to the show and let me introduce you to the cast iron and this is my modern-day Lodge Dutch oven and it is grimy and full of old oil and soot and ash and needs to be cleaned badly but other than it's doing pretty good so I'm gonna use this to demonstrate how to clean cast iron this is another piece of modern Lodge cookware it's a griddle and it's been used and abused to the seasonings all gone and it's covered in rust and it has a lot of damage but no pitting and nothing too serious I'm gonna use this to demonstrate knocking off some loose rust and REE seasoning this skillet was made by lodge a few years ago and it has been used and abused it's doing okay on the inside just need some reasoning but on the back it's got some pretty heavy-duty rust damage so I'm gonna remove the rust and then re season the whole thing this is an unmarked Wagner skillet it's a ten and a half inch skillet from probably around the 1950s and it is in some bad shape it is covered completely and rust with absolutely no seasoning I'm able to tell it's a Wagner because of the font and the lettering it says ten and a half inch skillet and then it has the size number or on it and it's got the size on the top of the handle additionally I can tell it's post 1950s because it's got a smooth bottom but it doesn't say made in the USA on it this is a very old pot it's got a gate mark which is a mark left over from the manufacturing process which puts it probably in the 1800's sometime and it is in really rough shape it has got lots of heavy pitting heavy rust and the inside of it it has an enamel lining that's very damaged and it has about 1/8 inch deep pits all throughout the bottom so this thing is in serious trouble I really don't know if I can save this one but we're gonna try alright guys it's time to get the rust off this cast iron and to do that I'm gonna use three different methods the first method I'm going to use is electrolysis the second method is a vinegar bath and thirdly I'm going to use coca-cola this is my first time using the coca-cola method so I'm going to get a chance to compare it against the vinegar method to make it electrolysis baths all you need is a plastic bin full of water and then you're gonna want to add a fair amount of baking soda in this amount of water I'm putting about an eighth of a cup of baking soda mix it up really good and then get yourself a piece of metal you don't mind ruining in this example I've got a piece of old rebar then I'm gonna take my old pot and I'm gonna sink it down in here and I've got it hanging suspended in the water I don't want it resting on the bottom and I've got it tied with a piece of metal coat hanger in this example now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna hook up a battery charger to this and I'm gonna put the positive on the sacrificial anode that you want to ruin and I'm gonna put the negative on the pot that I want the rust to come off of the more amps you run through this the more aggressively it's going to to work you can tell things are starting to work when you'll see bubbles and fizzing the closer you place the sacrificial anode to the base metal the stronger the reaction and so you can effectuate which part you want to focus on based on where you put the anode put the anode here this parts gonna clean the fastest now for this skillet I'm going to use vinegar to get the rust off I'm just gonna put it in this plastic pin here and I've got a gallon of white distilled vinegar that's five percent acidity so was three dollars at the grocery store and we're just gonna pour it on alright we're gonna let that soak for about an hour then we're gonna scrub it and soak it again and scrub it and soak it until it's clean next we're gonna clean these two pieces of cast iron using original coca-cola I've never done this before so I'm just gonna kind of do it like I would vinegar and see how it comes out [Music] of these three methods hands-down my favorite for this type of work is the vinegar bath the electrolysis works but it's really fidgety you have all this stuff you need to set up you know this charger and you need to constantly move the anode around to get it evenly across to all the surfaces the vinegar you just dump it in a bucket of vinegar and it seems to work fine the coca-cola works but not as well as the vinegar and it's more expensive there's a lot of products and chemicals out on the market they'll get rid of rust really well and even better than vinegar however I don't know if I want to be putting those chemicals on my cookware and letting it soak for hours at a time the vinegar the coca-cola the electrolysis all it does is loosen the rust it doesn't actually get it off you still have to use some elbow grease to do that you can use a scouring pad at or boy a wire brush a drill an angle grinder whatever helps you can use it I got this little wire adapter at the end of a drill I'm going to use it to try to get the remainder of this rust off and if I can't do it I'll put it back in the vinegar and soak it some more [Music] well you can see what a difference that's already making getting down to bare cast-iron [Music] all right well the cast-iron skillets been sitting in the vinegar for another hour and we're gonna see if the more stubborn spots have loosened up [Music] let's rinse it off in some vinegar and make sure we got everything that's ten and a half inch skillet is looking really good just a few places to touch up and it'll be done so rinse it off in the vinegar and as you can see it's just all nice and shiny so we are all ready to season this thing you can see here some of the black spots where the electrolysis has already started to work rust is really coming off right there now restoring this pot is going to be a special kind of challenge it's got this broken enamel lining on the inside and I cannot fix it there's really nothing I could do about that so the best thing to do is try to remove the enamel lining probably the best way to get rid of the enamel lining would be a using glass beads in a sandblaster I do not have that equipment so instead I'm going to use this this stripper here on a power drill and hopefully I can take off the enamel this doesn't work I'm gonna upgrade to an angle grinder and see how that does I'm going to be doing this forever at this speed I'm going to try out the angle grinder and see how well that handles [Music] well guys I did something stupid hey it was grinding and grinding and grinding away at this enamel and there's an hour into it and you can see how little progress I've made so I thought maybe I could speed this up if I just gently tap it with a ball-peen hammer I can just chip away the enamel and break it off and that would speed up the process and I was being extremely gentle and look at this right there just busted a hole right in the caster and it cracked all over this pot is from the 1800s and I just broke it learn from my mistakes first off don't try to buy antique pots with damaged enamel linings they are a pain in the butt second of all don't try to knock the enamel off with a hammer this is the one that was soaking in the coca-cola let's get the rust off here there's some serious rust on it this one was really easy only took one soak in the coca-cola and five minutes or so with the English minor and the brush to get it all completely done it wasn't too bad well this griddle is pretty well off so I'm really expecting to do everything quite quickly with just the electric drill [Music] [Music] well that looks pretty good got the rust off the griddle very easily and now one thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna smooth the surface a little bit now this is a modern-day Lodge cast-iron griddle Lodge deliberately makes their surfaces slightly textured so that it can pre season them that they can and season them quickly and cheaply at the factory so what I'm going to do is I'm going to take this little thing right here and I'm gonna go and hit the surface and just take some of that texture off and that will smooth it out [Music] well this is a whole lot smoother and it's still a few pits in here and grooves so there's places for the oil to to bake on in but he'll take fewer layers of seasoning for this to become really excellent nonstick once you remove all the rust the exposed iron is really susceptible to rusting and corrosion and you can happen in a matter of hours so ideally you want to season your cast iron immediately after removing the rust that's not realistic for me today I ran out of time and it's gonna be a couple days before I pick this project up again so I'm gonna leave all this cast iron sitting in this vinegar submerged and I'll pick it up again in a couple days and it'll have no corrosion on it look at that just a couple days ago it was solid rust now it's bare cast iron now we need to clean off the caster and get all that dirt and grime and metal shavings off the cast iron now we're gonna do this using soap and water now I know some of you out there thinking oh no you never never use soap and water to clean cast iron that's not true you don't use soap and water to clean seasoned cast iron so at this point we want to get as clean as possible soap is the appropriate thing to do once it's seasoned don't use soap and you want to get the water as hot as possible here if you want to know if you did a good job take a white paper towel hang it down the towel comes back relatively clean looking you did a good job and the towel comes back black you know you still have some scrubbing to do once you've got it nice and clean towel dry the cast iron and put it in the of it we're just gonna put it in the oven long enough to make sure it's bone-dry [Music] gotta admit that's impressive transformation that thing looks good if you have a piece of cast iron that's only lightly rusted you can get rid of the rust simply with soap water and a bit of elbow grease all the electric drills and angle grinders and vinegar isn't necessary for things that just got a little bit a fairly new rust off [Music] alright so I've got the cast iron clean I've got it scrubbed washed bone-dry and a little bit warm now it's time to apply the oil to begin seasoning it now I'm going to use organic flaxseed oil with no preservatives in it this is just some of the best stuff you can use to seasoned cast iron but you can also use vegetable shortening that you've melted down you can use canola oil some people use coconut oil there's a lot of different things you can use for seasoning one of the most popular ways to season cast iron is to take shortening and wipe it onto a hot piece of cast iron it melts right in and after you've covered every square inch of it with shortening then you take a clean towel and you wipe off all the excess put the cast iron in an oven at 400 degrees for about an hour and then repeat the process two to four times to build up a layer of seasoning now this will get the cast iron darker than flaxseed oil but I prefer flaxseed oil because it's stronger so let me show you how to season it with flaxseed oil coat the warm cast iron in flaxseed oil just like you would shortening and wipe off the excess with a clean towel now we're gonna put it upside down so the oil can drip off alright we're gonna bake it in there for one hour at 400 degrees Fahrenheit no matter what type of oil you're using to season your castor and make sure you don't put too much on it after you apply the oil wipe off the excess with the dry clean towel if you flirt with the oil cast iron in the oven it puts off a fair amount of smoke especially you need to do three items at once so got the fan blow and smoke out and I've got the fan hood going full-throttle it was still a little smoking here but after about 15 minutes it cleared up pretty good so heads up don't do it when your wife's at home so you notice how the seasoning on this old skillet is kind of splotchy but the modern-day large skillet it's not that's because of how these skillets are designed modern skillets are kind of bumpy so that they can be pre seasoned very quickly at the factory it takes a lot less time and energy to preseason a slightly bumpy surface the old skillets are smooth time for layer number two but again we're doing it for 400 degrees for one hour [Music] so there we go we've got two layers it's looking a little darker so there's the skillet is only the second layer and it should be very smooth to the touch it shouldn't be sticky at all if your pan is sticky that means you haven't cooked it long enough or you've added too much oil or both here's the the lodge pan you can see it's coming along very nice you can see what the griddle looks like after three layers of seasoning well it's hard it's not sticky at all it doesn't have a greasy feel to it so you can see what the skillet looks like after three layers pretty darn good but still it's more Brown than black so you can see the modern large skillet this is looking really dark it grabs that seasoning better than the smoother older skillets but it's bumpier it's not quite as smooth so here I am on my last layer of seasoning and the pots and pans skillets aren't quite black yet so I'm putting them in for a number of hours until they just turn black and this is just a way of finishing up the seasoning and making sure that thick layer of seasoning is cooked all the way through yeah check that out I didn't add any more oil to it but just a little bit more time in the oven and it turned perfectly shiny black that is gorgeous all right we're gonna do a little bit of troubleshooting here so I'm gonna demonstrate two common mistakes and then show you how to fix them the first is doing too many layers two to four layers is fine six to seven layers isn't necessarily better additionally adding more oil on each layer isn't better so here I am I'm just slopping the oil on as much as I can get on here and I'm gonna cook it in for a total of six layers on all the cast iron here and I'm gonna show you what it does and how to identify it and how to fix it if your layers of seasoning come out bumpy and uneven this is a sign that you're using too much oil you're not wiping off the excess when you turn it upside down the drips of oil are hardening you'll see them along the edge of the skillet especially and they'll break off and expose cast iron and cause weaknesses in your seasoning if you add too many layers of seasoning you'll start to get this bumpy surface that is it as nonstick as it should be you can remove these bumps and blisters through sandy removing the bumps in your seasoning doesn't take a lot of effort so you can sand by hand very easily or use a random orbital sander use 800 to a thousand grit sandpaper and just make a few passes until it's smooth to the touch alright just rinse it off scrub it without using any soap [Music] now the fun part guys I'm going to show you how to cook with cast iron alright we're going to put this on a medium heat for about five minutes we're gonna let that pan absorb all that ki that's the beauty of cast iron is it absorbs a lot of heat and distributes it very evenly with no one Catherine fans you are constantly moving the food around with cast iron don't do that stick the meat down and let it sit there until the surface caramelizing then it will release and unstick you can move it yes caramelized just releases [Music] once you sear the outside of the steaks turn the heat way down to low then we're gonna slow cook it I'm gonna put some of this Montreal steak seasoning on there I like my steaks to be medium-rare but if you like to cook yours a little bit more thoroughly one of the nice things about cast iron is you can take it and just put it right into the oven and that helps cook the steaks nice and even after you've caramelized the outside and seared in those juices beautiful steaks beautiful now we're gonna cook the vegetables little olive oil just a dash and I'm gonna roll this asparagus around so it's getting the beef juice and the olive oil all mixed up you want all the asparagus coated sprinkle them with some garlic salt make sure you don't overcook the asparagus it should Bend but it should still be able to snap if it's floppy you've overdid it [Music] all I'm gonna do is just black in the pepper a little bit and sprinkle a little bit of salt on them guys there you go you can see you got a little bit of black on the pepper you're good to go you don't want to overdo already got my dirty cast iron skillet here from lunch and all I'm gonna do is just wash it in warm water and scrub it with a scrub brush don't overthink it and don't use soap the trickiest part about cleaning a cast iron skillet is it's hard to see if there's any gunk or residue stuck to it because it's a black you know cast iron let's just use your fingers really quick make sure you don't feel anything stuck to it you're good to go and dry it off really good with the towel all right they're nice and clean dried didn't take you long you don't want to use metal tools like spatulas and tongs and forks too aggressively when using cast iron they can scrape off the seasoning and that's what you see here these scratch marks from a pair of metal tongs it's time to clean this pot you can see here it's got tons of grease and soot and all sorts of nasty stuff in there and even this this is old oil I think I was making some campfire Donuts and I didn't clean this thing out heating up the cast iron can make cleaning it a little bit easier you know I still want to be able to handle it but I want to make it pretty hot to the touch [Music] water is good for removing a suit and burnt up food but if you try to get grease off often the dry paper towel does better than the scrub brush and water [Music] there we go it's all cleaned all right that's how you restore season cook with and clean cast iron so not the only way to do it but it's how I do it and hopefully it'll get you started and you learn

cherry full dish whatever you want to call it so sit back relax enjoy the turning thank you for watching for today's project I'm gonna be final turning a bowl that I rough turned from a cherry live after I rough turn the bowl I soaked in denatured alcohol for about 24 hours removed it brought it in the house and allowed to dry for about a week now after a week's time it was pretty well warped but it was completely dry and ready to be final turned now the first step in final turnin is a true up to tenon here I'm just using my jaws of my chuck as a jamb Chuck I'm not too worried about messing up the inside of the bowl anymore inna occurs they'll be turning away later in the process now that I have the bowl reversed I can start truing up the outside of the bowl and that always begins with truing up or in then I move on to a pole cut to true up the outside of the bowl now here you can really see how much your ball is warped now I'm doing a bowl that turned in rim so as I get to the rim I had to reverse the direction of my cut to be able to blade angering tear out after I'm satisfied with the shape of the bowl I move on to shear scraping to smooth out the surface of the bowl to get the correct angle attack and above the shape I had to constantly keep me with a total rust now this is a great angle to show the movements involved in shear scraping you'll notice that the handle on my bowl gouge is way down you also notice that my body sways with the action of the cut after shear scraping high-power sand the 320 grit for this ball I want a room that's turned in but also turned down here I start turning up the inside of the bowl now for the final min the rim turned in turn down and undercut I start by trying some fear scraping the shear scrape is working fine butts leaving the surface a little bit more rough than I would like I'll have to come back later and smooth that out when you turn a ball with a turned in rim all your shavings tend to collect inside the bowl you constantly get in your way now here's a tool you'll rarely ever see me using it's a bowl scraper I'm using the bowl scraper in a shear cutting orientation to smooth out the underside of the undercut rim to either do this or do a lot of sanding here I marked a high spot with a pencil that needs to be turned away to reduce chatter on an already thin wall I'm using my left hand to support the cut and again high-power santa 3 Tony now use my homemade Cole drawers I finish off the base in the bottom of the bowl and finally I used the edge of a skew chisel put some decorative rings in the base of the bowl and here's the finished piece after two applications Danis oil finish and I buffed it with Tripoli and Conable wax I hope you enjoyed watching this so please don't forget

give a few very special things for you to try here all right what you got man I'm ready let's give this honeybadger a whirl I want to show you how this works it's got a ceramic tip as well as a bubbler it's like a warm straw then this is actually a portable dab rig he's pretty cool I think we should start with the NP X's King Louie we've been waiting for that now what John is doing is he's actually mixing the King Louie to concentrate its sauce all right we're gonna wait till that keeps up and then you're gonna hit that nozzle so what I smoke doing right here yes sir as soon as I start touching you're gonna breathe in okay there you go [Applause] [Music] beautiful flavor profile nice and tasty I mean I mean hey I'm here yeah one more time I'm gonna stuff constantly so the honey badger itself is about 250 retell the sauce itself roughly between 50 to 60 dollars what makes it special is the high terpenes they've probably got four or five different terpenes like limonene beta-carotene Mersin they're testing around well 13 to 15 milligrams per as well as your cannabinoids so the cannabis of THC is testing prior romic between 75 and 85 percent so you're getting some really amazing pure stuff there cool so how much does something like this cost it's 250 retail should drive the buggy this device here is is our showpiece though our friends over at Ziggy have been kind to provide us this rig to be able to play with took 14 glass flow or several miles or yeah it's it's 150 notices ofE yeah a 150,000 come that's right you think they will bite and use it about and just keep it as art piece typically you know we wouldn't allow somebody is cut from this but obviously the suspension so just load that up with the tingling yes sir you wanna put something on it now man yeah I put a real book on it more folks Mindy I got you a miss long all right [Music] what do you think the taste and flavorings like excellent that's what kind of makes up the sauce stuff special I think we should also try um which one you want to buy Adam yeah you like of our mmm yeah it's two gig to Gig to fairs we got here a a can of gar our friends provided for us this thing's worth roughly retail side five $600 it's a thousand milligrams plus they're they're amazing they made it specially for you my friend what they've done is they've ground-up the flower in the in the palm nice and then they dipped in oil they've got Keef in it it's it's a super joint is what it is you want to light it up that was custom-made for for you it's not a for sale product here in this market yet hmm so it's uh so one of the first to have it you could blow it out and it looks good with TV five hundred dollars man issue [Music] right till you work to be able to experience just ain't get paid

We're und guing to get ze ROCCKKKS!  \n  (We're going to get some rocks!) Faboulousssh They have great jam here. It's delicious. These rocks seem familliar. *Hmmmmmms as he grabs rocks* EEUUUUUUhhh Looking for one that's a little bit bigger Oooh. That one's nice. I like it whoo man. I really like this one I don't know why rocks are starting to like excite me now. Woa. Woa. Woa. Woah? It's a so pretty! *Throws rock* Look at all tse rocks in tse pack. I wonder how these things get so dang symmetrical like Look at that. It's awesome, that's so perfect. It makes me happy look at my little pile of rock that out there all day, just FYI Rocks don't make a very comfortable bed *Zooms in as the sound of traffic plays* Thanks Jam stone, you make the best Jam. AND you rock. *Childeren laughing XDDDDD* Oh dat gun, it's just a pen. (??? Dad gun? Dat gun? ???) Get over it. You can see I've already drew with pencil on there. I'm talking quiet cuz people are sleeping and I can get kind of loud and obnoxious. *Laughs in unsure* But, you know I tend to stay up late sometimes. I get into that fantastic flow and I can't stop it *Music plays* *draws on rock* Eooh.. That's gonna be cool, maybe... We'll see! You already know how it's gonna turn out hmphheh. *Picks rock up* I'm not even sure if this is possible. But we're gonna try it. Oh? What is that thing? It's so cute! I wanna eat it. Let's go walking out to the shed! *Music and wierd ass walking on dirt* Bee: Bzzzz Whoaaa! Bee! Oh my gosh. That bee was trying to kill me D: I'm not like crazy allergic to bees, but I'm allergic enough that it's a bad day when a bee stings me It looks like I've been making stuff again... Image that! HEY Hey, what is that on my tire? What is that? Eww. Oh? It's dirt. Okaaay. Here's what we're going to do. Take this. It's like a diamond cut off wheel disc? I'm going to go around the outline. Outlining and getting groovy with it. All the way around and then I'm gonna use a couple other different bits like this one. Maybe you know to kind of deepen it. Then I'm gonna take this, which is like a diamond drum grinder thingy-doo. And I'm going to remove the background material. Meeeeweeeereeereeewuuuu. So there's gonna be curved, and then this is gonna be like scooped out. I'm gonna use something like this to do this scooping Meeeweweweweeee. yeah, so let's do that! :D *Says yeay in high piched voice for about 2 seconds* *Music plays and carves rock* *Shows rock while spinning it* *Continues carving the rock but in a diffrent angle* *Zooms in* I think Edgar's judging us. What the reedle doosh. OKAY NOW You can seee... Hopefully you can see. I've kind of gone a little further on the bottom part. But the top part... I haven't done as much, so we're gonna start cleaning this up. Finishing it up and then going back. And doing this area right here. Right in this area. NOT this area. But THIS area. Oooooooh. Okay, now. We're just gonna dance in some happy little rock carvings. Anywhere, we're all over this rock. He's even painting it. He's pai- look. He's painting the rock. *Bob Ross anthem plays* This is your world, you can make OR break the rules *Music plays* This is totally completely unrelated to what I'm doing here, but... Uuuuhhh. Check out these tiny fruits I found at the local grocery store called Central Market here. The pineapple had a baby. Aw-ha A little baby guy! :D I just want to rock it, and make sure it feels loved and safe. And look here, here's a miniature apple. It's so cute What is this the land of miniatures? Orange things? Look at the lemon? I'm in some kind of alternate miniature reality, this isn't where rich people shop Okay everybody! Just using this little braush to braush off all of the deaust. I say it looks pretty cool. I like the swirly doos. You see what I was talking about earlier! Getting in that bevel on the inside here . Is the camera focused? Please mister camera focused for my friends! What I'm gonna do is Mark some lines right here and here to kind of follow a little edge. And then I'm gonna try to use this-it's another diamond burr, just a weird-looking, scoopy-doopy thingy-dingy. I'm going to repeat this. See this little curved in edge? I'm gonna repeat that over and over. Down until it gets smaller and smaller on both sides. So yeah, let's do that! *Music again plays* Hi hello, it is me. The subtitle writer, Minmin or CrazyHermine. I want to tell you that my heck hurts. Thank you for reading this. *Music again plays* *Shows juggling skills off* *Shows juggling skills off on unicicle* Yes hello this is Minmin the translator/subtitle writer and my neck is currently burning ya'll better be grateful for these high quallity subtitles. *Music again plays* Got it to this point. I've sanded it. And I think I'm gonna add some extra fabulousness to this by taking one of these ball doohickeys and buzzing in some little divots. I just think it'll look cool almost like an octopus tentaclease. Sooo eeeeh, let's do some experimentation shall we? Well technically this whole thing is an experiment. Okay! *Music plays for the like fifth time* *Stares at you in dancing* *Music continues* Well that's not very good. But whatever. FOCIOUS! Thank you. :D Last thing to do with this thing I'm not sure what it is. I'm gonna throw a coat of this deft lacquer on it. And hopefully it does not ruin it. *Sprays deft lacqer* So I'm gonna let that dry and do ze other side. OOOH SHOT We made it heh huh. It's done. I'm super excited about this one. Hope you guyes like it. let me know what you think in the comments and remember that all I use to make this was: A landscaping rock, A $60 Harbor Freight rotary carver, And about ten fifteen dollars worth of diamond burrs.

Pretty awesome! :D", "8uJfFWmebjo": "good a it's Robbie Regained well recently I got contacted by a company in Belarus they've got an office in Minsk and asked me if I'd be interested in reviewing checking out a metal cutting blade they sell they sell wood cutting blades for wood sculpting and what a range of stuff in angle grinder fittings they do this particular blog which is a diamond blade in four and a half and five inch so I thought yeah interesting I've never actually used one of these I've done plenty of work with Englanders over the years using regular aluminum oxide drawing discs and you know similar but I've never used a rigid metal disc like this with a diamond composite [Music] welded on edge and I thought it's a good opportunity to try out one of these and see how they compare now the blade is called grass black and looking at the doing the research on this apparently the original ones were in fact black but now they're it's a shiny silver if you look at the back it's quite a bit of a useful information on here and it's also any affected details PRC People's Republic of China so it's made in China it's not made in Belarus or the USSR or any of the Eastern Bloc countries as they're curious about that they do give you quite a bit of advice on the bit as far as how to get the best before fourth and the advantages of this type of blade and basically if we read through a number of these are quite obvious they say longer longer blade life a lot of it will be much longer then composit disk you know aluminum oxide but then how it compares to other diamond cutting discs I couldn't say because I haven't used any but we have to just have to have to take this on its merits performance wise and see how it goes constant blade diameter now that's the big advantage will one of the big advantages it's also got unlimited storage life whereas element oxide disks actually have an expiry date the only good for a certain number of years whether they've actually got explora date printed on is another matter but that's my understanding that all those discs have a a finite lifetime the other advantages are call us that this is solid metal it can shatter whereas an element of oxide cutting disk can shatter or fly apart if it gets twisted or if it goes into metal and it's not held firmly so that's bouncing around it'll actually tear chunks out of the edge of the of the blade so much safer and of course can't shatter you still should use a guard with it because that's going to fly off of it the other gain at the advantage of the constant diameter it means that as you cutting through you your job the speed can't be the staying constant it's not reducing as the disk gets smaller you don't have to swap out disks and just leave it in there and also you can have a lot less mess because the aluminum oxide disk consumes itself they got us from this diameter down to around here so all this all this disk has gone to dust and particles which you're going to make a mess in in your workshop and there you could breathe that stuff in or something were I don't like the smell but with this you're only gonna give actual cuttings from the job messing up the workshop is not going to get all that horrible gritty stuff from the disk hitting yourself up basically alright we'll take it out of the box and have a look at it so here it is it's quite weighty that's well made on the back got some information maximum rpm 12250 which is in line with regular five inch disks and the average immigrant generally spends about 10000 rpm what the metal is anyone's guess I would say it's stainless steel of some sort we'll put a magnet on it it's magnetic so that means it's so really and that's a basic stainless steel would it be a type like 4:30 or 409 widely used very common so you know the old is a visit stainless steel here with a magnet trick now I'm afraid that's not a very good test it works on some but it doesn't work on a lot probably the majority but used widely throughout industry ok we'll move right on alright first comparison we're going to use some Dewalt regular cutoff discs good quality in bodies in Australia for about a dollar each - trillion dollar each and if you do your numbers on what the price of this is like compared to these you have to really technical consideration where you're going to buy this because this is available direct from the company from Amazon so you may or may not have to pay postage depending on where you get it how much it costs the adverts for this suggest it's good for 80 of these now whether it is whether it is an I can't say and I'm again chew up 80 of these to find out we can only just see this in action and see you know what we think of them but if that was the case that would mean that one of these is equivalent $80 Australian dollars of these I know for a fact these are a lot cheaper than $80 so price-wise if that's right these will be a cheaper bye so I thought we can do an arrow to some tear soul is the same angle grinder in each case you cut for the same metal and with each of them and then we'll check the video time and see what the results show and this is phenol groaner we'll be using that's a 570 what unit neck tech made by Makita good little unit 570 is plenty I can still run that off of a car inverter your inverter small generator you don't need 900 watts just cut off discs that people to buy them these are a lot lighter easier to use and we did the job to make sure we give this blade a fair test I've already done some cuts with it compared it to the DeWalt so we'll start this test again with a brand new the wall you can see how much the world worn down with four cats that was channel square section and a flat stuff so it was four cats each cat lasting 30 seconds oh yeah and the wear rate is there already so we will start with a new disc and I'll repeat the cat's on camera and you can see it yourself that performance difference [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] on the Left we've got the element in oxide cutting finish usual stuff quite clean up to you bad on the right we've got the finish from the diamond disc you see it's a lot rougher and if they're cleaning up required or both around in the square section [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you can see that it is cutting it but it's galling even though the galling is removal it's still not anything like what you know you get with a cutting blade like a hex or a bandsaw so not the way I don't want to go cutting our minim it does put some residue on the blade which comes off pretty easily so it does do a bit of clogging but nothing that's any concern really say you can cut aluminum with it but I don't think it's not ideal it was better than you can do with the regular discs so in summing up which one do I prefer well I gotta be honest and say this is a lot faster to use than this you can see how much this has gone down in those few cuts so you know that's what happens that ultimately at the end of this depth this diameter although this will be sprayed around your workshop and you won't get it going need any deeper than you know well from here to sort of about here and if you're lucky where is on this you've got your full depth you do get more vibration with this for sure you can feel it but you can apply more pressure I didn't do it in the video I kept the pressure even on both of them but you can actually apply on more pressure and cut faster with this because if you do the same with this the medium actually won't cut me fast it will just tear it off to pieces more quickly this is how element element oxide is for it you don't need a lot of wattage to spin them because they can only cut at the rate that I can cut out if you put a lot of pressure on that's when things get dangerous the disc will wear out faster it'll possibly start tearing itself to pieces on the edge and that's how discs can shatter and cause injuries so yeah I could have cut faster with this if I applied a lot more pressure it's it's the way it works so the end of the day it's a matter of what you really want now I mean this disc will cut anything it'll do ceramics brick pretty much anything whereas these are restricted to metal really how it looks out on a dollar dis basis you have to do to something work that out overall I think these are a handy thing to have in the workshop but they're not the magic panacea for everything and if I was doing a lot of metalwork I think I'd find this a bit too slow I've been looking at these discs and certainly you'd get the jobs through a lot quicker significantly in some cases all that cleanup on the cutting services also I didn't like that that's going to slow down even more so overall if you're in production or you know you've got your own business I think this is the way to go is time is not important that money is this will actually work out cheaper and safer and make less mess okay but look that's it from me I can't say any more than that you've seen him in action whether you want to get one of these some of these is up to you like I'm gonna show you how it is okay that's it for me hope you enjoyed it see you next time Cheers", "ZKodxGcRSnw": "one of the things that I had to figure out mostly through trial and error is how to wire random motors that you might find like the ones I have here in front of you and just as a quick rundown this is a AC blower motor to washing-machine motors this one comes out of an electric wood chipper this comes out of a treadmill and that's a vacuum motor with that being said there are many different types here that one's brushed AC this one is a DC motor that's a AC the rest of these are all AC single-phase and they are brushless was important about single-phase motors is they have a start capacitor next to them and usually you can tell if it's brushless and single-phase because it will have this big bulge on the side which has a capacitor inside now I'm not going to open that up but you could read all that information right here on the label it says quarter horsepower 1700 rpms it gives you a amperage but here it says phase one as in single phase with a motor like this you need a start capacitor and basically what that does is it creates a temporary additional phase like a second phase that allows the motor to start turning in fact you know that there are problems with your capacitor if the motor comes on and in homes but it doesn't spin so either if you wiring this yourself it means you may have wired the capacitor wrong or something's wrong with the capacitor just has a quick example this is a microwave capacitor they come in all different shapes this one came with this washing machine motor and you'll notice that it's on a wire it's not mounted to the motor so in washing machines I've found that often it's mounted somewhere else in the machine so you got to be sure that you get that before you throw the rest of it away another star capacitor right there on the side and then bulge and DC motors and brushed motors don't need to our capacitors the simplest one is this guy so let's jump right in it for the most part you'll find that these motors are already wired but if you don't have the advantage of that take these out here you can look in the back and I don't know how well you can see that but here before got scratched off this used to tell you which to red and black - why are you wires - and so literally all I did was have this short cable here for demonstration purposes that I wired up so this is by no means pretty but basically it gives me a on/off switch it gives me a circuit breaker just in case things don't work out the way I hoped and I have a ground wire and then these two guys my hot neutral so basically I'm going to you probably can't see this but I'm just putting these on red and black and see the red hopefully ask not to dark red leading into this terminal and black on that terminal and then my ground wire is usually grounded to the body of the motor and this guy's ready to go isn't the power but I'm not going to plug this in until I clamp this guy down and just like that we got to work a motor one more thing before we move on to the next motor and that's speed control with an AC brushless motor single-phase there's no good way to externally control the speed of this like say through voltage control or something like that it's best to use pulleys there's a centrifugal switch in fact if you listen carefully if you hear that clicking sound that's the centrifugal switch engaging and if you try to say lower the voltage or something like that you're going to draw more amperage and cause problems with that centrifugal switch and I'll put a link which are describe what this centrifugal switch does and talks to you more about why you need one so it's best to if you want to adjust for speed you're going to need some pulleys to change the speed of this guy it starts with the multimeter so you're going to take this guy everybody is a little different I'm going to set mine to measure ohms and under that I have a setting to beep when it senses continuity now without getting into that too much on this video it's worth looking into just so you understand what's going on but continuity is what we're looking for and this is all I did started with the tab in the corner and I see which ones it has continuity with so nothing on the white nothing there if you hear that beeping this corner tab which doesn't have a color and the brown have continuity so you're going to need to make a list you'll do this over and over nothing on the blue yellow but definitely red right and then white same thing nothing on the brown alright so white and blue yes and nothing on white and red but we have white and blue and white and yellow so anyway you'll make a list and then we'll create our wire next what you see here are the notes that I took these are all the ones that have continuity between the wires for the two different motors and you'll notice that some of them don't do anything even though they had continuity so don't worry about that you just want to use that winding I've actually went ahead and measured with the tachometer the speed now this one allows you to wire for different speeds as you can see there's a high low and a extra low but the other thing is how do you know which one of these is the start winding as opposed to all the other ones which are run what you need to do is break back out the multimeter we're going to set our multimeter to measure ohms so you're going to see it bounce around as it autorange is to figure out what the own reading is let's start with the one that I know it's a start winding which is yellow and black but obviously it doesn't matter where you start so it's bouncing around and you can see it says seven it's about seven ohms now I'm going to go to the high speed winding which is white and blue and it's bouncing around a little bit and it settles on to ohms so you can see there's a huge difference in the resistance between 2 ohms which is what we just read and added Auto ranges now it's reading seven ohms and that's the major difference that start winding has a thinner wire and has a higher resistance and so it's going to give you a higher reading there now we can check the other ones just to increase your confidence here we're going to go white and purple white and purple is the low speed winding give it a moment to get into subtle and you can see that one's also 2 ohms and then we have white and orange and that's settling around two and a half own now this wiring just so you know is temporary this is not how I wire it if I wanted to run this on a regular basis but I threw this together for just for this demonstration video now this is a vacuum cord the vacuum was rated at 15 amps it should be fine for this washing machine motor and as you can see again that's kind of ugly but what I really want to show you is this and this now you need to wire these in parallel and all that means is the wire coming from the wall I've got my two cables coming from the wall and those two cables are split the pair both are connected to this wire and then also connect it to this wire now following this side we have our start capacitor this one is 233 to 280 micro Ference 110 V AC this is the one after looking online is the one that comes with both of these washing machine motors so that's what I got all right this wire as you can see is split one side goes across the capacitor and the other side just goes back so you can have your your live or your neutral it doesn't matter one to go across the capacitor and you gather just go straight to this end now the side with the capacitor is decide you're going to wire across the start winding the other side is going to go across your run winding one more thing about these capacitors they pack a serious punch and when they're charged even after you unplug it from the wall it still has stored energy so the simplest thing to do is without this plug then you just take a screwdriver touch the two leads together of course that screwdriver should have either a plastic or rubber handle touch those two leads together and that'll discharge the capacitor across itself just be careful because it can really hurt you all right we're going to take this across the start this is my start capacitor it needs to go across my star winding make sure your motors clamp down because it will jump off the table and let's plug it in that's it you got a running motor here I just wanted to show one more example of one with the capacitor on the outside this one is 3,500 rpms three-quarter three horsepower motor I got this out of a wood chipper but again it's single-phase and you need that start capacitor to get things moving here are my two wires for power and the start capacitor is wired on inside directly you don't need to do anything to that and your ground again to the body of the motor we're going to use the same harness we used earlier got this one wired up you see my ground wire and slipped into the ground there and then just like we did with the other one there you go all right this one comes out of a vacuum it's got quite a bit of kick this is the switch the this is a part of the foot switch that you step on to turn your vacuum on so I left all of that wired the best thing you can do with this most of the time a brushed motor like this the wiring is very simple so it's best whatever machine you take it out of to just leave it like it is so there's really not a whole lot to it you just plug it in and if there's nothing wrong with it when you push your foot switch", "gAAaCdIv_Jg": "[Music] to sharpen your knives you have a couple of options you can take it to a store that we do it for you or you can do it yourself using a sharpening tool there are different types of tool that you can use here are few options let's have a look at the pull through shopper nails this one for example this one has a preset angle and you can see two small pieces of sharpening stones so you hold it in your hand you place the blade side up that you want to sharpen and you slide it all over and this actually you can see scrapes on metal off this one is a different option there are two settings you can see they are all preset this one or slot will sharpen the blade and remove some of the meter off and the second one will finish it and polish the blade how do you use it just like so hold it place your knife without applying any pressure the weight of the knife is sufficient and fall so do it a few times and then go on the other side this is a good tool but it is not the best it takes a lot of passes in order to have a very sharp blade if you start with a very dull knife the next one is the whole choice let's have a look if you can afford an electric sharpener it will make your life easier they come in different flavor some allow you to do both blade at once others allows you to do serrated knives and others allow you to change the angle this one allow me to sharpen serrated blades such as a bread knife and it is preset at 15 degree angle and it's very easy to use and it's efficient let me demonstrate that so sharpen one side at a time and take about three to four seconds to go through [Music] [Music] and then go to the next step [Music] so the next steps grind you want to do it less time so here I'm going to do it a couple of times only and finally I wait to finish the night here the blade or the age I should say [Music] make sure you are using a dry clean line when you use this machine and again don't put any pressure the weight of the blade is sufficient then wipe it there are four different categories of wet stones all stones Diamond stones ceramic stones and water stones mine is a water stone it is called that way as it needs to be soaked in water for at least 10 minutes before using it after 10 minutes remove the stone from the water and press it on the rag as you can see this one has two sides one is coarse and that the other one is a fine grain so place the knife on the hill at the beginning of the stone with the right angle and pull then tail so try to have the same angle all the time do the same number of classes on each side and start with a cold side then finish with the final side this is a bit more complex because the angle has to be precise and accurate each time and you do want to put a little bit of pressure on the stone this is a dull knife and this is a sharp one have a sharpening tool in your knife kit and use it", "yhtiKOcZa3E": "[Music] hi I'm Bryan Strickland with American Sanders and today we're gonna refinish a hardwood floor we're gonna use the American Sanders line of equipment that you can find at most rental centers around the country we're gonna show you some tricks of the trade we're gonna show you how to use all equipment properly and by the time we're done you're gonna know how to refinish your own hardwood floor [Music] before you get started on your project you need to determine what kind of wood floor that you have there are multiple varieties there's solid flooring there's prefinished flooring engineered flooring only some of these can be sanded and refinished and if you put a sanding machine on the wrong type of floor you'll be very disappointed with the result so you need to determine exactly what you have let's take a look let's first talk about the solid tongue and groove style floors these floors are usually 3/4 of an inch thick they are meant to last the lifetime and they're thick where layer allows them to be sanded in multiple times during their usable life factory finished floors are also solid wood but depending on the brand and make of the floor the wear layer may not be as thick as solid wood flooring this type of flooring can be re sanded very nicely then there's engineered flooring which is made to look like solid wood flooring but actually is made up of thin layers of wood laminate glued together this type of floor usually has a very thin wear layer of wood and cannot be sanded and refinished more than once in its lifetime unless you have a high level of confidence that your engineered floor has enough of a wear layer to handle a resending project then I would not recommend trying to Reese and it as for the vinyl flooring this product is not real wood and cannot be refinished through a sanding process there are a number of ways to determine which kind of flooring you have for instance if you know how old the flooring is you can make some assumptions about the type of the floor you're working with prior to the mid-1980s wood floors were almost exclusively made from solid wood flooring so if the floor you're working on was laid prior to that time period then you have a large confidence level that the floors solid wood for factory finished or engineered wood flooring there's a very distinct characteristic specific to these type of floors it's called a micro bevel and it is visible where two pieces of wood come together if your floor has this feature then it is either factory finished or an engineered floor another way to determine the type of floor is to inspect the area around a heating vent or the area where the wood floor butts up against the carpet or some other type of flooring before you get started you want to inspect the condition of your floor understanding the condition that your floor is in is actually going to help you select which sanding machine to use we've got a dining room here about 110 square feet looks like inch and a quarter oak it's in pretty good condition floor is actually reasonably flat so we're not dealing with any kind of cupping or crowning situation that's going to be a problem we do have some water damage that we're going to need to be aware of as we sand might have to spend some more time there making sure that we get that area cleaned up as much as possible but generally speaking this floors and reasonably good shape it's just old and some of the finish has worn off I'm gonna use the drum sander in this condition because I've got some open space here and I can be really productive with that machine and knock this project out fairly quickly there are two distinct flooring issues either created by too much humidity or too little humidity in a house a cup floor which is where the edges of the would actually curls up and is higher than the middle of the floor that's caused by too much moisture or too much humidity reverse of that is a crown floor where the center is higher than the edges both of these are issues that can be corrected temporarily with sanding but really need to be handled long-term with handling the humidity or moisture issues that you might have in your house there are a few safety items that you should consider wearing during your project certainly eyeglasses whether it's your standard prescription glasses or safety glasses or goggles beyond that a respirator most of the ladies machines have dust containment systems but if you have a machine without dust control you're certainly going to wear a respirator in order to keep yourself healthy in that regard hearing protection is always important these machines while they're not overly loud they certainly do make noise and then knee protection is certainly a comfort level you're going to spend a lot of time with your knees prepping this floor and hand scraping and the other types of things we're going to show you how to do so me protection is also recommended [Music] once you determine that your floor is a good candidate for sanding and refinishing make your way to the rental center and select your rental equipment it's gonna be a variety of different machines to choose from each with a little bit of a different feature set that might be more ideal to your project versus another we'll talk about what these machines do and why they're different and then you can select the right one for your project the easy a drum sander is going to be the most aggressive machine that you can rent as a homeowner plugs right into your standard wall 110 volts but it's gonna allow you to flatten your floor it's going to be the most productive in the fastest one that you can use it requires a little bit of a skill set and some practice in order to understand how to do it right but if you've got a floor that's in bad condition and you've got the skills to go ahead and run this equipment it's going to be the one that you're going to be happiest with most of these bigger machines that you rent to sand your floor they won't get all the way up to the wall so you're gonna have to rent an edger an edger specifically does that last two or three inches around the room right up to the wall line the rotary sander is an aggressive machine that you can also use to flatten your floor and can be used from floors that aren't in great shape this machine requires also a little bit of a skill set can be difficult to use and is slower than the drum machine but can get into some tighter spaces orbital sanders are the easiest sanding machines to use they don't have to be run with the grain you can run them in any direction they can be run by anybody you're not going to damage your floor with an orbital sander the drawback to the orbital sander is that it's just going to be much slower than the drum sander or a rotary sander [Music] sandpaper is gonna be really important in terms of your selection you want to start with the finest grit you can and actually still sand the floor flat so in most cases you want to start with a 36 grit maybe a 40 grit that's going to be enough I think that's going to be enough for us to start on this floor and get it cut flat then we're gonna skip two grits for a medium cut so if we start with 36 we're gonna skip 40 and go to 50 maybe 60 if that's what's available and then we're gonna skip 2 more grits and go from 60 to say 80 or maybe a hundred depending on the on what's available to you at your local rental Center so our project has a three quarter inch quarter round used a shoe molding all the way around the room trick of the trade you can do one of two things you can either leave this shoe molding in place and actually use the edge or an edge all the way up to it you don't have to then worry about removing any of this molding or you can remove this molding and then not have to edge exactly all the way up to the wall that'll give you a little bit of a margin of error when you're running that edger around the room you put the shoe molding back in place nobody's gonna know how close you actually got to the wall if you do that another trick of the trade mark on your shoe molding a 1 or 2 or whatever the number is and then put the koa siding number on the wall where you took this from later on when you get that shoe molding and you put it back in place you'll be able to line it back up with exactly where you took it from so two more tricks of the trade for you before we get started sanding one of the things you need to do is make sure that you have set all the nails on the in the wood that might be exposed if you don't set the nails below the level of the wood you're gonna run that over with the sander you're gonna put a little bit of a damage in the sandpaper and that damage in the sandpaper will actually transfer to the floor so we're gonna use nail sets and we're use a hammer and the thing that we're gonna do that's a trick of the trade is make sure to use some sort of towel or some sort of soft item that you can actually put the hammer on and the nail as you're working around the floor any kind of damage you put in the floor now with the hammer by dropping it on the floor you're gonna have to take that damage out with the sander so we want to prevent that up front the other trick of the trade I want to talk to you about is blue tape we're gonna take blue tape and we're gonna put it around all the edges of the corners because as we're moving this sander back and forth along the floor we're gonna be dragging the power cord behind us in the most likely place for that power cord to get hung up and rub the paint off the wall is gonna be on the corners of the molding so we're gonna wrap those corners and blue tape [Music] we're almost ready to get started sanding this floor before we do let's talk about the process a little bit it's important when you're using a drum sander that you actually sand with the grain the whole point there is that on a rough cut our very first cut that's what we're gonna use to actually flatten the floor so the rough cuts gonna put a lot of deep scratches into the floor and we want to do that with the grain because that will actually hide the scratches better then we're gonna have two more cuts after the rough cut we're gonna have the medium cut and then the fine cut and those two cuts are just designed to hide those initial scratches if you have the expander style drum with the sleeve paper it's really simple to install simply slide it on the end of the cylinder and push it right into place [Music] alright so to install on the clamp-style drum you're actually going to have to back out these screws loosen this this bar plate up and then you're gonna take this piece of paper and you slide it up underneath that clam [Music] so to operate the EZ 8s and your floor again you're gonna make sure you go with the grain one pass up and one pass back in the exact same spot then you're gonna move over about half the drum and then take your next pass also a couple of things to realize one is this machine when the drums in contact with the floor you want to be moving if you stop while the drums in contact with the floor you're gonna leave what to call the drum mark will address some of that a little bit later there's a handle on this machine that's going to control that drum you're gonna have one of two styles either just this top handle here you might find on the machine you rent or you might also have this finger lever and if you have that then you have the option of either just controlling this with your fingers or again you can control it with the main handle as it goes up and down one thing I want to point out to you also is as you go up and down on your pass the best thing to do is to stagger where you stop so don't always stop in the same spot sometimes you're going to come back a little bit further and then on the next pass maybe you'll stop a little bit sooner that way by staggering that you won't ever leave kind of a visual sight line on the floor as to where you've been standing [Music] [Music] [Music] so when we inspected the floor earlier we noticed that there was some sort of water damage or water spot in the corner we've now sanded over that and it's not coming out most likely that is going to be a urine stain from a pet and that's going to be penetrated all the way through the board and there's not going to be any way for us to remove it from a standing process you could do a board repair and actually remove those boards in place new in there and then sand again but otherwise you're going to be left with this stain and there's nothing we can do about it at this point when we stand and finish it it will look better than when we started but it is that dark spots always going to be there so we talked a little bit earlier about running the Machine the drum machine that you have to stay in motion while the drum is on in contact with the floor if not you'll leave a drum mark or a stop mark I've actually purposely left one of these in the floor it's not hard to do you're gonna end up doing this you'll back up over the cord and it'll it'll cause you to do this you'll you'll Knick the wall or run into the wall it'll cause you to do it it's not a big deal you can take it out I'm gonna show you how to do that now so the way to take this drum work out of the floor is to cut across it on a 45 degree angle from both directions and then a third time going straight with the grain [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so before we remove all the finish from this floor we're gonna go ahead and show you how to operate the rest of the equipment that might be available to you in your rental center this is the rotary sander it's a 16 inch machine very aggressive it's gonna flatten the floor it does take some skill to to operate we'll talk about that in just a minute it is going to come with some sort of sanding head to attach the paper to this particular head has six different five inch pads that you just apply to paper to you might actually get a sanding head it's a single piece of 16 inch paper either way the machine is going to operate the same so this particular rotary sander is a dust containment unit so it's intended to be used with the dust dirt and and also a vacuum so you just install the dust skirt [Music] so I've got the backpack vacuum all and it's attached to the machine in order to operate this we're going to lower the handle we want it down around a comfortable height at your ear hip I'm going to lock it back into place that's important that you get to handle lock back into place so once you get the handle locked in place you want to kind of keep the handle up against your hip this machine's got a lot of torque to it and it's gonna want to move left and right once you get it stabilized if you want to go to the lift to the right you're gonna lower the handle just a little bit if you want to go to the left you're gonna raise the handle just a little bit just in tiny fractions will cause a lot of movement it's a very aggressive machine and let me show you how to operate it now all right in order to turn the machine on you're gonna push the safety button and squeeze the handle again make sure this handle is braced up against your hip because it's gonna start with a lot of torque one of the other types of machines that you'll find available your rental Center is going to be called an orbital sander this is the obs 18 it's a 12 by 18 inch deck sometimes you'll hear people refer to it as a square buff but it is a machine that anybody can run the beautiful thing about it is it doesn't require any skills there's no way you're gonna be able to ruin or damage your floor with this unit it operates in an orbital fashion so you don't have to worry about sanding with the grain of the wood the one drawback to it is it is going to be slower and less aggressive than the other equipment we've shown you so if you have a floor that's damaged or in really bad condition this is probably not the right machine if you have a floor that's in good condition and you have some time to sand it this is a great machine for doing that this is also ideal for actually blending scratch patterns between different machines like the drum machine and the edger and we'll talk about that a little bit later in the process so in order to install the sandpaper on this piece of equipment you simply lean machine back the piece of paper is going to come with some sort of either sticky back or a hook back and it will just apply to the pad that's that's under that unit so in order to operate this machine you're going to plug it in [Music] lower the handle you can just let the handle float you don't have to lock it into place and then again you're gonna push the safety trigger so another type of orbital sander that's available is a multi-disc sander they're a little bit more aggressive than the square types that we just showed you a moment ago this particular unit has three seven-inch heads on the bottom we'll apply the paper simply by pushing the paper on to the pads we'll be ready to go one of the nice features about this particular unit is that it's very transportable so it's designed with to be multiple components so you can actually take the handle off by flipping these levers and the handle lifts off and away so if you're in a situation where you don't have a truck and you just have a car this may be the unit that's easier for you to transport to and from your location it actually has two lifting handles one in the front one in the back so you can get that in and out of your truck so to operate this unit we're going to install the dust bag it simply slips on to the cuff and the bat plug this unit in and we're going to lower the handle so it just spins here it's got a collar that spins and raises and that then allows the handle to drop into place again just like the other orbital sander we're gonna let it float we're not trying to lock it into place I'm going to push the safety button squeeze the handle and we'll be sanding [Music] again this unit is an orbital sander so you don't have to worry about going with the grain of the wood and one of the neat features about this item is its triangular shape and you can rotate the head fairly comfortably and get it into some pipe spaces and some closets under shelves or actually into a corner of the room [Music] so we've completed the first cut or the rough cut using 36 grit on the drum machine and you can see if you look along the wall lines you can see that we've got these areas that you simply can't get with some of the Sanders so we're gonna use the edger for that and we're gonna use the exact same grit paper that we used on the rough cut which is 36 degrees you want to be able to blend those scratches with both machines with this unit it's got a wrench in the back and a bolt on the bottom that actually fastens this paper [Applause] all right so it's got a dust bag that goes on the edger it's like the others it just simply slips over the pipe we're gonna plug this unit in [Music] and now this unit is a very powerful unit so you don't need to do much work it's gonna do a lot of the work but you do want to grip it with both hands kind of in a crouch down or a kneeling position there's an on/off switch we're going to turn it on we're going to leave the pad off the floor when we turn it on then we're gonna gently laid it down on the floor and we're gonna move kinda in a clockwise direction around the room [Music] so we've completed the rough cut both the edges and the middle of the floor it's really important that our next step is to clean the floor vacuum it sweep it make sure we get any kind of abrasive grit or any kind of debris that we've got on the floor get it out of the way before we sand it again we're gonna sand - two more times once with a sixty grit and then we're gonna sand it with an 80 grit and then we're ready to finish as soon as we're done doing that we're gonna come back with another trick of the trade and show you guys how to handle these corners [Music] [Music] spontaneous combustion or an explosion can occur when working with sanding dust the sanding dust can self ignite and cause injury or damage so never leave the equipment unattended that the bag has not been emptied sanding dust should be disposed of properly always empty that dust into a container located outside of the building all right so we've got the floor sanded now we've got to deal with these corners the edger it has a rounded end on it so you can't get all the way up into the corners you're gonna leave a little bit of space you're gonna take a common paint scraper or hand scraper and we're gonna actually use this to take care of these corners we're gonna lay it up in the corner and go with the grain of the wood and simply pull toward the show [Music] so that's how we're going to handle the corners now this is the blade on this hand scraper will bowl on you so you're gonna use a mill file to actually sharpen this I should go along one trick of the trade is to make sure when you sharpen this you do it over a claw or some other way that doesn't get directly on the floor if you leave these paper these metal shavings on the floor once you apply your finish you'll end up seeing that later on so now that you'd hand scrape the corners you're gonna take a piece of sandpaper and you're actually going to blend those corners back into the floor make sure you sand with the grain [Music] so the last sanding step is to blend the scratch pattern so we've used 2 different Sanders on this floor so part of the drum machine and also the edger they have two completely different scratch patterns and if we don't blend those once you put finish on the floor you're going to see either a halo or a picture frame effect around the floor we're gonna use the orbital sander to do this we've got 120 grit paper on the bottom and we're just going to go over the whole floor with this machine and that'll blend the scratch patterns [Music] [Music] so another trick of the trade is once you're completely done sanding the floor is to take a bright halogen or fluorescent light and actually take a look at the floor focusing on the wall lines and looking for any scratch patterns or imperfections this is your last chance to fix any of those things prior to applying your first coat of finish or your sealer as soon as you apply that first coat of sealer finish any imperfection is going to jump out at you [Music] so at this point we're ready to finish the floor any debris any sort of abrasive or any kind of dust that is left on this floor is gonna get caught in the finish and we're not gonna like that look so we're gonna vacuum one last time [Music] so we're ready to finish the floor we're gonna start with a coat of sealer the homeowner in this case is chosen water-based finish and sealer so we're actually using American Sanders timber seal we're gonna put on one coat of sealer and then two coats of the timber guard finish homeowners also chosen a matte finish for this project we're gonna cut in using a typical nylon two-inch brush we're gonna use that to cut it around the edges and then we're gonna use a microfiber roller that you can get at most paint centers or any kind of home center use a microphone i and microfiber roller and you're gonna get a better result and the one thing you want to make sure you do is plan your exit don't start at the door and work into a blind corner that you can't get out of actually start at the far end and then work yourself to the door so you know how to get out [Music] so following the manufacturer's instructions we allow the coat of sealer to dry the appropriate amount of time and then we use the orbital machine with a high grit sandpaper to go ahead and abrade the floor one more time just to really smooth it out we vacuumed the floor the last time and now we're actually gonna use a damp microfiber mop and go over the floor once just to get up any fine dust that is there before we put down this first coat of finish so we're going to apply the first of two coats of finish we're using a water-based finish by American Sanders very similar to the sealer we just put down this is timber guard Pro the customer has selected a matte Sheen and we're going to apply that the same way we did the sealer [Music] so our project is finished we've got two coats a water-based finish on top of a sealer super matte finish it's very clean very natural look and it's going to hold up for years to come we hope this video has helped you select the right equipment and run that equipment properly so that you can do your own floors as you want if you're looking for more information or you have any comments or questions about our products you can find us at American Sanders dot-com [Music]", "yRNb64amhBo": "[Music] [Applause] so [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you", "9CnrX5DbAIw": "i'll show you here how i close large gaps when i'm welding with my flux core welder so i'm just an occasional welder just fixing things around the ranch and i don't don't have the gas tank for the mig setup or anything but i just use a flux core wire and works out pretty good for me does make a big bit of a mess you can see that spatter all around the world [Music] there but uh in the end it works and um i don't need to be pretty i just need it to be strong and that's the method i use to close the larger gaps here's another view of a different world but going horizontally this time i use about the same technique i'm usually trying to drag the puddle behind me and i just use a swirling donut action and i hold about a 10 degree angle and i usually like to drag the puddle behind me um and just go nice and slow and you get that rhythm after a while of you know just practicing and this is pretty forgiving the angle iron 3 8 inch thick so there's plenty of metal there to grab onto i think the key is just to go slow and keep a consistent movement of your hand so that that puddle is a consistent shape behind you and you just drag it across like i said it doesn't have to look pretty to be strong so that's all i'm usually looking for when i'm thinking stuff or you know fabricating something and then with that flex core yeah you gotta scrape all that crap off leaves that spatter all over but it's really pretty minor inconvenience versus me having to maintain big tanks so that's it you", "QwN7t9fKmqI": "the revolutionary design of the pepper ball pepper grinder

let's face it most stained glass videos are really boring boring and i try to make them interesting even though i know it's likely you're never going to make a project exactly like this but the techniques i'm going to show you today are applicable whether you're making a big project or a small project or a completely different project and by watching this video i think you just might learn a thing or two about making a leaded stained glass panel and i promise i'll try not to put you to sleep you're boring everybody now there are some various techniques that people use when making leaded stained glass panels but the process is really basically the same you take a piece of lead you wrap it around the glass and it gets soldered in place most of the time on my videos i start at the beginning of the project but on this one i'm well sort of in the middle of it but how did i get here how did i go from a picture to a plan to a project and before i get into the gory details let me show you some of the tools and materials that i'm using for this 21 inch by 23 inch panel [Music] side cutters breaking pliers running pliers file rulers glass cutter for the metal on this project i'm using half inch wide zinc u channel for the border and this sled between all of the glass pieces then of course a soldering iron solder and solder flux various colors of glass and a glass grinder [Music] for cutting the lead i use these side cutters if i'm off a little bit i use the file to quickly make small adjustments for more detail on tools and materials refer to the link in the top right corner of this screen it's also a good idea to wear rubber gloves when working with the lead it's probably safer that way and they keep your hands from turning black [Music] i'm making a large leaded stained glass panel for a customer they emailed me a google image of exactly what they wanted and they told me it had to be a specific size to replace an existing window in their home using photoshop i had the image resized to the exact size they needed i then used the adobe reader program to print two actual size copies of the pdf image i then cut out the pieces taped them together and now i have two copies one to lay the pieces on top of as i cut and assemble and the other which i can use as a pattern to cut some of the pieces but first let me say a word about patterns this is not really a pattern these black thick lines well that's a picture of the lead a normal pattern has a thinner black line which you can cut with the special lead scissors they leave a gap between the pattern pieces to account for the lead usually when i make a stained glass panel i cut out all the pieces at once but for this i'm not really comfortable doing that because of the thick lines of the pattern so instead i'm going to build the frame and then cut a piece of the glass at a time work my way down from the top this way i can build it slowly until it's complete and the exact size that i need i'm just more comfortable doing it that way [Music] i measure cut and fit each piece once i have a section of pieces cut to size i hold them in place with a strip of wood as i solder them before soldering apply a little flux because i'm up against the wood board i'm just going to tack these in place i'll go back later and make them look nicer [Music] the lead comes in six foot lengths they get a little bent up and transport so i'll stretch them out before i use them they have special tools for this but i just put one end in a vise and hold the other end with a pair of pliers then pull always stand firmly with one leg behind for support this way if the lead breaks you won't go flying backwards ask me how i figured this out now beside using lead between all the pieces of glass in your stained glass project there is one more method which you can use is called copper foil which i'm just going to briefly mention here this is copper foil tape which gets wrapped around each piece of glass then they get soldered together like i did here on this cool looking three-dimensional cardinal [Music] [Music] bad [Music] when soldering i'm using the flat side of the iron don't leave it on too long or you can melt right through the lead then you've got no choice but to replace the lead a good technique will come with a little [Music] practice well the panel is now completely assembled and it's soldered on both sides it took me a few hours every night this week in order to complete it it may look like it's finished but it's not listen hear that rattling the pieces are held in place by the lead cane but it's not air tight i still need to apply a cement putty and then let it dry for a couple of days and clean it thoroughly i'm not going to do that in this video you're going to have to tune in next week if you want to see how that's done so thanks for watching allie picked until next time i'll meet you in the alley [Music] [Applause] [Music] you", "D-On0DGcDlc": "this is the lock-picking lawyer and what i have for you today is a lock that's made a name for itself with internet videos showing it being attacked with a variety of different tools for several minutes at a time the light lock gold and of course in all of those videos one of which is over 17 minutes long the lock survives the onslaught I'll admit that I am very skeptical when I see videos like that because there is no bike lock in the world that can withstand a 17 minute attack from someone who knows what they're doing so today we're going to see just how resistant to brute force this lock really is and we're going to do it on light locks terms what do I mean by that well in one of their videos which I'll link below light lock shows an Ironman athlete unsuccessfully attacking the lock with several tools including cable cutters just like these in addition light locks website says that it can quote withstand sustained attack from tools like cable cutters I have my doubts in fact I'll be surprised if this lock lasts much more than 30 seconds but those doubts really don't mean much without testing so let's head down to the garage and see if the light lock really can withstand a sustained attack from cable cutters okay we're down in the garage so let's get to work and see just how tough the light lock gold really is [Music] [Music] okay were back upstairs and as you saw the cable cutters made short work of the light lock gold I went back and looked at the footage and it was just 16 seconds from the cutters first touching the lock until it finally failed now I posted the results of this test several days ago on Twitter and it apparently came to the attention of light lock and I got an email from the company's founder posing an interesting question one that I think is worth discussing briefly he says quote as part of sold secures tests they use cable cutters similar to yours and couldn't get through like lock old media outlets report this - indeed during our extensive testing it's been our experience that when attacking light locks with cable cutters the strap becomes mangled in such a way that makes it difficult to cut so would you please tell me the exact tool you used please I'm very keen to understand how this could have happened end quote I think this is a great line of inquiry and it shows that his head is in the right spot finding out what happened and hopefully trying to improve his products unfortunately the short answer is I don't know why my test results were so different it would be very easy for a cynical guy like me to discount the company's internal testing as biased but that's not the case with sole secure which is generally considered an independent and reliable institution but I do have a couple of guesses and they Center on the quality and type of tools used for testing first this is a relatively high quality tool made by HK Porter in Japan it's certainly not the best tool made but they are pretty good I also ensure that the blades are properly adjusted next many people don't realize that not all cable cutters are meant to cut steel cables in fact the majority of them are they look similar but if you read the fine print you'll learn that they're for electrical work and only certified to cut high gauge copper and aluminum wires use of tools like this certainly could be a contributing factor these cutters are certified for steel cable up to half an inch to be clear I don't know for certain why the testing conducted by others produce different results from my own but my best guess is the employment of lower quality cutters miss adjusted cutters and/or cutters that were only intended for soft metals like copper and aluminum played a role there is of course one final possibility it may be that I am just that much stronger than an Ironman athlete and everyone else who tested the lock in fact now that I think about it that must be the explanation in any case that's all I have for you today if you do have any questions or

Today we're gonna show you how to spread wax on a car using a dual action polisher. I'm going to use the TORQ22D dual action polisher to wax this Subaru. The TORQ22D comes with a large 6'' backing plate, which is great if I want to polish or spread wax over a large vehicle, or one with lots of flat panels. This Subaru is a smaller car with lots of curves and contours, so I want to use a smaller pad to spread wax evenly over all those areas. I'm going to switch from the included 6'' backing plate to the TORQ22D 5'' backing plate so I can use a smaller pad to spread the wax evenly. To get started, I'll lay the machine on its dorsal side where it has this unique stopper. I can lay it down flat, and it won't fall over! That will make it easier to change pads or the backing plate. The machine comes with some spare parts and instruction manuals, but there's also an included Allen Key. This is the only tool you need to change out the backing plate. You see in the middle of the backing plate is a small bolt: just take the Allen Key, get it in the head, then break the tension on the screw. Now I can unscrew the single bolt. This is all you have to do to switch backing plates on the TORQ22D. The TORQ22D is the only large-throw dual action polisher that allows you to switch backing plate sizes without extensive modification or voiding the machine's warranty. Some other machines may use a 15mm or 21mm throw, but you're not allowed to switch between the 5'' or 6'' backing plates without voiding the warranty. The TORQ22D is designed to accept either one without any modifications. To spread the wax today, I'm going to use the Black Hex-Logic Pad. This is a soft finishing pad. It has no extra cut, so I'm not polishing or removing any paint: I'm just going to spread the wax in a nice even coat with the soft pad. Now I have the perfect combination of machine, backing plate, and pad to get the job done. Let's go ahead and move over to the Subaru to get the perfect coat of wax. To get started, I already washed the car and conducted a clay bar service so the paint feels smooth as glass. Now we just need to add the perfect layer of wax for the best protection to keep this World Rally Blue paint looking awesome! Waxing a car with a machine polisher is the fastest way to wax an entire car. You also use the least amount of product because you get the thinnest, most even layer across every surface. I'll take some Butter Wet Wax and put a few dots across this Black Hex-Logic Pad. These few dots are enough to do the entire front end, and then some. To get started, I'll flip the cord back over my shoulder, and dab the wax out across the surface... ...that way when I turn the machine on, I won't fling any around the car and where I don't want it. I'll flip the machine one, and I'm just going to use speed setting 1 to spread the wax. I'm not working the wax in, I'm not polishing the paint, I'm just spreading the wax across the paint like how you'd spread butter on toast. I don't need to work it in at all, I just need to spread it across in a nice even coat. Now you've seen how fast and easy it was to spread wax using the TORQ22D dual action polisher. Since I used Butter Wet Wax, I don't have to wait for any dry or cure times. Butter Wet Wax is wax on/wax off. So I'll take a Workhorse Microfiber Towel and buff off the residue to reveal a nice lustrous protected surface! This looks great on this World Rally Blue: really makes it look extra deep blue and wet. Butter Wet Wax removes very easily from the clear bra as well. It buffs off the headlight easily, no problem.

one tip it's gonna take that brand-new rough pre seasoning off there to us smoothest glass finish [Music] my name is Kent Rollins oh thank y'all so much for joining us in this video today we are going to show you how to smooth out rough cast iron I'm talking the stuff they preseason now the preseason that I'm talking about is the stuff they put on this cast iron to think that they're saving y'all some time and some effort the ones I'm really talking about folks is a logic cast iron so if you've got a piece of pre-seasoned cast-iron and it is rough gritty feeling to your touch I'm gonna tell you how to take care of it when you start out with something smooth you're gonna season quick or build up season easier and have that smoother finish do you need more ideals or more help with your cast iron to get it in the best shape it's ever been in its life Shan my little sweet wife has created a link that is down below it is a playlist we've also created a step-by-step guide that is everything this video is about how to smooth cast iron it will be in the description below always keep that thing handy because you might need it you can go back to it find out anything you need to know so let's quit beating around the bush and let's get some of this rough cast iron smoothed out to where we can cook up some goodness you go to the store and you buy cast iron today 99.9 percent of the time it is something they called pre-seasoned now they want you to cook out of it right off the bat I'm telling you don't that stuff is like a polymerized coating of a high temp soy oil that they put on there you ever felt a truck bedliner run your hand across it you'll know what I'm talking about you will eventually get that rough coating covered in 26 and a half years of cooking I don't want to wait that long so how we going to fix it well I'm gonna tell you folks this is the only time Shannon will let a mouse in the kitchen I promise where is it at it is here just one of them little Sanders they cause a mouse you get one of them orbital sanders you could do this by hand if and you got two now I've got a 60 grit paper over 30-day the lower the number the upper that paper now I like to use a sixty to eighty sometime along in there now you need to realize when we go to sand in this we're not going down to go gray nothing Oh net cast I just want to get their rough stuff off there then we can build that finish up to something that's going to be nonstick it's not a very long process this is not going to be a half a day deal I'm talking like maybe at the most ten minutes I don't think it's gonna take that long so hang on you folks you you see this got a little point on it so make sure you get in the curve right here in the bottom of this skillet and up them sides just a little and we nearly there I can begin to see some color in there we get that wiped out I think we're in pretty good shape sometimes folks that's gonna gum up that first round so hey they make some more just get you another sticker on there and go back to town you won't have much trouble the second round cuz you don't got most of that gunk off there the first round I'm not taking all that off they're plumb down to the bear I promise you so I'm gonna wipe this over here the war I can you sort of feel fit around these corners just a little bit more because you need to be able to take your finger in there and make sure because if you leave this rough down there in these corners something going to always want to stick there it's not plumb down to the black bear shiny metal everywhere I just want to make sure that I get that rough stuff off there so folks we got this send it down smooth I don't think it is good to go we're going to show you how to rebuild that seasoning on this skillet to get that slick glossy finish that you can slip and hang out whether you've just send it off a bunch of rust or you burnt something in a no fire pit to get rid of it to start plumb over this is starting over we're going to rebuild that seasoning up to where we got that slick glossy finish we do this to rebuild that seasoning up there you're getting three really good benefits out of it right off the bat number one nonstick number two easier to clean number three your food don't taste a whole lot better rinsing so skillet out will drive that excess water out of it c-can I get this newfangled thing to work here called a stove and I'm going to turn it up on about medium-high heat because I've got to get this to work it's dry before you season because we cannot season cold cast iron it's not going to accept it it's not going to get hot enough that it's going to bond to that's what this baking process is going to create here in a minute takes cast a little while to heat up so we're going to put it on there when you pour that all in there if it is smoking it is too hot but it ain't going to be too hot it's gonna be just right and y'all have seen me in the past always use some olive oil sure I use olive oil on my old stuff now because it has been slick and finished for so many years but I got to using some flaxseed oil when I was starting out with brand new stuff or stuff that was refurbished and we're gonna re season we're gonna take some of this flexi dough and we're just going to pour some in there now when your first time seasoning this and building back it's going to take more than what it would just everyday care so you're going to put a little more oil in there than eight or four or five drops so get you a good lint-free rag and the handle might be hot now so make you have something you can hang on to make sure you get it all wiped around up to the sides everywhere now we've preheated that oven like I said to 350 so this is hot enough that we can go in there so we can turn that burner off we're ready to go and if channel get in here where you can see you can see there is a good coat of oil on this thing so we're gonna put this in the oven on the middle rack of the oven at 300 degrees for about 40 minutes and then we're gonna turn it off and let it cool all on its own this is not a one-time process I promise you we're going to do this in three times before we can get that service to go to building up as you can see it's cool enough for me to handle it's been in there about 40 minutes just turned it plumb off let it come to about room temperature but guess what it's time to do it again now we made some progress here I could see some things taking place where this was pretty shiny in here you can see that we're beginning to build some gold up over here some layer so as we get another and another known there we're gonna go to get this black that we want to see on there let's put the oven back on 300 let it preheat heat this skillet magic when it gets a temperature like we did before the world we know it's warm enough that it'll take this seasoning we're going to pour again a pretty generous amount in there lint-free rag all the way around back in the oven another 40 minutes let it cool again and we'll look and see where we're at well folks as you can see we've done this about this is my third trip and this thing is slick it is good now you can see we lost that silver and we're getting more to that goldish bronze color in here now you don't have to continue to do this till it's solid black all the way across [Music] now go to front bake it in here front potatoes coast cast it does love some starch and every time you fry something that the more you use it the better the seasoning is going to be now if you ever use a skillet or a Dutch oven and it tastes a little like metal you ain't near there yet seasoning will cover that it'll make your food taste better if you go to tasting metal and something you know you ain't weren't far enough now folks I want to stress to you putting this in the oven and baking this seasoning on that way that is for this instance when you're starting from scratch and building up seasoning on cast iron going forward if you're starting with something that's rusted plumb up or you're having to start with a brand new oven this is the way you started so folks we hope you learned something about how to take care of that rough pre-seasoned cast-iron now like we said in the video not all of it comes this way there is new stuff that you can buy that has a slick preseason finished I'm mostly talking about the lodge and all that stuff that comes pre finished that is so rough get in there and take care of that cast iron because remember it is something that will give back to you every time you cook out of it thank you for stopping by god bless you each and every one hit the little subscribe button how about some mascara too", "qiNAHRmdK_8": "if you're

countertop really not that difficult to make our cut here on the end make sure you make the cut on the part on the side that's going to be up against the wall then here you'll see where we took and marked it with a black marker and then put painters tape and make sure that painters tape was still down really well that will keep any chipping from happening here where you've got to cut out your drain hole our faucets are on the wall their wall faucets so this is the boss blade it's a DB a seven four to five D it's wet and dry it's be wet and dry but it's a seven inch blade and you can ask for them and you can see it's a fine-tooth blade got it at Menards I believe this is called a spider SP y de AR and this is the drill bit that we used to make the hole for our drain and what you want to do is you want to have somebody sitting here with a bucket of water just a simple water bottle like this see drill I just scored it on the water just like that it fits and you just keep going and you just keep going and it'll take about between 15 and 20 minutes to drill that hole okay and you got to have a nice nice power drill like this one of the battery drills will not cut it and that's it so here's our plug I just set the other countertop on here and found out where my other green hole was because I knew that that matched up where my faucet drain down and made this countertop about an inch deeper than the other countertop because this one has a lip not to make sure that it goes over the top of my cabinet and I sort of stick out a little bit more but that's fine and then I made it a little bit longer so we'd have a little bit more overhang a little bit more counter space on that side of the sink and remember the sink is going to cover this but you still want a nice a still it a nice round non chipped hole there I want to do this not professionally now we're just going to take up the painters tape and any marker like this right here will come out with an alcohol swab or just a little bit of rubbing of the fingernail and this was a permanent marker this is a granite not quartz by the way there we go get some that permanent marker off there well big deals can be covered by the sink but still right there's our hole for the board under there all right so now what we're going to do here I'm going to get this wet here pre-wet it you can see my black permanent marker line you can see I put the painters tape and I left about an eighth of an inch gap to that I wrap the ends as well tuck those ends in now he's going to come through here and he's going to cut this if you water ready okay I got the vanity all sanded down and painted with my wagner sprayer and I put on about three coats of really nice paint it just needs the knobs countertop has been cut both to link this direction into its depth we glued and pressed on the splashes after we cut them to sides and I brought them back about an eighth of an inch here did the same in the front section there and if you get in my straight cut this can look really good now I got this farmhouse sink and the issue with this is is this goes in the back and it looks really good but you can see the front of a bit of the sink has a big bow in it right there I mean it's got a big bonus we decided that the back of the snake looked better than the front of the sink so unfortunately that happens sometimes and I got to sink in three days from California I don't have time to return it nothing else is actually wrong with the sink so we just turned it around and put the drain in the front and the overflow I mean it's in the front so faucet I soaked it in vinegar and it looks like brand-new everybody thinks we got a brand new put vinegar on the mirror and that really shined it up to kept the coach lights or the sconces wall sconces clean the windows scrub the tub and I've got this piece down here on I got to paint it so we have to do is paint the walls paint the trim and John's installing the sink so this is where he takes over you", "LYrDTIGjZ_s": "now presented by easy stone care calm and stone refinishing calm the only granite top polishing video you'll ever need made by stone guys for stone guys this is the Regent top polishing kit these are the 3 inch rigid turbo resin pads with the 2 inch snail walk backer that fits on to the B 2 inch snail lock anodized adapter these are used to remove the scratches and keep a flat finish this is the 4 inch hook-and-loop rigid backer for the snail lock system in the Alpha 1000 grit resin here's the mb 20 polishing compound this is the 7 inch foam hook and loop backer that's used with the 8 inch hogshead pad and a china marker used for outlining your area the makita 9 2 2 7 C is the machine of choice for this procedure for this video we're going to remove a scratch start by marking out your area so you know where to start Spray the section down with a good amount of water enough to lubricate the pad but not too much always place the Machine flat on the surface before starting it this way you avoid causing more damage start the Machine and lock the trigger and then position your rear hand on the body of the machine and your front hand over the head and Arbor of the machine this will focus all of the pressure straight down through the arbor through the pad and straight onto the surface of the material without creating any unwanted pressure on the sides of the pad work in a tight circular pattern and keep an eye on the slurry that's being generated from the pad the thicker the slurry the more material you're cutting away and the faster that this occurs the faster the material is cutting away check your work frequently you after you wipe it down you can simply blow on the surface to dry out the moisture from the area you have just cut down inspect the area closely to make sure that your scratch is gone from the first step if it is not you must continue with the first step until the scratch is gone you don't forget to pay attention to the slurry use this as an indicator of how fast the stone is being cut down keep your first area as small as possible so you don't end up doing an area that is larger than necessary you clean off the area again and blow it until it is dry you take your China marker and mark the outside of the scratch pattern where you have just worked this will serve as an indicator line of where your area is to be contained when the stone is wet you cannot see the scratch pattern and you can end up doing a larger area than necessary because granite is far more difficult to refinish the marble or travertine it takes a lot longer and going further than necessary will result in a lot of wasted time and effort with each progressive grit the time needed will be less and less you are simply removing the scratches from the previous grit pad and as you move up you will have less and less slurry it is important to keep the pad moving across the surface constantly as to not sit in one spot too long these particular types of pads are very aggressive and can cut a slight dip into the stone when you are finished with the step lift the Machine quickly from the surface don't forget to always thoroughly clean dry and inspect the area very carefully between each grid what you want to make sure is that no part of the scratch pattern is more dull or less than the rest it must all be exactly the same from the center to the outside edge if it is more dull around the outer perimeter you have not overlapped properly you must go back and use the same grit pad and remove all of the previous grit scratches from the outer ring of the scratch pattern mark the outside of your scratch pattern to get ready for the next step make additional circles outside the one you have just made representing one ring for each next grit this will look like a target when you are finished and will help you keep will work inside of a contained area as to not go too far and create more work for yourself you can also write the number of each grid inside of each ring this will help you identify with ease which step is next you the idea here is to go over the first line and up to the next line in the ring this will keep your scratch pattern precise and sharp so that is easy to overlap with the next step this system is very easy and requires no indexing of the pads simply twist to remove and twist to put back on the pads will stay true and flat spray down your area with water and continue with your next step I prefer to start with the outer ring of the scratch pattern first and work my way towards the center this is because often subconsciously you will forget to work enough on the outside resulting in poor overlapping in a scratch pattern that is dull around the outer ring the ability to precisely control the machine is very important with this procedure you must be able to go up to the line but not over it so that you do not interfere with your next step notice how on this step the slurry is generating very quickly the stone is cutting very fast and even though it is a 500 grit it still removes a significant amount of material you must pay attention and not go too far when you feel you have completed your step remove the Machine and clean up the area and dry it for inspection you repair any rings that may have been wiped away you will notice now that the color is coming back significantly the surface will be smoother to the touch and you will start to be able to see a reflection to properly inspect your progress you must get down at eye level with the countertop and check the reflection for clarity and for flatness change your pad and get ready for the next step by ensuring that the surface is clean and free of any debris small debris can get caught under the pad and create rogue scratches this can cause you to go backwards and start all over again again place the machine on the surface before starting start on the outer perimeter of your scratch pattern and work your way towards the center even the 1,000 grit resin will remove a significant amount of material it is important to use this pad thoroughly but also to be careful and not create a wave in the surface you use a good amount of pressure and keep the machine moving across the surface at all times you this is what the slurry should look like when you are finished you notice a lot of color has come back and the area is getting less and less noticeable as you move on get down and look at eye level and make sure that the scratch pattern is consistent in exactly the same throughout the whole area now we are finished with the turbo pads and must move on to the alpha 1000 resin this is a wet to dry procedure and requires changing from the turbo pads to the 4-inch widget backer put the backer on the adapter just like you gave the turbo pads and then place the Alpha 1000 resin on the hook-and-loop backer and make sure it is centered the best you can make sure the pad surface is clean and free of any debris stuck in the channels and make sure it is stuck down to the hook and loop very firmly clean the surface thoroughly once more this procedure uses very little water you don't need much at all place the Machine flat on the surface and start it with the dial reading the number one position with very little pressure work the water around in about half of the area as the water dries up it will create a good amount of friction this is exactly what you want and you should apply more pressure and fight through the Machine grabbing the surface this will generate a lot of heat and will polish the stone mechanically very quickly the water will eventually dry up completely and you can keep going for several seconds after this occurs you may hear a high-pitched screeching sound this is perfectly okay it is just the diamond scratching the surface in a very very fine pattern when you are done remove the machine and spray a fine mist of water across the area and buff it clean when it is dry thoroughly inspect the area to make sure that the whole area is the same and there are no areas that are more dull than the other here you can see that I have done half of the area that we worked on you can see the drastic difference between the 1,000 grit turbo when used wet and the 1000 grit alpha resin when used wet to dry this wet to dry friction generates a tremendous amount of heat and is the key to popping a perfect shine on a granite countertop continue with this procedure adding water as necessary to create the friction until you are done you will know you are done when the whole area looks the same and there is no distinguishing outline from the area that you have previously worked on it should blend in with the rest of the countertop and not have a distinct outline check the surface temperature frequently to make sure it is not too hot to touch it is too hot to touch it is too hot to polish you must let it cool so that it is warm or lukewarm you on some stones such as this one the 1000 grit resin will produce an almost factory finish it will be difficult to see the area that you are working on as it will blend in very nicely with the rest of the stone at this point we are almost finished do any touch-ups as needed to make sure that there is no distinguishing outline from the area that you are working on you if there is still an obvious cloudy area then you may move on to the 2000 and sometimes 3000 alpha resin each progressive grit will make a significant difference in the amount of clarity and shine on the counter before proceeding to the final step here you can see a slight haze in the area that we have just worked on this is fine and it is ready for the next step which is the final polishing step where we use the NV 20 polishing compound MB 20 is a white cream use about the size of a marble and spread it on the surface use the seven-inch backer and place the 8 inch hog hair pad on the backer place the Hogs hair pad over the crane and start the machine on the number 1 setting spread it around over the area to be worked on so that it forms a thin haze this process is also wet to dry so when it starts to dry up it will grab from the friction just like the alpha resin pad did continue through this friction until it is burnished completely from the surface you should see a shine starting to form during this process if you need to you may add additional pressure although a lot of pressure is not needed like it is when you are using diamonds continue to move the machine across the surface and burnish the product completely from the surface when it is all gone you may release the pressure and just go over the area to buff it to make sure that it is clean here you can see the shine has come back and is almost ready to be presented to the customer on many stones a second or sometimes third application will be necessary to get the proper finish for the additional applications you don't need to add much product you can add a little bit of water to the product to thin it out and also to create a little bit more friction when it goes dry if you do need a third or even a fourth application typically you don't need to add more product just water the product that is built up into the pad will still be usable and will help you clean up the surface and pop that final shine here I have finished half of the area that we had originally worked on now it is time to do the other half while many people prefer to increase the speed of the machine as the procedure continues so I'm prefer to leave the setting on number one number one is 600 rpm and will work just fine for most or all stones using this product this will reduce the distance of splatter and help keep your work and surrounding areas clean you continue to burnish the whole area and blend in with the surrounding area when it is done properly this product will create a factory finish equivalent polish and should be impossible to detect where the repair was made when this product was first released there was a concern that it was a topical application many tests have been conducted to verify this and to this day nothing has indicated that this is a topical finish this provides a factory finish on granite and on serpentine green marble as well if any touch-ups are needed simply mist the area with a little bit of water and do not add any more product quickly buff the area and burnish dry using little to no additional pressure you", "hYGCaSoV33Q": "Namaskar\nWelcome to nishamadhulika.com It tastes super delicious when mirch pickle is served with meals. Chili pickle overcomes the taste of meals if you added less spices to the veggies. Let's start with the procedure of making instant green chili pickle. We have taken 100 grams of green chilies which are generally used for making any sabzi. Rinse the chilies well and pat dry. Start with chopping the chilies in small chunks or bite size pieces. Remove the stalk first. Try using a scissor for chopping the chilies as it more convenient and also doesn't come on your hands. Similarly chop down all the chilies like this. Here we have taken some spices for the pickle. We will have to grind the whole spices like fennel seeds, cumin seeds, fenugreek seeds and mustard seeds. But prior grinding these seeds, roast them for a while. Turn off the flame and add 1 tsp cumin seeds, 1.5 tsp fenugreek seeds, 3 tsp fennel seeds, and 3 tsp black mustard seeds to the pan. Now roast the spices on very low-medium flame. We don't have to roast the spices just roast to remove the moisture. Stir constantly and roast the spices. If you keep these spices under sunlight then roasting them is not required. We are done with roasting the spices for half a minute, now let us grind them. Place these spices in jar and ground them little coarsely. We are done with grinding the spices, let us prepare the pickle now. Mix the spices to the chopped chilies now. We have taken 4 tsp mustard oil, add it to the chilies. If you don't like the spicy and sharp taste of mustard oil then heat the oil in a pan and add to the chilies when it cools down completely. But the sharp and spicy taste of mustard oil taste good in this chili pickle. So, here we are not heating the oil rather adding it directly to the pickle. We have added 4 tsp mustard oil. Also, add 4 tsp white vinegar. You can add any other vinegar available in your house. Any type of vinegar can be used for making this pickle. Add the ground spices as well, followed by 1.5 tsp salt, 1 tsp turmeric powder, \u00bc tsp asafoetida powder and mix everything really well. Pickle is now done and ready. This pickle can be consumed immediately. You can serve this pickle immediately but this pickle when served after 2 to 3 tastes super delicious. You can very instantly prepare this pickle. Store it in any container and relish eating for up to 2 to 3 months.

hand-mixed the ratio we did on this particular exposed aggregate was a three two to three aggregate to sand to cement pretty rich you would say the reason I went rich on this cuz I want good good cement you know clean to these rocks I'm gonna seed the surface with that way when I rinse you know the surface it doesn't come away from my aggregate I want a good bond I wanted to bind good with my aggregate I'm gonna use some half-inch Riverrock and I'm just gonna coat the whole surface and when I did coat it I initially laid it down I hand floated it I added it within 20 minutes I started seating it so in other words you need to seed right away also this this particular rock came in a bag so what I've done to the bag before I did this process here that you're saying is I put a lot of holes in the bottom of the bag I just jabbed a bunch of holes in it and ran water through it a lot of water tell that the water ran clean so now I know my rock is very clean that way when I put the rock on here and I start beating it into the concrete it's gonna bind to the cement if you have dirt or other other organic materials and other things that prevent it from bonding then that wouldn't be a very good thing when you start to rinse because all your Rock's gonna end up falling out so you want to do when you cover that when you do any seating you want to cover it a hundred percent so pretty much all you see is rock on the surface when you get to that point it's time to get it into the surface and you can do that by tamping it with a jitterbug or a roller tamp any of those things you get on it early enough will bring the cream up and drop the aggregate in now the important thing is to remember when you're reporting around surrounding areas you're gonna have to pour your initial pour about a half inch low depending on the size of aggregate you're using because that's gonna bring up the elevation so what I did is I was started about a half inch below this form here and when I threw the rock on that brought it right up to the top you can't see that rock in there now and that's exactly what you want that way you know that that rock is in there solid and it's part of the mixture at this point now when you want to expose it you can use in a large area get a big horsehair broom you know half horse half nylon and just kind of rub it up a little bit look a little bit of water on there this is all done in the same day about 80 degrees outside we're in direct sunlight and this is about seven hours in now you don't want to use a nozzle when you do any kind of exposure on the same day just let the water flow loosen it up with the horsehair and the water will do all the work you've couldn't you could put anything into the surface of concrete with this exact same technique it could be broken glass or whatever you like just unlimited to put coins in their silver gold anything that like gather will hold up well put it in the surface throw a sealer on it and it's a done deal here's what it looks like we've got some nice round River rock very nice to walk over it's also non-slip very um stain resistant was basically the only thing showing his rock which is the hardest stuff of concrete this makes a really nice stepping stone do a dozen of those in position wherever you want in the yard see that's wet so you can put some wet sealer on there wet look sealer on there and it'll look like that forever anyway thanks for watching this exposed aggregate video and uh if you liked it subscribe hit the bell if you want to get the latest and greatest as

tell you it's pretty funny with this wheel I don't know whether it is but we were on the most aggressive where it we're on speed 4 which is 20 4,500 rpms we love when it down to speed 1 it almost seems as though the paint and material was removed faster or lower speed I don't you know exactly why but I can't tell you that speed 2 is 15,000 rpms speed 3 is 20,000 rpms so you're able to really get close to your desire to RPM for the work that you're doing I will say that this has been a highly anticipated product offering where is before automotive shots will probably use a pneumatic solution we're talking to some people in that industry they say that they like the versatility of being able to just pop a compact battery or even an X C style battery into the tool they don't have to worry about the compressor constantly running that was one of their concerns to get that much rpm and maybe they were relaying the information to me wrong or I'm relaying it to to you wrong but what they told us is is that it takes a lot a lot of air to run this style to a pneumatic in a pneumatic form factor they like the idea of being able to pop that battery in and plus they don't have to have a hose tagging behind them it's pretty cool a lot of people have been waiting for this you see that look how quickly it takes taste of material off now I will say this because the style of pad we're leaving a little bit of a hash mark or a crosshatch pattern in here I want to see if increasing that speed will will remove some of those those marks I might not might [Music] [Applause] [Music]

It\u2019s a perfect day in Pittsburgh.\nToday we\u2019re going to be talking about how to drill ceramic tile and to do it fast using\nthe right tools. There are two big problems when drilling holes\nin ceramic tile. Number one, it taking forever. And number two, when you actually get done,\nhaving chips in the edge of the tile and making it look unprofessional. If you don\u2019t have\nthe right diamond drill bit for this, it could take forever, and you may only be able to\ndrill a few holes in your ceramic tile before you need another one, and that wastes a lot\nof time and money. So it\u2019s imperative to have the right diamond\ncore bit. This one by Montolit is called the Mondrillo Black. This is a premium diamond\ncore bit. You can use it with both a drill and an angle grinder, and we\u2019ll show you\nhow to do that. Today we\u2019re going to be using the Fein WSG\n7 4 \u00bd\u201d angle grinder. It has a 5/8\u201d arbor on it. It also comes with a support flange;\nmost angle grinders do. Slide the support flange on like so. There\u2019s a button on the\ntop of the WSG 7; you want to press down on that. And then you can tighten the Mondrillo\nBlack down onto the arbor like so until it\u2019s tight, and that\u2019s it. That\u2019s all you need\nto do. Now this diamond bit can be used for dry drilling,\nmeaning you don\u2019t need to cool it down with water. That said, if you feel like you do\nneed to cool it down if you\u2019re doing a lot of drilling, you can use Montolit\u2019s Mondrillo\nPerformer cooling fluid. If you\u2019re cutting a lot of holes and ceramic tile, you can dunk\nyour core bit into this and cool it down to elongate the life span of the bit.\nJust a few tips on safety. Always wear eye protection and get yourself a silica dust\nrespirator like this Sundstr\u00f6m one and some hearing protection and glove protection for\nyour hands. I\u2019ll put links to the Sundstr\u00f6m mask down in our description here because\nI really like it, and I think that you should use it if you want to stay safe.\nBegin the cut by positioning the core bit at a 45\u00b0 to the top of the tile, move it\nto a 90\u00b0 and then use a wave-like pattern to complete your cut.\nAs you saw, that took a few seconds, which is awesome. Now, before you do what I\u2019m\ngoing to do next, unplug your angle grinder. There\u2019s a little hole right here. Just stick\na screwdriver up in there and you pop out the ceramic slug. And as you can see, there\u2019s\nminimal chipping around the hole. Again, start your cut by positioning the core\nbit at a 45\u00b0, move it to a 90\u00b0, and use that wave-like pattern to complete the cut-out\nof the ceramic tile. You can use the cooling fluid by Montolit\nto cool down the core bit if you\u2019re making successive cuts in ceramic tile; it doesn\u2019t\nslow down the cut whatsoever, and it will prolong the lifespan of the Mondrillo Black.\nAs you can see here again, we\u2019re using that 45\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 method and the wave-like movement\nto make quick cuts. And even after the fourth cut, this core bit was just as quick as it\nwas on the first one. In order to use this core bit with the drill,\nyou need an adaptor. So this part of the adaptor goes into the drill, and the threaded side\ngoes into the core bit like so. Then as you can see, this just slides right into the drill,\nand you lock it in place. So let\u2019s see how this diamond core bit works with the drill.\nSo we used the 45\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 technique again using the core bit with the drill; that doesn\u2019t\nchange. It is going to take a little bit longer with the drill; twice as long, as a matter\nof fact, and you have to ensure that the dust doesn\u2019t interfere with the cleanness of\nthe cut, which it did in this case for me because it was the first time. But you can\nuse your index finger here to carefully guide the core bit into that 45\u00b0 and then to the\n90\u00b0 eventually. It will take about twice as long to make these cuts with the drill\nbit versus the angle grinder. As you can see here, there are thirteen holes\nin the ceramic tile, and the Mondrillo Black continues to perform.\nThe Mondrillo Black by Montolit is the real deal. As you saw, it cut through ceramic tile\nin seconds with either the angle grinder or the drill. If you want to buy this, we\u2019re\ngoing to put a link down in the description. That\u2019ll take you over to our online store\nwhere we sell these, also the cooling paste and the adaptor that you need for the drill\nif you\u2019re going to be using the drill instead of the angle grinder. Although, I highly recommend\nthat you use the angle grinder because it\u2019s awesome.\nSo that\u2019s it. Thanks for much for watching this video. Give us a thumbs up if you liked\nthe test, and we\u2019ll see you in the next one. Take care.", "i0B_LsLN5h0": "[Music] [Music] you", "HdU8VS_3sdQ": "it's very easy to fix electric motors first of all you need to be qualified don't go attempting this if you're not qualified it is dangerous to work with electrical equipment make sure all the cool equipment is unplugged and electric motors are very simple your bushings the actual coil copper coil and some capacitors some do and usually when an electric motors being used for a longer period of time it comes down to the bottom so when opening up a device you first thing you look for is the bushings a bushing the wall now in my case it wasn't bushings it came down to a capacitor so it wasn't just started not properly I swapped over the Kassar and when l and it also could be a bit of corrosion and a switch so first things you look for is a the bushings is usually bushings in any corrosion or broken wiring anywhere or loose loose screws if that probably comes down to the if not that and all the capacitors it comes down to the cop-calling and therefore it's probably just is you just throwing it in the bin and buying another one for me I was like here was the capacitor cleaned out my switch that's in here I pulled off the plastic cover cleaned it up metal sure the connections were all good and they were and then I pulled out the capacitor capacitor in there now I've pulled it out and I've tested it and if you don't know how to test the capacitor you've got to have a multimeter okay this is a cheap one change it to UF and depending on how much you've got this is 15 you have it on a very low setting so any number above 15 so like 2050 you VA don't be fine and so you turn it to us on your multimeter and the line on one side means negative the outside means positive so you put red meaning positive on the positive side black meaning negative on the negative side and these are passages that I have for TV fixing it's got line there negative and positive and I've tested that and that's faulty so it comes down to my Bosch angle grinder not working because as a capacitor not the bushings not the switch at the capacitor so I'm going to order a new one and plug it in there and cost me a dollar two and I'll fix my problem then I'll whack it back together", "nf5-0ykbthU": "[Music] what's up yo bigcat305 here today we're making egg muffins that's right egg muffins three different kinds and if you have never heard of or had an egg muffin you gotta stick around so i will let you know which kinds but you got to stick around for that as well if you're new to the channel here what we do here is we try to simplify the cooking process make it easy and fun make sure you hit that subscribe button down below and ring that notification bell if you're a current subscriber thank you for all your support we really do appreciate it everybody let's get cooking all right here we go we're going to start with some bacon that's right just a couple strips of bacon because we're only putting this in two of the egg muffins so figure out a strip of bacon per egg next up we have a green bell pepper we're gonna chop this up into little dices just like so looking good you want to make sure you're trapping these relatively small because they're going into a little muffin so just a few more chops and we're done now we have the onion just a medium to large size onion the same thing chop it up not too big uh we're gonna cook this up saute it but it's still you don't want big big giant chunks so something like that once we're all done we stick them together with the peppers because we're going to cook them together next up a nice ripe tomato and we're just going to chop this up as best we can uh dice it up if you can it's you know it's a it's a tomato so just dice dice dice as best you can and we're gonna have this set to the side as well all right we have our green onions we're gonna again dice these up i like to go thick with the fat green parts and then dice the smaller parts up and that's give a little mixture there and then finally our baby spinach just rinsed up no big deal just rinse it set it off to the side and then we have six eggs one for each muffin and we're gonna just whisk these up check out my one handed egg cracking technique last egg in the bath and we start to whisk you just want to give us a good whisk get all those eggs broken up nicely until they look like this and then we're gonna add some salt and pepper as well as a little bit of garlic powder season these up just a tad whisk up just to get it incorporated and that is it we are on to the frying pan we're gonna take that bacon and we are gonna prep this bacon just by frying it up getting it ready for our two muffins they're gonna have the bacon so remember like i said one slice of bacon per muffin and that's it we just fry this up nothing fancy just let me tell you it's a little difficult frying bacon when they're this small but you can figure it out get it to how you like it take it off and set off to the side for the next step we're gonna use that bacon grease because there's not much of it so no need to empty it out we're gonna use it it's like liquid gold and we take our onions and our peppers and we're gonna fry those up add a little salt and pepper to those the season a little bit extra pepper because that uh combination does not have it that much and then a little bit of garlic powder as well and for this we're not gonna overcook this we're just gonna literally saute it for a couple minutes just to give it a little head start with the cooking process these are only going to be in the oven for 15 minutes so don't really want the hard onion to pepper so this is perfect just like that next up we are ready for the prep we're gonna take our muffin tin tray here with six and we're gonna oil that up with some spray and then we build this is it first two muffins are gonna be bacon first that's the layer then we add some green onions this is so easy it's this is where you get creative here this is the fun part green onions some cheddar cheese and this is our classic here bacon cheese egg with some green onions and that's it next up we have our baby spinach super easy you don't want you can just fit them in there just try to get the stems from sticking out there you go boom take that off we can add some tomatoes keep adding the tomatoes until you get that pretty full and then we are going to add our cheese this is just mozzarella cheese so spinach tomatoes mozzarella great combination and then for the last ones the western we're going to add our green bell peppers and onions that have already had a head start with the sauteing and then on top of that we're going to add some tomatoes this is gonna be a classic western with then some salsa just a little bit give it that mexican flavor and then of course the four cheese mexican blend for our cheese topping looking good i'm so excited here we go so next step we have our eggs i put them in a container that's much easier to pour remember it's like one egg per muffin tin so just do your best here you want to get it to like three quarters full that's kind of the goal it's best if you load these up with the toppings i honestly thought i was going to run out of eggs and had to make some more but i did not it actually came out perfect so here we go the last couple of tins filling up with the eggs and looking good and that's it it's just that easy we have our oven preheated to 400 degrees and a little bit more cheese on top of here why not and that's it clean up the top get any kind of leftovers off of there so it's nice and clean [Music] preheated oven to 400 15 minutes and after 15 minutes this is what you have wow look at that that looks perfect you just want to make sure the eggs are cooked all the way through and nice and brown on top and then we take them out little little little knife kind of dig them out but once you spray it like that look at that it comes out so easily and that's it one at a time just take them out i let these cool down for a tad let me tell you because they were hot so i let them cool down i would highly suggest that that way they kind of stick together and they don't fall apart so uh i let them rest for about a good five minutes before i took them out of there and just take them out one at a time here we go speed it up a little bit look at that close-up oh yeah that looks delicious here we go a couple more looking great and then one final close-up of all of them wow they came out so good look how beautiful those are they look so tasty and that's it we are ready let's go check them out look at this beautiful meal here this could be breakfast this could be lunch this could be dinner it could be all three could be a midnight snack it might be i don't know uh we got three different assortments and i cannot wait to dig in i don't know what to pick they all look phenomenal uh my gut is telling me to go with the bacon and cheese they all got cheese but my gut is going with the bacon and cheddar but i'm gonna go for the western muffin egg muffin uh it just looks so nice and it's still nice and hot and look you can pick it up with your hands and let's give it a taste test oh my goodness that is packed packed with flavor and falling apart a little bit too i must say um i probably should able to fork that's all right the taste is phenomenal i can taste that salsa that's in there the peppers the onions and that four cheese mexican blend is awesome everybody give this a shot you can be as creative as you want do

herbalist series i'm going to be talking to you guys about some of the basic tools that you need to begin building your at home apothecary okay so if you had not gotten the chance you definitely want to check out the previous episode where i'm talking to you guys about herbal books for beginners okay because you'll be able to pull some ideas from those books if you're interested right but um today i'm gonna go ahead and just talk to you about um different tools that you need and some you may already have in your home you may not even have to go and buy basic um household tools right um and also i'll give you one there's one particular tool that i may give you an alternative option on that you can do at home um and i'll just kind of advise you through that okay all right so with that being said let's go ahead and jump right into the video okay guys so the first basic tool that you're actually going to be needing is a mason jar okay so now this is a pretty large size jar but for individuals who are just looking to kind of have herbs on hand this is a perfectly fine size here this mason jar here just a regular like eight ounce jar is perfectly fine you can even find them smaller than this okay but this larger size mason jar this is really good for like if um for people like myself who's our herbalist i even use jars much larger than this okay but um if you're just looking to just kind of you know play around at home you just need a small size mason jar okay mason jars work excellent if you're someone who is interested like i've referred you guys to the books if you're interested in learning how to do that i'm also in my course my herbal course i do teach how to make tinctures and glycerins and things like that right how i do it now um what i was taught and so in this particular jar though what's good for these is storing your herbs making tinctures making glycerins things like that now you guys know i sell my own herbal products so obviously i use larger size jars okay but if you're just someone yourself looking to build your own at home apothecary a small size mason jar will do just fine okay guys so this next thing that you're actually gonna need for your at home apothecary tools okay to become a herbalist you absolutely have to have funnels so you want each size when it comes to funnels okay because like with this larger funnel for myself it depends on what you're trying to do but for myself personally i use large funnels for large jars just like this or if it depends on what i'm making or if you have the smaller size when you're making your infused oils and you're ready to store your finished product in a amber or dark glass jar you need funnels okay so this is pretty large i don't have my smaller one here with me at the moment but you'll use the smaller one to help put the finished product inside a dark jar it could be blue dark blue amber just like this okay all right so funnels are absolute must so the next thing that you're absolutely going to need is actually mesh strainers okay so without a question you're going to need mesh strainers especially if you're if you're using powdered herbs and i'm going to go over the difference in just a second but when you're using powdered herbs you need mesh strainers because if you're using powder herbs to make yourself like some infused oils or even if you're making like a tincture slash extract um you need the mesh strainer and what you're going to do is which i'll get into in just a second is use a cheesecloth to put here inside and then you're going to pour that i'm going to show you guys how to do this coming up in some other videos but you're going to pour on the oil there and then it'll catch all that powdered herb for you and you'll be left with the infused oil okay so you absolutely need mesh strainers to be able to do that so the next thing you're going to need after the mesh strainers right and the funnels is you're going to need cheesecloths or nut milk bags okay so i know some herbalists they'll just use one or the other they may use and the reason man i'm gonna tell you guys why i use both but um when it comes to cheesecloths right they're really good to me in my opinion what i like to use them for is for the powdered herbs like i just mentioned with the mesh strainer right but um when i you can use them for cut and sifted herbs as well cut and sifted herbs i'll show you guys a clip of that in another video okay but cut and sifted herbs are pretty much just the chopped up herb and so personally when the herb is much bigger i like to use nut milk bags for that okay it's just a little bit more sturdy to me using a nut milk bag to help squeeze the liquid from the herbs and get all those constituent properties from the herbs but personally i like to use cheese cloths you can do the same you can do powder or cut and sifted herbs with a cheesecloth okay but like i said as an herbalist over time you kind of know what you like and personally cutting sifted herbs i like using a nut milk bag powdered herbs i like to use a cheesecloth so it's up to you what you want to use okay so the next thing that you're actually going to need are amber glass bottles so once you've done your you got your mesh strainers you've gotten your cheesecloth your nut mill back and you strain that herb right of the concentric properties that you need for your product or your infusion or your oil or whatever it is that you're making your extract the next thing you're going to do is you're going to dispense that product into your amber bottles okay so um personally i have you know big bottles but i'm gonna show like certain ones your your extracts and things you can put them here even if you're doing an infused oil for your hair i'm gonna show you guys how to do that coming up even if you're using some for your skin always make sure that you're putting your product that you made in dark amber glass bottles they have blue ones as well you can use i think i mentioned that already but um the reason being is because direct sunlight to your product can cause it to become like degraded so it'll it won't be as fresh and good as it was as when you made it if it's exposed to sunlight or if it's not stored properly the amber tint helps to keep it protected from that direct sunlight okay so you want to make sure that you're using glass amber bottles to do so one of the last things i'm going to talk about as a basic in this video is that you're going to need a double boiler so you use double boilers because they have a top and bottom to them and you just sit this right on top and this is where you put your herbal product to infuse um the reason for this is because you don't want your product to get too hot if it becomes too hot it'll start to um kill off a lot of the concentrate properties in the herb so that's why you use a double boiler where it heats up at the bottom with water and it just slightly heats up the top okay if that makes sense i'm trying to break it down for you guys so um then you put your oil and your herbs here and let them just infuse like they should now a lot of people do not have not aren't really interested in investing in a double boiler personally i love a double boiler but if you're not interested in investing in one an alternative option that you can do is you can actually use an instant pot or a crock pot okay so what you do is you fill this slightly with water you're gonna fill it with water until it covers about up to here on your glass measuring beaker okay you put your oil in here your herbs in here and i'm teaching you guys this because i'm gonna show you a video coming up soon how to make some some things and i want you to have your supplies ready okay so you put your oil and your herbs in here you'll put the water in here until it comes about to this point you want to be really careful when you sit this in the water put a towel down okay because it's glass so sit this on like a folded towel to make sure it doesn't shatter anything in the water okay once you do that you're gonna put your urban oil here set it in here you want to try to find something like a small plate or a small lid to cover the top of this the reason being is because you don't want to get any water in your infused oil because there's no preservative in that it's a hundred percent authentic no preservative nothing like that okay so you want to make sure because water is the root of life it causes bacteria mold things like that so you don't want any water getting into whatever it is you're making okay and you're infusing so this is the option if you do not have a double boiler so make sure you just kind of put something over that glass measuring beak while you're making your infused oil okay all right so another excellent tool to have that i don't have with me but you guys have seen me using one of my previous videos it's actually a coffee grinder now if you're someone who likes to have seeds on hand i've shown you guys how to do this before with black seeds like for black seed oil how you can make a infused black seed oil um a coffee grinder is excellent to have on hand so that you're able to ground down your seeds and make them into a powder form okay and so when you do that um it's really easy to make your infused oils from there okay so a coffee grinder is an absolute must if you're interested in using seeds to make it to powder to be able to then transfer over into diffused oil okay guys so now it's time for the question of the week and this question actually comes from carol her she said hello there deborah can one use acv apple cider vinegar or fruit slash herb vinegar as a substitute for alcohol for making tinctures carol this is actually an excellent question and it's not the first time i've actually gotten it so i'm glad to address it on this video um when it comes to apple cider vinegar you can absolutely use it as a substitute um when you're making your extracts or your tinctures however just keep in mind the reason why herbalists when we make our products and when they're being sold we do not use apple cider vinegar because apple cider vinegar does not have a shelf life as long as say a glycerin would have which is about two to three years and uh alcohol tincture that is um 10 years okay so it just depends on what it is that you're how long you're looking to have that for but yes apple cider vinegar is actually a superb way to make extracts and get them into your system with those herbs okay all right so now that being said let's get into the herbal lingo for the week so the herbal lingo of the week is the term analgesic so analgesic is actually the term that's used for herbs that help to aid in pain relief right so um specific herbs can fall into this category that are known to be anti-inflammatory herbs those are herbs like ginger turmeric things of that such but one herb in particular that i want to highlight on this week's video is feverfew so feverfew is actually the herb that's known to help minimize migraines and excellent for helping to eliminate the pain that you may be experiencing if you're someone who gets migraines often and so um yes analgesic is the term that is actually known that i want you guys to remember to help minimize or eliminate pain so that does it for this week's video guys i hope that this was helpful i hope that you guys have some of these tools and if not remember you can always find ways to make things a different way if like you don't have the double boiler on hand if you have a nut mill bag and not a cheesecloth or vice versa things of that such i just wanted to give you guys different options that you could actually use when making things um we're going to be talking a whole lot more about some of these things coming up in the future and so i hope that this video was helpful and i will see you all in the next episode of growth and nutrition see you then bye guys", "Zn0GzVzVyts": "hi guys I'm Dan John's welcome back to the channel if you haven't subscribed yet please make sure you do so we're almost at 2 million subscribers and I really want you to be one of them now today I have a little bit of a different tutorial for you it's a DIY and almost like a cake or baking hack I've been using a ton of edible glitter in my recent videos so I'm going to show you three ways to make homemade edible glitter now the first way I'm going to show you is I'm going to be using a larger grain of sugar in order to make this nice kind of like crystal like edible glitter the second version I'm going to be showing you is using something called gum text or tylose which you might already have and I'm going to show you how to make that one then I'm going to show you how to make the third one which is a gelatin based edible glitter so let's get started on this tutorial the first edible glitter recipe I'm going to show to you is one using sugar now the sugar you want to use is a larger grain than you would find with the traditional granulated sugar this one here is an organic sugar when it's natural and then this one here is sugar in the raw either of these work for this the sugar in the raw is even a little bit larger than what I have here in the bowl so in the bowl is the natural sugar and you're going to use a quarter cup of the natural sugar you can use more or less as you wish as well then what you can do for coloring is you can use any shade of gel paste that you want to and you can also use food coloring in this recipe if you choose to use the liquid version and then you're going to need a small zipper bag that you can mix up the sugar in so what we have to do is take our sugar and pour it into our bag here and then I'm going to take a drop or two of whatever color I'm going with blue for this so you want to have like a drop or two in here and then what you want to do is seal up the bag so zip that together and then just using your hands you're just going to work that color in to the trigger until it is all combined once the sugar and the color are complete completely combined all we're going to do is dump the sugar out onto a parchment piece of paper which I've got sitting on top of a baking tray you want to make sure that you pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees and we're going to spread this out fairly thinly and then we're going to bake it in the oven for only about seven to nine minutes if you over bake it it will melt which is a lovely way to make hard candy but that's not what we're going for right now and then we're going to pull it out and I'll show you how to finish it off once the sugar has baked it's going to dry out a little bit and what you all you have to do is crumble it up is you can just like pinch it in between your fingers here and just crunch it up like that and then I found these little jars at the dollar store and as I'm putting them in I'm just kind of sprinkle and squeezing that in between my fingers just to make sure that it is all separated I've got this type of a jar so I can seal it up so it can be stored for pretty much for forever to make our second type of edible glitter we're going to be using a product called gum textile ohs powder if you are a cake decorator you may already be familiar with tylose powder we use it to strengthen our fondant and our gum paste here in my bowl I have one teaspoon of the gum Tex and I'm going to combine it with four tablespoons of boiling water and then I'm also going to use luster dust for the coloring for this version so what we're going to do first is take some of our luster dust and just tap it into the colored the gum paste there so we're going to color that now I'm going to take a just a spatula here mix that up together like that pretty simple so far now you're going to find that once you add this hot water we're going to get it's going to be really chunky so we're just going to pour that in a little bit at a time and it's going to get really chunky when it bakes though in the oven it does tend to lose most of its chunk which is a really good thing so it's going to keep adding here and what I'm going to do is just mix it as best as I can until we've got the like a nice almost like a paste that we've got going here so I'll just continue to work at this until I get that paste once you have the mixture all in here with as few clumps as you can get it is difficult though you're going to take it out and I've just got a silicone mat here on top of a baking tray and I'm preheating my oven to 275 degrees Fahrenheit I'm just going to spread it out as best as I can the thinner you get it the shorter time it will have to bake what we're trying to do is to dry it out and when it dries out it will peel away from the silicone mat if in my case it took about half an hour to dry out this type of one and because it does take a little bit of a while to do this I'm going to do a couple other colors and then I'm going to come back to show you the next step after its dried once your piece of the glitter has solidified and dried out you can either break it with your hands into smaller pieces or you can cut it with scissors so what I'm doing here is I'm putting it into my coffee grinder which I've actually swapped out the grinder for the coffee with a spice grinder attachment that comes with it you can use a regular coffee grinder I just find that the spice version gives it a bit of a finer like a finer flake we're going to be making so once you've got kind of a good chunk into your grinder here I'm going to put on the lid like that and then I'm going to put on the other lid and then I'm going to grind it up nice and fine once you have a ground up the Glitter what we're going to do is pour it into a bowl which I've just got my sieve here on top I'm just going to dump the whole thing in top that off and what I'm just going to give it a little shake and what this is going to do is going to separate the larger pieces from the smaller pieces now these larger pieces I can pop back into the grinder and regrind them and these little pieces that have gone through they are like that there and this what I love about this one is that it's super super shiny so I've got this little mixture here and I'm going to take these smaller ones and I'm going to dump them into my little pots that I have and you can get a bunch of different sizes of these kind of little pots they're super handy for this type of project and I found them in the craft area of the dollar store so I'm just going to finish this off regrind those larger chunks and then I'm going to show you the third way to make edible glitter our third kind of edible glitter is one using gelatin so here in my bowl I have unflavored gelatin powder and I have 10 grams of it we're going to mix with it three tablespoons of water and we've got luster dust that's we're going to coordinate with whatever color of gel paste we use so I've got my gel paste up here now what I also going to be using what we haven't used yet is the pearl sheen which is an airbrushing color the first thing I'm going to do is take my water and pour it into my gelatin and then just using a small spoon or a mini spatula just mix that around together we're just going to roll that in here moving that all around the gelatin will thick up will thicken up pardon me like this so we've got it nice and thiking thickening up now and so what we're going to do now is take some of our luster dust and we're going to tap it into here it's going to give it a nice little Sheen and then I'm going to take my airbrushing pearl Sheen and do a nice big squirt of that into there and then to give it some extra color I'm going to do at least one drop of purple and maybe two there we go like that and then taking your spatula again mix that up and you'll have a nice color here so what you need to do at this point is pop it into the microwave for 10 seconds you want it to be nice and liquefied before we go on to the next step once you've heated up the gelatin mixture you can put it on top of a piece of acetate really hard to see but it's here and I just got it sitting on top of a cooling rack so I can move it afterwards so what you're going to do is just take your gelatin mixture and just pour it onto the acetate here try to be in the middle because it is hard to see you don't want to have it go off the off your little piece of paper here so I'm just going to take an offset spatula up and spread it out as thinly as I can now this is going to take a fairly long time to solidify so it's best to leave it completely overnight and you've found that if you like put it in front of a dehumidifier or even in front of a fan it cool it solidifies a little bit faster than it does just out in the air once the gelatin has dried it's going to curl up and it's going to pull away from the acetate sheet so it's super easy to work with once it's completely dry you can either cut it or you can tear it just like that and I'm going to tear it up into small enough pieces to fit here in my coffee grinder again fitted with the spice grinder attachment and I'm just taking little pieces here putting them into there and then put on the lid and then put on the top here and then grind it up to be as fine as you would like it to be once you have ground up a decent portion of the gelatin sheet here you're going to take it and put it into the sieve above a bowl just like I did before with the gum text1 and then just give it a shake shake that through get all the little pieces of the glitter that come through at the bottom there and of course you can re grind up these larger flakes or you can use them as is if you prefer so just take a small spoon and take that out of your bowl here it's super shiny and we're going to put it into the little jar little craft pot here and seal that up so I'm going to give you kind of like my review of the three different ways and get them all out in comparison together coming up next so here you go everybody all three of the different edible glitters now the edible glitter where we use the sugar granules I'm not a huge fan of that one it looks a little bit more like just a sanding sugar like a colored sugar so I but I do like how it's kind of like a bigger granule and it can give like a different effect than teeny tiny glitter would now the gum paste one or the gum text1 what I found with that one is that was kind of frustrating and annoying too work with because it was so sticky but it does make a really really fine glitter so that's what you're going for the gum text is great for that one but my favorite of all three was working with the gelatin version now this one was the easiest to work with it made the most and I just think that it looks the best out of all three of the versions let me know in the comments which one you think you would prefer the best and I will see you guys all again next time bye", "PPJhjSITLnk": "[Music] this is an oscillating saw fitted with the correct blade and can cut through wood sheetrock concrete board plastic metal and more the key is to use the right blade or attachment for the job the oscillating saw was invented over 70 years ago originally as a device for safely removing plaster casts circular saws move in a rotary direction at high-speed reciprocating saws moved back and forth in the linear direction oscillating Saul's alternate direction up to 20,000 times per minute but moved through a very small arc about three degrees in the case of cast removal this is what keeps it from cutting skin the secret to getting the most from an oscillating tool is in using a high quality blade and matching the blade to the job these blades all from Zenith industries are manufactured from high-performance alloys and designed to cut specific materials each one goes through a micro phase hardening process that improves performance and keeps the tool sharper longer when it comes to cutting wood this chrome vanadium fast cut blade is top of the line it features a japanese-style toothed design with a double row of alternating bevel teeth it's the best choice for clean fast cuts in wood the spacing of the teeth allows for sawdust and small particles to be expelled greatly reducing any tendency to burn it's a good choice for plunge cuts and materials like laminate flooring and for cutting door jams and casings during tile wood or laminate flooring installations the blue oxide coating keeps this plate from leaving marks or stains on a material being cut and protects the blade itself from rusting this fine mm of the chrome vanadium blade also with the blue oxide coating is well suited for plunge cuts in drywall especially when doing cuttings for electrical boxes this extra-long blade has cobalt steel teeth and a titanium nitride coating that makes it suitable for cutting bolts trimming off bent nails that are in awkward difficult to reach places and cutting pipe when there's not enough space to use conventional plumbing tools it's long reach also makes it a good choice for cutting through framing nails during demolition by metal blades also have cobalt teeth and are a good choice for cutting through wood that has embedded nails this blade too can be used to separate nail together framing members semi circular blades made from high speed steel offer excellent straight-line cutting and can even be used with a straight edge since the teeth have zero offset and don't protrude from the sides of the blade this is also a good choice for terminating cuts without over cutting into adjacent surfaces for even more precise cutting the flat toothless portion of the blade can be used [Music] carbide grit blades have no teeth but instead have tough carbide grit vacuum braised - they're cutting edges these blades come in a variety of shapes and can be used for dressing cut ceramic tile chasing cracks when repairing concrete and shaping cut edges on wood this diamond grit version excels when it comes to removing tile grout or plunge cutting in concrete board these ways have no teeth or grit at all made of high-grade stainless steel they feature sharp knife like edges and are used for lifting cutting and scraping they're well-suited for removing caulks and sealants from around sinks back splashes and tubs lifting carpet and tile adhesive scraping loose peeling paint slicing through caulking for prying off wood trim removing old silicone sealants detaching non-slip stair treads and even cutting carpet this is often called a multifunction tool fitted with the right blade for the task at hand I think you can see why", "sCXbmNceIR0": "what's up guys on today's episode we're gonna be going over the step-by-step process to repairing stuff and scraps in other words curved rims which completely drives us car guys nuts of course I'm a proformance industries these are the best of the best I really wanted to see what are the steps what do they do to get these back into the proper condition so that they're safe now there's a million things that you can do to scuff them down and kind of DIY but this particular video is on a professional level so I want to give you the background view of when you bring something in to a pro what are they gonna do and maybe that helps you in your DIY situation I don't know but I think understanding the process is gonna help you out so that a lot more coming up on this episode of driving protect here [Music] for cars that see double duty I like to have one set of street wheels and one set of track wheels so I searched eBay and found a cheaper set of stock r8 wheels for eventual track day abuse but as you'd expect they're cheaper because there's curb rash on two of the four wheels so here are the steps and the behind-the-scenes look at what pros do to remove scuffs and scrapes and then in my case powder coat the wheels in a three layer process the main thing that we do first is we remove the wheel and tire off the off the vehicle what we like to do is we bring them here to our hunter DSP we put them on there we measure the run-out with the road for us just to check to see if the tire and the wheel are balanced out properly check to see if there's any bends on the wheels themselves it's not as scientific as putting it on our straightener but it gives you a roundabout idea as to what's going on this way we know where to put the wheel once is we take the tire off so once we remove the tire if the wheels bent it comes over to our straightening section we'll comes over here to our special Brazilian Marcos where he throws it on the wheel straightener and he measures the run-out with the dial indicator that gives him a more precise idea as to where exactly the wheels bent and we proceed to straight in the wheel we want to make sure that the wheel structure is repaired first before we even attempt to do any type of of cosmetic repairs so once that's done the next step is to dump the wheel and our stripping tank but it is a chemical based stripper it does a good job at removing the finish from the wheels without marring up the surface a lot of lot of people use sandblasters we do have a sandblaster but our sandblasters use very rarely only in the case where there's a little material buildup left that's a stripper didn't take off and we don't use sand we use plastic Corea well plastic urea does is it breaks on impact it takes to finish off without damaging the aluminum this way the aluminum is not overly porous it doesn't get too textured allows us a nice smooth surface once we're done prepping it to really you know get the particle to look nice and smooth on on a wheel like this that's a machine finish wheel what you see a lot of in the repair industry is a lot of guys will take damage like this and machine passed that lowest point of the damage and the reason that's a problem is two things number one this surface area right here you're making it thinner and sharper we see a lot of times these vehicles they hit a pothole the tire goes into the lip and gets cut because whoever machined at previous they just machine past the lowest point of the damage not only that you change the shape of the wheel you want to kiss the surface you want the wheel to maintain that same two tone CNC finish if you don't kiss the surface if you'll just lightly take off material and you cut past the lowest point you take this line here and you bring it down here now you changing the shape of the spoke and the style of the wheel but thankfully my wheels didn't need any straightening so we skipped Marcos's station altogether the stripping tank is manned by Raul and reminds me of the Temple of Doom four wheels before the wheels go into the tank they're quickly cleaned and scrubbed of any obvious dirt or rubber to keep the tank and liquid as clean as possible throughout the day then they're hung on the rack and lowered into the stripping liquid for roughly two to four hours to remove and/or loosen the clear coat or paint leaving a smoother more refined finish to better match the OEM design after the wheel crock-pot is complete the rack is removed from the tank and the wheels are power washed to remove the chewed up paint and clear notice how the paint or what looks like skin at this point slides off the metal with just the water pressure alone no sandblasting required what's left behind is the naked metal substrate ready to be machined sanded this process is ideal for older or rare wheels that have intricate wires and designs that are not easily sandblasted these are old Packard wire wheels as you can see they're caked on with layers and layers of paint these are gonna go in our stripping system they're probably gonna go in there for a good two to three dunks and as you can tell these are old wired wheels you're not really supposed to be sandblasting the heck out of these things so our stripping system works wonders for old-school wheels like this then the stripped wheels are washed put up on the wheel rack and tried before the repair process all right so we just pull these out of the stripper I'll be wash them there's no more clear coat on them but as you can see there's still a lot of damage and it touched some metal obviously we're going to start off with 180 to get most of these out and then 320 to finish it off and even with the they smooth finish so that the particle can grab on to something the trick here is to keep the tool and sandpaper as flat as possible in order to avoid changing the shape or design of the rim in the process of removing the scratch with the curb rash lightly sanded flat Raul switches to 320 grit and begins the refinement process keep in mind the cutting and refining process took about 20 minutes per wheel and probably longer if I wanted to keep my wheel stock or a polished look I know you're getting these powder-coated but if you wanted to bring these back to life and get the polished finish again all you would have to do is a sand this down with a as fine as you can get it as fine as you can get you start off flow depending on your damage 180 320 and you go all the way up to about 1,500 to 2,000 grit sandpaper and then you polish after that with some others or any kind of metal polisher and you should get something very close to this again or at least close enough to not be able to tell that I wasn't remanufactured by the company itself but because these are gonna be my track wheels powder coating is the way to go so no need to bring them back to the original shine with more refinement instead leaving the surface lightly sanded promotes adhesion for the next step of powder coating once satisfied with the curb rash removal and polish Raul sprays a degreaser on the wheels and washes and dries it thoroughly before bringing it back to Evan in the paint department first with the wheel hub masked off the wheel itself is placed into the oven for 25 minutes while the metal warms up Evan places the pickup tube in the powder coat and Prime's the gun once ready he removes the warm wheel and places an electrode on the metal frame to create a negative charge throughout the wheel while the powder coat is dispersed with a positive charge to immediately stick to its polar opposite once complete the wheel is put back into the oven for about 25 minutes at 400 degrees and the gun pickup tube and the work area is clean once again next evan prepares the mid coat paint which is basically the same thing as painting a car it's just liquid instead of powder that will create a dusting effect or metallic flakes on the finish proformance suggested doing this for my track wheels so that the brake dust would not look so obvious after each track session as they know it'll drive me completely insane so once the first powder coat in oven-baked is done the wheel is once again removed from the oven then evan lightly dust it with metallic paint so you have a finish that hides that extra brake dust once he was done with that he sent it back into the oven for another 25 minutes to bake then the wheel is removed a third time from the oven and sprayed this time with clear powder coat to protect the base powder and the dusting of the metallic paint underneath it but notice the orange pili look once he was done then immediately from there the wheel goes back in for its fourth and final time in the oven at 400 degrees or another 25 minutes once it comes out you'll notice the orange peel or the waviness has disappeared or flattened out perfectly for a flawless finish once Evans done he moves the wheel outside in front of a fan to cool before the next step once cooled Jonathan prepares the rim for mounting in balance so right now I'm thinking of the lug nuts that we put on the wheel to actually cover the area where they wear the lug nuts it so that it the lug nuts it's metal to metal contact now otherwise it may the particle will actually break off while the while you try to tighten it and you will can actually come loose eventually all right and then we also cover the back the mounting pad so there's no powder in there which also will cause the same the same problem and the end the hub so now we're ready to put the tire on all right so the machine we have here is the Corgi Master J so it's a touchless machine but it's also now fully automated which means that I control everything like all their arms manually it doesn't do it by lasers or no no no but we don't like to trust the Machine you know to do all this stuff we don't like to take the risk and even though its touchless we still put put tape around the whole wheel because the tire itself will actually make some markings on it because because of the paint's are being so fresh the lube will use is water-based so that means it's not going to stay on your wheel it's gonna dry out and it's just gonna it's just gonna disappear basically instead of leaving all that greasy stuff then the wheels finished where they started back on the road force balancing machine to make sure that they roll true especially with the fresh set of Toyo triple Eight's and now with the curb rash gone and the wheels looking amazing especially with two layers of powder coat in one layer of paint applied I'm now ready for the track on the next episode find out how the RH feels on the track and how to

"KGCcLGcyxFo": "this is what we're making two different recipes really really good beef jerky here i've got a lot of beef here more than i can make into jerky on the very first go around so i'm going to be making a lot of jerky this week i've got to get this video started today however it will not end today so you're going to see a multi-day process here making beef jerky and i'm doing it with a food dehydrator and so it's a machine designed for this this can be done in the oven and i'll show you a few tips that'll kind of guide you in that direction also the recipe for the marinade that's really what this is about there is a little bit of different choices in beef and that'll be up to you now i'm going to use a brisket for mine but you can use a round you can use chuck you can use sirloin whatever suits you pick a cut of beef that you like start with it and move on from there but there's some tricks about how you cut the beef that matters and also some tricks about how you marinate it that really matters so i'm going to give you a great recipe a few really cool tips this is fun it tastes really really good and it's going to make the best beef jerky you've ever had so we're going to slow dry the beef and do it the right way with a marinade that's really really good so i'll tell you what let me show you what i have here we'll get on with this come on so the ingredients i have for this today i'm going to use a brisket you use whatever cut you want this i'm going to be making a lot of beef jerky with and i'll probably be doing multiple recipes for myself this i'm going to be starting with my uh favorite recipe which is a real fruity complex that is really really nice in its flavors a lot of people before i start this a lot of people like to combine um dark sauces like soy sauce and worcestershire i don't like that combination flavor i think that it really is hard on the palate it's kind of confusing in the flavors so i separate the two if i'm doing a recipe that has worcestershire sauce then i will not use soy if i'm doing a recipe with soy sauce i won't use worcestershire and it's about limiting the number of ingredients for a more pleasing palette pleasing experience all right so for this one we have pineapple juice ginger black pepper soy sauce and lime juice and this is going to make a fantastic marinade does not take long to marinade especially if you cut the meat the right way we'll look at that before i get on with my meat mixing it up i want to talk about getting the marinade together it's as simple as get your juices and get your soy sauce and the ginger in a bowl you're going to need to whisk it together mostly to get the ginger worked into it all right and that's all there is to it as far as salt i would caution against using much if any salt on this because you've got a lot of salt in that soy sauce all right so it's already there to an extent uh and frankly beef jerky really doesn't thrive well on salt it doesn't need to be salty it needs just to be made right and dried right all right so the real trick here let's get this mixed into a bowl that's either plastic glass or ceramic it'll prevent any reaction of the acids with metals okay so this is a quick go through about the grain of meat and how to cut it when it comes to beef jerky a lot of people just go at it and go slicing it and they're done with it right so what i'm going to recommend that you do here is if you'll notice the grain on this meat runs right through here it runs this direction right here see these strands like this right like that okay that is the grain of the meat okay so the grain's running in this direction now if i cut this way then i'm going to have very stringy difficult to bite or chew through um beef jerky however if i cut from this corner this way making cross cuts directly across this grain it shortens the grain of the meat in my beef jerky to very very very short pieces only a quarter of an inch long if i'm cutting pieces a quarter of an inch thick that's the other thing cut your meat one quarter of an inch thick all right if you cut it really thin then you're going to end up with well your beef jerky will dry quickly but the quality and texture and desirability is not quite the same as what you find in the packages the packages that you know you're used to what we're going to make today will be very similar to that so cut your grain crosswise if you want to use a brisket remember there's two muscles there's one where the point is that runs underneath the flat which is this part here separate those two remove all of the fat that you can get off of there then cut your meat for your beef jerky just that's all there is to it once you get finished trimming out a brisket completely that's the flat right there completely trimmed off all right both sides so that is what a beef brisket flat looks like no fat on it and here's the point remember we took care of that this was the front of it that's our point so we have our meat all together right there and that's how much meat that your average brisket is going to yield a little bit we're going to weigh this out and we have exact amounts so i have a lot of meat already sliced i'm cutting simple quarter inch thick slices that's all there is and remember grain's running this way so i'm cutting across it just like this getting those easier to bite through pieces of jerky who wants to wrestle with jerky to eat it right now folks i'm ready to put my marinade and my meat together i can do this a couple of different ways i can put all the meat in the bowl and just marinate it that way i can put this meat into some plastic bag ziploc bags and pour the marinade into those and marinate it that way i think that's real practical and it seems to be a clean way of doing it but it's your choice okay just make sure you don't marinade in any metal bowls okay so i have it in these plastic bags they're in the bowl and we'll put them in the fridge give them a couple of hours we start dehydrating after that if you're going to dehydrate in an oven it's going to be 160 to 170 degrees if you're going to use a dehydrator it's going to be the same temperature if you have an oven that's convection then you're in luck because that's the best way to go and if you do that use pan racks on a baking sheet and it'll lift it up and it'll do a beautiful job here we are my meat has marinated for a couple of hours now that's more than enough all right and i have set up a little station here to line my drying trays now i'm using a food dehydrator and the trays on this of course are designed to allow air to move through them you want to put your meat on there so that the meat is not touching that way air gets around all the way all excuse me air gets all the way around each of the pieces uh when you're doing this you might want to put up some paper towels or something that can get wet with the marinade because it's going to be a little bit messy that's the reason i set it up and do it this way so go ahead line these out once you get them all lined then we're going to hit it with pepper before we start drying it i have lined out all of my trays here with my beef jerky and it pretty much filled the whole thing a little less on the top go ahead and hit it with your black pepper now if you want cracked black pepper use a mortar uh a mortar good grief having a hard time talking a mortar and pestle and uh you'll find that that works really well for breaking them down or if you have this type of a grinder that uses a crushing device rather than grinding it'll make a good large cracked grain also and just go ahead and hit all of your all of your jerky with a light coating of that black pepper this is the really the best way of doing it if you like pepper on there so as you've seen there's been a lot of beef used in this so i started actually with a brisket here that was 10 and a half pounds and of course it took out a lot of fat so it changed that a lot and to that for my marinade recipe i used two cups of pineapple that's just a simple pineapple juice nothing more one half of a cup of lime juice one half of a cup of soy sauce two teaspoons of ginger and enough black pepper to cover it evenly to your taste remember if you like a lot of black pepper and you get to put it on a lot and if you like it light you get to keep it light there it is that is your recipe let's take a look at this beef jerky i'm looking forward to tasting it well right there beef jerky that's the first batch however it needs to be said this is a two recipe deal okay so you've gotten one recipe i'm about to start the second one back here this one's gonna be a little more robust the first one gives a light flavor um gentle light fruity without being overwhelming and very beefy and that's one thing it really does is it really enhances the flavor of the beef itself lets it stand out now this lost about two-thirds of its total weight upon being dried so there's a lot of weight change that's going on here i started with almost four pounds and i've got one and a half pounds left so there's a big change but uh it's still it is a very good value when you figure the overall cost of beef jerky and also what you can get in the quality of your homemade beef jerky i've already tasted this it pulls apart wonderful it's very gentle and tender and we're going to take a look at that at the end of this video i wanted you to take a look at this and know what was going on though i'm in the background working on my math and getting all of this right about to start this next one so let's take a look at these ingredients come on the ingredients that we're going to be using for this is going to be again our beef and then the marinade i'm using white zinfandel some soy sauce sugar i've got some apple cider vinegar liquid smoke paprika and some garlic powder this is a really great recipe let's get right into it now i've sliced my meat mixed all of my ingredients two ways we can do this we can put this and this into plastic bags and let it marinate that way or i can put all of this right down into this and let it marinate in here either way it's going to get marinated okay but you want to turn it occasionally to get thorough marinating two to three hours in this okay the marinating is finished all i need to do is lay my meat flat on my dehydrating trays and then get it started up okay that's all there is to it i would remind you make sure that your meat is separated on the edges that it's not touching and get it spread out good and even lay all the pieces flat okay so no folded pieces or anything like that give it time once it's all together because remember it takes hours to make beef jerky i'm about ready to get my power head on this if you've never seen these things work before it's simple as this it pulls air up through the middle and blows it down through a groove right here on the edge of the tray and when it's doing that in fact you can see right here this right here these vents are what blow down this is what pulls in and then it also exchanges air through these vents here as well as through out blowing vents on the bottom where it blows out the moist air that it's created so it's constantly recycling fresh air into it and heating it and then circulating it and then blowing it back out and that's how this thing works uh and it works really well so keep your high temperature around 160 degrees and just let it run until it's good and firm and dry for this batch of beef jerky i used a little over three pounds of beef and i was using a beef brisket i'm using the point meat here and then to that for my marinade i used one and a half cups of white zinfandel wine one half of a cup of soy sauce one half of a cup of sugar one quarter of a cup of apple cider vinegar one quarter of a cup of liquid smoke for this one i used to mesquite one tablespoon of paprika and two teaspoons of garlic powder on the paprika if you want it to be a little more robust you can go to two tablespoons recipe i've just finished weighing all of the uh beef jerky that we've made it's 3.3 pounds and 0.2 ounces so barely over 3 pounds and the total amount that we paid per pound was nine dollars and 64 cents a pound uh when we started out with a uh 10 pounds for the beef had to trim it ended up with 6.922 pounds of beef that we then processed and ended up with just barely over three pounds total product when we started uh the process of drying with almost seven pounds so folks there's a lot of change that goes on there and of course with each change up goes that price and that price does not include the marinade time electricity or anything that is just the cost of the beef itself there's a breakdown on cost for beef jerky been sitting here comparing the two recipes the second one that's good that's really sweet very fruity reminds me of teriyaki a lot it wasn't a teriyaki sauce but many of the flavors were there for teriyaki okay and very similar and it comes out very good and sweet this is a very good one the smokiness is not overwhelming on it okay so it's it's more of a light and very pleasant enjoyable marinade and the first one is even lighter to the beef and it allows a stronger beefier flavor to come through very good not too much pepper on it it came out just right folks there you've seen it we've taken ten and a half pounds of beef trimmed it down to just a hair under seven pounds dehydrated it to three pounds and now we got three pounds of some really good beef jerky all right there you have it beef jerky thank you for watching this enjoy these recipes and please look in that description box that's where i'm going to have my links for my website essaytrotter.com as well as texas cooking today here on youtube thank you very much have a nice uh have a nice day and enjoy that beef jerky bye-bye i wanted to speak to you for just a moment about my recipes now i put out my recipes my recipes okay they're on my website now i don't put out your average everyday recipe you know you i had somebody comment to me recently he said why would i do that when they're available everywhere for free there's a little difference those that are for free and i've printed them out you have to a little tiny thing in the corner of the piece of paper that's covered with ads most of the time and then it's not very descript not mine mine are worth having okay so when you get one of mine it's designed to be printed in such a way that it can be put into like a three ring binder look at this look at the quality on it look at the how clear this is the imagery is beautiful so they can be printed this is the way i've designed mine so they can be printed back to back and then you end up with you know a complete recipe that works in a book and it comes out absolutely beautiful pictures that depict everything that you need to do in the recipe now not all of them are exactly that way but a lot of them are and i'm getting more and more done this way and putting a hard push towards good quality recipes that give better instructions than everybody else's and that's the reason i do them this way these are designed to have holes punched in them you pull this up and do this with it look three ring binder boom punch holes in it you have it right there everything's all available for you okay so pardon me i didn't mean to hit the mic anyway really cool idea great way to do your recipes instead of having to buy a book of 50 recipes to get 10 you just pay for the 10 recipes save a whole lot of money and you got a better idea for how to keep your recipes thanks for watching please enjoy what i provide check out texas cooking today

showing you how to clean up underbody rust on a budget this is a different method than what was shown previously out in a video for this i am using the toyota tacoma at the back axle as the worst of the rust on this truck but thankfully the frame is still solid this method can be used on frames as well the rear axles on these trucks are known for rotting out so i'm wanting to clean it up and provide a layer of protection so that doesn't get worse as some of you may have remembered I did some brake work on the rear replacing the back brakes wheel cylinders and rear brake line if required spray on a degreaser and then pressure washed into the side of the truck right now I just want to knock off a majority of the scale along with removing what looks to be left of the toda undercoating spray this can be done using a scraper or ball-peen hammer if you have access to eight air compressor and needler this is certainly a great way of removing the rust scale too I'm trying to keep this somewhat on the budget so anyone can do this at home in their own driveway to keep this mess someone contained I have laid down a tarp which makes for an easy cleanup after with the rear somewhat disassembled this is a great time to clean up that rust during the removal process on some components I didn't have the bolts break so they were drilled and touched up with the tap the parking brake assembly was also removed along with the lever for the low proportioning valve these trucks are also known for having the differential vents rust up not allowing the pressure to be released this will eventually cause the seals to seep as shown by the pinion area if caught in a right time he can replace the vent and then the seal will be fine using a degreaser I washed away the oil residue left from the seeping seal due to the tighter clearances around some of the components I used a die grinder this is a compact die grinder from Mobil distributor supply made by OEM tools model number two four four zero four coming in at around 4.7 inches in length 2.4 CFM consumption at 90 psi equipped with a wire wheel this is a great way of cleaning up the surface removing the scale and working around those uneven areas a link to this die grinder will be included in the video description as you can see the rear the truck is supported by jack stands now I have removed the wheels to prevent any chemicals or overspray getting on them the stands have been covered up with plastic bags as a form protection considering the wheels are off I have engaged the four-wheel drive so the front wheels are locked into park and block the front wheels so that truck doesn't roll now the rear of the truck gets to greased using a strong form of detergent which I purchased from my local detail supplier spray on the solution and allow it to soak in for a moment then rinse sufficiently using a hose next was using an air compressor to remove any standing water and help dry the surface to some extent make sure the air compressor does have a separator to reduce the chance of oil contaminating the newly cleaned surface with the surface somewhat damp this is fine as this is the requirement for the rust treatment I am using here I have a product from rust-oleum k'rud Kutter a must for rust I have been playing around this product on a few different projects and it seems to hold up great it does have a phosphoric acid base which is a known treatment for rust with the surface wet it does help break the surface tension along the chemical to react with the surface with this scale removed it's also easier for it to bite into the surface base so it's not having to work through all those layers dumping the concentrated chemical into a plastic container it can be mixed with water according to the instructions I'd recommend wearing gloves and respirator safety glasses and work in a well-ventilated area apply to the surface using a brush with the wet surface it can be a bit tough to determine where it has and hasn't been applied so take your time while cleaning up the rear axle I also did the shocks and leaf springs I will eventually replace the shocks and you rust on the frame will get addressed using the same method and I'll do section by section in my spare time it does take a bit of time to dry and dry times will vary depending on your climate I left it for about an hour and as you can see it has a white film leftover for extreme rust a second application is required which I did the second application I did dilute with water a 50-50 mixture I did notice on some of the surfaces with minor rust it did of a completely in the first application with a solution finally dried next is moving on to paint for paint I'm using a farm implement paint from a local farm equipment dealer this is the same paint which I used for cleaning up the rust on the Rangers frame along with the fuel tank for the BMW this paint can be applied using a brush roller or spray gun with a spray gun it's required to be thinned out using their products I did apply the paint using a cheap HVLP spray gun the overspray is fairly minimal and the application is much easier than using a brush or roller due to the tighter areas and irregular shapes any areas it didn't want covered in paint I had plastic wrap applied tape paper or even tin foil can also be used to contain some of that overspray I even dropped a tarp over the one side of the truck I'll let the paint setup for 15 to 20 minutes this will vary depending on the products and temperature then applied a second coat I would not recommend applying any type of rubberized coating as this can trap moisture eventually causing components to rot out and by the time it's found you're too late this paint does go on fairly thick and is extremely tough it can be applied to bare metal and does have some rust inhibiting qualities it has a low gloss finish so won't stick out but will help repel the dirt to some extent after a couple days of drying reassemble the components on the rear axle any fasteners in the axle replace with stainless steel hardware to prevent them from rusting there is where the jack stands were will be touched up after with a brush after a month of curing and when everything gets finished up the axle was treated with a rust inhibiting spray I used a mixture of linseed oil and wd-40 linseed oil has been used as a rust inhibitor on aircrafts this is a boiled version I'm using which is known to drive faster due to the cooler weather linseed oil by itself is quite thick and it doesn't spray very well so that wd-40 helps cut it down I wanted to avoid using a Sullivant as it can be harder than any rubber components the wd-40 also helps disperse any moisture which may be on the surface when applying an oil spray to a vehicle be careful around the brakes especially rotors as the oil can cause ich in the braking surface it's best to apply this in an area which you don't have to worry about staining the ground then allow the vehicle to sit in that area for about 24 hours as it will drip to some extent after a year now this is into the second winter it has held up extremely well this truck has been driven on many gravel roads is exposed to salt and all forms of weather the rest of the frame was also cleaned up using the same method unfortunately with cleaning up the frame if yours is boxed in such as this there really isn't any methods to properly clean the inside from rust the only real treatment is washing out the frame with a hose using compressed air to blow it any water

tile. Granite is actually one of the toughest natural stones that you can get. To do the drilling we're going to use this which is a JCB diamond tech hole saw. A few years ago I actually bought a cheap diamond coated hole saw from Ebay and that was just to drill through a ceramic tile and it wouldn't actually cut through ceramic. So you do have to be very careful where you buy these from. I would recommend getting a decent made like this. We are now just going to open the packet and on the inside is a set of instructions. It's not actually obvious that there are instructions printed on the inside. So that's the bit and that is an 8mm one. So I'm now going to pop on a pair of safety glasses I'm then going to insert this into the drill. If you've never used a drill bit like this before these are quite difficult to get started these are actually a diamond coated hole saw and you can actually buy a special jig for holding these if you are struggling getting the hole started.   To start these off you get the bit like so, and start it rotating, touch it down on the surface until it bites in and then stand it upright you can actually cut a hole. The actual instructions for this do state that you do need to dip it in water every five seconds that will give you the maximum amount of life from your bit. The makers of this bit also recommend oscillating the drill as you are cutting the hole. So that's the tile we're going to cut through that is at least 10mm thick and that is polished granite. I want to start off by dipping the drill bit in some cold water as you could see that cut through there very quickly indeed. So that's how to drill a hole in a tough granite tile. In the next video I'm going to do a test to see how many holes we can actually get from this one drill bit because that will be very interesting to see. These kinds of bits are normally classed as consumables. You would use these to cut a set amount of holes and then dispose of it.

", "YAgvqbJ3r1s": "if you've ever wanted to know how to make this you found the right video i've got some great looking ingredients here this is a beef jerky recipe folks beef jerky really really good tasting stuff i've eaten so much beef jerky in my life i can't see straight and there are many different flavors of beef jerky i love okay and you've seen them at the store you see all those different options on beef jerky so this is going to be one of those options it's going to be a marinade that i make that's just a really good beef jerky marinade it's sort of like a cross just between a basic soy sauce marinade and a teriyaki and the flavors of it lend that direction okay so it's going to make a really good tasting beef jerky here number one number two i like black pepper on mine and in this recipe we're gonna use it but you can leave it off because of the way i do it and the next thing we're gonna get into is the cut of meat you use but more important how you slice that cut of meat i went out and just got a brisket i got a brisket because when i went to the store to look for meat for this recipe my choice in in my mind my choice was going to be what they had on sale they had this on sale okay and the price was reasonable enough so i went ahead and purchased this and we're going to turn it into beef jerky now i recently watched a video that said beef jerky is a scam and i thought okay well let's listen to this and see what they say find out what's going on i listened to his presentation and you know at the end of it i'm thinking well it's possible maybe beef jerky is a scam well i'm not only making it i'm talking about when you go to the store the amount of money you spend for such as a small amount of beef jerky we're gonna find out how much it costs per pound to make beef jerky we're going to do a cost assessment i've got the scale here i've got my beef here i know how much it weighs beforehand we're going to trim it so i'm going to remove a lot of fat that's going to increase the cost of the beef right there at the end of that fat trimming we'll do a cost analysis of how much the beef costs before i start because like i said when i remove the fat raises the cost of the meat so we have to re-figure how much it cost per pound or ounce or gram or whatever at that point once we've figured that price we're also then going to take a look at how much weight there is afterwards and we're going to uh at that point know exactly how much we are paying per pound or per unit of weight let's just say that we'll know how much we're paying per unit of weight uh to make beef jerky and there's some other things you have to consider time electricity that kind of thing so there's there's cost involved here and uh there's going to be some displacement of moisture which really changes the weight let's take a look at the ingredients for this fantastic marinade you're gonna love this and let's get on with the right way to cut the meat so that your beef jerky will a take in marinade well and b be very tender come on over before i get into the meat that we're using today because that's a whole different analysis and a whole different kind of part of this video the marinade recipe itself let's look at those ingredients i'm using pineapple juice lime juice soy sauce ginger powder and we're going to be using some black pepper and i recommend like a fresh cracked black pepper if you don't have a grinder that actually crushes it this is a crushing grinder rather than a mill grinder works good for that this my brisket this is the cut we're going to be using today and i just chose this mostly because it was the the cut that was on sale at the market all right so this was on sale at a good price so i bought it and i thought this is great because i can get into all kinds of analysis on this like how much you have to remove from the the meat of fat in order to make for good jerky and then after that how much does that fat raise the cost of the meat and then how much does drying it raise the cost we're going to look at all that as far as cutting it this is also a great cut of meat because it shows you me or it excuse me it allows me the opportunity to show you how cutting meat makes a difference in chewing your beef jerky if you cut lengthwise with the grain or even at an angle to it then it's going to be a little more stringy and tough to chew but if you cut the right way you can make your beef jerky a little softer in the end i'm going to show you that trick so wonderful ingredients let's get on with making this let me precaution you when making a marinade or anything like this you're dealing with a lot of acidic liquids pineapple very acidic so is lime juice so is the soy sauce so we're dealing with some really acidy stuff here and that will react with metal so use glass plastic or ceramic bowls it'll save you any reactive problems even stainless can react with acidic liquids all right so bear that in mind let's get our ingredients in here lime juice soy sauce our ginger and whisk that in uh ginger powder a lot of times will want to just set up on the top and it can fight you a little bit so give it a moment and that's one of the reasons i like to just go ahead and mix this in advance it gets that taken care of all right so there we have this now if you notice i haven't put any black pepper in there the black pepper honestly it it works better it tastes better if you put it on the meat right before you dry it i have a very large cut of meat here and i chose this because i thought it would be a fun lesson in how to separate mussels how to trim meat how to get it prepared for a job like or an item like beef jerky now before we get into trimming it and separating the muscles i wanted to mention the grain of the meat and how we cut the meat to make it more tender after it has been dried if you'll notice the meat has lines running through it these lines right here they're running in this direction right here you see them very distinctly okay and that's one of the reasons i chose this cut was this is very obvious in this cut all right so we have the grain of the meat running this way so if i start on this corner and make cuts this way the grain of the meat being long running through my beef jerky is going to make the beef jerky very difficult to bite through very tough very hard to chew and it will be a much less pleasurable experience if i cut my meat this way directly across the grain then the grain pieces in my beef jerky will be very very short and they will pull apart the same way this stuff pulls apart see it's already starting to so it bites off easily when you bite it and that is the idea of cutting the meat the right way so that's first thing i wanted to talk about second thing was how much is this sucker going to cost okay now let me get the exact numbers on this i kept them i kept my original label for this for one reason so that i could tell you exactly what we're starting with 10.4 pounds of beef that is our starting number i'm going to trim off all of the fat and separate the mussels and we're going to re-weigh it after we find out how much of the meat we're actually using in the beef jerky okay so there's going to be a cost analysis to start with and then once we have a price per pound of the product we're actually using we will then move on to how much it's going to cost after it has been dried okay but let's start with 2.79 per pound this is a select cut okay and it's not the expensive stuff and it's good because you don't need too much fat and this cut is already fatty enough i have a total of 10.42 pounds here so this price is going to go up probably to about 3.79 easily we'll see we'll find out make sure you have a scale if you're going to do this comparison yourself or just trust in mine i have a scale rated to 11 pounds so it should easily handle what we're going to do here but i have to have some way of getting that much meat on it and what i'm going to do is i'll use a a simple stainless bowl like this to measure and weigh the meat in and then um and of course i'll zero the scale with the bowl after that we'll then find out exactly how much meat so let's start by trimming this thing get my scale out of my way now before i trim any meat i want to make sure that that meat or the knife is extremely sharp so now my knives are always kept very sharp but sometimes blades get out of alignment and that's the reason we do this it's just to pull the blade back into alignment and i have a video on sharpening knives and what this does to it and how and why so check that out all right now how you start is your business but i usually just go with the very first thing i see so i've got a big old chunk of fat that i'm going to have to remove from this now always be careful when you're cutting if you notice the direction of cut always do yourself the favor of cutting away from yourself try not to cut too deep but some of these portions of fat are going to be really thick on a brisket i don't want any thick cuts of fat like that anywhere on my beef jerky because it does not doesn't work well for beef jerky okay let's make that real simple right there so this is part of fat that runs in between this muscle and this muscle you have this muscle which it controls direction of the leg from side to side and this one controls direction of the leg from front to back and this is the pectoral muscle of the cow so when you look at the front of a cow in between his front legs you see two lobes hanging down that's that right there folks that's what you're looking at all right now right here remove some of this outside that's sticking out now you can cut inward because that runs right in between those two muscles so you see how i cut really deep on that and it didn't hurt a thing all right that's simple now if i lose a little bit of meat here and there like this trust me it's insignificant in this game all right so don't let that bother you don't lose any sleep on it okay and the thing of a brisket is just go at it don't be afraid of the thing all right just grab the knife and go straight at it so look at these huge clumps of fat that i've already removed very little meat on this piece here and none on the other so what i have this other muscle that converges right across here all right now and it comes down a little bit low it looks like right about there on this one all right but i need to get rid of all of this back fat so that i can see a what i'm doing and b have it out of my way for doing this now sometimes if you have a knife like mine that is wide and it might be hard to get through the meat like what i'm doing there then use a smaller knife a boning knife like this can make this kind of work really easy actually this is a utility knife not a boning knife but it works well much the same way okay a little bit of meat caught on that one okay i want to avoid doing that too much all right looky there okay it's very distinct you see this layer of fat that runs right in between the flat and the point muscle okay take that little knife just run it along that fat line and watch it separate those two okay and remember we're not butchers we're chefs so take your time at this don't get in a big rush about it don't get nervous or uneasy about it just go at it and remember sometimes you cut a little meat won't hurt it by the way if you've ever wanted to know how to separate your own muscles on a brisket guess what this video is teaching you how to do that all right in that neat the way that's coming apart okay now right here where these muscles join so i need to come across there right here there they are folks your flat and your point right there you have two separate cuts and both being very very viable very good for this so what i need to do is remove all this excess of fat from the point which by the way is the fattiest part of the whole thing the flat here once it's cleaned up on this side is usually very very lean running up through the inside of it so you have a good cut for that but as you've seen we're going to be removing a lot of fat here there's plenty of it to go through the first thing we'll do just push him to the side it doesn't matter which one of these you start with just go at it as i mentioned before don't be afraid to cut into it some okay and just follow the fat down the meat trying to run your knife high so that you don't remove too much at any point all right this other stuff can also be trimmed down cooked up for your dog all right if you have animals or you can save it as stew meat it'll work so as you see i'm not being any too careful with leaving any of the fat behind on this cost analysis all right that's not my goal the goal of the cost analysis is to be as realistic to what this stuff actually costs to make as absolutely possible all right and that's the whole idea here you see i'm i'm not sure how the numbers are going to come out i'm really not but what i do know i chose a very fatty cut of meat i did that quite on purpose all right that fatty cut of meat is going to indicate to us the worst circumstances the most expensive circumstances for this you'll notice some of the meat has really the grain is coming right apart on it not too much of a shock and i want to say this this is not my favorite cut to make this dish with all right beef jerky i've made with sirloin i think the sirloin is too lean i have made it with round which is a very good balance of fat to meet very good cut for that so whether you go with your upper or your your inner round that's both a good cut okay even an eye of the round will work for this it's a little on the lean side but it will work before i go to the fat on the other side and this is pretty well handled here i did want to mention notice the brown right here on this edge what this is the result of is wet aging okay this is when it's set up in the package for a while and it's aged and it's not a bad thing it gives it some enzyme buildup in the meat that helps to tenderize it not a bad thing you can remove that if you want you can just slice it off if you feel that it's like the appearance of it is ugly or whatever but honestly it's not going to affect your beef jerky in the least so you can leave that there and it's perfectly fine so if you'll notice the split side on this still has its fat alright and that is you know of course because we haven't had a chance to get to this side yet but on the flat you have only one side as a general rule to trim if you have to trim the top side of it that's kind of unusual it happens but it's rarely ever very much there to cut all right so keep that in mind now if you'll notice when i go at this that i always use a broad stroke okay and even if i cut into the meat just a little bit i still do that that long stroke really helps to give you a nice smooth look after it's said and done like we have here all right don't be afraid to go at it in just that way and by the way if you've ever been interested in how to clean your meat to prepare it for other dishes well this is it right here folks that's all there really is to it all right there we have it right there it is time for us to get on with measuring this out weighing it out so i have a bowl that i've already placed on my scale and i have zeroed this out so that our weight will be accurate here so we have zero pounds zero ounces and i want to keep this in pounds and ounces so that we can get a little more accurate look at this since it was originally weighed that way all right so we're going to start there we go that's our point and here's our flat and now that it's all said and done we have a total of six pounds 14.7 ounces all right write that down and we can do our math on this in a little bit to know exactly how much we're going to be paying per pound all right now for cutting our meat for making beef jerky something i want to mention here as i mentioned earlier that we're going to cut across the grain all right some of the pieces are going to be a little smaller because of that if you wish to give a little bit of an angle on it you can do that it angles the meat the grain of the meat slightly in your in your beef jerky but it also will make a little bit larger your pieces of beef meat for beef jerky what i'm going for here is pieces one quarter of an inch thick okay it's always smart when you're holding that knife just hold it the same way for every cut line it up and a good long stroke just like that it's going to give you a very even cut on your meat all right so go ahead just get yours cut the exact same way all the way through now some of these pieces are going to get really long and if you want to split this in half at that point it's not going to hurt a thing go ahead and do it and a lot of times i'll cut into it from both sides until i get down to what i want to use if you have any of your pieces that come out too thin in a spot or two don't worry about that that happens sometimes when you're cutting these there will be some pieces that we pull out of the dehydrator sooner than others so now that i get it so i'm making really long cuts on both sides that's when i just go ahead and reduce my meats but i still cut across the grain after that all right and be careful you don't want to get those pieces of meat too thick because they will be difficult to dry they still will they'll just take a lot longer so once you get to about 3 8 of an inch thick like that that's really very difficult to dry keep it down like this to your quarter inch size all right so there's a couple of different ways we can marinate this i can either just put the beef right down into the marinade in this bowl and marinate all of it and from the looks of it if i put all of this in there it's going to fill that thing to heaping full so the juice is going to be right at the top meaning it would be easy to spill i could also marinade this in some plastic bag ziploc bags that's what i'm going to do i'm going to put divide my meat in half put half of it in one half in the other and divide my marinade in half and go into those two bags the same way so i have here my two bags and i'm going to put both of these in this bowl but i wanted to show you just what that looks like go ahead and zip it up push out any excess air i need that in there and put these in a bowl like i said sometimes they leak you don't want that leaking all over your refrigerator okay and then you can kind of work this around to make sure that all the meat gets marinade thoroughly coating it okay okay needs to marinade give it a couple of hours to marinate and then we can start the dehydrating process in the event that you do not have a food dehydrator and i'm before i get into this i want to mention those things on the cheap side forty dollars all right you don't have to spend 250 to make beef jerky okay that's all there is to it on the other way of looking at this chefs have certain things in their kitchens for a reason and pan racks are infinitely useful you can use pan racks like this on top of a baking sheet and boom guess what if you're using your oven at 160 to 170 degrees you have a food dehydrator if you have a convection oven you have a really good food dehydrator right there so that is something to look at so simple baking sheet pan racks and you're making beef jerky okay the next thing is your dehydrators they're very simple machines so don't like i said don't put a lot into them when you're starting this i've been marinating now for a couple of hours the meat looks really good i'm getting ready to put it into my food dehydrator the way these things work very simple this one right here um they just heat air and blow it okay nothing more and they work at 160 degrees for making jerky this little unit simply pulls air straight into the center here it heats it and it blows it down through these vents around the rib around the rim here and then it blows it straight down through these trays which also have that same vent groove all the way around the edge it'll pull air up through the middle vent it down this way and it pushes it up through this grating to dry everything inside so it's a good even air circulation and it dries very well these don't cost very much you don't have to spend a lot of money to get a food dehydrator all right now let me set this aside we're going to get busy getting this thing lined out this is a little bit messy you do not have to dry your meat when you're doing this you can but you don't have to uh does it add a little time to it yep sure does probably adds maybe 30 or 40 minutes of drying time to it but that's insignificant on the whole when you consider the amount of time it takes to do the dehydrating so take your meat and simply line it out on your tray the whole idea here we want the meat to cover completely we don't want to have any of the meat overlapping or touching if possible this is the kind of job that gets a little bit messy so having some paper towels or something like that to catch any drips or spills is a very smart thing to do okay go ahead and do that i'm going to build this up one tray at a time so i'll completely fill one tray and then i'll move right into another one and then another and another and that that way we get them all done that way after that that's when i add the pepper okay you can do it one tray at a time but i think it's easier just to do all of them at once isn't that simple now do not overcrowd these trays what you see here you see how there's a little space around the outside edge of each of these that's what you're looking for right there do that on all of your trays once we're finished then we're going to hit it with pepper and we'll move on to drying it before i get into putting my pepper on this i'd like to mention your pepper grain size yeah it matters go for a large grain okay of course grind if you can produce it with your pepper mill now i'm not using a pepper grinder this one actually crushes the peppercorns so it breaks it the same way that you would have if you did cracked black pepper and does it very fast so i like this little machine otherwise you know grinding it up would be a better idea for you just to break it by hand now hit all of your jerky but only with as much as you really like and some folks won't say this is one of the things if you're doing fresh pepper like this you can be a little bit light on it and it'll be fine you're not going to you're not going to have too little because it takes very little to get a long ways on this beef jerky so do it that way so you'll know when it comes to doing these dried projects like this these things all take hours okay you just set the machine up get it running and after that it's just a matter of waiting it's going to fill your house with the aroma of everything that you have used for marinating and in this case it's going to be some beautiful fruit juice smells a little bit of soy sauce it's going to be a good smell the aroma can be quite acceptable and there it is the whole thing is now set up ready to put the top on this and get it dehydrated there's nothing more to it than that that's it folks it is now making beef jerky that will be finished when it's finished and you want to check it about every four or five hours until it starts getting firm then after that about every two hours eventually you're going to have the exact texture you're looking for and that's your beef jerky as far as the meat how much you use on this video what we've used is well i started with 10 and a half pounds of beef there as you've seen and so it's a big chunk that i had here after trimming it down a big change in the amount of overall poundage that i had uh as far as how much you can get away with marinating well that's going to be probably a couple of two or three pounds with this recipe or you can reuse the juices to do more beef and that you can get away with that all right so do that a couple of times if you'd like the recipe for the marinade simple enough two cups of pineapple juice one half cup of lime juice one half cup of soy sauce two teaspoons of ground ginger and as much black pepper as you like ground over the top of that meat some people like it light some like it heavy so you do it to your preference that's all there is to it simple enough but let's take a look at the finished product now i've been working on my math okay i promised on this that we were going to do a cost estimate we were going to find out exactly how much this weighs after being trimmed and then when we start the batches how much meat we have there when we finish the batches how much we have this uh the first batch i started with 3.86 pounds of the 6.922 pounds that we had so that right there is what is left and it came to a total of 1.579 pounds all right now in a little while i'm going to be figuring how much the cost per pound is and then we will get right down to how much people are paying in the store and how much it costs to make it home and that kind of thing that's it so that's where we are right now however it needs to be said right back here we've got some really good ingredients this is recipe number two that's right on this one you get two recipes another marinade tastes fantastic we're gonna do the point of the beef it's a little bit more grainy and usually has a little more fat running through the inside of it it should still make some very good jerky though the first batch of jerky came out fantastic it's very soft and tender and it's just what it should be easy to eat i have a friend of mine that bit into some of this ate some of it and it turned out that it was so soft that with dentures could be chewed without a problem so if you make it right even if you have any kind of uh oral problems in a lot of cases if you want to try it it might work out for you all right so let's get on to these ingredients let's take a look at the next recipe let's get busy making us some more beef jerky come on this marinade recipe again we're using that beef brisket and this time a little over three pounds this is the point meat to that we're going to be making a wonderful marinade with white zinfandel soy sauce some sugar liquid smoke got some apple cider vinegar and our spices we're going to be using some garlic powder and paprika making really really good marinades right here this is as simple let's get it all mixed together and we're going to give it a little time for the spices to kind of work into it and all that before we get to putting it on the meat so needs to be mentioned these flavors delicious when combined here we go get that sugar worked in here well i'll say this right now this is delicious smelling already i can't wait to get my meat soaking in this that's going to taste so good now set it aside let it do its thing while i cut the meat a couple of things i want to mention before i cut up the meat for this recipe this is the point meat for brisket in other words it's not the flat the part you normally see sold in stores this is the other part they normally grind into hamburger or other stuff it's a very good meat but it is also very stringy so we have to cut it the right way now if you'll notice this fat or meat is quite fatty so we have a lot of fat running on the inter muscular fat there it's not going to be that much of a problem it does make for a little bit oilier beef jerky in the end however it's not unmanageable or unusable so two ways that i will marinate meat for beef jerky one is i will simply take the meat and put it into some plastic bags pour the marinade right into that and there you have it you're marinating the other way is the bowl that you mix the marinade in you can marinade right in that i will caution you of one thing if your bowl is metal marinating for that long of a time can have an effect depending on the metal and how it's being used some metals will react with acidic liquids so you want to be careful okay there we have it remember to come in the kitchen occasionally stir your meat to get it thoroughly soaked all the way around and give this an easy two to three hours of marinating time before we turn it into a beef jerky and our beef jerky drying time is going to vary depending on your humidity i mean if you're if you have high humidity it could be as long as a couple of days and if it's a real low humidity you might get it done in a number of hours my last batch took me about depending on the pieces of jerky 8-10 hours of dry time there was of course the marinating time so it was about a half a day overall pretty quick now this i'm going to put a little plastic wrap over it it's ready for the fridge right there my meat has been marinating for a few hours and now so i'm going to pull it out of this and just get it lined out right on my trays the thing about doing these dehydrating trays the only thing i'll caution you about is making sure that your meat does not touch okay and sometimes you get little pieces like that and you know it just happens when you're cutting up the meat it just sometimes certain pieces aren't as big as others so if you notice i'm not too neat about this i'm not trying to be neat about it i'm just trying to get them organized in a way that i can get air circulating around all the pieces that they will dry evenly and then i'll end up with some beautiful beef jerky that's my goal there it is it makes a little bit of a noise not very loud definitely nothing detracting so that will sit and run for hours and i'll come back and it'll be this evening i will have beef jerky and it will look very much like what i have here my beef jerky that i made earlier the quantity of everything i used on this recipe starts with this beef i used the point meat off of a brisket and that was a little over three pounds on the marinade i used one and a half cups of white zinfandel wine one half of a cup of soy sauce one half of a cup of granulated sugar one quarter of a cup of liquid smoke for this one i used mesquite i have over here some apple cider vinegar that's a quarter of a cup one tablespoon of paprika two teaspoons of garlic and a little bit of time and patience folks very good let's take a look at all of this wonderful beef jerky i have just finished pulling out the last of the beef jerky and cooling it down this was the point meat okay so now that i have it out of the dehydrator we're going to weigh this out get some idea of just what we ended up with [Music] so i have a scale over here let me seal that i want to turn this on all right so the second part of this a total of uh one pound six 6.9 ounces i have everything that i have made in the way of jerky in these two bags this is the flat this is the point and we're about to weigh all of that up now i have a bowl here that i have already zeroed out on my uh scale right here and so let's put our meat down in here and get the other one right on top there three point okay three pounds zero point two ounces so two tenths of an ounce uh over three pounds okay very insignificant now when i crunch the numbers on this what it amounts to is we have 1.437 pounds on the second batch and the first batch was 1.579 pounds and when i added that together we got 3.016 3.016 pounds total of beef jerky folks so what we have here and what this is going to tell us i'm going to be able to take the total price that we had at 2907 and figure out how much it ended up costing per pound so we have 2907 2907 and we are going to divide that by three pounds three point zero one six equals nine dollars and 64 cents actually 63 8 so you can call it 64 cents 9.64 cents per pound now this is before spending electricity and labor and all of that and of course if you have a company that's making it you have the overhead of the building the people the the insurance all of that stuff so there's a lot involved in the cost of making beef jerky suddenly we're paying 9.64 cents a pound for beef jerky which frankly is a lot cheaper than you're going to get in the store but it's still a very high price if you figure that price there let's see divided by 16 which is how many ounces in a pound and we are paying uh 60 cents per ounce on that beef jerky all right that's it right there if you're making it at home now if you're buying it it's going to cost a whole lot more than that folks so there's your price comparison on beef jerky right there just finished bagging up that second bag as you've seen there is a lot of beef jerky here however relative to what we started with which is one big honking slab of beef that is a whole lot less right there although i want to say tender easy to bite first of all that's because of the way we cut it we're not fighting it mmm from the flavors and that one a lightly fruity flavor it pulls out the beefy side i really like that because the beef on this one stands out however over here on this recipe this one has a much more fruity flavor to it as sweet more like if you marinated with teriyaki it would be similar not just good but you know you have kind of a similar complex of flavors going on and that's because of the sugar the sock or the the soy sauce and um normally to make a teriyaki sauce you'd put sake in it but we put wine in it was just different kind and it added to more of a fruity flavor very very good stuff try these i'm going to be munching on this stuff for days i love beef jerky give this a try you're really going to enjoy it take a look in the description box that's where you're going to find links to my website where you find the recipes for this stuff also links for my site here on youtube which is texas cooking today if you would take a look at that there are a lot of recipes there and if you don't see what you want please in the comments box of one of my videos write in what you would like me to make i'll see what i can do for you thank you for watching please take a look at my website and my recipes you're gonna like those and folks have a good day bye bye i wanted to speak to you for just a moment about my recipes now i put out my recipes my recipes okay they're on my website now i don't put out your average everyday recipe you know you i had somebody comment to me recently he said why would i do that when they're available everywhere for free there's a little difference those that are for free and i've printed them out you have to a little tiny thing in the corner of the piece of paper that's covered with ads most of the time and then it's not very descript not mine mine are worth having okay so when you get one of mine it's designed to be printed in such a way that it can be put into like a three ring binder look at this look at the quality on it look at the how clear this is the imagery is beautiful so they can be printed and this is the way i've designed mine it's so they can be printed back to back and then you end up with you know a complete recipe that works in a book and it comes out absolutely beautiful pictures that depict everything that you need to do in the recipe now not all of them are exactly that way but a lot of them are and i'm getting more and more done this way and putting a hard push towards good quality recipes that give better instructions than everybody else's and that's the reason i do them this way these are designed to have holes punched in them let me pull this up and do this with it look three ring binder boom punch holes in it you have it right there everything's all available for you okay so pardon me i didn't mean to hit the mic anyway really cool idea great way to do your recipes instead of having to buy a book of 50 recipes to get 10 you just pay for the 10 recipes save a whole lot of money and you got a better idea for how to keep your recipes thanks for watching please enjoy what i provide check out texas cooking today there's a lot i mean a lot of recipes there and if you would take a look in the description box down underneath me here and you'll find the links to my website to texas cooking today to the stuff that i do and how to keep up with me and to find out a little bit more thank you very much you have a good day", "RyhU7DE2DsA": "[Music] so [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] now", "1e4OH5AiHfY": "hello everyone tango here and today I'd like to show you a brand new little concept for an extremely simple ultra low tech and very cheap with a skeleton farm now the goal of this farm is to be super super easy to build it is not going to get you hundreds of wither skulls but it is going to make hunting for wither skeletons a whole ton easier so this simple concept is going to take advantage of the fact that wither skeletons are taller than all other mobs spawning inside the nether fortresses all right but to use this ultra simple farm all you got to do is walk back and forth down this pathway here and just give a good look at any wither skeletons you see that have spawned on the side platform and they're going to aggro you and come running over to you but they can't reach you check both sides no mobs can Agoura you see the blaze won't there's blaze right there but they can't hit me no other Mazal hit me just keep on walking down here okay keep pulling the zombie or the skeletons as you go okay we're going to grab that guy down there he'll address and once you get down here just belly up to this iron bar here and we're going to take advantage of these skeletons ai here and they're going to walk straight up on top of those hoppers there I just wait for us to slice enough to bits with our looting smite sword whatever we got chop them all up as you kill them if they move even closer to the middle here it's just a great thing okay once you're done just go ahead and check in the chests and maybe you would get lucky so the trick here is that the wither skeletons can just barely see over those stairs causing them to aggregate as you go by they'll try to attack you even though they'll never be able to guess you where all the other mobs simply can't see over the stairs because they're just too short and they'll never even know you're there now there is one very important rule when using this farm and that is do not jump because as soon as you jump that's when the blades are going to a guru and the users is going to be very sad unfortunately now even if we put a slab above us here it will let me know make it so we can't jump as high but all it takes is just ever so slight increase in our height and the blades can see us so even that slab won't stop that unfortunately all right so by far your most important decision when building this farm is going to be deciding where to build it you're going to want to find a fairly large nether fortress and then try to find a section of it that is around as few spawnable blocks as possible now obviously there's always going to be a ton around but just do your best to definitely minimize that it's going to really improve the rates in the end typically fortresses that are over large oceans of lava are going to be your best bet so look for those so the thing to keep in mind with this farm is that it can be built anywhere inside the entire bounding box of the nether fortress if you don't know what a bounding box is imagine a box a rectangular box that contains every single piece of another fortress every tunnel a record or every room everything naturally this box is going to be big yeah something like that so what I've got here is a client mod that clearly shows the bounding box of all nether fortresses in the area it was made by a buddy mine named ear D and if you want to check it out I will leave a link in the description down below I highly encourage you to do so one of the cool things is it actually allows you to toggle the individual components of a nether fortress which is pretty cool stuff so you can kind of see how that was assembled piece by piece and obviously I've removed a lot of it for the sake of this tutorial which is something you might want to consider doing as well now you'll notice a lot of times the bounding box of another fortress will extend pretty much further than you would expect based on what the components are showing here like in this case right here you know the bounding box is sticking way out over here where you wouldn't expect it given that the components seem to end all over there and that's because the bounding box you keep keep in mind it is all of the components of the fortress and you can see there's another one here that stuck out a little bit so with a little bit of exploration even without this mod you can you can easily find the full extent in the full bounding box of your another fortress and it's totally worth it because you can definitely take advantage of it and figure out the optimal space to put your farm now once you've identified the section of the nether fortress bounding box that you want to build it in you're gonna have to figure out which direction you want to actually build the farm in and how long you want to make it now the longer the better in this case okay the longer it is the more likely you are to get automatic D spawns as you go from one end to the other and that is going to give you a constant fresh supply of new spawns as you keep going back and forth which is very much a good thing okay moving on to how to build this thing and if you haven't figured it out yet it is incredibly simple so here we are devoid world I'm gonna do it this way just so it's easy for you all to see so getting started here the base of your farm has to be nether brick block you got to use the full blocks here because wither skeletons will not spawn on slabs so just keep that in mind the block that you're going to be walking on down the full length here needs to be a daylight sensor and that's because it has a very unique height which is a little bit shorter than a half slab if you were to make that a half slab there you would be a little bit too tall and the blades on the outside spawn areas would shoot you and burn you and make you fried up and you'd be very sad and it would not be good other than that it's pretty much you get what you see here it's got a couple of stairs pointing inward and I will mention the slabs here are optional you technically don't need those I prefer them it seems to give a little bit more enclosed feeling but they are often what you want to cut those out okay so for these spawn platforms on either side this is going to be symmetrical here from the edge of your stairs there come out 15 blocks of nether brick all right and then up from there 14 of those blocks are going to be what you want to spawn table and the 15 one here just triggering closure I prefer glass panes it makes a nice look there but obviously if you want to save the glass you could use solid blocks or whatever you want there and then just give it a slab roof on the bottom slab there so I think and spawn on top of your farm and carry this all the way back down and that is it for about 99% of your farm so just take this and stretch it all the way down the full length of your farm leave a little bit of space on the ends and I'll show you how to build those end caps alright once you have the farm built to the length that you want you want to build the end caps over here so here we go on the end now you're going to put a chest on that one block past the last daylight sensor put a chest oh that's obviously we're going to pick up your nether skulls and all that stuff take an iron bar and place it right on top of the last daylight sensor just like that from there now you're going to take some hoppers put one into the top of the chest and two into either side like so so they're all facing obviously the way the skeletons are going back there and wherever they die the items will go into the chest down below okay now what you can do is wanna make some stairs for the withers to are the listicles to climb up so two stairs like that do it on either side like that and like that and then go ahead and fill this all in in between with solid blocks like so little more back there you get the idea now from up here you're going to break out these two slabs right there and put more iron bars there and there and then on the other side even with the end hoppers you're going to break out three more one two three one two three okay so that they it looks just like this one more block past the end of the stairs there that's just the right spacing and gaps in everything you need for the wither skeletons to climb up there but not ever be able to hit you now from there you can go ahead and take some slabs and just even this out right up here with the ceiling like so and then take this ceiling over here and just even it up with the edge of your fog so this is going to be outside as your farm right here you can even add a couple more spawn table areas right here and take this glass and ceiling and wrap it around so it all meets up nicely right here okay once you have everything enclosed all in there and tidied up you need to put like a little roof on top here and this is so that gas can't shoot in from this rare angle here because it'll happen and you'll be sad when it does so to do that there's a lot of ways to do this I like to put some another brick on these corners right there there and there the important thing here though is that the roof is three blocks there's a three block air gap in here for the widows girlfriends to get up inside here but here something to do like I said just put some slabs under all this here again a lot of this is just for looks you could do whatever you want here just as long as it's going to block gas from shooting you take some glass panes and put some line there again this is if you did glass on the outside of your farm this would match and make it look a little bit better and then from there just going to put some slabs and put a slab roof on this whole thing okay now for those of you paying attention you're probably asking yourself how do I get inside this thing right now and that's a very valid question so there's a couple of things I can recommend here okay one is if you want to come in from the side you could do something like this okay just obviously due to high wall here with some buttons all the way down to stop spawning that could be carpets or whatever pretty straightforward stuff here just don't use slabs here because even if you take this up three high don't use slabs because sometimes the mobs on this side will agar you as you're in the hallway so no slabs just buttons or carpet or whatever else you want to use to stop spawning in there that's kind of the quick and dirty method the other option is to do something of a better if you're going with the glass panes right do blast pains like this all along the side look somewhat better could even leave on the bottom open here I think that kind of looks nice and then some carpet here as your walkway entrance in kind of gives you a hint for how spawns are looking too as you're coming in now obviously both of these side entry options are going to have the downside of as you are pulling mobs you're going to run into that wall there so any mobs from here down you have to pull that way any mobs from the other side down you pull the other way so you might want to consider doing this down toward one of the end caps too to reduce that awkward crossover there that is an option there to consider the other thing the other way you could get in which I haven't done myself but theoretically if you want to come up from the floor it should work just fine you just have to have a few more slabs here so that blades don't agree to that gap there when you're coming up and then just poke a hole through put your ladder there and then generally for the most part you'll you'll run right across when you're sprinting but sometimes you might bump and it gets a little bit annoying and stuff you just got to be careful your when you come up the ladder you don't jump up too high the important thing is with all these designs is as you're coming in don't head row the mobs okay one last note here because I'm sure many of you will ask and that is can this be stacked the answer is definitely yes okay so from your main quarter line here what I would do is in your entry area here I would go to stay our ladder up like this it's probably what I would do I haven't done it as monkey other options obviously again the end the entire point is just don't aggro mobs as you're going up and down between the floors something like this would work I would end cap off this like this against you know as you're up here you know if you didn't end cap that you don't want to be able to see the mobs over there so solid blocks all the way up there and then once you're up here you're good to go at this point you know your ceiling isn't a ceiling anymore it's the floor for your next level pretty easy stuff most other fortresses are tall enough where you can actually fit nine levels of spawn platforms if you really want to go nuts the other thing to consider if you're really going crazy on this thing is maybe put a run speed beacon in here so you can run up and down these quarters a little bit faster might help to something else to consider all right guys that is going to do it for today if you thought this design was pretty clever you liked it then we favor and hit that like button I would really appreciate it and if you are new to the channel they becomes different subscribing if you want to see or tutorials just lack of this one and as I say guys thanks for watching hope soon next time and building hi [Music]", "zsBtJlQjovw": "what's up everybody welcome to another episode of The Daily sesh I'm Rick James and we're here standing in phoenicians manufacturing facility they're a grinder company located in the States of course right here in Mesa Arizona we've got drew he's the manufacturing manager and he's going to give us a walk-through and show us what it's like to make a phoenician grinder let's check it out hey guys it all starts right here this is all of our raw aluminum it's all 6061 so we process into our grinders from here we move it on to our tables for staging we got these three machines making all three different sized grinders right now from large small to medium each piece of aluminum is cut in a different size for the part that it's going to be completing we have test gauges here to make sure that we don't have any discrepant pieces and the best quality is going to be a pain so from here we load it into these machines and then that part becomes this which then later becomes that which is the finish grinder as far as the machining goes so it starts off as this piece or but starts as this then it gets transformed into this from there this would be the finished raw part so this this surface is underneath so this is the lid here which is part of the cutting mechanism which stacks on top of that and this is the bottom part or if this is the fall through so this is the top side of this say the flip them over to yeah like like those it's two operations okay so this part is half done this part is completed so once it's finished with this then you flip it over and you grind out some anymore yes and there's a called grinding or cutting or this is heading yeah grinding tends to be like on steel this is all aluminum so you run 20 to 26 different tools per grinder on these for the finish 26 different tools what's that mean yeah we can look up at the Carousel here I can show you a couple of different ones what each of those tools is necessary to complete the product that we create here Wow so the machine and this is a CNC machine it starts with one like drill bit and then just kind of rotates to whatever it needs for the next set yeah correct yeah so it's all automatic tool changing all numerically controlled so depending on what needs to be cut this specific part right here will be changed out automatically yes so that tool has a specific tool path in a specific order to create the finish and that this one being a tiny chamfer mill you can see at the end it's got a nice little point on it that's a ninety degree chamfer melt and that finishes out in some of the tighter areas of the grinder so it's pretty straightforward these machines do all of the work when you're making grinders how many grinders can you make in a day in a day it really just depends on the size because they all run different times so this one here runs for 20 minutes so you can do the math there on a eight-hour work shift because the large runs for more 40 minutes and with loading times it's close to 50 so a little bit less on the large a little bit more on the small but we do keep this thing running all day and we make plenty once it's out of that stage then what happens next once we unload that we'll have a finished product and then it comes over here to deburr and everything's hand inspected and handy bird which essentially means that there's not going to be any sharp edges or any the scrapping parts coming through later on in the assembly and processing so this is a part that's fresh out of the machine it's a complete grinder obviously less the screen that goes in there no magnets yet there's no anodization on there so this one hasn't been deep bird yet I can walk you through that real quick you have to do it it starts out on these buffers and then everything gets checked from there [Music] so basically just kind of cleaning them up and polishing them or yeah so you can see the difference here so this edge tends to be really sharp coming out of the machines so running over it with this disk eliminates some of that sharpness so no one's get in their hands cut up and you guys have to do this with every single grinder every single grinder we make goes through this process from there we bring it all up here get staged in these trays and this is their last step before they get anodized and so anodizing is something that you guys do out of house or out of shop yeah yeah we outsource that just due to a couple different reasons cost and the chemicals in the whole process of it it's a pretty big process to deal with but you're still outsourcing to phoenix um yeah it's a local company everything we do is gonna be locally sourced here so keeping the money within all US made all and on all quality controlled by us here out of this facility so why Phoenician grinders and how did they come about so Phoenicians started with the two founders here Colton and Dane and they just wanted a quality product and they had a background in manufacturing so they weren't finding a quality product that was up to their standards you could say and they decided to manufacture it on their own and then it evolved into what you see here today how long has Phoenicians been around Phoenicians been around for six years now how many grinders has Phoenician made now we can go over and look at some of the serial numbers yes you brat yeah so we saw the deeper process and once things come back from anodized they actually shoot over into this room here and this is our laser room so we do all the engraving in house here and we have this setup here this does the tops and bottoms for both the large the medium and the small and from there we kick it over to assembly this is where we'll press in all the magnets and we'll press on all the screens we do a quick cleanup once over of them here and each grinder also includes this Keith pick that we manufacture here in house from the machines yeah this is made on that laser that we just saw so we do the engraving and the outline of it guys cut it from the machines as well yeah it's all cut on that laser oh the laser cuts that yeah the laser cuts everything on here but once it comes back from the anodizing then it comes over to this table and yet and everything gets assembled yeah everything gets assembled into this complete grinder so this one here we're at thirty seven thousand two hundred and ninety and this is a medium four-piece grinder and that's actually only for the medium sizes each size has their own serial number correct yeah all the grinders are gonna have serial numbers on them how big is the staff here at the nation on a daily basis it's usually three or four of us so it's myself Dane Colton and the sales representatives that we have working outside the office so internally it's three of us so we have a large grinder medium grinder small grinder we also manufacture a few different things this is our aura this is a pipe with our X bowl incorporated in it the front carb manufactures all out of aluminum this is this smaller version for your last piece this is an 18 mill X bowl piece also offer that in 14 we have our ash tray deee bowler with removable nail that nail is coated in nickel just to ensure quality and longevity this is our concentrate tray we also have a flower option which will show you up in the office and there's all coating later so this is the gold stuff yeah and this stuff actually belongs to a colleague of ours and it does get used pretty heavy you can see here just how well this finish holds up so this is the same process that a lot of satellite parts go through they get launched up into space so it is designed what do you mean it's the same process so a lot of those satellite parts require a gold or silver coating on them okay just to keep from deterioration so we use that same process here for the gold coating and I know for a fact this grinder has been used heavily and you can see here just how well it maintains its super clean how much does this grinder eco-floor so this is the large four piece paper slot and usually retail on that for a standard and a diced one is 125 and for the gold one the gold one is 1,500 Wow alright guys that's gonna wrap it up today we did a cool walkthrough with drew the manufacturing manager up finishing grinders he's able to show us everything that it's all about and of course if you want one of their grinders you just got to go to Phoenician engineering comm or hit up one of your local smoke shop and if they don't have it you got to tell the owners to get those Phoenician grinders until next time guys give us a thumbs up and smash that like button see you guys later [Music]", "vHQ_ViMNxfs": "What\u2019s up guys Anders here with the much\nawaited 2020 updated class guide for Black Desert. It's been a while since I've made one of these,\nbut it's about time I get to it and with it we have to go over a couple of things since\nthis is a guide geared towards newer players, though I know some of you veteran players\nlike to watch as well. Black Desert has 19 classes to choose from\nas of the date of this video, with more to come in the future, this means it's\ngoing to be hard for me to give you the in depth analysis compared to someone who has\nbeen playing a single class since the start of the game can give you. I am one of those players that likes to play\neverything, so after 4 years I think I can give you some insights into each class and\nhelp you find the one that is right for you. So with that said all of these statements\nare of course from my perspective and are my opinion and I urge to seek out your class\ndiscords and veteran players who have been playing your class of choice for years. They have infinite more insight into their\nrespective classes. The pitfall many newer players fall in is\ntrying to play every class from the beginning and then being led by what is the strongest\nin the meta. The meta will not matter to you because by\nthe time you as a new player reach the gear level required to competitively PVP the meta\nwill have shifted and you may be stuck with a class that wasn't as strong as you wanted\nit to be. That is why I say try the classes out for\na while before fully investing into one class as your main moving forward. For newer players I need to explain two things. Awakening. and Succession. These are the names of the class archetypes\nthat you will have available to you. Almost every class has these. Awakening is unlocked at level 56 and allows\nyou to use a second weapon. Awakening uses both your starting weapon skills\nas well as the Awakening weapon and skills. For some classes it becomes a dance of chaining\nAwakening and non-Awakening skills together. After you unlock Awakening, you are given\nthe option to unlock Succession. Succession basically disregards your Awakening\nweapon and focuses on improving your starting weapon and skills. So if you enjoyed the style of a class before\nit achieves Awakening, you can stick with that style through Succession. Shai and Archer are the only classes to forego\nAwakening and Succession, but I'll go into that when we talk about those two. All classes in the game are gender locked\nso keep that in mind when making your decisions. I am including some brief skill demonstrations\nin this video to give you a flavor of what each class can do, but they are basic, so\nkeep that in mind. With that long intro let's get into the rating\nsystem I will be using. I decided to give each class two seperate\nratings. Awakening rating. and Succession rating since\nthey sometimes differ greatly. Now for PVE this encompasses how good the\nclass is at killing monsters at low level and high end areas. This is an average rating since no one class\nexcels at every single spot in the game. DUEL has to do with how good the class is\nat 1v1 PVP. THis is important if you consider yourself\na duelist or need to defend yourself in PVE from another player wanting to challenge you\nfor the grind spot. WAR shows you how good the class is in large\ngroup PVP and siege battles. Finally, SKILL will let you know how difficult\nthe class is to master or pick up. Low ratings mean the class is fairly easy\nto effectively play. High rating will mean the class requires a\nlot of hours and dedication to get good at. Okay so those are the ratings and explanations\nout of the way. If you disagree with my ratings let me know\nin the comments. Now first up. Warrior. Classic class. Male. Uses a Longsword and a Shield and has a Greatsword\nas it's Awakening weapon. Warrior has recently received some love in\nterms of balance changes. It is much better than it used to be in the\npast when it comes to PVE and is strong when it comes to dueling. It's group pvp utility is okay, but outshined\nby other classes. In terms of skill, Awakening Warrior requires\na lot more dedication to do well in all aspects of the game. When Warrior achieves Succession, it becomes\neasier to play and achieves one of the highest PVE clear speeds in the game. In Succession, his potential is lower in PVP,\nbut not awful. Warrior has been a stable and dependable class\nthat is currently experiencing a good phase in the meta. He isn't the strongest class, but definitely\none of the better ones available right now. Though he may look slow at first glance, his\nmobility, especially in Succession, is lightning fast and can more often than not close the\ngap almost instantly in 1v1 fights. Next up we have Valkyrie, Female. A Paladin-esque class that uses a Longsword\nand Shield and has a Lancia as it's Awakening weapon. Valkyrie can be seen as the female Warrior,\nbut is very different in style and utility. Her Awakening PVE clear is average, only really\nexcelling at high end areas with high end gear. In duels she can be deadly if played correctly,\nbut suffers more than other classes. In group fights she is a great asset with\nher Awakening ultimate ability being incredibly deadly, heals, buffs, and negate damage skills\nthat help the group push on the offensive more easily. She may seem clunky once you first Awaken,\nher Lancia has a weight to it and her role requires a lot of positional awareness in\ngroup fights. She's not easy to master, but good Valkyries,\nthough few, are very deadly. In Succession she becomes faster in PVE, slightly\nbetter in duels depending on whether or not you take to the Lancia weighty style or the\nmore mobile Succession style. Her Succession skills hit hard and though\nSuccession Valkyries are less sought for in group fights she still maintains some utility\nin the form of healing, buffs, and negate damage skills. Succession is easier to learn and master than\nAwakening though Valkyries in general are less popular than other classes. Next up we have Berserker. Male. Giant race class that uses Axes and an Ornamental\nKnot and an Iron Buster for it's Awakening. Berserker's Awakening PVE clear is very good\nin most areas of the game. Not the best, but not slow despite his large\nstature. He has the most grapples in the game, but\nwhile the multiple grabs are nice they are more of a relic of the old times where you\ncould consistently keep a target grabbed for a comically lon8g time. With the new PVP CC limits, you don't see\nthat anymore. Awakened Berserkers do have what many like\nto call the Q window or refer to them as Q Zerkers. Their Q skill is their enhanced skill that\nyou can use every few minutes. This makes them a deadly cannoneer able to\nobliterate anything in its range for a short duration. You\u2019ll sometimes hear players call Berserker\nuseful only every 3 minutes when it comes to Node Wars. An exaggeration with a shred of truth. In terms of dueling, Berserker in general\nis difficult to master and requires hours of movement practice to be able to win duels\nconsistently. Succession Berserker gains a slight PVE edge,\nbut suffers in every other category. He is still being worked on so it could get\nbetter in the future, but Succession Berserker is one of the least effective Successions\navailable right now. Next up we have Wizard and Witch. The two caster type classes in Black Desert. They both use a Staff and Dagger and then\nGodr and Aadr Sphera for their Awakening. Wizards and Witches play identically before\ngetting their awakening weapons. You can cast fire, ice, lightning. earth, heals, resurrection skills, but most\nimportantly they can cast a skill called Protected Area which makes them the most sought after\nguild wars class in the game. This skill amplifies your allies defenses\nby an obscene amount for a short amount of time which allows for offensive pushes into\nenemy bases. If you have enough Witches and Wizards you\ncan chain these effects so that you can push longer without taking heavy damage from the\nenemy. Protected Area is the most powerful skill\nin the game, no contest. In it's Awakening the Wizard uses Fire and\nWater skills and has increased AOE. He gains a grab and two elemental pets, a\nwater elemental that can damage from range and a fire elemental that can damage in melee\nrange. Witch is similar but gains a block instead\nof a grab and a lightning pet for range and a earth pet for melee range. Witch uses Earth and Lightning elemental skills\nand has increased AOE and range in her Awakening. In succession, the Wizard gains the advantage\nof instacast chaining of his skills raising his difficulty but increasing his damage potential\nin PVE. Witch doesn\u2019t benefit as much from going\nsuccession. When it comes to duels Witch and Wizard are\nnot the best and will get countered by anything with a grab, though with practice you can\ntry and play around that. Their main issue in duels are the long animation\ntimes that keep these classes in place for just the amount of time needed for a grab\nclass to close in and get the grab. When versing classes that don\u2019t have a grab\nthe matchup gets a lot better for Witch and Wizard. When it comes to group fights, like I said\nWizard and Witches are dominant. No combat guild will ever turn away a Witch\nor Wizard even if they have lower gearscore than what they require to join. Next up we have the Dark Knight. Female elven class. She uses a Kriegmesser and an Ornamental Knot\nwith a Vediant for her Awakening. Dark Knights deal high damage and have decent\nmobility. Their PVE is okay in Awakening and exceptional\nin Succession. Duel wise she is average. Her damage potential is very high, but she\nis very weak. Glass cannon to a point. Her main issue comes from unreliable dodges\nand her damage being magic causes her to have trouble with Strikers and Mystics in particular\nsince those two classes have passive Magic Defenses. Dark Knight is flashy and has gone through\na lot of nerfs in the past probably as an over correction by the developers for releasing\nher in such an oppressive state. Nowadays, she is a couple of tweaks from being\na fairly balanced class, but those tweaks don\u2019t seem to be coming. Her Awakening offers some range abilities,\nwhile her Succession offers more assassin esque skills being able to charge certain\nskills and appear behind enemies to unleash them. She is not very difficult to learn and is\na decent class to start out with, but she offers no utility in group fights and remains\nstrictly a bomber style class. She can get a lot of kills if you play for\nkills, but won\u2019t make a dent in a meaningful fight. Next up we have Sorceress, Female uses an\namulet and talisman with a Scythe for her Awakening. Potentially the strongest class in the game\nat high gear scores. She is a mobile dark magic user with decent\nDuels and Group fights potential thanks to her almost unlimited iframes, or invincibility\nframes. Her potential power may be high but Awakening\nsorc in particular is not easy to play if you are starting out. Succession is a little easier to get into\nand has a bit better PVE potential than Awakening at high end areas. In group fights sorc is able to outright kill\na group by herself or at high gear levels she\u2019s able to be annoying and disrupt enemies\nlong enough for your allies to come and help. In duels she does well though she may struggle\nwith large AOE classes like Witch, Wizard, and Guardian but usually if a sorc dies it\u2019s\ndue to player error or gear disparity. While Sorc may be the strongest in the game,\nshe isn\u2019t the easiest so you don\u2019t see a lot of newer players pick her up as a starting\nclass. Next up we have Tamer, Female. Younger looking class with a pet, Heilang. She uses a Shortsword and a Trinket for her\nWeapons And the Celestial Bo Staff for her Awakening. Heilang does a random Crowd Control when you\norder it to attack. That plus Tamer having one of the quickest\ngrabs in the game and incredible burst make her very deadly in 1v1 situations. She is still very weak defensively and difficult\nto master so it takes some dedication to play her well. Her Awakening kit is very good and her damage\noutput is high, but unlike Sorc does not have enough i-frames to help her stay alive in\nlarger engages. Her succession is on the weaker side, probably\non par with Berserker Succession in being some of the worst successions out there right\nnow, but her agility and decent mobility still make her deadly if played well. Her PVE in succession is quite strong compared\nto Awakening, but you lose iframes and q block for it so PVP suffers. She\u2019s a good class overall with obvious\nshortcomings, but with some tweaks she should be getting better moving forward. Tamer makes it the last of the Magic Damage\ndealers. Tamer, Dark Knight, Sorceress, Witch, and\nWizard all deal Magic damage. This means the next two classes will have\na passive resistance against them. Striker and Mystic being those classes. Let\u2019s start with Striker. Uses a Gauntlet and a Vambrace as his weapons. A Gardbrace as his Awakening Weapon. He is very tanky thanks to his magical defenses\nand has deceptively high damage that scales poorly at high end. Despite this he is very good in PVP as he\nhas a lot of protection. His Awakening damage is static meaning as\nyou gear up early on he will feel very powerful, but as you near high levels of gear he will\nfeel lacking compared to other classes. In PVE it\u2019s pretty much the same story. He does okay early on, but will feel very\nslow compared to other classes at high end areas. In war he is a brawler style class that will\nmost likely get deleted if he jumps into the fray. His Succession is more combo oriented than\nhis Awakening, but the style remains the same by his signature leg drop skill that deals\nheavy damage. In Awakening he summons multiple clones through\ncertain attacks, basically think of stands in Jojo. Overall his relative lower difficulty and\ngood damage early on makes him a decent pick for newer players. Now as for Mystic, the female counterpart. She uses the same weapons, Gauntlet, Vambrace\nand a Caestus for her Awakening. She is more defensive in her Awakening than\nStriker and has a lot of utility and CC abilities. In terms of raw damage she is lacking, but\nlike Striker has a lot of protection. Instead of clones you get a water dragon that\nappears when you use certain abilities. Her PVE clear is better than Striker at all\nstages of the game. Her dueling potential is good, not great but\nnot bad either. Her succession lends itself to be a better\nduelist but it is a lot more difficult to play since you lose a lot of useful Awakening\nskills. In group fights the only really viable route\nwould be to go Awakening for the toolkit. Succession won\u2019t really add anything to\nhelp your allies in war. Mystic is fairly simple to pick up if you\nplan to play Awakening, but Succession will require a lot more hours of dedication. Overall she is a solid class, but middle of\nthe road in the overall roster of Black Desert. Moving on we have Archer. The male elf class. He uses a Crossbow and Ra\u2019aGhon as well\nas a Greatbow for his secondary weapon. He is a pure ranged DPS that unlike other\nclasses does not have the traditional Awakening or Succession. He starts out with his secondary weapon already\navailable to him and you go through Ascension at level 56 which is basically like Awakening\nfor the rest of the classes. His strength is his ranged dps and protection. He can be very mobile and deals heavy damage\nfrom range. His hardest hitting skills do leave him fairly\nstationary and vulnerable, though at high gear he can mostly kill his target before\nit reaches him. He is very good in all stages of PVE thanks\nto his fairly decent AOE and range abilities. In duels he will be favored when facing less\nmobile classes. And in group fights he excels at picking off\nlow HP enemies which oftentimes sees him doing very well stats wise. He is fairly easy to pick up and play, but\nwill take some time to master. A novice Archer can be annoying to fight because\nof the range, but a good Archer will be deadly. Now onto Ranger, the female elf class. She is the counterpart to Archer but in role\nonly. She uses a Longbow and Dagger for weapons\nand a Kamasylvian Sword as her Awakening weapon. Ranger has been a class that has been average\nfor a long time. Succession came and made her one of the best\nPVE grinders in the game, but was quickly nerfed to the ground. She is still an above average PVE grinder\nin both Succession and Awakening, but is outshined by other classes. In terms of Duels her Awakened kit is good,\nbut not easy to pick up and play. You can do well if you dedicate your time\nto it and learn to play Awakened properly. Her awakening has a grab that is very useful\nin certain matchups. When it comes to Succession, she may be one\nof the worst duelists in the game. You can still win duels against people who\ndon't know what they are doing, have less gear than you or are afk. In war Awakened ranger is fine in smaller\ngroup fights, but in larger wars Succession is a little bit better. In terms of difficulty Awakening Ranger is\nmore difficult to learn and master, but Succession isn\u2019t so easy to play either. Unlike Archer, Ranger lacks the range and\ndamage potential as well as protection of the Archer. At closer ranges though she can still deal\na hefty amount of damage. Overall Ranger has had her moments to shine\nin the past, however brief, but nowadays she is average and outclassed by newer classes. Next up we have Ninja, the male assassin class. He uses a Shortsword and Shuriken and Sura\nKatanas as his Awakening weapon. Ninja in Awakening is one of the slowest grinders\nin the game, but his Succession allows for more AOE and mobility helping him in that\nregard. His dueling potential is high meaning he is\none of, if not the best duelist in the game. Recent nerfs to his Succession have made Ninja\nSuccession worse off in PVP, but his PVE damage remains the same. In war Ninjas in either Awakening or Succession\nwill have a similar role of disruptors or assassins. Ninja is fairly difficult to pick up and play,\nbut his Succession lends itself to being easier to learn. If you are interested in dueling Awakening\nnow has an advantage over Succession. If you are more PVE focused, Succession is\nwhat you want. The counterpart to Ninja, Kunoichi is similar\nin some respects. Kuno uses a Shortsword and Kunai as her weapons\nand a Sah Chakram as her Awakening Weapon. Kunoichi in Awakening is a decent grinder\nwith good sustain and fairly protected kit. She still plays the assassin role in group\nfights and is excellent in duels. Succession has better burst mobility compared\nto Awakening, but is less protected so harder to play. Recent nerfs have made her survivability less\nthan in the past, but she is still fairly difficult to catch when played well. Succession has an ultimate ability that deals\nheavy damage even after nerfs, but for the most part you will see Awakened Kunos in wars. In terms of PVE, succession is about on par\nwith Awakened grind depending on the spot. Overall Kunos are less popular than Ninjas,\nbut offer some alternative playstyles compared to Ninja. Next up we have Shai. A female elven like class. Named after a race in the game of the same\nname. Shai is the most unique class in Black Desert. They don\u2019t Awaken, rather they gain a Talent. Shai was made to be a support class so their\nkit is filled with heals and party buffs. They are essential in group fights and surprisingly\ndo very well in high end PVE grind spots. Unfortunately their mobility is terrible making\nthem slower to grind with in lower end areas. In Duels, she stands no chance with anyone\nwith any semblance of gear. She has heavy PVP damage reductions on all\nher skills making them hit like wet noodles. In terms of difficulty she is fairly easy\nto pick up, but in group fights you will have to adapt tactics and have some positional\nawareness to do well. Most Shai players that aim to do war will\ngravitate towards a defensive build making them more difficult to kill. This is expensive if you also choose to grind\nfor money. Shai starts out with Alchemy and Gathering\nalready leveled to Professional which is decent and has some passives that lend it to be a\nvery good Lifeskiller/Profession class if you wish to follow that route. Her passive leveling gives her added Weight\ncapacity which is great if you are a Free to Play player looking to save some money\non weight. Lastly, Shai is able to compose music through\nan ingame composition engine. You can upload and share your music to other\nplayers in the game and will get ratings depending on community likes and dislikes. Overall, Shai is a good support class, a good\nLifeskilling class, and a good unique class for those wanting to play something different\nin Black Desert. Next up we have Musa and Maehwa. Musa is male class that uses a Blade and Horn\nBow with a Crescent Blade as his Awakening. Musa Awakening has very strong clear in PVE\nin all grind spots. Succession is not as good but close. He has excellent mobility allowing him to\nmove from pack to pack with ease. In duels Musa Awakening requires some skill\nto do well in, but is fairly protected allowing him to sometimes dictate the flow of the battle\nthanks to his mobility. Succession isn\u2019t as good and requires higher\nmastery to do well in. For the most part Musa rewards dedication\nand time commitment to the class. You can easily spot a good Musa from a bad\none. In wars Musa is a great flanking class able\nto get around with ease. His ability to disengage with his speed is\nespecially useful when scouting and flanking in node wars. Overall he is a great class for beginners\nwho want mobility and decent PVP and PVE damage. Maehwa is the female counterpart. She uses a Blade and Horn Bow with a Kerispear\nas her Awakening weapon. She is similar to Musa in that she has great\nmobility. However, Maehwa lacks protection when compared\nto Musa so it becomes difficult to trade damage since you really can\u2019t do so effectively\non Maehwa. Awakening has decent PVE clear. Succession is a little bit better depending\non the grind spots. In Duels they are fairly even in both Awakening\nand Succession. Average at best. In war they serve the same role as Musa as\nscouts or flankers. Good Maehwas are still scary in these situations\nand can easily rip apart less experienced players. It will require a lot of time commitment to\nsee results on Maehwa. Because of this you don\u2019t see that many\naround these days as many veteran Maehwa players are waiting for the eventual buffs to their\nforgotten class. Next up we have Lahn, a female dancer style\nclass that uses Crescent Pendulum and a Noble Sword as her weapons as well as a Kratos like\nGlaives as her Awakening weapon. Lahn is unique in the fact that she can glide\nthrough the air making her more vertical than other classes in the game. She has a lot of protection in both Awakening\nand Succession, with Awakening giving her a mid-ranged grab and a lot of HP regeneration\non her skills. This allows Lahn to effectively grind in PVE\nwithout using as many potions unlike other classes. Her succession loses the grab and HP regeneration\nbut gains a lot of AOE damage and defensive traits. In duels Lahn Awakening has the edge thanks\nto the grab, but Succession has incredible damage that makes up for it. Both are very good duelists. In war Lahn serves as a bomber style class. You fly in ult or deal heavy damage and fly\nout before you die. She is very squishy in general so you can\u2019t\nlive for too long in group fights. She can be made more evasive to allow her\nto survive more and acts as a disruptor in node wars pretty well. In terms of skill she is easy to pick up,\nbut hard to master. Overall she is one of the least popular classes\nin the game, but also one of the strongest in terms of potential. Finally we have Black Desert\u2019s latest class,\nthe Guardian. A female Giant demihuman. She uses a Battle Axe and Shield and a Halberd\nas her Awakening Weapon. She is without question the strongest PVE\ngrinder in the game with her Awakening. Her AOE is large and damage output is absurd. She can out grind classes much higher in gear\nthan her and she can one shot players with one skill. She has protection in almost all her skills. She has iframes. She has a protected grab and her skills have\na deceptively long range. Her succession is more utility focused giving\nallies defensive buffs, so she trades damage in favor of those utility options. Most players play Awakening for the sheer\ndamage potential. She is easy to learn and very easy to play\nthough in duels she suffers against grab classes as her animations are very slow and predictable. With that said even classes with grab have\nto be careful since Guardian will take a chunk of health if they approach without care. In war she currently top frags, meaning she\nis consistently at the top of the leaderboards when it comes to kills. You could give a new player a geared Guardian,\nput them in a war situation and they will still do well despite knowing very little\nabout the class. She is currently the dev\u2019s favored child,\nso we will not be seeing nerfs anytime soon. Overall, she is the answer to the question\nmany of you will be asking. Which class is the strongest in the game? Guardian. And that's it from me for this 2020 Black\nDesert Class guide. Went through the basics and the flavor of\neach class. Hopefully it gave you an idea what classes\nyou may want to check out. If you want to have fun and enjoy the game\nyou choose a class you like and master the class regardless of future changes or the\nclass ranking in the ever changing meta leaderboards.

toolbox but diamond plate doesn't have to look bad it can always shine so today I'm going to show you how to polish diamond plate using our brand new Chemical Guys vintage heavy metal polish now the heavy metal polish is designed to remove heavy oxidation stains and all that nasty stuff that brings down the shine of your metal it restores all type of metal work stainless steel chrome polished aluminum even precious metals like gold and silver it's a unique formula it can be used by hand or machine to break down all the nasty debris that's stuck on your metal we sell in a 16 ounce size now we also offer it in a smaller 4 ounce size so you can keep it on your motorcycle in your toolbox or to polish your special jewelry that you might have in your house and keep it right in your jewelry box today I'm not just gonna be showing you how to polish diamond plate I'm going to show you how to polish diamond plate using the porter-cable 74 24 XP so I wouldn't grab this from our training facility in the back and what brought it out here to polish up this use trailer and show you how to make that diamond plate shine we're also going to be using one of our black optics orange microfiber cutting pads is a five and a half inch version and the microfiber is going to really polish out these heavy stains on this diamond plate with the porter-cable 74 24 XP so we're going to first go ahead and tape up a section on this diamond plate to show you how good the before and after is of this polisher so I got some blue painters tape here from the hardware store I'm gonna go ahead and make a square right on here okay now this material right here is called diamond plate okay now diamond plate is found on a lot of trailers like this one right here that's been sitting outside for a really long time and a customer brought it to us to see how well we can polish up the diamond plate now diamond plate has these cool diamonds in it that's why it's called diamond plate and that gives a good surface to grip to walk on or to place pools on it's a very good industrial surface now diamond plate is cool because it could always be polished up because it's either made out of stainless steel or aluminum so this one has a lot of stains on it and oxidation but we're going to make our Chemical Guys magic happen right on this diamond plate so I'm gonna throw in my porter-cable 74 24 X P it'll grab power and then we'll see you in a moment so I got my Porter Cable 74 24 X P plugged in and I threw on one of our Chemical Guys five and a half inch backing plates this will allow me to use a five and a half inch pad and that's perfect for this area that we're going to be polishing so I want to take my five and a half inch micro cutting pad and place it right on the backing plate I want to make sure it's centered so if it's not centered always go back and recenter it there we go we're ready to go and I want to grab some heavy metal polish okay now heavy metal polish works by first shaking it up a real good shape make sure it's all ready to use okay now once a heavy metal polish is shaken up we're going to go ahead and place a nice X right on the top of our pad and to use it with a microfiber pad I saw I like to take my finger and like to work it into the microfiber pad because this allows the microfiber to cut into the oxidation a little bit more I'm going to add a little bit more polish here a little bit more heavy metal polish because we want to take off this heavy oxidation this is really oxidized and stained diamond plate so it might take two polishes we'll see what we can do okay now you can polish by hand if you're looking to do this with a microfiber applicator pad a foam pad or with a microfiber towel but save time I'm gonna use a porter-cable because it's a big piece right here so first I'm gonna take my Porter cable and I'm going to spread it out on the diamond plate there we go now what about my sheet up speed setting 6 and that'll give me enough power to polish out the diner okay so after a few passes I already know I'm gonna have to polish just a couple times because this diamond plate is real bad but we're getting the shine back you guys can't already see and we took off a lot of oxidation now I want to get the true luster out of this diamond plate you can see it's a little bit difficult to see because we're using a black pad but on the black pad we have all of this oxidation and the pad is looking much more black and the oxidation is actually making the microfiber pad fluff down and you can see it on my hands look at there we go I touch the microfiber pad now my hands are all black I'm gonna have to wash them later but that's oxidation coming off of our metal okay I want to keep polishing it because it's going to take me probably two or maybe even three times to polish it but I want to get the brightest luster that I can out of this metal work so once again I'm going to add some polish polishing metal sometimes can be a little bit messy as you can see my hands are getting black but that's oxidation that's coming off from years of being left in the California Sun Sun is what causes oxidation also oxygen in the air so make sure you always keep your metal protected let's turn down the speed setting one we're the oxidation really black nope let's start walking okay there we go do the second pass let me go ahead and grab my microfiber towel and let's buff off any excess there we go this this is really old diamond plate but we're gonna pull this tape off and see the difference that we got on there here we go so I've restored a lot of shine back to this diamond plate I'm gonna go ahead and pull the tape off so we can see the difference there boom look at that that is just simply awesome that is just fantastic you actually see the depth in the diamond plate it's smooth and you can see the layer of oxidation that is on the diamond plate okay and the tape really shows a nice clean difference it almost looks like this spot is just brand new it made the diamond plate shine and it brought back that luster now you can see that mirror shine over here there is no mirror shine okay but over here we move over and there's that bright mirror shine just like chrome now your diamond plate can easily be polished like this very very easily a diamond plate toolbox or your trailer your truck and metal our heavy metal polish doesn't just work on diamond plate it works on steam less steel it works on chrome works on aluminum billet anodized and even works on gold and silver platinum as well so now we polish the diamond plate I still got a whole huge trailer to do it's going to take me a long time but once I'm done with this if I want to ensure that my metal stays looking good I can always follow up with our new Chemical Guys vintage metal wax to make sure that this is protected so if you guys have any more questions about our new vintage heavy metal polish the perfect polish for all your

"in keeping with the fabrication this little lathe this is giving me an opportunity to try or not try but actually practice a different approach for cutting a specific feature now if you watch the production of this little crank right here you saw me do the inside with a square file held in a drill chuck and activate it up and down like a die filer it worked out very well putting the dial on this is going to be a whole different animal this square has to be very concentric very true position to the outside or when you turn the crank it's going to look like you know it's going to run out period it's not going to look like anything it's going to run out the dial on the tail stock has the exact same square drive feature the hand wheel on the carriage has the exact same square drive feature and so does the lead screw for the cross slide i'm going to make a brooch this morning really quick for this particular feature right here and for the other hand wheel naturally and for the little brass style that i'm going to put on that guy right there quarter inch diameter high speed steel drill blank i'm going to hand grind it real quick and then i'm going to put it in a spin indexer in the mill and i've already done a video on this called can you grind on a mill and yes you can so i'm going to do it again real quick before i broach out those components let's take a look my grinder is set up with a coarse wheel on the left and a finer wheel on the right i will take the majority of the material off of this high speed drill blank on the left hand side dunking it in between because that is getting quite warm trying to keep it concentric get it over on the fine side and get it down to a manageable diameter that i don't have to grind too much off of on the mill i'm gonna load it up in my spin indexer the other side of that is a much larger square this is going to be about an eighty thousand maybe about a two millimeter across the flat square using a norton cup wheel and a homemade arbor i'll hold this entire assembly in a three quarter collet in my mill that's all it takes quarter 20 screw recorded collet here we come i'm going to spin this at about 1800 rpm which is a little slow this wheel can go to 5800 rpm spin indexer in the vise raise the heel of the spin indexer just a little bit to put a mild draft angle on the brooch that way it doesn't drag all the way down it cuts on the front just a little tiny bit going to reposition the camera here we're going to look at it from underneath and it's okay if it's running out like that you see the eccentricity on the outside of that wheel it's not a problem the face is true and that's all that we're cutting with these are about 10 000 of an inch deep passes here and i'm just going to run it down till i know it will enter the pilot hole that i'm going to put in the material comfortably and yes the machine is thoroughly draped at this point every conceivable surface is covered up you don't want this grinding dust flying around your machine once you know you have all corners nice and sharp i'll lock it off in a specific position and i will use the edge of the wheel to make a small hollow grind on the nose of the tool right there done looking for an 0.96 final square this is a setup piece of brass so i know that when i get to my real dial i know what my readings will be on my digital readout and the easiest way is to just poke into one corner and walk it to the next corner to the next corner to the next corner and i have a lifelong habit of always turning my dials clockwise so if you see me back out that's what i'm doing there's a little look for you with a dental mirror makes a nice feature but it's got to fit the mating part right so make sure you double check everything and it doesn't take a whole lot for it not to go the adjustments here are about one thousandth of an inch per surface until it just sneaks in make sure whatever you make your brooch from that it's large enough in diameter that it doesn't flex under the load of the cut i'm going to prepare the stationary and movable dials on the same or actually on different ends of the same piece of material using a common piece of material like this or an extended piece of material like this makes it a lot easier to handle the final product when the final piece is small stationary dial is a simple turn to od with a reamed hole through the center and the movable dial will be basically the same as this but we're going to back turn a small diameter on it so that it looks like the lock nut that you would find like on a mill table the bearing make sure the gauge pins fit always break the od where the cut terminates right there if there's any flare it could affect the concentricity of the opposite side of the plank i'll do the exact same thing turn it to the same diameter so the diameters match that assembly drill and ream the inside and plunge cut the back with the parting tool make sure your parting tool is rigid enough so that it doesn't flex under the cut and that it's ground correctly to give you a nice square corner this little counter bore right here is the controlling feature that will terminate the lead screw and square drive features this is critical this depth right here it goes one way or the other it is very possible that the assembly will pinch and not turn and once you're happy with the diameter and the depth deburr everything move on to the back turn and take it over to the mill give you a quick look at the setup here if i were doing multiples of this piece i would have a stop on the stationary vice jaw to hold the v block in place as well when you put the parts in the middle make sure that you indicate everything for a concentric relationship in the features this is the broaching operation for the movable dial and there is no rotational relationship required here this dial will spin so this square can be in any position but for sizing purposes it's always good to have your broach in line with the table so your x and y moves will give you nice straight edges now this face is so small that a visual alignment here is fine i lay a scale across it and i look at the scale in relationship to one of the jaws and when i'm content that it's true we go for it always make sure there's sufficient room underneath your tool that you can put your mating piece or a gauge in that's really you know quite a shock when you're working on a critical feature and you need to move the table because you can't get the gauge pin in we've all been there i know i have and this is a through broach operation that is the critical counter bore that you saw me bore in the previous operation in the lathe all goes well the lead screw goes in and the round diameter engages the bottom of the counter bore same time the square goes through that is a control surface extremely important oh moving on to the stationary dial make sure that the concentricity is there since there's no stop on the v block these are the two anti-rotation dowel pin holes that will make sure that this dial does not spin as the lead screw spins through the smaller center bore and i place these by i think next time i'd place them i place them a little bit closer to the center because they are just about tickling the od of this part this part was any smaller this would be a scalloped hole and that's not a good thing i'm doing it much deeper than it needs to be so the reamer doesn't pack up and this will be parted off in the lathe after the fact so this is going to be a very small washer but this is just a much easier way to handle it o63 reamer finish off both the holes and the secondary work on this part is basically complete this is the stationary index dial and it does require a single index mark positioned 180 degrees of post from those two dowel pins that i just drilled now that surface right there is facing the camera and not facing me so this is going to be something i have to fiddle with with the mirror so it's easier to film than it is to do this is a 90 degree high speed steel brooch i'm coming down in the quill with it and it's not going down past the shoulder on that part although it looks like it is it's not it's staying well shy of it i'll creep up on it visually from the side i only want to go about five to seven deep make sure that if you're going to do this that you do this at the same time you drill those two holes because that marks got to be got to be opposite those two holes for correct positioning at assembly this brooch is so rigid and this material is so soft that i literally can't even feel whether or not it's cutting i have to see if it's cutting and when i get the depth i'll put my finger on the back side of it just to see if there's any deflection or movement or contact interference at all and i can tell you that i didn't feel a thing i didn't feel a thing this groove will be filled with a black lacquer right assembly so you can see it as long as it's steep enough to accept the lacquer the feature is good enough try to make it the same width as the lines on the dial just for visual cosmetics no interference back in the lathe for the parting operation i'm setting my tool by dragging my razor blade across the face of the tool and waiting for it to stop clicking against the outside of the parting tool zero out the digital move in your required amount i'm going to make a very superficial plunge cut here come back with a 45 degree tool and chamfer both of those exposed corners and finish the parting operation this is the stationary dial and i'm using a catch tool that a viewer sent in i'll see if i can put a link to that particular tool in the video description handy little thing to have only because this is a scale model and for no other reason i'm sure there are 10 different ways to do what i'm about to do but i'm going to knock this out in the most backwards fashion i can possibly think of because time is of the essence here and i want to get through this i have taken the diameter of this particular part multiplied it times pi coincidentally to come up with the circumference that particular length divided by 25 is what i need to do on the od of this particular wheel right here you cannot get what you need with the graduations that they give you that being said white packing paper from the very beginning to the very end is one complete revolution of the face of that spin indexer i'm going to cut a piece of this off strip it all the way back to about a quarter of an inch and tape it on and then i'm going to visually use a pointer and stop on each one of these lines to give me 25 even graduations about the diameter of that small brass dial and if you don't think i'm serious there you go excel spreadsheet gives me all the numbers i need and i laid it out with the 24 inch burner so a little bit of overkill but i can probably assure you that these lines are going to be very close to accurate well as accurate as my eyes are so let's shave a piece of this off tape it to the dial put some graduations on that little brass thing there you go these cuts are going to be incredibly superficial and the rotation will be locked right there let's put in a count set the machine up put some graduations on that little guy this is the final setup i will be using this is my pointer mechanism here on the side i'm just going to rotate this by eye until the bottom of that tool lines up with the line on the paper and i'll bet you that it comes out pretty close you think about a projected error when you get down to the little diameter that we actually cut down here versus the space between these lines those lines are going to be pretty fine so if i can get these lines pretty much spot on that pointer we should be in good shape i'll take a few test cuts at one location because there's no guarantee it will repeat no i mean it's going to repeat as good as my eye i am using a snap tap internal threading bar to do this so these are 60 degree v-grooves that is a very fine insert let me spin that around show you that that's the insert that i will be using it is visually lined up on center with the blank and all the cutting will be done i guess maybe i could do it around the front let your watch progress as it happens right about this angle here okay let's get on the tripod finish this spindle speed is about 1900 rpm for this operation i'm going about five to seven deep all the burrs and everything will be shaved off on the lathe after the fact and these groups will be filled with a black lacquer to match the stationary dial this is accelerated footage foreign that is incredibly hard to film as you can see depth of field is really narrow all right let's pop it out clean it up take a better look at it let's see if i can do this with the camera right in my face these are o62 long dial pins excuse me 062 diameter about 1.2 millimeters excuse me 1.5 millimeters you can see the index marking the top now this is the dial that does not move the lead screw through from the back put the new one on okay get back here here we go let's try that again now this guy has to be driven by this screw itself so that's got the square brooks in it from before you can see the lines as the screw turns that knob turns and forgive me for not putting numbers on there i just barely see those lines i will ultimately fill them up with a black lacquer and wipe it off so any any cutter marks or chatter or whatever will go away but you can see how nice and uniform that that turns out doing it that way that is only about a 5 000 steep scratch right there that is very superficial there is a rather critical stack dimension that needs to be hit or when you tighten the crank down everything will pinch and nothing will move so that dimension has not been established yet and that is brought in not only by the depth of the square cut in the graduated dial but the thickness of the stationary dial that is all adjustable let's put this on my goodness that is small the tolerances that i used on my dials are a little tighter than the tolerances they give you for these knobs there we go that's squeaking and howling here in the back it is an incredibly windy day here in texas and that is the big garage doors jumping around and the roof vents and they are even cinched down as tight as they can get those roof vents they're still jumping there you go that took an awful lot of time it took a full day to do that in case you're wondering what the real time was here that's a full day worth of messing around generated a couple of drawings and yes the handle is still loose i'm not going to cinch it down because i don't want to gall anything i generated a few drawings made all the parts made the brooch and those lines should give you an advancement of the carriage excuse me of the cross slide one thou two thousands coming off the diameter for each one of those lines 25 graduations 40 threads per inch on the screw and that's about as good as it gets right there that's as good as i'm gonna get it that's all we got guys thank you very much for hanging in this is a fun project and i appreciate all the comments and feedback i hope you're well wherever you are in the world let's hope 2021 is going to be a great year so

started out working in our test center moved on into our global biomass group working on uh wood and other grinding and has now spent uh many years since uh six to seven years uh working um across many applications but early on in particular indiana specialized in in roller mill grinding of um agricultural products corn etc but also works through all of our applications gained a lot of expertise his official title assistant applications manager overseeing all markets for us uh doug is a very experienced presenter uh doug has presented numerous times with texas a m at various short courses aquaculture pet food animal aquaculture things like that he is a multiple time presenter at the u.s poultry feed mill manager seminar also the auburn university feed milling workshop has been a instructor there several times recently completed excuse me north dakota state university's northern crops institute course as a presenter there so without uh further ado i turn this over to doug thanks ryan uh i know it's minor semantics and i'm going to point out just because you missed the threshold but it actually has been ten years ten whole years so not seven and nine but anyway uh don't need to focus on that we'll we'll get started here um as ryan said feel free to submit questions as we go and we'll certainly circle back around to them once we get to the end so we'll we'll hop right in just hang on this one too long hopefully you guys all are here for the fundamentals of roller mill grinding uh if you somehow got this link by mistake uh you're still welcome to join us and and try to learn a little bit so real quick on safety just always want to touch on this uh guys just please make sure uh whenever you're you're servicing your equipment you're opening up please make sure you're properly locking on locking out and tagging out so on this slide i just kind of want to go through real quick um this is more or less so you guys all understand that the different industries that are that are on the call today so i apologize if i'm a little vague at times but it's because there are so many different industries that are uh that are on the call today so i can't get into too many specifics so i'd be happy to get those specifics with you one-on-one afterwards so again i just do apologize because as you can see there's anywhere from literally rocks to corn that we're grinding today so just something to keep in mind as we're going that most of the concepts will pertain to your application but in the event that something doesn't seem quite right it is possible that it it could be more directed towards a a different market so let's just start off real quick by asking the question you know why are we using a roller miller or a roll crusher and typically for most of you uh it's because that that roll crusher is gonna use less energy than what a hammer mill or maybe other various forms of grinders would use and also usually we get a more homogeneous grind from the roller mill as well so if you kind of look at this chart i have over on the right side that shows uh approximately a 710 micron grind coming from both a hammer mill and a roller mill that blue line is indicates the the the particle distribution for the roller mill whereas the the red line is from the hammer mill uh you can see they're both averaging right at 710 microns but that that blue line is a much more homogeneous grind than the hammer mill so that's a big reason depending on the product you're running so this is a little more focused on the grain side but usually we see less heating we don't see we're not adding as much heat just because we don't have as much friction working as compared to you know a hammer mill or pulverizer or something like that and also again very application dependent but because we aren't heating as much we're also not going to lose as much moisture so for those of you on the call that are more in the feed industry that's less shrink that you'd be you're looking at there a couple other ergonomic things is you know they're not as loud they you know usually 80 to 85 decibels is normally where these machines are running again that can change a little bit they don't produce the dust that we see from other forms of grinders again that kind of shows in that particle distribution you can see on the screen and because those roles in the machines are not spinning as fast as other various grinders we also uh have a lower risk of a thermal event or a fire in there so then we've decided that the roller mill is the best option now we look at how does a roller mill work well material is fed through a series of rolls typically one to three pairs of rolls in order to try to reduce the size and that's how roller models work i appreciate everyone stopping out today that's that i'm sorry i love this poor joke i apologize um so let's start at the top of the machine and uh with your feeder and and what its function is in the different forms of feeders this is our pocket feeder many of you have this this particular feeder and what this feeder is doing is it's volumetric so we are able to calculate the amount of volume that we have going through that feeder now you can see the the pockets are right here is what it is this is actually showing our high high volume feeder and then it's going to dump oh across the face of this magnet which is shown right here and down into the rolls uh this particular feeder is very nice because it is volumetric you are able to calculate how much material is going through your machine and also it can be utilized where you can tie it right into the main motor amps and you can speed up or slow down that feeder as needed as depending on what your motor load is and it is also a positive shot shut off i apologize um because if you need to turn it off you can simply turn off the motor and you will not be feeding any product in your machine so move on next to oops too far into our roll feeder now the roll feeder is a is similar to the pocket feeder and that there's a spinning rotor inside the feeder housing but what this is is a very coarsely corrugated roll that you can see right here or along this uh this whole length here it runs the full length of the machine and what this does is it utilizes a feed gate that opens and closes to allow product more or less product through so this roll feeder typically stays at a constant speed this is a very nice feeder in the fact that it does create a very nice curtain of material that goes down through your rolls so we see very little surging from a machine or from a feeder like this whereas with a pocket feeder it's possible that you'll see some surging you'll see your amps bounce up and down and i'll touch a little later on why that could cause a little bit of issue so the roll feeder is very nice in that regard however it does require this feed gate which does have to adjust open or close depending on what rate you want to be running uh typically it's standard it's going to come with this hand wheel you can see down here that's going to pivot this arm which will open or close this feed gate away from the roll to open or increase or reduce the amount of material that is going through the machine now if you don't want that manual input there is an option uh to add a linear actuator onto that and this particular option actually is uh utilizes a 4 to 20 milliamp signal which you can again tie right into your your controls and automation so you can read your main motor amps to open or close depending on um on what kind of amp load you're trying to run on your on your machine so that way there's a little less human input you don't have to constantly be adjusting it instead of picking one set point now this feeder comes standard with some of our smaller type machines it's just a simple hopper agitator the picture on the left i apologize it's a little hard to see but you can see this flange bearing here and the shaft running across and what it is is just a hopper agitator which is this right here it's designed to just keep product moving and prevent it from kind of bridging up uh this is works very well with free-flowing grain so for those of you on the call that are grinding corn this this type of feeder is very adequate i'm sure many of you out there even operating this particular type of feeder it again utilizes a feed gate open or closed to regulate the amount of material coming through uh it's a nice lower capital cost feeder if you want if you don't have any need to control exactly the amount of material going through there or don't need to calculate your throughput it works very well sorry i have to remove the laser every time i want to change slides now let's talk about magnets because hopefully every one of your machines that you're running does have a magnet still installed up within the feeder housing um just going to play this video hopefully you guys all know how these work and they're you're cleaning them but that you can see that they're swinging away from your whatever type of feeder you have in there i played pretty quick i'll play it again i'm going to pause it so you can see it swings out how i didn't even get deposited in time i apologize so when that feeder swings out just make sure you guys are cleaning it off frequently i know sometimes they're overlooked you forget to do them but cleaning these off making sure you're not getting any material into your rolls and potentially ruining your rolls so now that we've kind of quickly gone through the the feeder um now we're gonna go to we're just gonna go down the line and see where where our material goes next which is into the roll so let's start talking about some of the the roll characteristics and first and foremost we need to start off by trying to decide how many roles do we need to use for your application you know as i mentioned earlier usually it's one two or even three pairs of rolls and why we need to decide that is you know there's there's a little bit of overlap there's times where a single pair will do it or maybe the double pair you know either one will work but you know what's best for your application now we have to take an account obviously capital cost there's always that part of the investment we need to talk about but you know it's also what's your best operating cost and you know i'm gonna bring up the fact that uh you know if you're looking between a two roll crusher and a four roll crusher you know single and double pair if both will do the job when we look at the four roll as compared to the two roll we're getting additional roll surface area so we're spreading the work out over more pairs of rolls so sometimes it's a little easier to get the grind we're looking for and and we can get a more homogeneous grind when we have a little more control over it um you know if we look at you know how many pairs is too many a lot of your machines out there we can actually add another set of rolls to them so if you have a single pair we can make it a double pair if it's a double pair we can turn it into a triple pair and a lot of times get you a little more efficiency some better roll life you know as far as is there a limit we tend to think the the three pair is the max you you should be running uh just because as that material is going through your roll crusher it is getting finer and finer after every single set of rolls it goes through so if we look at this uh this tooling that we have over on the left side of your screen you'll see the some of the corrugations will cut into rolls so on the top i'm trying to show what like a triple pair would look like you can see these coarser corrugations and they're getting finer as we go because the material is getting finer we have to have finer corrugations otherwise you'll get big particles that'll sit in those those little valleys and and really this almost acts like a little bit of a pocket feeder so we have to keep getting those corrugations finer and finer as we go down so if we start to get into the quadruple pair or an eight roll machine you can see we have these corrugations would have to be so fine moving the same volume of material through a very tight roll gap with very shallow corrugations you can't move the same amount of volume that you can through these uh these coarser corrugations so you know yeah there's certainly some applications where we can look at adding a a fourth set of rolls but you start to get into the challenge of how long are the corrugations going to last and that bottom pair becomes quite the bottleneck as compared to your top set of rolls there we go so now let's quickly talk on how all those rolls are driven and the the examples i'm showing here uh on the far left you can see we have one of our triple pair roller mills and you can see three main drive motors all those each of those motors is driving the front roll on each machine or what we call the fast roll and then over here on the right side is our inner roll drive or the ird as as you may have heard um and actually let's just go to the example on the bottom you can see our main motor back here we have main drive belts going to this front roller the fast roll and then over here on the right side of the machine is our ird side which is shown up here in the upper right so the back roll is driven off the front roll via belts and different size shifts and we'll talk in just a second on on what these different size ships are doing and what they're used for so the reason that we like to use one one motor per bankrolls or sometimes there's two but we we only drive them off of the off the front rolls is because we want to make sure we understand how much work we're doing on each set of rolls because that's really crucial to a how your material is going to grind how uniform of a grind you're getting and um also uh how much wear you're getting on your on your rolls as well so on on a machine that has one motor per bank of rolls it's really simple to balance your motor loads because you can record the amps on every single motor and hopefully be able to compare the numbers and see how close they are to each other if you do have a machine that does only have one main drive motor for two sets of rolls it's still possible because we do only we are only driving the main rolls there i'm sorry the the front or fast rolls so we can do just a little bit of math and we can be able to calculate how much work we are doing on each set of role i kind of have the instructions over there on the right of of how you would do that and the reason for that is like i said it's product uniformity we don't want to over grind on one set of rolls as compared to the other when you over grind on one pair you tend to create a lot of fines more fines than if you just spread the load out over a couple sets of rolls and also when you're over grinding on one pair you're going to wear those corrugations a lot faster than the other set of corrugations and and ideally we like to wear those at the at the same rate so it's just for the longevity of your machine it's a lot better if you can really maintain and and balance out the work over all the sets of rolls that you have um similar to the vehicles you drive you have four tires on them you want to wear those at the same speed so you should be driving on all four tires so to talk about the differential uh i mentioned it just slides back and i've seen actually a question has already come in about this um all of those roles i shouldn't say all but typically we're going to use a differential on our rolls uh and what that does is it changes the speeds of the front and the back roll so that they're not spinning at the same speed and what that does is it actually creates a little bit of a shearing action in there so you're more uh think of it as you're cutting the material instead of just smashing it together or compressing it and that brings us a few benefits uh typically it gives us a lot more control over the material we're grinding we usually see less fines when we use the differential in there and we're able to just get a little more uniform of a grind typically because we're not creating as many fines so um on the right side i have a little bit of a chart that kind of explains uh some of the different differentials we use and kind of an example if if our front row is spinning at a thousand rpm it does show on the right side of what the slow roll would be spinning at um you see that one point six seven to one and two to one down at the bottom a lot of times that's going to be more in a some of our soybean de-hulling applications where if you if you're hot dehulling because that the temperature you need that extra shearing action a lot of you if you're in the you know grinding grain relatively fine uh we'll use that 1.3 to one and a half to one differential that gives us a nice nice shearing action and up not a whole lot of one to ones out there i'm guessing some of you if you're if you're utilizing our 650 series you might have that but typically we use at least one point one to one just so we can get a little bit of a shearing action in there now we just talked about how the rolls are working and the material going through them these devices everyone has them on your machines and i want to make sure we're utilizing them because without them we have the potential to have material actually going around the rolls so we want to make sure all the material goes through the rolls so up top you can see there's a uhmw cheek plate get my laser pointer here it's this piece right here it's uhmw and you can see it's slotted right here so it is adjustable because as your rolls where you will lose diameter and we want to make sure this contours to the roll so what this piece is doing is preventing material from going around the ends of the roll and now right here you'll see is another plate you can see it on each side this plate is also adjustable um there's the bolt there's one bolt here there's one other one you can barely see here but you can loosen those bolts and this plate will actually slide up and down and what this does as well is prevents material from bouncing over the rolls because again we want all the material we're grinding to go through the rolls instead of over so making sure these are set i i see it quite frequently when i'm out in the field these were lifted up when you change your rolls and they are never dropped back into place so what happens is you get a lot of material that's going over the roll so we want to prevent that you know one of the easiest ways i do it is it really if you can just use a like a flat head screwdriver and put it between the rolls and that plate and drop it down just uh you know the the higher up you are on your machine it's not as crucial but certainly as you get down and you're getting finer you want to have a tighter and tighter clearance on that plate seal now let's talk a little bit about the roll diameters and and what the options are and some of the advantages and and for the most part what i'm going to kind of hit on here is the larger diameter is better there's there's more advantages the larger you go so i'm going to talk about these three main bullet points here i'll bring them up each time but on the left is a list of the different diameters of rolls of that we have available in in particular machines a couple of these we don't actually offer new anymore but there's a good chance there's still many of you running them in the field today so the first one is the nip angle and that is basically is what is grabbing that material and pulling it down through the rolls yes the corrugations are grabbing a little bit but it's also the angle at which that roll is able to contact the material and the larger the role is the more optimal that nip angle is i kind of use the example shown down there at the bottom of uh there's a ram truck and a golf cart you know if you have to use one or the other to jump over a curb that truck's gonna be able to do it better because it has a larger diameter wheel as compared to that golf cart um just because i'm sure a couple of you were joking about me using a ram i did have a co-worker suggest that i use an f-150 here but i told them i could not i did not have enough room or that golf cart is sitting so i couldn't use that as an example so now to talk a little bit about increased surface area so when you go to a larger diameter you have more surface area on that roll as well and what that's going to do is going to give you longer roll life the corrugations are still wearing at the same rate but because you have more corrugations they're going to last longer in between the times you need to corrugate so i give three examples here i'm just showing three different 36 inch wide rolls so we have a 9 inch a 12 inch and a 16 inch diameter roll that nine by 36 has just over 1 000 square inches of roll area that 12 by 36 has about 1 357 square inches and the 16 by 36 has just over 1 800 square inches so each of those is about a 33 percent increase as you go up so you have the same width of machine and theoretically you know you can move the same amount of volume through that ignoring the efficiencies with the larger roll diameters but if you have 33 percent more roll area we would expect you to get 33 percent more life out of those rolls before you need to re-corrugate them um so you know that leads directly into you know what's your downtime if you if you could remove one less corrugation and times you have to turn off that machine and shut your production down you know what what's that worth to you so just something to keep in mind when you're looking at machines and you know is there a potential there for some savings um and i guess i will add when we move uh showing this list again is that some of your machines actually can be retrofitted um we can convert a 12-inch machine to a 13 and three-quarter inch diameter and those of you that are running a 14-inch we can also increase that to a 16-inch roll utilizing the same frame there's just a few components we need to change on your shifts and belts but so there could be a possibility we can increase the diameter of your um rolls without changing anything else on your machine like i said you get the benefits of we would expect a slightly higher throughput or or increase efficiency however you want to look at it but you know somewhere in the 10 to 15 percent range we we couldn't expect to see that kind of improvement and then also you do get that added roll life as well so there's value there as well now this one is a really important one that's uh many times overlooked or not thought of and that's actually the role deflection now this is a direct result of the roll diameter as well as the width of the roll both of these come into play so that's why i did list the different widths we have for each roll diameter as you can see and and as you've noticed the as the diameter gets bigger we are able to get the roll longer and i'll explain real quickly here why that is excuse me so where that roll is the least supported would be in the very middle of the roll where it's farthest away from the bearing that is affixed to the frame of the machine so it'd be very difficult to see actually i don't think you could see it at all but that roll does flex a little bit just because as that material is coming into down into the rolls get my laser egg in here so your material is coming down and as it hits those rolls it's actually trying to push those rolls apart now over on the edge of the machine where the bearings are and it's it's attached to the frame they're really not going to move very much but when you get into the middle of that roll you can actually see that roll try to flex a little bit now i talked earlier about that pocket feeder and you get some surging well that can cause some problems because if you're surging it's trying to push it at times and then it's not pushing the rope and it's pushing it and not pushing it so your roll is constantly moving so that can cause some some minor issues um but if we just look at the deflection even assuming we have a a curtain of material that roller is going to try to push back a little bit so if we look at a couple examples i did just to kind of show some of the more extremes um if we have a 12 inch diameter roll that's 72 inches wide the middle of that roll can move up to 10 000 of an inch now if we narrow that down to just a 12 by 52 so i can show you how the the widths vary here that deflection drops to right at 400 thousandths of an inch and then if you using that same example if we increase our diameter from 12 inches to 16 inches that deflection drops even lower down to just over a thousandth of an inch now again we're talking thousands of an inch here is does that really make a huge deal um and actually before i go on sorry uh the very bottom note um i talk about is some of you i can see here i can't see but you're probably thinking hey we have you know 72 inch and 84 inch rolls out there you know why would we do that if um you're seeing that much deflection uh typically those are the machines we're going to use in a very coarse grinding or a cracking application where we don't need to have a very homogeneous grind and i'll show why here i'll give you an example on the next slide so i apologize there's a lot of data on this i will explain it so what you're seeing are two uh particle size distribution reports uh these are two different grinds that were run on a machine that had 12 inch diameter rolls that were 12 inches wide so essentially minimal to no roll deflection at all and what it did is i ran a sample and i kind of recorded the the roll gaps up here and you can see we got a mean particle diameter of 441 microns with a 1.1.89 standard deviation and then to try to simulate that roll deflection you would see of ten thousandths of an inch i open every single roll gap up by 10 000 of an inch and what we got is a mean particle diameter of 593 microns so we we saw 152 micron difference in that 10 000 of an inch now if you go back and and you think you know that's 152 micron difference you know if we have a roll there that's uh we can flex that much you could be making a different grind just even though your roll gap's the same uh as that roll is flexing you're going to see your grind change so that's why um we won't we don't like to use a machine that's wider than 52 inches for a grinding application just because you're 52 or narrower that that number that deflection really drops down and we're able to keep a much more homogeneous grind for for a longer term so let's talk about now you know we're obviously trying to keep homogeneous grind and we can see some roll deflection and and what happens so how is your machine keeping those rolls together how are we maintaining that consistent grind well it starts off first by the frame you guys all have it's a very heavy duty frame i list the different wall thicknesses you can see there but what i want to point out is the the frame of your machine is only supporting the weight of the rolls it's not actually holding any separating forces from those rolls trying to push out it is just supporting the weight of the rolls so it's already a very heavy duty frame uh so just a real quick trivia question because we can any guesses on what the weights of a triple pair 16 52 roller miller roll crusher is and that's not including the motors you guys are all muted so you can't answer anyway oh i see someone already actually threw it out there yes the answer is d uh 31 500 pounds um a is actually the weight of the rolls alone so there's about 14 000 pounds of just frame on that machine yes good job will uh so also on that machine uh just to point out the the frame is the only piece on your machine that cannot be replaced uh by the time that would wear out we just assume you just need a new machine at that point um there is a piece on the frame that is replaceable i just want to point this out real quick it's that bronze bearing slide so as that slow roll is moving in and out it's there's a sliding surface which is that bronze wear strip that is that is replace replaceable so that's just what i want to show on on this machine or on the slide but so the frame only is supporting the weight of the rolls so we need to have another enclosure that is uh holding together the separating forces as those rolls we're trying to push out we need something there to contain that that pressure as well so what we have on our machines or you guys have on your machines is the are these tension members this whole tension member housing and so the way this this particular area works is this machine is showing a five ton ball screw jack which is which is what's going to move your rolls in and out it's going to hold your rolls in and you can see our bearings up on this tension member and then we have this tension member over here that's that's holding this side now on your on these rolls you can see we have a disc spring and on all on the next slide i'll show you some examples of those but that's what's going to hold those rolls in or if you do get an un uncrushable object i won't say rocks because some of you on this call are grinding rocks but um you know bolts or something like that if we need to pop those rolls open that's what those that's what those springs will do but what i wanted to show here was it is this tension member that's affixed to your frame is what's actually supporting the the separating forces of when you're grinding so we kind of have two different areas on that machine so you have the frame which is only holding the weight of your rolls and then we have this tension member enclosure which is what's actually holding your rolls together to keep them from trying to move apart on us come on next slide there we go so those springs i just talked about um depending on the series of machine you're running they're gonna look a little different uh you can see up here on the top left this is our our 650 series uh much smaller series of machine so we don't have a very you know high intensity spring going on but you can see as our machine sizes get bigger our spring stacks do get more and more robust uh you get up to the 1200 and 1600 series shown down here on the bottom you can see there's a double stack of beveled disc springs is what we're using there just uh like i said as as an uncrushable object does does come in your machine hopefully they're not but that will allow those those rolls to pop open and hopefully allow that product to get through and so there are a few different options that we we use when we're looking at these spring stacks um and it's it's depending on your application like i just said there's people on here that are grinding rocks and there's some people grinding very very simple stuff you know such as corn or other grains so we'll put a preload on those springs that's what's holding holding those rolls together and then we also have different uh deflection forces and over travel we can look at so um we we can move anywhere from four tenths of an inch up to a little over an inch depending on what your application is again like i spoke earlier i'm going to keep a little vague here just because we do have such a wide array of people on the call today but basically what i'm getting at is there are different options depending what you're looking at and and if your grind does change you know if you're starting to get a much finer grind and we don't we want to make sure we're keeping those rolls as tight as possible we may look at uh at an alternative spring stack to try to make sure we're keeping those those rolls from moving as much as possible and real quickly just to touch on this bottom bullet point uh i'm sure many of you on here are operating crumblers as well in your feed facilities the spring stacks are different for those they are not as they're more forgiving i'll put it that way so they usually most of them do not fall within the range as i have up here so they are just a little different now we're going to move on now to the the roll adjust so we we just talked about how we want to try to keep those rolls from moving we want to keep them in the same place well once we do get them to where we want them we want to make sure we can move them in unison so we we do have the single point roll adjust so you only have to move one hand wheel per bank of rolls and that whole that roll is going to stay together and moving unison on both sides because once we get parallel we want to get keep parallel especially as you get to a wider and wider machine keeping that parallel can be you know very difficult that example i gave earlier on our on our 12 by 12 machine um that's not very hard to keep parallel just because it is so narrow but as you get that 52 72 84 it can become more and more imperative to try to keep them and keep an eye on them so we do have a single point roll adjust but you know as you're checking it you may notice that your rolls aren't in parallel well luckily we do have a a very simple way to correct that um if you're on our 1200 or 1600 series there's this coupling on the back that is connecting those jacks together hopefully you guys are all familiar with it all you have to do is slide this coupling over and you can move either side independently to get the rolls into a parallel position and you re reconnect that coupling and you can continue to move that role as as you were before uh for those of you on here that are operating our 900 650 uh measure where it's not that simple i apologize that i actually for whatever reason omitted those slides from here but um that you can certainly still do it you have those threaded rods on each side but for the 1200 and 1600 series this is how we maintain our parallel now all of your machines do have roll stops which is what we use to prevent you from running your rolls together um you know unfortunately when you have to have a very tight clearance you know for down to two to three thousandths of an inch you there's also a possibility they can run the rolls together we don't want you to do that just because that's going to wear your corrugations faster and that's going to increase your operating costs which we don't want to we don't want to do so these roll stops are designed that we can set them to prevent your rolls from running together again i'm showing our 1200 and 1600 series here uh the the 900s and 650s are a little different i'll certainly be happy to to always work work with you guys and walk you through how to set them you know each application we're going to set them a little differently so if this is something you're not familiar with um please feel free to reach out and we're happy to walk you through it just so like i said i don't want to wear your rolls any faster than we have to so making sure these are set it's a very easy thing to do especially if we're on site with you guys uh this is just this slide is just more informative just kind of talking about the the various uh shaft diameters we use in our machines um just because as you you could expect as the diameters get bigger of our rolls we're also going to use a larger shaft kind of goes back to what we talked about earlier with the deflection just making sure we're as robust as possible you know as you get up that 1200 hx on the 1600 we want that 100 millimeter get a little larger diameter bearing on there as well but not too much to talk to at this standpoint now all of your machines did come standard with an aspiration port on them uh many of you that have the i'll say older but only within if you haven't purchased your machine within the last five years your aspiration port's gonna look like this it's that round i think it's four inch diameter connection point on the back your machines um we don't require aspiration to maintain throughput through your machine kind of like a hammer mill would but we do like that just for housekeeping purposes uh and even to help protect your bearings a little bit um i'll talk about that just in a couple slides but the the newer machines that you'll see out there actually do have a full width of air pickup point and we did that actually to help keep the velocity a little lower because with that round uh four inch diameter one you sometimes depending on how much aspiration you were pulling you got a pretty high velocity at that pickup point we we'd pull a little more good product than we wanted to so we want this full width pickup point and sorry i realized my laser is not on here we go so and we do have one for each bank of rolls and to talk about that just a little bit um i know a lot of you a lot of people out there certainly think hey if we just put a little bit of negative on the on the discharge of the machine we'll collect a lot of the dust and and i'm actually going to use this picture on the left to show you why that's not always the greatest uh greatest plan of attack so you can see this full width pickup point and that's located right here on the machine right here and right here so there's one on each set of rolls so if we're just pulling negative air off the bottom of the machine you're only going to collect the dust that's down here on the bottom because if you go up around you have these tight roll seals there the roll seal over here and your cheek plates so there's not a lot of area for you to be pulling air from especially if on your bottom set of rolls where your roll gap might be a thousandth of an inch and if you have product going through that you're again not going to pull much air so you can be pulling a lot of aspiration here from the bottom but you won't be able to collect any of the dust that you're actually producing up on the top of the machine so if you do want to put a little negative air on it i do strongly encourage that you put them on every bank of roll just because that's where you're producing the dust that's where we're going to try to collect the dust and because we do have various roll seals in there i'm not going to call them an air lock by any means but we do want to try to collect the dust wherever we can and prevent it from getting that out through unwanted crevices which again i will talk about here on the next slide when we get into talk of the bearings a little bit so the places that that those dust could get out through the machine would be where your your roll shafts are exiting of the machine so we do have roll seals that you can see here mounted to the shafts and so that's just a neoprene seal we're gonna that's gonna hold tight against the frame your machine and to help prevent dust from getting out and which is also then we get into our split housing uh pillow block bearings we use uh we now do make them with an lor seal to get that o-ring in there uh the goal is just to try to prevent as much dust from getting into those bearings so those bearings are designed to last the life of your roll so if you're not seeing that or having issues that might be a place we an easy way to potentially increase bearing life if you are having some issues would be to put a little bit of negative on on that machine just to try to prevent a little more dust from getting out into those into those bearings so also with maintaining those bearings a lot of our newer machines are being equipped with this uh lubrication delivery system or lds as we call it uh that way it's just a single point lubrication point on your machine again trying to reduce the you know manual points of where you have to be adding grease to your machine so if you put on the same spot that's just really what this is again i'm not going to get into a lot of detail but most of your machines should have something like this on them now to talk a little bit about corrugations i've seen a couple questions have already come in looking talking about the different corrugations and what's required the corrugations are very dependent on the application you're grinding and how fine you're wanting to grind so um we're always happy to review them uh you know one thing i really discourage you from doing is you know when you send your roles in for recordation we hear it a lot of just well just give me what we've done before just because that's what we've always done now for most of you i'm guessing your grind requirements have even changed over the years and decades so reviewing and making sure we are using the right one and just real quickly a quick guide on on some of the more popular corrugations we use um the sawtooth the bmw and the rbv you can see here um bmw i know many times is also known as builder cut i obviously can't write that on my on our slide but i i will uh acknowledge that yes that's what the is referred to as times but um i won't read through the bullet points um the b w is very similar to the sawtooth uh just uh we see a little sharper edge to it that lasts a little bit longer is the benefit from that and then our rbv is is the most common corrugation we use for for the majority of our grain grindings so similar to the the last slide i just said um feel free to use utilize our applications team um just because the corrugation you're using has worked pretty well for you for however many years or decades you've been operating your machine doesn't mean that there may not be a better better mouse trap out there for for what we can look at or or if your grinds change a little bit you're trying to optimize something a little else so feel free to have the conversation with us that's what we're here for we do want to make sure we let you know the the options we have available um and one example of that is actually the the blue rules we've we've been working on here for a handful of years now you know a lot of times we have a lot a lot of ideas that you may not have heard of you may not know exists so we're happy to help you out with uh with letting you know what we know and this is just one example uh if it's something you feel like you may be interested or have benefit again feel free to reach out to us um rather not make this much of a sales pitch so i'm not going to dig too deep into it but it is a an option that is available for you guys so just quickly review kind of a lot of the points we went over and then we'll open it up for questions um just the different points we've talked about and where they're at on your machine i do show one of our triple pair machines here so many of you may not if you only have a single or double obviously you could reduce it uh this won't show the 900 series or 650 but you can see our three main drive motors one for each set of rolls you can see your jacks on the back of the machine there's one on each side so you can see these three there are three more on the other side that we can't see from this angle you can see our disc springs that we were talking about so that jack's moving that whole shaft in and out as it's moving the bearing bearing and roll i should say obviously you can see the bearings on the ends of the shafts um we did talk earlier about roll parallel and maintaining that another one is actually the roll tram we didn't we didn't talk about that one at all so you know that's kind of how your rolls if they get it like cocked a little bit like that um underneath these bearings here is actually a tremble that we can use to lift up or lower that roll so we can make sure they are in proper tram um as these machines are sent out we do send a tram gauge with all of them many times they they do get lost uh understandably so so but that is uh that is a tool that is sent out with them you can see this cheek plate in here we talked about that sealing the end of the roll it's hard to see those plate seals we talked about you guys all have the sample ports on your doors and then the swing out magnets and the feed gate we talked about earlier and then we'll just go to one more on the back side and then we can open it up to some questions there's the back side of the machine so again you can see all your main drive motors for each one uh here's the jack on the opposite side that we couldn't see you can see that shaft that goes across from jack to jack that does connect those together and there's that coupling component that you can couple or decouple if you do need to reset your parallel on your machine um the single point roll adjusts on each machine and each machine is independent so you can move each roll independently um main drive is obviously over here and then here's that ird or inter roll drive side we talked about uh for the most part most of your machines are in this configuration but they can be flipped if if we do need to and then again those aspiration ports on each on each machine you can see another one right in here the bottom one's kind of hidden but it is right there so that's a real quick review on on those points we talked about um looks like we got a a good amount of questions coming in already so i believe we'll we'll take a look at some but um i do have my contact information here on this next slide so if you guys do have any more questions always feel free to reach out and we can talk a little more in detail specific to your process and your application if you want um and i will add another thing if you guys do have any ideas for future webinars that you would like to learn more about uh anything across the the cpm business feel free to comment or send us a message uh we always want to make sure we're bringing you guys content that you that you see value in so please let us know if there are any future webinars you would like to hear from so at this point let's uh let's look at some questions sure doug um i will uh we'll present the questions that are a little more general in nature there's a couple of very very specific questions um good ones uh that will reach out to individuals um to each individual that asks the question directly and have a further conversation first question what is the relationship between the size of particles and the number of raw flutes per centimeter and for corn what is the perfect corrugation of rolls and flutes corrugations as we say uh up from top roll to bottom um i'm gonna have to provide a very vague answer here of it depends um that'd be something it would be better to have a conversation offline especially just because wanting to know how fine you're wanting to get that product um you know how homogeneous you need is is there a certain standard deviation we need to hit so there's no one great answer to that so i i i can't provide you with just based on what i know at this point with what the proper corrugations would be so in that same vein doug what is the differential speed of rolls for good crushing um this is okay same thing yeah sorry um most likely we we typically like to be about that one and a half to one for for good grain grinding is typically where we see again obviously there's always some exceptions to the rule but usually about one and a half to one is where i kind of like to start okay is there a better seal on the roll shafts to prevent the outflow of dust the current one is a sponge um yes we do have a couple other options other than what was shown we have your name and information of who asked this question so we can certainly reach out to you with uh some other options that we do have available we we do like this like the sponge as was stated but they do need to be replaced uh consistently and um relatively uh low value item but it does require consistent replacement and they're new we do think it's a good solution yeah that's a good point ryan just made uh like you just said they're they're relatively uh low in in cost so when you are changing your rolls out it is just a good component to just assume you're going to change it every time that they might still be in good condition but uh for the investment they make and for the dust they hold back it is good to just replace those every time you do pull your rolls out can you use different roll speed differentials on each bank of rolls yes that's this is something we many times use especially if we're looking at a triple pair machine um we'll sometimes use a less aggressive differential on the bottom pair of rolls and what that does is it actually makes your slow roll faster so because like i talked about those bottom rolls you have them they're all so tight they are a tighter corrugation so many times that's the bottleneck in your machine so we sometimes will actually speed up that slow roll on the bottom pair to help move a little more product so it's a little less aggressive also sometimes you know if if you're someone who's running different commodities or different products yes we'll use different differentials on different pairs if we're trying to utilize one set over the other with a different product but um the quick answer that is uh yes we can do that because i guess because each set of rolls has its own independent drive and ird setup okay next question how large of material is able to go into a roller mill i'm asking for bigger than corn kernel size like larger pellets alpha or wheat brand pellets 10 millimeter by 16 to 20 millimeter in length can a roller mill handle those so kind of the rule of thumb we say is usually half inch or smaller is what you want to look at their half inch will be 12 millimeter or smaller we like to keep it at um certainly it's very application dependent i see you're referencing specific pellets and a lot of it will depend on again the roll diameter with the larger roll we get we can usually accommodate slightly larger material because we are able to better grab that material and pull it down into the roll so and also it will depend on the corrugations we have you know if we get a coarser corrugation we're able to pull in bigger material however you're not able to grind it as fine so um just kind of based on what you're saying here uh the 10 millimeter really doesn't scare me overall it's certainly something we'd be willing to look at okay had a question that i'll tackle actually is the 12 by 12 machine available for purchase yes it is we've begun offering it commercially the only model exists in our waterloo iowa test center today it is a fully modular machine each pair of rolls in the feeder is its own section so it's a bit of a different design than what we have will we can reach out to you individually to see if it uh fits your needs another question from will do you offer a four inch shaft um i don't believe so but i may have to confirm that okay i don't know we can answer that question in greater detail for you will uh question uh can you expand on balancing the top and bottom rolls when we only have one motor what does that mean absolutely so i just brought the slide up again so this is showing one of our dprm machines where we have one drive motor driving two of our fast rolls so the difficulty with that is you know you're trying to make sure you're balancing the work you're doing on each set of rolls but you can't strictly look at the the amps you're running because you're you're grinding in both sets of rolls and those amps are being only recorded in one place so the way to do that there's a couple steps to it to make sure we're not over grinding or under grinding on them would be to turn your machine on and just with no load going through the machine you're going to record those idle amps and then you're going to start running and grinding as you normally do you're going to record your operating amps now the thing to do at that point then will be to open the bottom set of rolls that way you're not overloading them you're overloading the top because the top will still be grinding as it normally would and then when you open those bottom set of rolls that's gonna you're gonna see your amp load drop and so that amount of amps you drop that change or delta will show you how much how much work you're doing on the bottom pair so then you can compare that to what your total operating amps are and you can subtract out your idle amps your operating er your idle amps and the amps you lost by opening the bottom set of rolls and that'll tell you what uh how many amps you're pulling on the top set and then you can also see how many you're doing on the bottom set and so hopefully those numbers are are pretty close in relation to each other so you can see how well you're balancing them hopefully that answers the question i get it's a little it is a little confusing um and if it's not a certainly feel free to reach out and we can we can help you figure it out as well okay do you have small research roller mills this was asked a couple of times uh our smallest roller mill is uh six and a half inch diameter by nine inches long um that is our smallest machine that we can handle uh do have a number of research facilities using that um tends to work pretty well tends to work pretty well do the bell bell view disc springs wear out how do we know when it's time for a change um as with everything yeah they do wear out just not very quickly at all um it would be hard to tell i guess because what's gonna happen is they're just not going to hold their their compression as well um i mean i don't i honestly don't have a great answer for that other than if it's been a long time you know obviously long is relative but that's what you would see is that you're not able to hold your your roll position as well have you evaluated the impact on grinding on varying speeds of the rolls with a vfd um the quick answer that is yes that's actually something we do many times in our test center is uh we do have a vfd on our on our main drive so we can speed up or slow down the rolls depending on the application so it is kind of application dependent but um yes that's something we do sometimes look at all right next question on a double stand should all the rolls be the same diameter does it matter if you put a larger set on the top or the bottom preferably yes they are all the same diameter i know there are some examples where you may have a nine inch roll on the top and a 12 inch on the bottom i would typically prefer that you have the larger diameter lower on the machine just because you do have that improved nip angle and typically those are going to have the finer corrugations as well so because you have more diameter like we talked earlier there's more surface area so those uh corrugations will last a little longer since you have the finer corrugation so um no it's something we can certainly overcome and it it'll work but typically i'd prefer that we have the larger diameter the larger diameter roll on the bottom okay next question uh centered around is the presentation available yes uh you will get an email with a download of the presentation including uh the question and answer yep and if for like uh ryan mentioned earlier it sometimes does show up in junk mail filters but um if it's been a day or so when you haven't seen it please feel free to reach out and i can make sure you do get a copy of the of the video how about a pdf of the presentation yes i i can i can share one of those as well that won't get sent out so if it is something you would like uh do feel free to reach out and we we can see who requested this one so i'll make sure you get one for that okay with soybeans would you see more wear in the center of the rolls than on the ends of the rolls or maybe just material in general uh for material in general um usually we see it more on the ends just because i actually you know i take that back it really all depends on how how you're feeding the machine and you know if it's coming in at a certain angle we're going to see one side of the machine grind more than the other uh depends a little on the corrugations you have but um typically we usually see it be pretty even across the machine if you're doing a good job of feeding it okay and uh final question on the list that we'll address in the webinar uh well get one more popped in so uh for which application do you take different roll diameters in the same roller mill so i know they're back in the day a few decades ago i know there are machines out there that many times would be growing two different grains you know let's say you know you're grinding wheat one day and corn the next day and you only need to use a single-pair machine they would have a double pair machine and they would only use one roll at a time so that's a lot of a lot of the machines that are out there like i mentioned where there might be a nine inch roll on the top and a 12 on the bottom that's something where we would see that where they were just happen to be using different commodities and just had a different requirement um prefer to not have different role diameters in the machine but that's what would sometimes happen yeah i would say that's not a standard offering by uh by our company correct usually yep yep not a standard what i have also sometimes looked at we talked a little bit about being able to upgrade your rolls from either 12 inch to 1375 or 14 to 16. i have seen it where someone had a double pair 12-inch machine and just for you know capital costs and budgets they were only able to do one set of rolls at a time so they upgraded their bottom set of rolls to 1375 and kept the top pair at 12 inch but you know the plan is in the future to change that to the larger diameter to get those benefits okay do slower roll speeds give better control of the grist of materials and animal feeds um to a certain point yes because we those roles aren't going as fast we don't have as high of a a grinding action i'll call it we do sometimes see less fines produced so it gives you a little more control i think that's kind of what you're asking you know then we do certainly have to look at the the case of by slowing down the rolls we're also not getting as much throughput as well so that's a little bit on the back side but yeah there is some some merit to going a slightly slower roll we do get a little less fines produced all right that is the end of our questions uh you have doug's contact information feel free to reach out with additional questions there's a few that we chose not to tackle here during the webinar we pledge to get back to you individually with some of those answers or sorry with those answers and um with that said that concludes the webinar today i want to thank everyone for attending really appreciate it thanks doug uh for taking on this topic and and look for more topics from cpm in the future thank you everyone thank you", "t6U0vMbFS0E": "hey Chris with RC Wurst here welcome back to another great video today we're gonna be showing you you guessed it how to wire a double float switch so stay tuned alright so today we're going to be wiring a double float switch and the reason I thought this video would be interesting is one we haven't done it yet into the double floats have three wires now some of you may seen floats before that had three wires and those are the single-pole double-throw or in this case a double float switch so if you're not familiar with a double float switch we essentially have two floats in here and this one is labeled the bottom this one is labeled the top we've got a relay here so what we're able to do is in relatively deep applications where you maybe don't have a lot of room for a wide angle swing you can use the double float switch for a wider range of pumping in those tighter diameter applications and it's also intended for direct pump control so let's talk about how to wire this thing up if you have any other questions about double floats by the end of the video make sure you leave those in the comments below on your way down don't forget to hit that subscribe button let's jump into the wiring here alright so why aren't up a double float switch is actually relatively simple so we've got ground of course so we don't have to touch that the double float switch as I mentioned has three wires so what we're trying to do is with our white wire hook that into our Neutral or RL 2 depending on if it's a hundred and twenty or a 240 volt system but the thing to remember with a double float switch big warning label or whatever double float switches you have to purchase the one appropriate to the voltage you're using it on so we sell 120 volt and 240 volt double float switches you have to buy the right one for the particular voltage you're using or it will not work and that has to do with the relay that we just talked about so we've got our neutral in 120 volt configurations or our l2 in 240 volt configurations then we're going to hook up to that white wire right there and then what we're gonna do and of course this is our incoming power so our power source so we're gonna have the l1 hook to our black now this could be a wire nut this could be a terminal however you're hooking it up doesn't really matter but what we're doing on the other side of the l1 which this would be our load side so if you're using this for a pump this would be your l1 or your hot in 120 volt configurations you would hook that to the red wire so essentially what we're doing here is with that holding circuit that's created with the relay we're able to have let me grab the floats again so the simple way that this operates and I got on backwards but so it requires both floats to be in the up position for the system to turn on and then both floats to be in the down position for the system to turn off and that's what we're accomplishing with the relay and holding circuit that's created when both floats come up and then that holding circuit doesn't break connection or lose power until that bottom float falls back down which is what gives us that wider range of pumping so hopefully this quick demonstration showed you simply where your wires go when you're trying to wire a double float switch all right so that's our video it was a short one short and sweet don't forget to Like in subscribe like I said we'll catch you next time [Music]", "3kI2JPPasQY": "hi I'm chef Mike Garrity executive chef at Woodstock Trident of America and I'm going to talk to you about our handheld sharpener now the neat thing about this is it has two stages we have a fine side and we have a coarse side what's nice about this system is it takes away from you trying to figure out the angle when you hone the knife it's got two cross sticks in it set up the factory at the correct angle now to use this as very simple you just take a cook's knife like this or any other knife you're going to put it down right here on the fine side you're just going to pull it through three or four times you don't have to put pressure down there's really micro feathers that start to happen so honing a knife is just taking those micro feathers off we're just really realigning that fine fine edge of the knife you can use that fine side every hour and a half to two hours worth of use or you can even use it more than that if you want because it doesn't take steel off now eventually you're going to have to sharpen your knife and that's when you're going to use the coarse side so it actually takes steel off that blade when we take steel off the blade we reset that edge now to take steel off the blade we have to get after it a little bit so you're going to have to apply light pressure down it's the same motion as what we did before only you want to hear a nice even grind all the way through so we start at the heel of the knife pull toward you you're going to do that probably three to six times to reset that edge once you have the edge reset finish on the fine side and your knife is going to be set bright same angle that it came from the factory it's going to be good as new and if you own any of wood stops Asian style knives whether it be the santoku the nakiri or the chai dowel we offer a universal

Wisthoff calm", "wkMsjlVdRI4": "(music) TB: That way we can see the full extent. So how much was it like this when you were a young?   You can relax your feet, you can relax.   How was it when you were a young girl?   Was it this bad? Patient: Just the heels, initially and that's when they sort of cut it up, and then I was limping around with a bandage around, I'm trying to recollect (remember) I don't remember if it was the right or the left, but it was the heel I remember right away. TB: The heel?   This one over here where it all started? P: Uh hum. TB: And goes all up the side. P: Now it's everywhere. TB: And now it's on your poor hands to, uh? P: Yeah, this is recent. TB: How long has it been on the hands now? P: I would say at least six eight months now. TB: have you ever seen a dermatologist before? P: No. TB: Both heels.  So how much were you scraping it down yourself? P: As much as I possibly could. Like I said, sometimes I've harmed the good part of the skin and it bleeds, you know. TB: The problem with scraping yourself, because the tool you have isn't precise, it just takes off everything. P: And then I buy those blades. TB: I know.   Of course, blades can be dangerous. This is gonna be very hard for even a foot specialist like me to treat.   So what we're gonna do, I'm gonna spray a callus softener. Try to soften as much as we can and then I use my own scalpel and we try to remove as much of the dead skin as possible. P: So you call this a callus or a corn or what? TB: So callus is just hard skin that grows above the skin and that's because of direct pressure.   So anything that's really sticking out like all this, this is callous.  When we see circles of hard skin that go into the body, that is from pressure: pressure and turning.   That's what pushes the callus into the body and that is what a corn is. P: It's like a little root. TB: Like a little root. P: I've done a lot of discovery (research) on my own. TB: Yes, so as you can see the majority of the hard skin is along the outside of the foot and the heel.   These are weight-bearing areas.   Yes, pressure points and that's why the majority of is here. But for some reason, your body is producing hard skin faster than normal, and that's why it's having  a very fast reaction to the pressure. P: I have thick skin! TB: You're a tough girl! That's why I knew it.  You're a tough girl, tough skin.  That's the only way to that... P: That's why I have such hard skin! TB: That's right!  I don't want to mess with you! So what we're gonna do we're gonna try our best to give you as much relief as we can, okay? And this is something that you have to do yourself. P: So you see the end of the big toe? TB: Yes. Yep. The problem is like you notice, if you didn't walk at all, this much would come right back. So the goal is to again, soft shoes, as much padding and cushioning as possible. P: You see the kind of shoes I wear? TB: Yes. P: In fact, Giselle was teasing me. She's known me for about 17 18 years now. She was teasing me when was with her last week. TB: Yeah. P: She said, \"Oh your feet are not yet ready for Summer!\"  It was the nail polish!   We were talking about nail polish.  You ought to see the soles of my feet! TB: Well what did Doctor Giselle say about me? She said ... P: She said your dad was... TB: Yes. P: And you used to sort of just hang around. TB: That's right!  I used to be that his shadow and now I'm my own person now. Okay, so what we're gonna do, we're gonna take down as much as we can, okay? We just got one more one more foot to do. I know it's really sore even with the callus softener. Okay. One done. So here is this.  So it's very similar, oh my, I have to sign in. Hold on. Oh!  Because it got age restricted from YouTube, YouTube won't show it to people who are underage and I haven't signed in. But if you look, this is it here, one solid piece. Yours is just little bits and pieces all over. So like I said his is the closest to your foot. P: And you did this just two weeks ago TB: No, I filmed it a while ago, but I posted it two weeks ago and 150,000 people saw it. P: Yeah, I see that. So we'll keep spraying it to keep it we gotta keep this really soft. Get this soft. So that's why I'm trying to get him to really scrape it down himself. It's about constant care, so if you're able to have the time to really scrape it down yourself. P: You didn't put it on? TB: No, it's not working.  I can't sign in because it's age restricted. P: It's not good at all.  I got it now. TB: So this is the tough area again, I know I know.   I'm sorry. Did you ever have a surgery? P: On one of the feet, I don't know which one.  And it was that area that was first one whether they said it was a corn, and they removed it. I don't remember which foot though.  It was so long ago. TB: The problem is normally callus is just dead hard yellow skin. The fact that it has all these little red dots and like looks like little vessels to me shows that it's either scar tissue or we have that tissue from underneath that has been caught and stuck in the callus and that's why it's so much more sensitive than normal in this spot. It also could be just because of the amount of pressure on the heel that's what's caused the tissue to P: To make it more tough. TB: And more sensitive, and it's hard for me to dig that out because you have more feeling or sensitivity in that area. P: Right. TB: You okay? P: Uh hum. That's why we just take our time, and we we take out as much as we can. And I'll write a note To Dr. Giselle, P: Giselle, yes. TB: To get a dermatology referral just to see if there's something else. P: Going on. TB: Yes. At least for the hands too to see if they can give you something to stop that. P: It's fortunately, fortunately it's not so bad. Huband: But it might you know? P: Yeah but it could.  Who knows? P: And again, it's all around the palm. TB: All around. P: Not in the middle part. TB: No and it's similar to the foot. It's where you're putting all the pressure. P: Right. TB: So what I'll probably do is similar to last time: I go over everything once applying more of the callus softener and then go over everything again trying to take out all the way to the bottom. P: Uh hum. TB: No, I really appreciate your patience you've been here a long time in the office, sorry. H: No problem. H: She is so used to waiting for her healthcare, okay? It's alright. (laughter) P: Why is podiatrist not included as part of OHIP?  (Ontario Health Insurance Plan) TB: Podiatrists do have some coverage, actually. Podiatrists can claim I think $10 to OHIP. They have billing rights, but the problem is I'm a chiropodist and Ontario practices a chiropody model   So after the year '91, there has been no new podiatrist in Ontario. There's only 45 around 45 podiatrist left in Ontario. So chiropodists do not have any billing rights. We're not able to claim that $10 to OHIP.   But even if you're going to a podiatrist, they're only covering $10.   The rest would have to be covered by you. P: That's what I was wondering why you don't they don't cover part of it because there are so many... H: (?) TB: No.  It's the same thing. H: It is very uncommon really. P: I'm not talking about my kind of thing, there are so many other things too. TB: It's just the money. P: People who have knee problems.. TB: OHIP you know to fund and pay for all these services it's very hard; they're already very tight. TB: I'd rather they give it to Doctor Giselle than me.  She can take it. P: The rest of Canada, do they have something similar to OHIP? TB: Yes.  Yeah, every province has their own provincial plan, but everything's a little different. P: Yep. TB: But it's pretty much the same. I'm gonna put this here. TB: I think the spot here on the left foot is much worse up here.  The other ones on the higher up, this one yes in another area. You okay? P: Uh hum. TB: This one's a little sore or it's okay? P: It doesn't hurt; it's okay. I know where you are working on even without looking. TB: Remember you don't be shy with me.  You tell me if something's bothering you. This one's a little sore, ah? Yes? P: It's not it's not hurting but it's quite. TB: Sensitive?  I can I can feel it. It's just that top layer that's really... TB: I'm gonna spray it a little more. TB: Change the blade. P: How long have you been doing this? TB: Me? P: When did you take over your Dad's business, I mean? TB: I finished school five years ago. This is gonna be my sixth year in September. But as you know I've been watching my dad do this my whole life. P: Right. TB: So my job was to take off the shoes and socks. P: Yeah, I know Giselle mentioned that to me. TB: She knows my story; she's good. P: She told me that. TB: Yeah, she's been very, very good to me.  Any foot problem her patient has she sends it right here. So yeah, it's this is what I grew up watching and and learning and but I think the biggest thing that my dad taught me was how to how to socialize or talk to people. That's something P: That's important too, obviously. TB: Very much, so. How to treat people you know with respect and make them feel comfortable. Etiquette.   Those are the people skills.  That's the stuff that you don't learn in school. P: No, they don't teach you. TB: Because anyone can learn how to cut toenails. P: And you tell him all your different cases? TB: He's always asking all the time. He's always asking what I'm doing? But the way I practice is very different than his.   He didn't do as many surgeries or injections or laser treatment all the stuff that I do. So that's why, yeah, he's very always interested. Because of course, technology has changed, the treatments have changed. What I'm gonna do... We tried to take as much hard skin as we can. Okay.", "YDzhy1_SUNs": "hello everyone thank you for coming back again with me in my kitchen come on with me and let us make this delicious nutritious healthy and very easy to execute dish let's go all right so this is what we're working with here i have um 10 chicken thighs here and you know how i usually put some salt all over it and i went over each one and pulled off most of the fat and i rubbed it down really well with my lime and my salt and i made a couple gashes in it so that i can get um seasoning in there so i'm going now to rinse this off thoroughly and then i will dry it very very well and we will add our marinade so my chicken has been rinsed and pat it dry with some paper towels and this is what i'm going to season with i'm going to use these uh herbs the provence that i've had here i'll say i'm going in with about a tablespoon and i found this rainbow peppercorn so i think i'll give it a shot it's a combination of all different uh colors of um peppers pink and black and green so we'll see this is my first time giving it a shot i would say that's about a good teaspoon going in with garlic powder about a tablespoon and i think i said that these this is uh 10 chicken thighs okay go in with some oregano about two teaspoons it's a little tad of cayenne half a teaspoon you know i'm going in with my chicken bouillon tablespoon and a half smoked package you go a little heavy on this i'm gonna say this is about a tablespoon and a half the two tablespoons and then the last thing that's going in there is some olive oil about two tablespoons it's almost done let me just put it in there [Music] oh i forgot honey i'm going with a little bit of honey you know i i have the sugar-free honey that i use quite frequently i am going to add i would say about a tablespoon tablespoon and a half all right what i'm gonna do now oh i forgot i'm gonna put in time also i have here about three good sprigs at a time i'm gonna leave the twig in there we can take it out after all right so i'm gonna use my hands get this all um rubbed into all of the creases and i'll be right back all right so here's my chicken all seasoned up and i'm going to cook this tomorrow so i'm gonna lit it up and put it in the refrigerator so it'll have several hours um to marinate uh if you don't have the luxury of having that much time you can at least marinate for two three hours before you cook it okay all right i've transferred it into this bowl here because it'll fit better in the refrigerator and tomorrow we'll come back and finish up all right so it's now the next day and i have my chicken here and what i did was i took it out of the fridge about 30 minutes ago just to give it a chance to come closer to room temperature what i'm also gonna add to this dish is i have here about 10 medium to small sized potatoes i washed them very well and cut them into equal sizes i also have here some carrots maybe about five medium sized ones and i have a large onion here now what i'm going to do is just drizzle in some olive oil i'm gonna add some garlic powder that's about a teaspoon and a half i'm gonna use some of this uh cajun seasoning about a tablespoon and a half and [Music] black pepper and one more thing my paprika about i would say a tablespoon and a half so i'm going to get this all uh combined and we'll get them on our baking tray all right so i i'm gonna use this disposable baking tray here because i wanted something with a wide bottom plus i'm taking this down to my grandbaby so it'll just be easier to bring it in this and leave that there because somehow when i bring my dishes over there they stay there all right so we're gonna go in with our chicken i'm gonna put the chicken in first because i want to make sure that it makes contact with the pan so it'll cook from both sides smells really really delicious and okay and then i'm gonna go in with my veggies in between all right so i have everything here on my tray essentially in a single layer so it cooks evenly and i have my oven there preheating at 425 degrees once it comes up the temperature i'm gonna get it on to the middle shelf of my oven and i would say this would probably take about an hour to an hour and 15 minutes but i'll check it along the way to see how it looks all right so here you have our roasted chicken with um potatoes and carrots let me tell you this smells really good it was in the oven for an hour and 15 minutes and i did the test with a knife and everything is um cooked through properly the chicken liquid is clear and we're ready to go guys thank you so much for joining me in the kitchen again today i sincerely appreciate your love and your support and i look forward to coming back next time when i promise to make another delicious recipe bye",

to a great start today we're going to be trying out another recipe from claire saffit's cookbook dessert person back to the foundational recipe section for her classic cream cheese frosting and we'll be doing the brown butter version cream cheese frosting is probably my favorite frosting of all time and brown butter makes everything better so i'm super excited to try this recipe out today i'm going to be using this as part of the carrot cake recipe that i'm making today so if you want to check that out i'll link it through at the end without any further ado let's get right into it so i've got two sticks of butter in a heavy bottom saucepan over medium high heat and we're going to melt this down we've made brown butter a bunch of times on the channel so hopefully everyone's familiar with the process at this point now that the butter is fully melted you can see we're getting a little bit of sputtering action here in the top and you can hear it sizzling away as well that's a great sign that tells us that the water content in the butter is starting to evaporate off and it's been just about 10 minutes since our butter initially started bubbling away and you can see that the bubbling has really subsided considerably so this is a great sign because once the bubbling stops is when the browning of the milk solids begins so we're about to see some color development and this part should progress pretty quickly as the milk solids are toasting it will start to get a little bit of foaming action so this foam that you're seeing on the surface obviously makes it hard to see what's happening down below so if you're having trouble making out the color development just go ahead and lift that pan up and the foaming will calm down for a second and you'll be able to get a good peek at what's happening with your milk solids you don't want to burn it so i'm going to go ahead and kill the heat now we've achieved a nice golden brown color the line between golden brown and burnt is very fine so toe it delicately stop short is definitely better than burnt butter um that's going to be a bad time and now we just need to let the brown butter cool so i'm going to transfer it to the bowl of my stand mixer scraping out all of the delicious toasty milk solids you don't want to leave anything behind and we'll just set this aside to cool down to about room temperature i let the brown butter hang out in the refrigerator for about 20 minutes stopping every five minutes to stir it just to speed up that cooling process a bit and you can see the texture here it's thickened up considerably it's still totally loose and runny i mean it's similar to like a yogurt at this point but you can see the beautiful brown butter flecks all mixed throughout this i'm loving the way that this is looking and with the texture like this i think it's going to mix in really easily with the cream cheese so with that let's get to assembling the frosting so adding in two blocks of room temperature cream cheese so we need to beat this with the paddle attachment just to get everything evenly incorporated and smooth i'm going to use my scraper beater because this speeds up the process considerably and does a better job getting everything incorporated so i'm going to slot this on here and get this cranked over medium speed and now that it's broken down a little bit i'm going to crank it up to medium high so that was just a quick 30 seconds i'm gonna do a quick stop and scrape here just to make sure that any of those bits creeping up the edges get knocked back down so that was another 30 seconds you can see the texture here is looking really nice and light and smooth i'll give it one final 30 seconds all right perfect so there's just a minute and a half of mixing it came together super fast but look at this gorgeous texture it is super light and fluffy it's all evenly incorporated i'm loving the way this looks already and i'm adding in a generous two finger pinch of kosher salt and then we're also pouring in our powdered sugar this is a brand new bag of powdered sugar for me so it's lump free but if your powdered sugar happens to be lumpy by all means go ahead and sift that ahead of time just get those lumps broken apart i'm going to do just a few short pulses on the mixer over low speed just to get things incorporated a bit more gradually after about five pulses the powdered sugar seems pretty much incorporated however i do want to scrape the top of the bowl just to get that little rim of powdered sugar knocked down as well now we're going to crank this up over medium high and beat it for about one minute until this is super light and fluffy all right so that's been a minute wow and check this out one minute of mixing and this is absolutely gorgeous i don't know if it'll show up on camera but we've got some really pretty speckles of brown butter in there i really like the way this looks i really like the way it smells it smells like tangy cream cheese mixed with that nutty brown butter um the the aroma combination is fantastic i've never smelled anything like this before and the final thing we need to add in here is some vanilla beans so i've got some new fresh vanilla beans uh no dryness like i had last time i'm going to score the length of the bean here using firm pressure oops a little too firm maybe so taking the flat side of my knife i'm just going to run this down perfect so with the vanilla beans in there we're just gonna beat this to get those evenly incorporated that was just a quick 30 seconds but i think that was enough to get the vanilla beans evenly distributed and this is the end result it looks beautiful because we've got brown specks from the brown butter and little black specks from the vanilla bean so there's a lot of visual interest in here alongside that creamy white icing i cannot wait to use this on my carrot cake and if you want to see how that goes check out this video here or for other fun recipe videos check out these thank you so much for watching i'll see you next time", "ZZKlGiwQWjY": "hey guys it's ho taboo from bdo herb and we're going to go through today the history of grinders tier list now just as a reminder at bdo hub we have all this data that we've collected from basically you the players and we've tiered everything we've literally looked at who does the best and who does well quite frankly the worst in every location based on your data so have a look over there if you want to find out more so let's have a talk about historia where is it it's in the valencia desert same zachman and how did you get there you see the portal spawn you just click on it and you'll go in now keep in mind the portals could also take you to ackman so bear that in mind your entry levels we're going to say about 241 ap and 290 dp with the kutum now keep in mind it's always better to be above these the higher you are the better it is now notable drops i have taken off the tongue grad earring even though you can get the pieces for it that you can put it together which is 70 ml but the main ones are the tundra necklace which you're looking at 130 to 140 million the trash is obviously 15k each black magic crystals are about four to five mil and also you have the scrolls of ancient language which are two mil but obviously you could put these together to make the scrolls to get your memory fragments if you'd like so these are the notable drops now it is also worth saying that this is one of the better places if you want to spend your address so that's worth taking into consideration when you're grinding here so anyway let's have a look at how we're going to do this the tiers that we set it out and there's more information over at the website we've got the loot numbers there you can see for instance d would be with a normal loot scroll with no address is to get less than 3750 within that hour now it was also worth noting if you see an icon in color that means it's awakening if it's black and white it's succession just to help us put our list together so let's jump straight in and have a look at it i've changed the table around slightly our s2 is going to take up two levels and that's because for some strange reason history has some pretty balanced numbers at the top end but we'll get to that so at our bottom tier our d to after these guys are not doing so well here you have the awakened berserker you have the awakened wizard and you have the shy for some strange reason these guys just aren't pulling their good numbers here yes it is a shame but we all know these guys can do better elsewhere but yes for history probably not the best to take these into this location there are better places to go so let's move on to our seat here our seater is a little bit larger we have our 3750 to 4200 we have our awakened muso we have our archer succession warrior succession tamer awakened tamer and awakened dk again these guys aren't doing so well and definitely below what we'd say the averages for this area especially compared to other classes going forward so let's have a look now at the middle of the pack and we're starting to look at our b tiers going on so for our beta we have our succession mooses our awaken witch our succession dk's succession guardians awaken rangers awaken lands and awaken warriors now don't get me wrong these guys can do quite well here but just we're talking about looking at the general average of what people are getting all the higher end of like these brackets that we've put on but yeah this is where we're sort of looking thus far yeah the middle of the pack but we're really going to get into the better numbers as we progress onwards so let's look at our a tier our eight is we have the awaken valkyrie we have the succession ranger we have the awakened guardian the awakened ninja and the succession berserker now these guys are starting to pull some pretty nice numbers here now what you'll sort of see when we're going through this from pretty much from here up to the ester this is getting quite marginal there is not massive leaps between really where we have the 80 and some of the people in the s even though we do have the a plus here between but as you can see we've got quite a small bracket here now this is just looking at all the data it was trying so hard to get this bell-shaped curve but it just wasn't happening but these are the top performers and you'll sort of see now why i said the numbers are a lot more balanced than what we originally thought going forward but anyway let's look at now our penultimate best here are a pluses i'm sure this won't be a surprise for a lot of you but in our a plus tier we have the awaken sork the awakened mewah the succession lan the awakened mystic the succession mewah and the succession mystic all these are pulling some pretty nice numbers and as you can see the a plus two also not that far off from the 80 it is pretty tight but anyway let's go to our history of grinding gods this is the s t coming up and there are so many in this section i've had to do it in two so our first half of the st and these aren't in any order just so you're aware let's have a look we have the awakened kuno the succession kuno the succession salk the succession valk and the succession ninja these are all pulling some very big numbers in history but again this is quite close to where the ater is so don't look at this and think oh this is leaps and bounds ahead it's really not it's a lot closer than what we've seen in some of the other tiers but yeah these guys are the god tit or the first half of the god to when it comes to history so let's have a look at our second half of the god tier then and for this we have the awakened striker the succession striker the succession witch and the succession wizard now i would like to give a little special mention here to the strikers the strikers are a class which when we went through the numbers and we do keep re-editing these and we're going to put more and more in i promise to keep this up to date these guys have just like shot up out of nowhere and do some crazy grinding these two really are the gods and these are slightly above the rest in the s tier as well but we still kept them in that s t because it's again it's only slightly so yeah it's worth noting now for those looking about the hashashan because i'll make a little comment about that as hopefully i've got this video out on the 16th of september the awakening and succession has came out today now we didn't want to use global labs numbers because at the end of the day we want to see people who are 61 62 grind it with all their gear etc to get some good numbers and we want to get a good spread of numbers in before we put them in so that's why they're not here now what i do promise you within a month i know i've said before we wanted to do these quarterly but now we've obviously got bdo hub here as well we want to do these much more regularly as soon as we have the data on every single tier list we will update it and we will have that in anyway hopefully this has been helpful for you and a bit of informative information that's a tongue twister but yeah take care guys see you soon bye you", "u4mAyuBxdpk": "to all the geeks and nerds out there welcome to a brand new series called mastering the Minecraft and in this series we're going to be taking your questions using some science and getting you some answers and as you can see behind me we're gonna be using my creeper farm in this episode because we are going to be taking the question why doesn't my mob farm work so let's get into this thing and get you some answers this is my creeper farm that I originally designed for Java edition 1.14 and we're currently running 1.15 point one and as you can see this thing still works the creepers are spawning they're falling down and their drops are being collected at the bottom but this video is not about this farm per se this video is about the general mob spawning and how you can fix your farm so it respective of what design you're using these rules will still apply so we just use this as an example to get things going so this is the farm and this is what I showed in my video and there'll be a link in the description if you want to see that video and learn how to build this thing but yeah before we get on to this thing let's talk about this question so I get a lot of comments about this question so let's take a look and by question of course I mean the comments section so here are a few examples of some comments I've received about this farm and if you were to just look at the comment section you would be led to believe that this farm doesn't work well here is a video of me showing you it literally working so I'm going to assume that these players have built the phone correctly obviously when there's a tutorial you need to make sure you follow it but let's assume that it's the book correctly but what else might be affecting this farm it could be the location it could be the server setup it could be other players on the server there's a bunch of things and we're gonna be talking about that in this episode so before we get onto that what we need to do now is we need to run this farm and get the rates of how many and the drops we get per hour in its current location because I've built this farm low down in a world I've build it inside a perimeter so this is ideal location so these this is the best rates you'll get from this farm design so let's get that running and yeah see what the rates are like to help us in this tutorial series I'm going to use a few mods that can help us demonstrate various aspects of the game and the first mod we're going to talk about is carpet mod there'll be links in the description as usual so there is a feature in carpet mod where we can count items that go into a hopper and what you do is you run the hopper into some wool and you can count the wall based on its color so there is some lime wool and we are counting the drops so if I hold down my at my top screen you can see there there's a third law Dallas's lime and that they are the rate so we could see how many per hour we're currently getting and how many we've collected in total so we've Carly's collected since I'll turn this on three minutes ago we currently got seven hundred and eighty eight hundred gunpowder and our current rate is around fifteen thousand per hour but so we need to leave this running for a good length of time if you can leave it running for around ten hours that's that's the best thing to do to get more accurate numbers I'm just gonna do it for an hour but I'm not gonna wait here for an hour because there is another feature of carpet mod where we can speed up the game and make it run as fast as possible and to do that we're going to use the tick command so go tick whoop and we're going to use this number right here and that is an hour so now the game runs as fast as possible and you can see these creepers are really shooting around so I'm going to get onto my FK spot and we're going to leave this running for an hour and you can see the time is now we're moving up quite quickly now we'll come back once an hour has elapsed and see how many drops we got in that time our tick wall has just finished and you can see from the from the numbers there our rates are around thirteen thousand one hundred and eighty I'm gonna say so that is the number that we're gonna take as our baseline and yeah that's that is that that's probably the fastest rate you'll get from this farm because it's currently in this ideal location as I said before so we're going to do now is we're going to do various experiments we're going to move this farm around we're going to change aspects of the world and see how that affects our rates and see if we can recreate some of the issues that some players have had in the comment section but before we do that we need to talk about some ops spawning and explain how it works first of all we're going to talk about where mobs can spawn now this part isn't strictly necessary because we already have a mod farm ready to go but so for completeness I thought I'd cover it right here now in this section I'm gonna skip a few of the finer details of mobs spawning but if you're interested in that kind of thing then check out episodes 10 and 11 of the second minecraft which is also on my channel where myself and methods from Sai Croft go over a whole bunch of stuff but yet to give you the the brief overview generally speaking for mobster spawn they need a light level of 7 or below now of course for all of this stuff there are some exceptions but for general mobs that's that that's the light level and also they need a solid top surface so all of these blocks are spoonable they are all have a solid surface it's all on the top of the block and so that's why this love is here and also it needs to be opaque so we can't see through it you know from the top like that so there we go so they're all these blocks are spawn a ball and over here we have some blocks nons burnable so these these don't follow that those those same rules so here we have blocks so all of the redstone components mobs can't spawn on those here we have a lower slab mobile Scott's one of those here we have some other blocks they don't have a solid top surface these blocks here are not opaque they are transparent also we have water now for general blobs they won't spawn in water but of course we have some exceptions we have the drown and Guardians that will also have these other blocks that mobs won't spawn on there's an exception for bedrock that is a solid surface a toilet solid top surface but mobs won't spawn on top of that that is a special case and some other examples here and also at the end here we have these two entities mobs will not spawn inside other entities so that is something to consider as well now the next thing is to talk about is where in the world they will spawn around the player so if I'm over here on my afk spot let's talk about where their mobs will spawn in relation to a player imagine a sphere with a radius of 128 blocks well that's quite hard to imagine but good thing is you don't need to imagine I can show you it like this so this is using a mod so called mini HUD and there'll be links in the description and this is the spawning sphere around a player so I'm on my f K spot and this sphere is centered on me and as I said this is a radius of 128 blocks so mobs can spawn anywhere inside this inside the sphere as long as there is a block for them to spawn on and we talked about a bit more details about that in a second but the other sphere you need to know about is that mobs will not spawn within 24 blocks of the player and that's in a spherical shape so 24 block radius around the play of mobs will not spawn so that's why my afk spot is right here it's more than 24 blocks away from there from the farm but of course the farm is inside the spawning sphere itself and that's how we control mobs and get them to only spawn inside our farm the next question to answer is why is it important for our mob farms to be built and slowed down in a world as possible well that comes down to the spawning algorithm and how this works so let's talk about that so the way that mobs are spawned is that the game will pick a random X and Zed coordinate and then it will look in that column of blocks all the way up until it gets to the highest block in that column so let's say it picks this block right here for example and then it will look all the way up and the highest block in this column is this glass block in this column right here is this top top concrete block and in this column right here it's actually this piece of string this counts as the highest block so it's any block in the game then what the game will do is it will pick a random block anywhere from y1 all the way up to the highest block so let's say for example it takes this block right here it will then try to spawn a mob and that's called a spawning attempt now what happens is there is a chance for a spawning attempt to fail and that that chance of failure increases the higher you go so if you have mobs trying to spawn low down their world they're much more likely to succeed and as you get higher and higher in a world they're much more likely to fail and so it's not that mobs spawn at the bottom of the world and then work the way up it's more that so they have a higher chance of success when it comes to spawning a lower down they are the next thing to discuss is this roof why is it extended around the farm what is its purpose well it serves two purposes the first purpose is to keep it dark inside to this ball it's extended enough to block out the sunlight now I've got a night vision potion on so I can see inside but if I didn't it would be black inside and of course we know that mobs need a light level of 7 or below to spawn now the other thing it does is it encourages packs spawning now when mobs spawn there they're unlikely to spawn just one at a time you'll see them spawn in a pack so if we look here let's see if we can see some mob spawning and hopefully we'll see a pack spawn all at the same time rather than one one or two we should see a pack of them hopefully any second now there we go we just saw four four creepers just born all together right at exactly the same time and that is that an example of packs spawning so let's talk about that what it is and how it works the first thing to consider when we're talking about pack spawning is the size of the pack now when it comes to creepers and most other mobs their pack size is 4 but so for some mobs they have a lower pack size now you can check out the Minecraft Wiki for details about that but we talk about creepers today so we are dealing with a pack size of 4 so let's say that the game picks this block right here to start spawning but following the rules you've already spoken about once it's done that it will then try and spawn the pack around this first spot so the way it does that it will pick even the X wasn't direction and then it will move out up to 5 blocks so let's take for example this way and we go 1 2 3 4 for example and then it will go in the upper in the other direction up to 5 blocks again so in this case we're going to go 1 2 3 so here and it will spawn another mob and will then do that two more times so let's go to this one and then over to this one and so that's how you get a pack of force mobs all spawn it together in in close proximity now that's how those those form up spawns over there when we just saw them up here but there are some other things to consider which is relevant to the roof over here I have this simple setup which mimics what we have in the farm we have this which is our spawning platform over here we have the roof which is made of bottom slabs so no mobs can spawn on the top and it overhangs the spawning platform by a little bit now let's say for example that the game picks this column here with a green glasses to spawn a mob and that's it before it's going to pick a random y-coordinate all the way up to the highest block in the world which in this case is this block here which is part of our roof so let's say for example that it picks this block right here now these glass blocks imagine that these are air blocks in fact so let's say it picks this air block for right here now of course mobs can't spawn in air but that doesn't stop the packs from spawning and so then what it does is it follows the same rules we said over there so it'll pick a random direction and then it will try and spawn a mob by moving over up to five blocks so let's say that by chance it picks this direction it will move up to five blocks so we've got one two three four maybe two there and it will try and spawn them up which of course it can because that's inside our farm and they are spawning all blocks and then it would continue the pack spawning and so it could in theory spawned three mobs even though the pack started spawning outside we could actually get three mobs inside our farm and so it's beneficial to have this have this roof on the top because then it will increase our spawn rate inside our farm through pack spawning so what would happen if you dug a hole in the ground just big enough for this farm to fit inside it but you didn't have the air blocks around it and you didn't have the roof on the top well we have this little mini setup here to kind of demonstrate so imagine this is our farm in the center you've dug this hole all the way down to bedrock and so what would happen is if one of these blocks around the outside was selected for pack spawning what would happen is the pack spoon will actually be canceled because there is a solid block right here at feet level so when you're building these farms you should always have air blocks around the outside so you can benefit from the pack spawning so if you are building a farm where you want to enclose it to keep the light out it's best to use blocks that are not solid so stair blocks are a good a good alternative they block the light but they won't stop the pack from spawning so that is one little tip but let's let's give that a test so we can mimic that we can mimic this farm being built inside inside a big hole in the ground surrounded by rock if we just remove the roof so let's do that and see how that affects the rates I'm back at my F casebook and all I've done is I've removed the roof from the top and as you can see I've reset our lime counter so we're back to zero and now I'm going to tick this this is a farm for another hour and see how this affects the rates of our farm our tick walk has finished so let's check out the rates now I also should have said that they also made it a turn on night time so we don't have the issue of light getting into the farm it's still pitch black in there but let's look at the rates so look at that 5256 that is a massive drop when we had the roof in place we had thirteen thousand one hundred and eighty so a huge drop in rates just by removing the roof so that's because we're not having the the benefit of the pack spooling around the outside so you might see that in your world if you build this really inside the rock and you've got Rock coming right up against this farm they definitely gonna affect your rates so one tip to improve things is to try and dig out air blocks all the way around so up to 15 blocks out is what I do with the roof so 15 in each direction around the farm and also make sure you got the roof in place at that level where we had it and then you don't have any air blocks above it because as I said before it goes the spawning algorithm will go up to the highest block in the world and if you've got a load of blocks above it then that will also affect your rate so you do need a quite a big hole to fit this farm in but it's well worth it in terms of getting those rates as high as possible now it's time for the next test and where are we well we are up at build limit so far and place a block up here you'll see I am at build limit so and this is a test to confirm what we spoke about earlier about making sure the farm is as built as low down the world as possible so there's no other blocks around us from ups to spawning we don't worry about any of that kind of stuff so we've basically inside a perimeter but we are just higher up in the world we are in fact directly above the farm originally so there is the farm over there that is a backup that has the roof still intact so let's see what this has what this does to the spawn rate so I've got my FK spot which is exactly and right in the same place so this farm is exactly the same just higher up in the world all the way up so let's see what this does let's do our tick walk for an hour and see what i'v rates are like the tick walk is complete so let's check out the rates look at that eighteen hundred and sixty-six per hour that is a huge drop from the from the original which was thirteen thousand one hundred and eighty and don't forget the original is right down there this is exactly the same coordinates just higher up in the world and that most the most inefficient height so this demonstrates how important it is to build your farmer's load down as possible so there we go now there is one other test in terms of location that I want to test and that is above an ocean here we are above an ocean this is always a popular place for people to build farms so let's see if this is any good so this is that again the same farm but just in a different place now you can see there's a creeper up there the creepers are spawning and falling down but I can already tell but this thing is not working as well because it's not many but let's let's do the test so I want to do two tests here I want to do one with our FK Spock right here in its normal place but also I want to do one with the FK spot right there high up in the sky now we'll talk about why in a minute so let's do these tests and get some numbers and then I'll talk about why that is important our first test is complete from this FK spot right here so let's check the numbers 281 wow it's a big big difference well I didn't quite expect that so we're much lower down than the world we're down at why is 63 I think I said and that's much lower than building up at build height so what is going on here what is the issue with this location well I think it's to do with the afk spot so let's let's try again we've got FK spot all the way up here and see if we get some different numbers as the Sun sets the tick warp has finished we are above the farm and the only difference in this run is where the afk spot is so obviously we're here and our original one is just down there so let's check out the numbers and see how it looks so did we go 5064 I'm going to go with so that that is better much better than before but obviously not as good as when we had our perimeter with the 13,000 180 so still a drop but so better than before so what's going on here what is the difference between this afk spot and the one down there well it's something called the mob cap so what is this thing called the mob cap well as the name implies it is a cap on the number of mobs that will spawn and there are different mob caps for different categories of mobs we're just going to be talking about the hostile mobs today and the mob cap for hostile mobs is 70 per player so in my single-player world as I'm now only 70 mobs will spawn at anyone's so why that is that why is that important well in when we're up there on that afk spot let's see where our spawning sphere is so I can press this button and here is our spawning sphere so as you can see here inside this sphere there are no other blocks that are spawn of all at all apart from the ones inside our farm and that is of course that's what we want we want mobs to be spawning inside our farm now if we change this sphere let's change it so it's on this afk spot as you can see I've moved the spawning sphere to the lower afk spot and there are no islands within inside this spawning sphere there are no blocks that's all apart from the blocks of the farm that is of course except for the blocks that are in this in the ocean and below so we need to remember now that drones can spawn inside inside the ocean so that is going to take up some of the mob cap itself but also underneath we have caves so if we don't do something about the caves they will spawn mobs so there we go there a whole bunch of mobs spawning down here and if they're spawning down here they are not spawning inside our farm and so what could happen here is that if we have lots of swabs spawning down here in these caves filling up the mob cap that means there are no spaces left for other mobs to spawn and that is going to affect our rates and as we've seen that gives us a big drop in numbers we're back over at the perimeter but I've added this box next to the farm because I want to demonstrate what it would look like if you try to light up all the caves around your farm so imagine we built this foam low down in the world like this and we had the space around it for the pack spawning as I said before but oh but you didn't clear out a whole primitive like this you left all the blocks in place but what you did do is you went round and you you lit up all the caves in this 128 blocks fear but maybe you missed a cow so let's say this is gonna kind of simulate having a cave or two that you missed that you didn't lights up what would that do to the farm rates how idea affect things so I've got it in but the gaming peaceful at the moment so let's turn that back on to normal so let's let's do this go over to here and I've been playing it on normal back and we should start seeing some mob spawning there we go so there's our doc box right there and we should be seeing some mob spawn over here too so I've reset our timer so our counter should I say your lime is down to zero so let's tick walk this again for another hour and see what this dark room has a does to our farm the hour is up and our dark room still has mobs in it and our farm is still spawning creepers but not as much as before so let's look at the numbers let's see how we did so there we go 6417 we're going to go with so that is about half what we had before when we had the perfect perimeter but just having this one little area that is not conditioned so even not lit up or knots or made not non spawn a ball that has drastically affected the rates of this farm even though it's right down in the world and yeah with all the other bits and pieces we've spoken about so this could be a cave that you've forgotten to light up or it could be something from the surface yes so that is a big issue so make sure you condition the area properly that is a big big deal and also should mention before I run that test I removed the farm that was above it that we did for our sky our sky limit test now that would also affect the farm so if you've got any blocks above your farm don't forget that he's definitely going to affect your rates as well because as we said before with the spawning the game will try and be any block up to the highest block so it may start picking blocks but above your farm and try and spawn mobs there and of course there won't be anything for it to spawn on so yet make sure you don't have any blocks at all above your farm now the next thing to talk about is servers what happens if you play on a server with other people how does that affect things so of course we mentioned that a mob cap is 17 per player but so yeah if you add some more place to the world how does that affect things let me introduce you to a slaw jerk he is my alter ego and yeah here he is over here and I've added the spawning sphere around ace logic so this is his spawning sphere this is where mobs can spawn and as you can see where we're still in it and the close to the perimeter just to give you this idea of this cross-section so here you can see all the caves and this is where mobs can potentially spawn in fact we've got some over there already so mobs are spawning inside this cave filling up the mob cap and yeah that is gonna affect the farm so even if I've got my farm inside a perimeter and everything is totally perfect if there are other players on the server loading other areas and they are loading mobs then that means those mobs are filling up the mob cap and that means that that will affect how many mobs can spawn inside my farm so let's do a test so I can summon another player and we can do some experiments with multiple players on a server I've moved away from the perimeter out into the open but I'm all by myself and but before I yeah I summon a friend in and let me show you one more thing so if I look at my tab screen the second line down that shows us the mob caps for the different categories of mobs in the game so for today we all need to look at the first two numbers that they they are around the hostile mob cap so the second number the red 70 that is the mob cap so there's one player that's me and it's 70 mobs so only 70 moms can spawn in this world now the first the first number the 73 that is the the total number of mobs in the in the world so far so the 71 now 73 so that fluctuates a little bit sometimes goes over the mob cap a little bit not to worry about that just yet we can talk about that in a future episode but what we need to do now is we need to summit in a friend so we can raise our mob cap as well so cop it mod has a feature where you can summon in another player though Steve is one of those so that's someone in Steve hey Steve how you doing so here he is he's another player he operates just like another player would do in the game now if I look at that I'll tap screen again we still have a mob cap of 70 even though there's two players and it's supposed to be 70 per person well because we're in the same chunk it stays at 70 now as I move away from Steve you should see that that number should grow and should go higher and higher the further and further away that I go so eventually it will get to 140 which is to play a mob cap though I'm going to go although back to the all the way back to the perimeter and then we can see our mob cap in full I'm back at the perimeter and Steve is over there in that direction and as you can see from my tab screen the mob cap for us now is a hundred and forty because we're far enough away from each other so imagine this is a server with other people playing on the server and they are around and they are in areas that aren't condition to talk so mobs can spawn and as you can see from the first number Steve is filling that mob gap so even though I am in a Riveter with perfect conditions my mob farm is built perfectly at the bottom of the world with with our roof we've packed spawn and all this kind of stuff we've already spoken about Stevie's over there ruining the whole thing so what I'm going to do is as you can see I don't think we're going to get much out of this but let's run this anyway for completeness let's run this farm for an hour and see how many how many spawns we actually get the test is complete so let's take a look at the numbers there's a few creepers still spawning and we got 611 wow that is a massive drop so we're losing some fruit like twelve and a half thousand drops from the original 13 just over 13,000 that is a huge drop and the only for it really is that there's a player online just one player online in an area that hasn't has been no conditioned and so they are filling up the mob cap and that is stopping mob spawning inside our farm now of course you can imagine that if you combine some of these things together that we've tested today so maybe some players online if you're on a server plus if you build this farm a higher up in the world plus if you've got some other spawning spaces around your farm or if you've got the air play spot it's likely the wrong place so those things can all combine to make this farm not produce much not many items at all and of course when I say this farm what I actually mean is any farm this farm is just being used for demonstration purposes this is just how minecraft works just how the mobs spawning algorithm works so any farm design will suffer from the same the same things as well so we've got a few things to finish up on so let's talk about the last few bits and pieces before we say goodbye as we're on the subject of service it's important to mention so that this design and all of the stuff we talked about today is all about Java edition in particular 1.15 and above so yeah if you're on something different if you're running spigot or paper that kind of stuff then although that's based on Java they have some different configurations they might have some plugins they can change how the game operates and so some of these things may not be the same and that may well affect your farm as well so that's something to consider if you're not sure what you're running then speak to your server admin and see if they can help you out if you do have some issues the other thing to mention of course is as I said this is Java edition so if you're on bedrock then all of this stuff doesn't apply to you because bedrock works totally differently with mob spawning there's a whole bunch of different rules that I don't know about but so if you check out sonnet Whisperer on YouTube I'll stick a link to his channel on the in the description he's got a bunch of videos all about bedrock and farms and how they work so definitely check him out but yeah if you're a better player then this stuff is not really applicable to you so my advice is if you find the tutorials online on YouTube or whatnot check in the description check the title make sure that it is for your version of the game before you build it and just in case because you know it may not work and also check out the check out the comments see what other people are saying before you go ahead and build a farm so there we have it the first episode of mastering minecraft is out and yeah I hope you enjoyed it I hope you found it useful now these episodes are going to come out as and when not gonna be on a schedule so yeah if you've got any suggestions for questions you'd like to ask for me to investigate and get you some answers then stick them in the comments I'm definitely looking out for those so yeah I hope you enjoyed it

will see you later [Music] you", "_SIsg-tmJ0Q": "welcome to outlaw woodworking today i decided to switch things up and we're gonna we're gonna give a little bit more of an in-depth review of the split fire 22 60. i'll list it right here i think that's a model number but this is our our wood splitter that we got not too long ago and i've been using it a lot and today i'm gonna i'm gonna do a little more in-depth review of it and yeah let's get started i'll tell you what i think right off the bat i can tell you that i love the split fire it's a 2265 i believe um but it's the best it's i'm so happy that i bought this uh this wood splitter um right here i'm i've got this giant tree that i've piled up but i don't i'm getting ready to haul it off to the landfill and i want to get as much fire good firewood out of it as possible before i do i don't want to i don't want it to go to waste so i basically pull out the split fire and start splitting it up yeah right here i've got my tool cat and the split fire and i'm basically splitting all this wood and you can see the double action of this split fire is i i can't imagine having one having a splitter that only goes one way the dual action is just amazing um this is actually a small um small unit they make a lot bigger units but for me i thought this was good enough and i put some big logs in here um you'll see it coming up but i ended up um yeah i i i split some really big logs like probably um 18 24 inches in diameter and a couple times i thought it was going to stop it but it did it ended up it went right through it anyway um [Music] yeah what are my thoughts on the spitfire log splitter i think it's probably the best log splitter ever made the the founder of this particular log splitter was actually the inventor of the dual split you know a lot of a lot of people have copied his dual split technology but that that little dual split thing to me is the best and you know originally i wasn't going to buy anything made i wanted to only buy in america but i really couldn't find one that was as good a quality as this split fire and it's made in canada and you know those canadians they're they're just like americans so i kind of i didn't feel that bad about it right here you can see i bring my excavator over and pick up some logs and cut them i don't for some reason my back gets really sore bending over cutting with the chainsaw um that just always bothered me but um that's the nice thing about the escavator you can just lift stuff up and just come out and just cut it this this uh chainsaw that i'm using actually i'm pretty happy with it it's a husqvarna 445 it's kind of a homeowner chainsaw but i've had really good luck with it i'm actually going to buy another one and right here you can see i start chopping these big logs some of them are a pretty big dimension but this split fire um 2265 i think it is i'm sure someone will correct me about that but uh it it really it never stopped i ordered it with the honda motor i just you know as a young guy i i had good luck with of course i'm 60 now but i when i was young you know honda man those things never quit you know i had a honda mini bike i had a honda 50 a honda 70 on a 125 and they just never i never had one breakdown so i thought you know when i ordered this i'm gonna order it with the honda motor and that's what i did right here i found i decided on this spot right here i'm going to start stockpiling firewood in this spot because it's a sunny spot and it'll be a good spot for me to let the firewood dry out right there right here i bring down a few more logs and i just keep i i decided today i was just gonna i was just gonna work on wood firewood so i just start cutting up a lot of logs that i know i know i'm not going to mill them because they're either crooked or they're just not worth milling so i start cutting up quite a few that that i know are going to be in that territory these are pretty big they're like 18 inch diameter i love that the excavator can lift them up at the height so i don't have to bend over too far i i really have a bat back and and i have to be careful right here this one sucks because i'm bending over cutting right cutting through that same with this one the fireplace that i burn wooden is pretty small so i i tend to um split them up and pretty it's pretty small pieces right here you can see look how good that um it's a little hydraulic log lifter man that thing works good i don't always use it but sometimes i start getting tired and my back gets sore so i'll start i'll start using a little more than i normally would and the tool cat you know i'm just splitting them throwing them in the tool cat and it's got a 2 000 pound hydraulic dump bed so i mean i don't even you can fill that thing up as much as many times as you want and um it's gonna dump it thanks for watching this episode of the outlaw woodworker working out in the forest chopping wood with the 2265 wood splitter the bobcat e50 excavator the tool cap 5600 the husqvarna 445. anyway thank you very much for watching please subscribe like the video and i will see you next time later [Music]", "jcaqhNlRRB0": "hey I'm Bob and I like to make stuff today we're gonna make a forge [Music] I'm a huge fan of watching blacksmiths work here on YouTube especially the essential craftsman and Alex Steel and I've always wanted to really try it out but I don't have the right stuff I've got an old piece of railroad tie that I can use as an anvil I've got the wrong hammer but it's pretty heavy I don't have a forge so today we're gonna take inspiration from a bunch of other people who have already made simple forges and burners here on YouTube I'm gonna have all those linked down below we're gonna make our own let's get to it basically I just bought a couple of boxes of fire bricks now these are made specifically for really really hot places they're in the back of your fireplace or in a brick oven and so we're gonna use these to first lay out the structure of the forge and then we'll wrap it in steel I've got these pieces stacked up but there's an opening in the back that I need to fill and so I'm gonna take one of these bricks and cut it down and try to make it as tight as possible so it will fit in there and fill up this back then we also have to cut down some stuff on the front I decided that I wanted this three bricks deep I think that should work for one burner going in the top but I also want to have a little shelf on the front of it just to have a little more support for taking things in and out of it so I've got these two side pieces here I'm gonna cut them off and then I can place them as doors just to like keep all the heat on the inside but they'll be easily removed I'm gonna use an angle grinder with a masonry disc on it and it's made for cutting stone and tile you could also just chisel these apart if you really didn't have something like this that you could use [Music] [Music] I've got the pieces in place pushed tightly together in all the different directions and then I took measurements from that so I'm gonna try to make a steel frame out of angle iron that goes around the top and the bottom and then that will sandwich all of the bricks in between it then I'll weld the top frame to the bottom frame and then hopefully that should all hold together as one piece now the bricks themselves won't actually be attached to anything they'll just be held in and kind of pressed inside the frame if I ever need to change one out if it gets broken or whatever I should theoretically be able to pull everything out through the front opening and replace a single brick it's not gonna be easy but it is gonna be possible I have seen a lot of other forges like this that actually have nuts and bolts on them so that you can take the frames apart I think that's a little overkill for what I'm doing so I'm just gonna weld it together [Music] I got all these cut down with the bandsaw and I just made straight cuts I didn't notch these I didn't miter them it doesn't matter in this case you could do this with an angle grinder or even a hacksaw if you've got patience these are just gonna overlap here on the corners and I'm just going to weld them together they don't even need to really sit against that but I want to make sure that they are tight on the sides of the bricks and to do that I'm going to put some clamps and then just squeeze the pieces together and then once I've got them tight I'll tack weld all of these joints take off the clamps and then do full welds [Music] got the two frames made the top and the bottom so now I just need to attach them together so I'm going to lay out the bricks where they're finally gonna be stack the whole thing back up and then just cut some strips to go on the side that I can weld on to connect the two frames together [Music] I decided to use angle iron to lock the corners together and on the inside of this angle iron there's actually a curve down in the corner so I took an angle grinder and beveled this outside corner of the top and the bottom so that this fits really tightly [Music] [Music] [Applause] I've got the back corners welded in and the crosspiece so this back panel won't fall out and then the original plan was to put some pieces here as well but actually everything is held in place pretty well and if I don't put members here that means I can pull these out in case I need to I think that'll make it a lot easier to change out the bricks in the future if needed now if for some odd reason this thing ends up not being stable or whatever I can always just weld in some supports right here but I think I'm actually gonna stop right there for the welding and move on to the next step we've got that Forge pretty much squared away and now it's time to move on to the burner like the Forge I'm not creating anything new I found several videos online of simple ways to make a burner and I'm just gonna kind of pull some of those ideas from different videos I'll have all those videos linked down below if you want to check them out let me show you the parts we're dealing with to connect to the propane I've got this regulator which is a 20 psi regulator which is more psi than you would typically get out of a gas grill so that's kind of important that gets connected by this flare adapter to a ball valve and this is how you'll turn the gas on and off that has another connector that goes to this coupling piece we're gonna work on that one that's important and then the gas is gonna come out of this square tip we're gonna drill a really tiny hole in here and that's gonna be our jet a lot of people will put a MIG welding tip here and you could certainly do that but I'm gonna try it with this this whole assembly is gonna be mounted and go into this pipe this is actually the body of the burner all the flame will happen down here on this end we'll just have to modify this end a little bit but we'll get to that soon these are the three pieces that we're gonna have to modify this is gonna be the nozzle it'll get a hole drilled in it later but this piece is going to hold the nozzle and needs to be mounted right in the center of this so we need to grind some flat sides on this piece and then drill some holes so that we can drive in some set screws and hold that piece in place I just made these little marks so you have a point of reference so I can flatten on this side turn it about 90 degrees flatten on that side and so on I mark the four spots on this one as well and just need to drill holes in from each one of those sides so I'm going to file a small flat spot and that'll give me a place to Center punch and drill the hole [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] I've got the holes drilled in this piece and now I need to tap them I just got a tap that matched the screws that I had I don't think it matters what the size is as long as you have the right tap for the screw now I've got these four retaining screws in place they all turn freely and the point of flattening these sides is so that you can put this piece down in between these screws and then tighten in the screws and they'll hold that in place you can also adjust these two in and out and these two in and out to make sure that this piece is centered within this opening now the last thing to do is to drill a hole for the nozzle the inside of this cap actually has kind of a bald end here and that'll help Center the drill bit I don't want to push hard because I'm using the smallest drill bit that I have and I could probably actually go smaller than this for the jet but this is as far as I can go this is a 1/16 bit so if you have anything smaller than that you might want to try it out [Applause] [Music] almost all the way drilled through this thing before the bit broke so I went back to the store to get another one and they actually didn't have a galvanized version so I got brass instead it actually works better because brass is softer and easier to drill through so we have our nozzle done on this one and I did want to point out something about using galvanized metal in this whole thing when you heat up or grind the galvanized metal it puts off some gases that are not good for you and so we don't want to heat the galvanized piece but luckily this is gonna fit right in here but the heat is all gonna happen down on this end so we don't have to worry about any of that affecting the galvanized piece you can easily swap that out if you can find this fitting in a different metal so now that we've got the nozzle done we're gonna put all these pieces together with teflon tape to make sure that it's nice and sealed up and we're gonna test it for leaks before we use it [Music] [Music] we want to make sure that we check for leaks in all of these connections so first I'm going to take out the tip that I've drilled out and put back in the solid cap with some teflon tape seal up that end and then we can put some soapy water on all these add pressure to the end of it and make sure that nothing is leaking [Music] we're ready to test it now I've got everything taped up and tightened together but I've connected it to the gas so I'm going to go ahead and throw up a disclaimer if you are a kid don't do this don't even think about it without the help of an adult and if you're an adult be really really careful gas is flammable everything from this point on is dangerous you are on your own but be careful okay so we're gonna take this and instead of using soapy water we're just gonna submerge the entire end down in here I've got it opened up so that gas should flow all the way to the end of it and I'm going to turn on the gas and then slowly open the regulator and look for bubbles [Music] so you can see right down here I've got some coming out of the tip but that tip piece is gonna be replaced so that doesn't actually really matter because once I put the nozzle in there that'll change we've also got one coming out right here where the hose is attached to the flare so I might take this piece off and try it again [Music] all right we've got the pressure back on the regulator open and I don't see any bubbles coming out of the top so I think we are good to go out and test it [Music] now it's time to mount the burner in the forge itself now I thought about coming in from the top because that's the way I've seen most of them before but because this particular forge is wider than it is tall making it coming from the top heats up a lot of the vertical space so instead I think I'm going to come in from the side and as long as we put it back about right here we should have plenty of room in there to put something in the Forge and still have room enough for it to get heated all the way so I'm gonna start by drilling a hole in this brick right here I've got a really cheap hole saw this is not made for brick but this is eight dollars instead of $30 for the masonry ones so even if this is a one-time use only this will save me a lot of money so I'm going to start by drilling a hole right here it's probably slightly too small so we'll drill the hole with this and then kind of ream it out just to make sure that the pipe will fit in [Music] so that kind of worked a little bit but it definitely destroyed the teeth on that pretty quickly and I didn't get all the way through I've also got that dead step bit by dead I mean it was overheated it's not sharp anymore but I think this will actually allow me to get through the material enough that I can come back then with a rasp and actually open it up so we're gonna give this a shot [Music] [Music] all right I've got the hole ready this thing does fit it in and it's a nice tight fit so we don't have a bunch of extra open space around it that's good I will point out that using one of these not made for masonry it's not really worthwhile even though it was a cost savings using an old step bit actually worked pretty well and using a rasp worked the best this is what really did all the work to get the right shape in the right size we did our initial tests with the burner outside just to be safe just in case something were to go wrong we made sure to put the gas source around a brick corner from the actual burner I just wanted to go through it and make sure piece by piece that everything was working and we didn't run into any danger everything actually worked out fine so what we ended up doing was moving the nozzle back as far as it could possibly go and those set screws are actually holding the piece of brass at this point that was the best way to get the best flame that we could get unfortunately it doesn't really show up on camera outside so we're gonna go install this thing in the Forge and then we'll get some video in there I took off the end of this and I'm gonna slide it into the hole that I made I also made a really simple little shelf that's lined up with two sides of the hole just to support this so it's not hanging out and pivoting on the brick itself [Music] it works which is fantastic and the flame looks really good it looks far better in here than it did outside it's very blue so I think it's gonna be plenty hot enough I did notice a couple things while we were testing it though having the burner coming in from the side creates a convection on the inside which may or may not be what you really want when you're doing forging I don't know because I don't have any experience but if you did have it coming in from the top it would put direct heat down below it so if you had a piece of metal in there it's gonna get the most amount of heat we're gonna go ahead and test it as it is but if we need to we can always put more fire bricks in there and set the metal on top of it or we could just set the whole thing on its side that would work as well another thing I wanted to point out is that we are currently testing this inside I've got the ventilation running but if you're gonna use a forge you need to use it in a well-ventilated area for sure I've got this piece of steel we're gonna heat it up and see if we can flatten it out [Music] the middle is definitely red-hot so I'm going to go ahead and pull it out and Hammer it flat with the wrong tools because honestly this is all I've got [Music] it's a tiny spoon [Music] after that initial test I realized that although it worked the forge was not getting hot enough the steel was not getting past kind of a bright red and it needs to get all the way to a yellow and so I looked up some different ways to make it hotter and one of the big things I found was the nozzle so this nozzle that I made by drilling out the hole we're gonna ditch that and I went back and did a little test off camera and use the MIG tip like I mentioned earlier I took the same cap as this one drilled a larger hole and tapped it and then thread it in a point O to five MIG tip we're gonna try that one out I did this one really quickly so it's off-center I can always redo this if I need to and actually use the old one since it's got a center hole and just drill from there [Music] and there it is it is a simple but working for words I'm pretty excited to have this now I have a whole lot to learn about doing some very very basic blacksmithing but I'm looking forward to it now one thing that I would definitely change if I were to do this again is to put the burner in from the top I do think that makes a pretty significant difference being able to focus the heat directly on to the metal now in this case like I said I could always turn it on its side I just won't have this little tray that I made to hold the metal like I mentioned there's going to be a whole bunch of links down in the description of other videos that I watched learning how to build simple forges and simple burners there's tons of variations so be sure to go check those out before you make it and if you do anything like this please be safe we've got tons of other types of project videos for you to check out and if you're not

[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you", "hPArNkc9yKk": "hello again everybody thanks for tuning in now here we're just about to use the five horsepower chop saw to saw the end off of the billet just because that's you know some mig weld and some can we don't need and and some of that end cap that i don't particularly need to include in the blade and we'll flip it around and get the handle end chop the handle and some of the end cap off of this end we're going to leave most of that 1080 material on that end so i can forge a tang out of it and not lose my um heavily patterned material to a tang where you wouldn't see it pretty much anytime you use a saw you're going to have to deburr afterwards but here i'm also kind of checking the ends after i'm grinding to make sure that i don't see any open welds where there there shouldn't be any and i was looking clean at that point so that was good also i'm quickly skimming over the flats of the entire billet just to get rid of any high spots any loose scale so it sits nice and flat and sticks to the magnetic chuck really well on the surface grinder because that's where it is going to go next surface grinder time i'm getting the table going i'm going to adjust the stroke of the table to cover the entire piece going with the stop there moving the table in i'm lowering the head down [Music] these machines are just an absolute joy to have for a bladesmith that does any kind of pattern welding or complex damascus work at all they're just such a labor saver and they get everything so flat and clean just it's a thing of beauty and we just find the surface pretty much like with any machine tool you've got to find the surface carefully at first and then you're going to dial in a feed you can see there's a high spot so i'll take the high spot off real quick on the end there and when i've passed enough of the contact wheel and belt over it i'll dial myself back out off of the piece here i've taken several passes off of both sides i think sixty thousand or eighty thousand off of each side just to make sure i had gotten through the can okay y'all it's about to get real this steel looks really really clean at 120 grit and i should be through all of the can i'm gonna go check etch it and uh and then the next installment will show the the pattern reveal [Music] hopefully it all goes well keep your fingers crossed okay we're going to get a quick glimpse of the pattern going on in this thing i got kind of a gross check etch on it there's a little bit of can left on it but so far so far the welds look really good and uh now i'm going to put it back in the forge and forge the tang and then that'll be the last hot step firing up the little dawn fog style vertical forge well it's made out of 14 inch diameter pipe but uh it's got a smaller heat chamber than my ribbon burner porch i use this one for quick heat ups just for general forging work it doesn't have a digital temp controller like the other bigger welding forge this guy is pretty dang handy for doing a lot of different work now here we are using the top tool over on the power hammer it's just a piece of mild steel the thickness that i want i'm just using it as a pallet or a striking tool to step down [Music] a shoulder into the end of the bar here this is i'm forming first the width of the ricasso the width and thickness of the ricasso of the blade and it's got to have a wide ricasso just because of the the design of the knife so blades about two and a quarter wide and the ricasso will be about one and three quarter wide so i'm using a a half inch thick well i actually went with a 5 8 thick now that i remember um step down tool and you got to do it in a couple steps and kind of alternate between truing up the flats and knocking more step down so you don't try to do too much at once and get some funky result should be just about done here next step is to go over to the guillotine fuller at the peter right anvil and just strike that manually using a six pound sledge and i'm knocking in that double shoulder into the area that i previously stepped down with the top tool to form the shoulders of where the tang will begin that'll give me something to forge up to with the power hammer [Music] got to make sure to take it every take it out every now and then and kind of true up the flats there with a hammer keep it crisp and i reckon it's uh time to go back to the hammer with it here we are using the edges of the dies now to work up to that notch that i just stepped in flipping it flat to continue controlling the thickness to match the ricasso and the heel of the blade just running the hammer slow not hitting too hard it'd be very easy to screw up and just stomp a mud hole in this thing by accident right now and have to go back to uh the drawing board so to speak i used to have a 50 pound little giant for doing this kind of stuff but i sold it last year and then i upgraded to a 250 pound utility hammer you'll see in some of my other videos but i haven't set that up quite yet i have to install it so right now i'm doing all my power hammer work on the big boat right here okay so you can see the the remainder of the check etch pattern there but here's where we forged the end out into a fairly straight tang aaron uh makes pretty straight handles on his boys i think that's what he's got planned for this but i guess you could always modify it if you wanted to so that's a rough forging and then i'm going to put it in the oven to normalize at an exact temperature and then give it a sub critical anneal or two but uh that's all of the forging that will be done later this clip point will be cut off by me after i get the blade softened up i'll band saw it and then surface grind it one more time so here i have roughly profiled the tang out on the grinder blades all nice and softened so i can band saw it easily and uh here i have drawn on a clip grind to cut out the tip is just going to be plain 1080 unless aaron wants to reprofile it down to there that'll be up to him i prefer to conserve the original length but we'll see how it goes anyway next step is to bandsaw that out and this is a 20 inch powermatic model 81 bandsaw i put a jack shaft setup in it and then i also control the three-phase motor with a vfd to get enough speed reduction for sawing metal with it i saw pretty much everything with it wood metal synthetics what have you it's just a great all-around saw and uh as you can see i do a lot of drawing on it and lay out it's kind of a work table as well that's really the nature of flat spaces anywhere in a workshop i'm afraid so that cuts like butter though with an annealed blade and now we have a clip cut out of the piece now we're just gonna of course kind of true up the saw cuts off of that clip and you can see what i mean by when i manually bent it at the end of the forging procedures to make the entire pattern of the blade follow what would be the curved edge of the bowie as well as that edge bar gives the pattern better flow than if you just kind of like cut the pattern and out of a rectangular bar and then let the edge bar run out in the belly of the knife here we're just squaring up some of the inside corners right there on the ricasso and the heel of the blade get it looking nice and crisp back to the surface grinder now we're going to take it down to the finished thickness 340 or 50 thou and nice and clean so that we can get another better quality check etch on it looking forward to that and now we're just wrapping it up here with a 120 grit belt that'll give us a much better etch quality to our check etch than that rough 36 did to begin with so now it's nice and clean down to final thickness and we are ready for the acid bath once more making double sure with the micrometer we're at target thickness little deburring gotta make sure all the corners of everything are nice and friendly before i take it in the house and wash it off with soap and get it into the etch and stuff as an aside this is my first full week of working on this new broadback ironworks 2x72 grinder this thing is amazing you should get yourself one if you're in the market for a grinder it's uh it's super adaptable it flips sideways everything is quick adjust runs very stable and true and smooth and quiet well here we are i got a check etch on it it's not a super high def check etch but i think it'll work for the purposes of demonstrating how the pattern came out there's just some 1080 left at the tip there from the end cap then that mirrored separate edge pattern then those black hex cores with twisted bars in a in a tri-weave pattern and then that top squiggle bar all the way out to the clip you can see where the pattern flow squeezes up where i forged the tang out and this is a a large blade right now it's about 14 inches long 350 thou thick or so and two and a quarter inch wide but the weld just came out perfect i'm very happy about that and now it will be going to aaron wilburn he's going to make a fancy handle for it with some twisted firestorm damascus i make for the fittings he's going to put some mammoth on that i believe and do a frame handle with uh maybe some coloring and maybe some some uh file work spacers i'm not sure it'll all be up to him but i'll i'll post the finished results once we see how that came out but yeah i'm pumped to have done something kind of worthy of the collab because aaron's a really awesome smith thanks for following me this far and i'll post up more when i have more to show", "6WK9GPNBmu4": "hi everyone welcome back to another vlog and this time it's from my in-laws home where my parents-in-laws my youngest brother-in-law and family is living presently it's our ancestral home filled with memories of days we spend or i spend after my marriage so for me being here is something very nostalgic now i had mentioned this earlier too my mother-in-law or our mother-in-law is not someone who waits for her daughter-in-laws to start cooking early in the morning we too wake up early but mom wakes up way more earlier than us hence she starts cooking breakfast before we enter and she has never complained about it normally mom plans the menu for that day she definitely takes our opinion too but we are always happy with the menu as mom doesn't feel to impress morning is usually rice rotis when all gather and this day it was the same with boiled egg curry i have done lots of egg curry recipe videos so not going in detail just give me a glimpse mom had already started to roast grated coconut with shallots i added the rest of the spice mix which included red chili powder turmeric powder coriander powder black pepper powder and garam masala powder [Music] having a hot black tea and some snack is always very refreshing in the morning my co-sister sabine was also with us in the kitchen she is caring and also in her rest period as per her gynec so she was actually helping us in the kitchen apart from the major works [Music] i have prepared boiled egg curry as well as scrambled we normally have either one of these types with rice rotis in the morning for breakfast eggs were already boiled in the pressure cooker meanwhile sabine was cooking rotis and i started for the curry preparation that's some onion being sauteed in hot coconut oil [Music] so you need to cook eggs in a pressure cooker for just one whistle a tip from my mother-in-law remove the hot water in it and add some water that's cold or at room temperature close the pressure cooker and just simply waggle the cooker with bit of force [Applause] and the eggshells could be easily removed some of the shelves would have been completely out already [Music] so now it's complete [Music] high up each egg [Music] to the sauteed onion and tomato adding the ground paste of coconut to make it extra creamy you could add some soaked cashews while grinding the coconut [Music] once the curry boils add the egg pieces let it boil for another minute and the curry is ready this is a very basic egg curry that anyone could prepare [Music] easily we have the friend yard the sides and the back of the house that gets very much untidy with all the leaves falling off from the trees mom says even if we sleep in the morning by the evening time it would be the same with leaves all around this is what i love the best in cleaning i don't know if it's the same for all rather than cleaning inside i love to sleep outside hearing the birds singing getting fresh air and some fresh smell of nature because we do have lots of trees around [Music] trees actually provide shade from the sun but the drawback of having so many trees is the untidiness of the courtyard definitely after cleaning anyone would feel hungry and we were no less and by that time rihanna and armaan woke up [Music] the menu for lunch was vegetable biryani and kadai chicken it's my mother-in-law's recipe and i don't have a recipe done too v3 mom me and sabine started the lunch preparation few minutes after our breakfast for vegetable biryani we used green peas beans carrot cauliflower and such [Music] for kadai chicken we need to fry chicken pieces we have used two kilo chicken pieces so for the marination you'll need around one teaspoon ginger paste 1 tablespoon garlic paste 1 teaspoon turmeric powder 1 tbsp red chili powder salt and around 3 or 4 tablespoons of vinegar mix well add the chicken pieces and marinate for around 15 to 20 minutes for getting that beautiful colors of the vegetables in the biryani mom cooked the vegetables in the beginning for few minutes cauliflower was already put in a mix of hot water and turmeric powder and now along with the other vegetables you need to cook just for 2-3 minutes and then switch off the flame heat some oil for frying the chicken pieces in the same oil the rest of the preparation is done so don't add too much oil that you will have to take out some the flavors of the chicken will be there in the oil so don't let it get wasted chicken pieces needn't be very crispy fry on medium heat till it's just cooked this is soaked cashews that you'll have to make a paste for the kadai chicken [Music] [Music] [Music] after all the chicken pieces are done time to prepare the rest to the same oil add onion for 2 kilo chicken you will need 4 medium size onion that's sliced saute well till it's really soft before adding the next ingredients [Music] don't forget to give a mix in between we sometimes tend to add the other ingredients before the onion is sauteed well and that gives a raw or a sweet taste of the onion while having the dish always cook the onion till it's soft and changes the color a bit to the onion add one teaspoon ginger paste and one tablespoon garlic paste and here again let the osmal go to the kadai chicken you need to add onion that's chopped in large pieces and even capsicum the same size in another pan heat some oil and cook that separate cook for just 3 or 4 minutes and you can take them off they retain the color and you can add it at the end over here to the onion mix add 4 medium sized tomatoes that's thinly sliced add some salt once the tomatoes have become soft add a tablespoon of crushed green chilies and mix well let it cook for 2 minutes that's chicken masala you can use any brand we have used eastern brand around two heap tablespoons [Music] then goes black pepper powder around one and a half teaspoon [Music] now time to add the chicken that was fried earlier mix really well till all the pieces are well blended in the masala it might take only couple of minutes [Music] add some warm water say around 1 cup add crushed kasuri methi or dried fenugreek leaves along with that add the cashew paste and some water [Music] mix for some time and then goes capsicum and onion finally two spoons of soy sauce and some red chili sauce [Music] keep on low flame and cook for just two minutes and then you can switch off the flame vegetable biryani is almost same like preparing any biryani heat some oil and saute onion then goes ginger garlic and green chili paste mix well [Music] cover and let it cook till the raw smell [Music] goes add sliced tomatoes add some salt [Music] when onion and tomatoes have changed the color to a darker shade you need to add the spice powders that's turmeric powder garam masala powder and black pepper powder [Music] mix well [Music] there was some stock left after cooking the vegetables so adding it to the pot [Music] mix well and here i've added curd instead of this you can add thick coconut milk [Music] add some salt and some vinegar add the vegetables and give a mix you don't have to cook the vegetables now it would be done while kept on dum so right now switch off the flame we didn't have coriander leaves which we normally buy from the market hence using this different type which has the same smell of coriander leaves also known as mexican coriander or culantro it has quite a strong smell so don't add too much if you're using this mix well and it's time to layer the rice on top this is cooked rice we normally use for biryani you may use basmati rice after layering some rice pour over 2-3 tbsp of ghee and sprinkle some garam masala powder [Music] finally on top add fried onion cashews and raisins cover place on low heat till the steam comes through the rice [Music] after any major cooking there would be lots of cleaning left and we jointly do it having conversations in between and that actually eases the work sometimes it's really boring when we are alone in the kitchen [Music] we normally eat ghee rice and kadai chicken or vegetable biryani with kadai chicken for weddings and this recipe tastes exactly the same my mother-in-law got the recipe from a lady who is a wife of a chef who cooks at weddings and that's how mom got the recipe and this tastes exactly like wedding kadai chicken so please don't forget to try this out it's really delicious you can have the same with plain rice naan parathas or even rotis [Music] nothing is more satisfying than having a dessert or ice cream after food we all had a good nap after the delicious lunch meal and woke up to a refreshing tea so that ends for today's video and i hope you all enjoyed watching it if so do give a thumbs up so that i know please try the recipes shared and i shall wait for your feedback stay safe everyone see you with another video until then take care bye", "lvDuSN_Y80s": "the Morphy Richards icon deluxe

do this so this is my 5 8 sorby bowl gouge it came with a fingernail grind on it but i modified it a little bit and what i have on there for a grind is 35 degrees off of 90. now let me show you how i come up with that it's a little simple protractor i have it set at 90. so go 10 20 30 and to 35 now that's what i check it with this setting here some people might call that a 55 degree grind my whole life i've measured everything off of 90. so i call it a 35 degree now here's how i check it if i put this down the flute and check it like that it's 35 degrees let me show you on a piece of paper a little bigger here's the same situation that's the grind the dotted line is the flute this is the wings up at the top and that's the line you'll see when you grind it if i put it on that flute line you can see and i bump that you can see i'm on 35 degrees off of the 90. that's how i check it and that's how i grind it now how do i keep it at that and not grind the tool away trying to get there i use one of these it's a very grind simply goes in here and you always need to set this at the same depth from here and the same setting on the grinder and i'll move over there and show you and i'll show you what i use and how i maintain that let me get the camera set up and we'll move over there all right well let's set that protrusion on this i use two inches i have a block here has a camera metal on it too i've got aluminum plate there that's two inches back this one is one and three quarters back and i use that for a different gouge so i'm gonna put it here hold everything up against it and then i lock it down now this needs to be set in a particular spot otherwise you'll change the grind i have marks on here and if i set it to that mark right there which is the one i know it'll be exactly where i want it you're not going to grind your tool away i have a cbn wheel it's always going to be the same the setup is going to be just right if you don't trust that line you could cut a little stick and you could put that in i don't know if i mentioned that's 350 grit cbn this is 80 grit i do reshaping and i like to sharpen my negative rake scrapers on here because it really makes a nice burr the line works good and so does this little stick for a gauge there to put it in position but i've marked the end of this with a sharpie making sure that there's no chips in here and holding this back against there if you rotate the wheel you can see that i've taken all of that sharpie mark off of there i think you can that kind of verifies you have the right angle i don't do that anymore because i trust the line and my setting here so if i can avoid getting in the way i'll show you how i sharpen it i start right off of the radius tip and just swing it down like that not a lot of pressure just a little bit that looks really good now this will be a little more awkward because i if i do it the way i usually do i'll block you [Music] doesn't take much i'm pretty much just laying this against that uh wheel so now i'll start in the middle of that nose you just swing it back and forth like this once i've got that a couple times one complete rotation that way and one this way now if i can hold this still you can see it's quite sharp i have a piece of wood in my lathe let's see how sharp it really is all right this is a piece of english walnut that i had laying around that i almost threw away let me grab my face shield and we'll test this edge that's pretty good i just took about three eighths off of it no hesitation at all now there's not going to be much left of that piece because there's actually a pretty piece of wood it's got some more away that was fun pretty nice shavings they're coming off okay well that's this is not about cutting but it was more about sharpening and i i hope you're able to get something out of that and i was happy to do this sorry it took so long now if you can hang around for a little while i'd like to show you some pictures that viewers have sent me they've asked me about some of the work i've done especially the segment work and i've shared that information and they've taken pictures of what they've done and it's totally amazing and some of them have never done this before dizzy bowls they've done the tumbling blocks they've done all kinds of things and uh another viewer louie has a channel i'll put a link in there he's done the star that i've done so if you can take a little time and go check them out there's only a couple youtubers that that have sent them to me but i would like you to watch those and check them out hope you got something out of this little sharpening that i do this is how i do it certainly not the only way and thanks for watching this will be a short slide show so you may not have time for popcorn these are pictures that some of my viewers have sent me many of them are of things that i have done and they wish to try i'll tell you more about them as we go along here's a real nice emerging bottle this was made by gil vanderbush did a fantastic job i think i like it better than the one i did so this next one is a spear with stars in it it's made by fred dixon he said he's never done anything like this before and wanted to do it after he saw the sphere that i made this next one is a beautiful piece of wild cherry this picture was sent to me by buddy dean so coming up is a piece of black locust turned by dennis beamish on his brand new one-way 2436. this next group of pictures are from fellow youtuber louis bandera his youtube channel is woodworking 220-7 you should check him out he does some really nice work i really like this one here with the little inlaid crosses in there i think it's really nice job there's another view of it there it's really cool then this one coming up here is a little candy dish who doesn't like a candy dish really there's another view of that one with the little plugs inlaid in it and it looks like a cigar ashtray now this one right here he made that after he saw my star bowl and i'm very impressed with what he did there and i'm honored that he liked it enough to go ahead and make one like it really nice job louie here's a few more that he's done and they're really nice there's nice shape nice finish on them and just all in all a very nice job after watching the dizzy bowl that i made last year josh blumenthal made this one this is his very first dizzy bowl i'd say he did a really nice job his work shows a complete understanding of the process and i look forward to seeing even more of this here's a really nice looking segmented bowl it's very interesting looking and here's a little square bowl that he did coming up is one i'm really impressed with after watching my video on how to do your first inside out turning joss emailed and talked about doing a guitar well i would say this was a hundred percent successful just amazing i love it maybe it's because i play a guitar myself these segmented bulls were made by rp eddington but what you're going to see soon is very impressive this is a taurus that he made he emailed me after i made mine and asked a few questions and then he went out and made this first one he's ever made it's totally amazing these pictures are from a fellow youtuber hugh davies from wouldn't it be nice i believe this was his first segmented bowl and it really is nice here's another segmented bowl that he made hugh told me that he was interested in making a tumbling block onto a pen so i sent him a sketch of what i've done and sure enough he's put a tumbling block on a pen that is pretty fine work he also made a dizzy pen that's pretty incredible looking itself pens are real small and pretty precise in making him to come out like this and he's done a fantastic job i'll put a link in the description to his channel check him out he does some really nice work these two were made by charles ridley this is like the star bowl that i made and this one is like the dovetail bowl that i made and he did amazing work on both of them this beautiful dizzy bowl was made by steve middleton it looks fantastic and the choice of wood was perfect these last ones here are from wayne nicolas from leduc alberta i hope you enjoyed watching how i grind my bowl gouge and all the photos i'll put a link to louie and hugh's channel be sure to check them out thanks for watching and until the next time see you later", "MKujUIv9Tss": "in this episode of the leather shop vlog i'm going to make a wrist cuff i'm going to make a black powder rifle sling i'm going to tell you my secret chili recipe did i just say that yeah and a few other things it's gonna be a good show roll the tape [Music] [Music] [Applause] unbelievably tired i've got uh 83 orders in the queue this morning i can't even believe it the weekend just took off and i'm just one man and a badass letter shop on the on the positive news front i got a guy i think is going to work out to assist me with some things he does get this video production um he's he's capable with the computer which is something that i haven't had before i spent a couple hours with this guy over the weekend and we got some things ironed out we're haggling over price and he's figuring out what he wants to charge for his service and i'm figuring out what i can afford and in the meantime he's going to do up a video for me i gave him access to my my video archive and he's going to just do up a video and show me what he thinks he can do he thinks the video should be longer i think he said that this guy's name is jb and jb said that my videos give me maybe 15 minutes and that i have to understand i'm speaking to very specific crowd overall he thinks my videos are are fairly decent so i don't know i'm really excited about this i'm looking forward to it i'm finishing up with a uh a gun sling that i started friday and then i have uh two other people who are going nuts over their wrist cuffs so i got to do that and then i got to get back to the pair of pants that i'm making and get that done i would like to have a deal where i just only do pants you know eastern oregon leather practice limited to hand i'm making a pair of pants for this jb guy and he has a really unique design that he wants with like flared legs and some conchos on the side they're going to be so cool i would like to do more specialty stuff like that but first i got to clean up the backlog one thing at a time i guess you know one order at a time and the backlog does i haven't ever got it down below 40 in the entire history of the business but i'm confident you just got to keep plugging away and work a little bit later and eventually maybe i'll get an assistant in the shop but right now it's just me i look around and try to figure out where i left off when i left the shop on friday i meant to come in here on saturday but instead i ended up doing some things for you know trying to get ready to have a new virtual assistant and that before you know it it was like two o'clock and three o'clock and then it was time to go in the house and make chili my son came over and we made chili delicious chili i make the most bomb-ass jewelry at least this morning that's how it was when i was sitting on the toilet friday really sucked as a a working day every now and then you know you get working on a piece and i just keep [ __ ] it up and and making it again i made this this is a black powdered rifle sling and i made this three times this third one looks pretty good it doesn't have a you know any marks on it that i don't want or anything like that turned out nice these are the two that i [ __ ] up okay this one well that's my pattern see check that out didn't notice it until i dyed it and then this one ended up having like a crazy little smart scratch it doesn't feel like a scratch but when i dyed it it just became very apparent that there was something going on there so i can't send that out also it's freezing in here because i can't get propane because i got to use this little [ __ ] heater which doesn't put out near enough heat to heat my shop just sort of takes the chill off notice the way i have that sitting on top of a cardboard box that's super safe isn't it i thought about that this morning because i hooked the heater up to madame a so i could turn her on from in the house so it would be warm when i got out here and i thought that thing said what if it falls over that box catches on fire and burns my shop down so then i got into this deep thinking you ever get into the deep thinking ain't nobody got time for that ain't nobody where i'm like okay if the shop burns down it's mostly made of cinder block so the only thing that's going to happen is the roof is going to burn up uh all y'all's orders that i'm making are burn up the leather is going to burn up but i'll still have the basic structure in place okay back to this black powder rifle sling i've got the straps cut out i think the straps are 42 inches and in the middle uh another strap attaches so you have some adjustment and i gotta dye this this doesn't have a lot of sanding because it's supposed to look like old school so i got to order uh leather today i'm down to about a half of a shoulder so it'll go together like this and actually more like that sort of like that and then you hang it on your shoulder you put your rifle in there and you go hunting be very very quiet so i like to listen to the rush rimba during the day the problem is and for those of you in other countries rush limbaugh is a an am conservative radio host who pretty much single-handedly saved the am radio if it weren't for rush i don't think we'd have am radio he was that popular 25 million listeners he had the thing is he died two weeks ago and they're they're treating the guy like like he's not dead they're playing reruns of him and mixing his mixing segments of him talking around so it sounds current and he'll have a he has sit in sit-in sit-in people who say sitting in for the great one he's dead you're not sitting i guess you are sitting in for him the whole thing as much as i like rush is just bizarre and i don't i think i'm gonna have to not listen to him anymore and there you have more wisdom from clips on the way [Music] but as long as we're just handing out checks why 1400 bucks where are these numbers coming from okay we're about to wrap this thing up we've got um gotta lace it together okay so this [Music] goes how does this go oh that's right i think it goes in the bottom be easier if i had an actual gun but okay so there are a few different ways to do this the picture on the website shows a crisscross crisscross that's because um it's not going through what do you call this the tongue and so you then you can lace it like that if you're going through the tongue i don't know there's like a probably a hundred different ways to do this that's the completed uh black powder rifle sling okay this is a two inch cuff and i'm gonna need three uh three quarter inch straps two to go across and then one for the cross members and two three quarter inch double bar buckles which i have a [ __ ] ton of i'll tell you why because i accidentally put in the wrong digit when i ordered so i've got like 30 of these and i'm about out of one inch buckles geez i need help now then we always stop by start by uh the edges just nip those off and then we take our sanding block and we sand the corners so they're all [Music] round i'm telling you you don't get this kind of detail when you order china it just doesn't happen and then we just sand we got sansan sands and sometimes when i'm standing i like to stand up and stretch my legs tonight i think is going to be a bar night and i'll tell you why my uh where did my sanding walk i'll tell you why because my wife who wears many hats actually she never wears a hat she's going to go to um for city council meetings because she's the city recorder and while she's at the city council meeting i just hang out at the bar which is right across the street and then she goes to the meeting and she comes back and we enjoy a nice salad and i enjoy six or eight i mean one or two beers and it's just uh it's what we do a lot of people have challenged me on hand sanding because they say oh you don't need to use a hand sander use one of these this is a uh [Music] this is a um [Music] shaves the sides off i don't know what you call it it go like this and it shaves the sides off but it leaves a rough edge an edging tool that's what it's called but i think you just get a nice a nicer edge if you use sandpaper get it all [Music] shiny some of these straps had little imperfections in them that one i got a little aggressive with the dye so this one has a imperfection close to the end so i measured this out i can put a buckle and have plenty of strap left to wrap around simply by making my fold slightly after that imperfection and it's going to get a buckle and it's going to be down like that and you won't ever even see it all right shopcat i gotta work i can't work when you are doing this so i'm gonna have to get okay i'll give you a belly rub in fact not only does she insist on having her belly rub she can actually open some doors she will hang from the doorknob and and get it to slip one direction or the other she can't get into the shop door it's too heavy but she opens the house doors all right thrill seekers it's time to die this gets a die job using tandy i call it honey because it's like a real buttery tan i got it i mix uh regular tan with fifty percent denatured alcohol boat fuel and uh it creates it creates that color so i didn't come up with that color myself because in my world everything is black but that i used to do uh i had a retail client customer who made these bracelets that said they would hand write on there i don't know how they sold them because i thought they were kind of ugly uh god is and then they would be dazzle it and you know god is love god is food got it whatever and they would make thick ones but mostly skinny ones one inch bracelet so they would buy the blanks from me and i would make them these one-inch bracelets about that thick a little a little badder than that and i would make them all like seven inches and i and then she would order some that were eight inches but she would order like 300 of these at a time and i discovered that the only thing worse than having 80 orders in the queue is having one of those orders have 200 items on it [Music] little adam wack or adam wax canning wax it's candy wax you buy it in the canyon aisle at the walmart or you do like i do and send your wife in there to buy it that is if you have an aversion to going into the walmart which i completely do actually i don't really like going into too many public places i don't do safeway because i don't know i i don't like getting greeted 32 times by the time i hit them dairy on the back wall now this is kind of funny watch this alexa grinder on turned out pretty good i think what do you think so we put a little good old adam wax on here yeah that smells like adam wax put some of that on there and see these uh parts here where i got a little hot and heavy with the buffer right here adam wax takes that right off blends it in [Music] followed by a good vigorous rubbing with the shoe shine brush look how shiny that's getting this folks is an edge slicker it's really just a nylon gear or something that they charge you six bucks for probably cost them about 35 cents and it just kind of adds a little shine so you just go like this there's what it looked like before and after see just a little shinier a little bit better i'm gonna finish up the straps and then we will assemble this product [Music] i bet you didn't know this i make the best freaking chili you have ever eaten in your entire life you're thinking no so-and-so makes the best chill of it no no this is the best chili got a little cheese on there a dollop of sour cream so the basically the recipe goes like this you can use beef or turkey or whatever i used um turkey burger oh my god and what you do is you get two tubes of that turkey burger from the grocery outlet store and what i do is i take my pan that i'm going to make my turkey in and murder my my chili in it's about that tall about that big around and i put about an inch of water in the bottom then you take your turkey burger and before you take it out of the plastic you hold it up underneath hot water for just a minute and it will loosen the outer cellophane plastic thing that it's in the bag so you can just twist it slice it with a knife put it in your pot bring that puppy to a boil and that will um pretty quickly you got to play with it with some you know a fork it will um thaw that out and then i have a hamburger smasher it's got a thing that goes like that on the bottom and you smash hamburger with it i don't know where i got it i think my daughter gave it to me smash it all up and that's the end of the work really now if you go into the walmart or send your wife in there they have cans of already cooked beans called chili beans and it comes with like a mixture of red beans kidney beans uh those little white beans it's like four different kinds of beans so i get me like three cans of those and then i get two cans or rather one large can of tomato sauce just plain tomato you know mulched up tomatoes and then i get uh an onion celery oh and a red bell pepper and if you want some color you can do a yellow bell pepper so you chop all that up put it in with your turkey burger two packets of chili seasoning buy a can of chopped jalapeno peppers if you buy the small can just dump the whole can in other words maybe three quarters of a cup of them sliced jalapeno peppers and i pour a little of the juice in there too then let's see what do we do we do some red pepper flakes we do some salt and pepper to taste and if you want like amounts i'm just you know shaking and testing and tasting i can't tell you how many how many tablespoons of this or that salt and pepper to taste i tell you that let's see what else um let that stir and simmer for i don't know maybe 15 or 20 minutes till it gets a little bubbly and then turn it all the way down to six with it on six just stir it every once in a while and now here is the important part okay i like a little vinegar in there but because i poured the whole can of jalapenos in there and and they're sort of in a brine in this case i didn't add vinegar but if you don't want to do the jalapenos you need a little acid content so i would put in a quarter cup of vinegar at least stir that up now you're going to taste and go whoa that is really um actually i kind of like it like that that is really sharp tasting i mean you're like i can taste the vinegar okay here's what you do listen carefully you want to get yourself three quarters of a cup of brown sugar and put the brown sugar in there it will marry with the vinegar and create the most amazing flavor oh fennel seeds like uh maybe three shakes of fennel seeds actually i put the fennel in while the turkey's cooking before i put anything else in it sort of makes it taste like turkey sausage it's just amazing i'm gonna i'm gonna finish this and then we'll get back to the cuff man am i gonna regret that the only thing that would have made it a little bit better would be uh if i had a beer but trying to cut back on the beer because of the extreme amount of adipose tissue which is collected upon my personal being okay so here i've cut all of the members we'll call them and we're going to be using some uh smoky rivets just because i like saying smokey rivets and i think these look really cool they're not they change the name of them they used to be called smokey i think now they're calling them gun metal and then as soon as the libtards get around to taking a look at that they'll change it back to you smokey because you can't have gun metal i mean you have gun metal you just promoting violence right this is all sort of subjective i think that'll work okay then we're gonna take the baby anvil and we're gonna take the rivet and then we're going to take the cap of the rivet that's why these are called double cap and we're going to take the poundo tool that a tap do the same thing on the other side that's the first member [Music] that's the second member now we get a cross member it's very difficult to pick these little rivets up because i have no feeling in this finger all the way to there and about there which is called the carpal tunnel syndrome and so if your name is jonathan and you live in barren wisconsin your cup is on oh [ __ ] it's supposed to be black well as soon as i dyed this black your cuff is on the way i am cooked for the evening folks i am done beautiful people it is uh i'm going to run in and use the facilities and get myself a beer just one beer i'm just craving a beer and i'm going to come back up here out here up here over here oh my god and i just i want to get like four or four more orders done tonight at least i'm feeling good i've been taking uh it's called a building pill it's it's horny goat weed and an oxygen supplement so i have a lot more energy than i normally do it's not affecting you the way it was supposed to but it's supposed to make you older people like us have more energy that's what i was looking for i'll catch you guys later you", "sXU5QvHBAQM": "[Music] we did it again we're back in the kitchen and welcome to everyone that's

it's infusing from the get go and that's that's what we want because it's lemon pepper so over here we have some lemon this is about two big lemon large lemon we already zested it tell them how to zest it because they don't know what you're talking about you can either use a zester or you can use a grater okay so you zested the lemon and you leave it overnight for it to be a bit dehydrated because that's exactly what you want that's right then we have a teaspoon of black pepper garlic powder chicken season and all-purpose seasoning you can also add a little bit of salt but the salt will add after because we do not like to use too much salt so now we're going to add the ingredients to the chicken and we're going to leave to marinate for about three to four hours after which we'll show you guys how we do our lemon pepper chicken wings so like i said we have in this we have the lemon the dehydrated lemon we have one teaspoon of black pepper one teaspoon of garlic powder one teaspoon of hot purple seasoning one teaspoon of chicken seasoning and quarter teaspoon of salt we go easy on the salt so we're just gonna add all these to the chicken and remember it's lemon pepper chicken so you can use two to three large lemon and you can either grind your black pepper medium or small i do not have a grinder so i'm just going to use a small black pepper and we'll go from here so we're just gonna work it in to make sure that all the chicken are equally coated with seasoning this is smelling good definitely what is that pepper smell going in there that's the it's coming from the lemon and the black pepper yeah that's a kind of peppery tropical kind of a smell going here and if you want to add some cayenne pepper to this you could you could add some cayenne pepper to it if you like spicy but we will add it on the side because i do have a baby so we'll add that one this is looking real good it's beautifully coated you know you gotta cover it up and uh leave it to marinade

so we're gonna go and do the flour we have a one and a half cup of flour we're gonna add some black pepper to the flour remember it's lemon pepper chicken so we're gonna add some black pepper to the flour and some salt just less than a quarter teaspoon because the chicken is properly seasoned and we don't want it to be salt so now we're gonna just mix it all in and over here we have a clean empty bowl that we're gonna coat the chicken and put it in okay you're gonna use like an egg base on this after okay you want to coat it with the flour first to get that nice crisp on the outside so now that's done we're gonna add maybe two or three pieces of chicken into the flour and we're gonna just toss it around like this touch it around we're lightly coating it shake off the excess and this is what we want so we lightly coat it put it here lightly coat it shade off shake off the excess flour and we're gonna put it here we're gonna do the same thing until it's done you know the best part about all of this is the preparation you just take your time you let the meat marinate then you add a flour base and then use the egg wash to you know add flavor into it and when this is all done it's

use milk if you choose but i'm using water and we're just gonna mix it to get that wash for the chicken so now we're gonna use one and with the chicken to go into the egg and one to go into the pot so now we're going to take up a few pieces put it in the egg come and zoom in at the people see wash it in the egg shake off that excess egg wash and you're gonna put it in the flower you're gonna lightly coat it and you're gonna shake off the excess and you just drop it in a pot lightly coat it shake off the excess you don't want to move the chicken in the pot before a minute because then you lose that crease that you're aiming for so after the minute you're gonna turn it shake it so it gets loosened so it can literally cook stay tuned and keep watching as we continue with our lemon

i am starting a 1968 f-250 pre-runner build and in front of me here is some equal-length four-wheel drive i-beams uh from a f-250 dana 50 ttb front end so i will post some pictures right now of this and the truck with the roll cage and put in the description a little update on what's going on in this truck because it is a 68f 250. i'm keeping it eight lug and i don't need to worry about smog in california since it's pre-75 so this is a ford but it's getting a gm six liter lq9 4l80 mp205 transfer case the dana 50 front end the dana 70 trust and tab rear end uh big fox three inch coil overs three five front bypasses four four rear bypasses air bumps all around sway bar a harmon racing fuel cell that i custom-made a can for that's about 55 gallons so i'm gonna put that behind the axle and this is a long-term project i did buy the truck in 2012 and i haven't really done much work on it besides the cab cage and a few things so let me post up some pictures here and i'll give you an update on what the project is all right so let me talk about this dana 50 ttb equal link front end it's a little different than most uh other ttb front ends being unequal link plus i've never done one like this so it's a lot of learning experience and there is some gaps on the tube but once it's off of my fixture i will be able to heat it up and hammer those gaps away and then do some overlay plates and you'll never notice all right so here's the dana 50 ttb you can see starting right here is where the factory housing is i cut this since it is going in a 68 f250 i had to extend this area here from the wheel mount so the diff is inside of the frame so your driveline can all clear um i did a truss i only have a shorter break and with these compound bends and angles i did the truss in a two-piece that will weld this grind it smooth do a nice overlay plate same with on this beam i have a two-piece design that i will weld this and then have same thing an overlay plate there i'm running a uniball to mock up the uniball width i have two pieces of 3 16. so the distance between these bigger tabs is two and three quarter the same as my misalignment spacers and on the inside of this inner tab here i cut a piece of plate that fits tight inside the uniball cup on both of these to keep everything centered so passenger side i-beam you can see i had to bend the passenger i-beam to clear this pivot here as it cycles but since it is a four wheel drive ttb i need the axle to be able to still go in here which is why there's this large jog and normally on dana 50 and dana 44 ttb front ends this passenger beam is shorter and it goes up to the pumpkin here only so i'm going equal length so i had to swing the passenger beam in front of the driver's side i-beam to clear everything now you can see there's a diff bolt there fill plug two more diff bolts you can see i had to fit a piece of tubing onto the truss to be able to get to those bolts to bolt everything together all right now here these are the dana 50 factory knuckles drilled this out to run a 5 8 bolt so i can put the heim of the misalignment spacer i also double sheared this tab preheated the knuckles since it is cast welded this gusset on here and then i'll be doing crossover steering just like you would see on a four-wheel drive or two-wheel drive i-beam truck so you won't get bump steer across the entire travel all right now what i use for tempe templates is ram board you can get this at home depot it's nice because it's thick it actually retains the shape so if you bend it that's how i did these gussets here and over there and the truss i used ram board made my three pieces and then taped it together so now what i'll do is i'm going to put a truss gusset from here to the knuckle so now i will uh make that all right now this template here ends up a little bit short in this area so i'm going to trace this template since it fits good here and on the tube to a new piece of ram board so i can fix this in and then draw my angle all right so here's where i'm gonna be doing that gusset that i was just making now you can see if it's in there good there's a little bump there but i'll just fix that in the computer drawing and then it gus it's there now what i've learned is to make the templates as good as possible because it will reduce the amount of grinding and cleanup needed so let's go to the computer and get this thing put in the drawing so we can cut one out all right so now that we're back over to the computer i use a plasma cam program and it allows me to import any bitmap uh photo so i just scan this with my scanner here and i scan it into black and white and then i'll import it so let's get that done right now [Music] all right so as you can see here i got the template scanned in just saved it so now i'm going to import it into my plasma cam program so now it's imported in it's a bunch of little segment segments so now i have to just clean it up basically i just trace it with the program and then it allows me to cut it out a lot easier and then there'll be less cleanup on the actual metal plates [Music] um [Music] all right so there's a template there's a scan now we're gonna get this laid out on the tape on the plate get it cut out and then we could grind and fit it to the beam [Music] you", "YirNv5xOjfM": "so the first thing you'll need to do is take a bowl like this one I put in your shredded paper now if you don't have Frederic paper don't you understand use a newspaper cut it up works just the same and you'll get a really good dough and then basically fill it with hot water this is the kettles just boiled and I'm going to fill it up to the top I might have to add a bit more hot water and then we're going to leave it overnight so here's more boiling water you basically just want it to cover it it's very hot so be very careful now if you don't use hot water that's fine I've made it before using cold water just the hot water really helps break down the the flavors of the paper and hopefully will make a smoother clay anyway so we'll leave that overnight and then we'll come back to it so this has been overnight it's nice and soft it's quite a little water in there I'm going to leave the water in there for now because it'll help pulpit now I'm going to use a hand blender now please ask for permission to use it if you're using your parents or somebody else's and make sure it's a lot this one's quite new quite strong so I'm just going to literally blend it [Music] okay so we have a really lovely squishy mulch now let's talk with a little water in here so I will take this give it a good squeeze over the sink and get the excess water out but this is looking really good and then we'll add the gluing a paste [Music] okay so I've taken out quite a lot of the water in fact look how much water came out that's quite a lot and I've halved the the pulp mainly because I want to do you know different videos showing you the different glue techniques this one's the easiest of them all I'm just going to take some flour this is all-purpose flour there's a matter fit self-raising or not and I'm just going to sprinkle it over the top and I'm gonna mix it all up so this is basically your flour and water mixture because the pop still has quite a lot of water in it you don't have to add extra water I'm also going to add just a tiny bit of salt because I want to keep this over the summer in an airtight container in the fridge and I don't want it going off because it will go up otherwise and then you just mix it up there's no exact science to this you just need to add quite a bit of lemon add quite a lot so you kind of stop feeding it clumping together and feeling as if it's going to stick is actually really nice process this is lovely if you do like being exact I think a very rough measure is something like a one part flour to about three parts of the pulp [Music] and then just see if you can mold it if you can mold it into shapes and it holds its shape then it's probably ready Nick I think that's quite good what do you think that's a little hard so yes so now I'm going to put this into their coat tight container and then when you're ready to use it you have your own DIY shredded paper play so cheap so thrifty so Google and really great to work with and we're doing more projects on red head art with this soon in the meantime you can check out the paper mache fruity bowls that we made previously anyway as always this is your craft basic so this is to help you do other projects in the future and don't forget to Like comment subscribe and hopefully was here and soon did you care bye", "8S5Rftas7G4": "hi everyone today i want to talk about the greatest resource that the apple 3 has outside of the game which is the d3 planner so i'm sure that you most likely have heard of it i have seen it pretty much any build guide uses it to compare setups and show setups including myself and pretty much anyone i know that makes builds and there is also other uses of it which is also for your own character or comparisons for example so it's not just about people making the builds but it can be a really useful tool to optimize your roles to optimize your items optimize your character in many ways and understand how you should proceed and how you should reroll your items maybe what kind of upgrades you could get and all these kind of things so here is the website it's the d3 planner you can just open it by typing d3banner.com and it will give you a good idea here this is developed by riff who is also part of maxwell now with the dvr planner so this is all on our website here and integrated neatly also with our guides so you got everything in one place which is great and here i just loaded a profile for example you can save profiles here you can make whatever build you like you can choose the class you can give it items and then you can save them and you type a name and it will go to my profiles which well are a lot for me because i like making defeat banners it turns out and here you can also save them in folders if you like so for example here i have like season 23 stuff i have maxwell memes you know whatever you can make anything i decided to basically delete most of the old seasonal stuff which is not really useful anymore i've recently updated all my planners it's like 60 or 70 builds or something so they're all on my discord in case you haven't seen that from one of my recent videos but yeah this is where they go here's also the import button so you can just go here and you can actually type your own battle tag for example and you can import your character and like this you have exactly all the rows copied for example we can just do this here and that gives us my goldy age it's missing some items here right now but it will also show you exactly everything like in the game with what item is rerolled all your stats the only thing that defervator can't do is the paragraphs we have to assign those manually so in this case we just put whatever here and then we have our numbers so here i've loaded the gold dh now for my planners and usually i have to standard 5000 paragons everything perfect rolls and 150 all runs 150 gems so this is the the standard that we have for all the maxwell guides so i just use the same here and for example here you can also open the different setups so you can save and load multiple setups for the same build if you like or compare even completely different builds if you want so it doesn't matter you can just you know just copy one of these there's a button here for plus that will make a copy of exactly what you have selected and then for example he has t16 there's solo speeds there's solo in groups although boundies and all this kind of stuff and depending on the build i put a lot of variations here because certain builds are quite useful in a lot of things so it's really nice to have all the different variations in one place instead of having a different planner for every single build and every single variation now if you want to compare some stats for your items for your own character after importing it for example you can do so here either by looking at the damage that you do so for example you just take this dps value here or you can take the actual damage because this one doesn't count attack speed so sometimes it's just about the heat damage and not the actual dps and then you can either look at this by changing something for example we can take this and roll the in cold image to dexterity for example so we have a much worse amulet and you can see that our damage goes down here to 12.5 which previously was 14.2 so this would be a dps source of something like 12 or something it's always good to just pull out the calculator in those cases and then you can do like quick maths uh 40.2 which was the higher roll and then 12.5 so you don't need to do it 100 accurate but here you see yeah it's a 13.6 damage difference so we see that obviously cold damage is much better which makes sense because on a paragon 5k character you have a lot of dexterity and it doesn't matter much how much more you get so obviously something like this is a much better amoled you can also compare it here on the right so there is actually these uh increases per certain amounts of stats so we see this here for example this is basically the ring rolls what you compare here right the six percent crit chance 650 decks 50 crit damage so this is all the stuff you can roll on ring and this is usually where you have a bit of more regular room to change stats around because most other item slots are quite fixed right you always have questions on your braces and christians crit damage on your amulet and the crit chance create damage on your gloves so these don't really vary very much and the only other dps that on a gloss for example is attack speed and then you have area damage which is usually preferred in pushing builds but it doesn't give you any sheet damage increase that is really measurable so area damage has to be calculated separately and you have to understand air damage scaling to really know if it's going to be work for you or not so with area damage in general you can count it as a very valuable role there are actually certain builds where on the ring for example i would go with air damage over critical heat damage or critical h chance for example i've done that for my gr-140 solar monkey clear in season 20. and then there's other builds where air damage just doesn't really do much because well you have maybe like some kind of single target build or you have like some ability that doesn't work well with it or it doesn't work at all or there are simply other bills that are so hungry for cooldown reduction especially like most of crusader builds or most necromancer builds that you simply don't have any slots left to stack area damage but typically i would count one error damage roll as something between five to two let's say twelve percent extra dps depending on how much or how little area damage you have already and how well your build can utilize area damage by making large poles for example so this is just a little bit of a rule of thumb so there is actually kind of a competition between area damage and for example physical damage on rings or attack speed on rings so we can look at that here and we can see that for example a physical damage roll would give us eight percent flat dps which is very nice so you could argue for physical damage there are some more stats you can see here in the planner but they don't really matter very much this is a little bit of like fluff numbers i'd say uh maybe if you compare a lot of different builds you can you know see the patterns a little bit and you get a bit of a better feel but here's for example damage multiplier effective dps all this kind of stuff i never look at that at all so i usually just compare actual roles on the items or compare passive choices or skill choices that buff me in some way and then i see for example this damage value here or the dps value and i see the differences between the setups one thing if you want to compare stats really quickly is you can also just click on these uh headers here and you can collapse it so if you for example just want to compare your life and you want to see for example is vitality or percent life better for my maximum life so you can go here and you can quickly compare it you see our life goes to 987 and here it goes to 992 so live percent is actually better which will also show in the toughness so this scales directly with vitality for example and you can see that here it will be slightly less just as this if you want to compare your character to something like this with the optimal rows you can just pull up my planner for example or the one from maxwell and then you can also just change the paragon to your paragon if you want so let's say you have like some paragon 1.5k character and it will usually always fill everything here already and then you just put the movement speed and you put maybe no vitality because we already have 5k it seems pretty good and then you can just put everything here and you could compare this setup to whatever you have by importing so you can have two tabs open and look at the numbers directly so you see a bit of like the potential that you could still grind up all in one go or you just do it manually so you import a character and then you import it again perhaps and then you start changing your roles from you know whatever is imperfect to better rolls and you can kind of see the differences and see how much you gain you need to know that greater rift tier is a 17 hp multiplier and a 2.3 monster damage multiplier for every tier so it doubles roughly every five tiers and it quadruples roughly every 10 tiers and it's times 10 roughly every 15 tiers so this kind of gives you a bit of like a benchmark to see and how much damage improvement you need to get to the next tier with like the same rift that you have in your personal best already for example and this will maybe help you a bit to understand of what is the next step to do so now if you look at this skills and effects tab you also have to look at the right uh conditions so you can for example decide to include certain things here in stats for example here this strafe bonus would be the gold four piece bonus because that gives you six percent damage reduction you see our toughness changes a lot otherwise strength has no other benefits so if you want to compare damage this doesn't matter same if this you have bladed armor but you can look at the differences and you again see that this blade armor here gives you roughly 26 more toughness or so and you can compare this to for example to the ball companion so we take this and you see you have less toughness this is only like a 15 boost so usually this is the reason why we have played armor in the gold set similarly you have stuff like vengeance for example so this is an actual damage multiplier and this is always up so you want to check that ambush you can kind of compare okay with or without so you have to average it out typically ambush is something like a seven percent dps increase overall color weak same thing 20 multiplier the good thing is that it also will show you what is a multiplier and what is an additive damage buff so i've made a video talking about all those damage multipliers that was a while ago but that is still accurate for i think everything because well this stuff very very rarely changes and you can check that out if you want to learn about you know the overall picture of all the passives and most of the legendaries in the game and then you will see for example what gives you an additive damage boost and for example if you look here on the side for the damage multiplier you will see that this is a multiplier and this is not just an additive damage bonus for example taegook will show up here in the damage increased by skills because this is an additive damage buff this is the same as having air roll on your items and maybe something like the archery passive for bose that is also additive and then for example color week is a multiplier on this gives an effects step you can also decide to include some groupers if you'd like for example if you want to see something like a trash killer or a rift garden killer for groups or something like that here you can select the class and then you can add all the buffs that this class has so here's the age it has audi says end so you can also change that around strong arm braces they stack by the way so you can have multiple supports using those you can put in the oculus ring and all this kind of stuff if you want to add some items or some stats that are not part of your class there's also a button here so you have hide items for other classes for example swamp land waiters has been notorious to be used in many led builds this is not really necessary anymore because black phone's pants got changed to be like swampland waiters now so everyone has easy access to those but for example here when you wanted those pants with the extra elemental damage then you had to do this and also there is high legacy items so there are some items that are from old patches that don't exist anymore but if you want you can add them there and there's also class specific stats for example if you make a support character you might want to roll some strength on the support wizard or something like that for xrt defense and then you can also do this also here on top you have the seasonal selection so we have planners for old seasons for example the grinder season and the season 22 with the fourth cube and all these kind of things so if you want to make any builds for these for whatever reason or you might see those at least then this is here and you can just change it to non-season to have kind of like a basic setup and you can always just you know add something like this and here's the dynamic change you can just add the fourth cube so right now we also in pdr times or right after we already have the new update here so if you click on ptr here on the top you can already see the follower update so in season 23 you have the follower revamp with 14 items equipped on your follower new skills new emanate system and you can find it all here so you have a second tab that goes with your character and those buffs will already be included in your stats so you can see for example here if we look at this four percent crit chance buff here it tells you that the maximum value it gives you and here our demander has 63 right now and you see on the very bottom anatomy four percent so that is already there and for example also stuff like the knights whale will give you 100 crit chance and you can also see that effect in your actual dps so here for example 94 trillion and if we uh remove this then it will go down and you see that discount will buffer by around 50 dps when he pops his knight's whale in the future we are also going to have all these follower setups with the main characters set up together on the maxwell guides so whenever you see those the 3.0 embeds it's going to be there at least for any sort of variation obviously in groups you're not going to have the follower so it's pointless i have there but this is our most recent addition here including all the item changes for the next patch you can also compare those damage numbers for example for elite or for bus so also when you open a planner make sure that you check here if this is like the right stuff and also here in the bottom if you have you know any kind of unwanted buffs so sometimes people might select something there and that will inflate some of the numbers so usually i always have everything disabled and then i have like the generic buffs that are always there or most of the time i have those enabled but for example score is a bit optimistic for example in most cases so yeah there's some stuff you have to look at and see for like the actual values and that's about it so i hope that this video helps you out in case you want to check out planners for yourself or make some for yourself and just in general as i said it's a very good tool to compare your character to someone else you can just import their battle tag or you can also you know import your own character and compare it to the optimum so in short look at the actual dps changes and also look at those quick comparisons between stats if you're unsure about what to roll on your items look at the actual toughness changes and then also make sure that the whole setup is correct so always check the paragon tab and then check you know whatever else you need to activate here and maybe for any kind of support setups and like this you can really find out what works the best for you for example also with those break point tables so for certain skills especially channing skills this is also always something to look at because those break points usually have a lot huge range and you want to make sure that you hit the right one and that's about it for this video so hope you enjoyed this i hope you like it and i'll see you guys next time", "iYZ9OKat9KU": "hey everybody kathy here with paint pouring by kathleen miller welcome back to our channel today i have my 16 by 20 oval canvas down and i put on my forever lilac color which is a new one by sherwin

kind of liking this just like it is phil so that's kathy mentioned this is a primary a secondary swipe so she lay down the primary colors and is going to swipe those and then go back and lay down these very colorful secondary colors and do some additional swipes with those so stay tuned people don't fast forward or anything because you're gonna miss it kathy has her black cell activator which is simply black amsterdam paint and australian floetrol okay phil here we go we're off like a herd of turtles people it should be interesting how this lilac base kind of blends with all the colors you're using it should be shouldn't it it's gonna be something i like the color i love the color yes and i think it's uh once you get the secondary swipe colors on there it's going to be quite it's gonna be magical i'm liking that those prison pores i'm liking them already phil they're showing me what they got they got shine pizzazz sparkle i mean you name it they got it well one thing we know we do have is a new video for this spinner and pool setup so kathy has made that video to show exactly how she sets up her pool both this small one and her large one the spinner how she puts the sticks on there and also the canvases and kathy is just she's in one of her uh there's not even any music going on on your head don't i'm going to add a little bit of this oh boy i wouldn't do that until you well i better wait till i better yes oh boy well that's good i'm good you're in a good mood well you always are when you're painting i know i am okay the secondary colors are being laid down this is mauve pale by arteza somebody's blown again this is watermelon mist by primary elements i wanted to bring a little bit of some joyous happy spring-like colors this is deep purple by blick and if you've never heard me probably use blick it's because i brought this from back home this is an old one that i used to use i used to use a lot of blick paints back home well this paint has to be four or five years old though oh it is if not more if not more you're not going to be used much if you keep dripping like that baby this is quinacridone magenta by golden yeah phil and i are having a pretty good day it was pretty uh nipping here this morning but it's beautiful now it's gonna not be very warm only like i think our high is only like 63 today in arizona so that's pretty cold especially when we've almost been hitting the 90s this is a violet by arteza mixed with metallic purple by artist loft that's that's a nice mixed color there wow yeah that's a pretty color i just didn't like one so i thought uh i'm just gonna dump something else in there so i went on a scavenger hunt came up with that this one is apple rose by primary elements this is really a pretty color too that's another thing kathy shows in her recipe video is mixing not only paints and pigments separately but paints and pigments together in her pouring medium this is permanent blue violet by amsterdam next we have pink lemonade by primary elements and our last one is our dioxazine purple by liquitex that's going to wrap it up for the colors which we have a lot of colors film lots of 15 you used 15 different colors oh boy in this pour leave it to me well like i said i'm the colorful one i like a lot of color a lot of people just like different shades of one color um that's just not me well a few days ago you used two colors in that ghost bloom simply black and white so now you're going to the opposite extreme and using 15 colors but whose idea was that with just the black and white that was your idea phil that was a great idea because it really turned out it was fun it was fun to see what would happen i don't know i had my doubts but then all of a sudden it's like wow i really like this and they turn out really pretty so okay we're moving on now you still have a little split syrup ah it's not gonna okay it's not it's to be covered all right i'm not too worried about it see how it just covered it feel yes you did just right uncovered that puppy look at these colors whoo baby i think this is going to be kind of pretty kathy does have an amazon shop a red bubble shop and an etsy shop and there are links in the description box to all those shops of course her amazon shop has all the different supplies you need for paint pouring her etsy shop has all her original creations for sale and her red bubble shop has merchandise with images of her creations imprinted on them so they're all unique shops that you can go to have some fun clicking around see what's available i'm just standing here smiling just smiling liking this i'm liking this really liking this gonna do a crossing no okay i'm really liking this baby yeah baby who did that bring out some pretty pink it did oh

multi-colored secondary swipe colors it really is a nice contrast it goes well with that base of lilac that's kind of cool to be in there yes kind of cool but i gotta bring this over here now just putting like a little some accent lines touches on yeah just a few like little different touches to see what we're gonna have then i'm gonna wreck it and that'll give us some different touches too i'm just going to do one more over here and then i'm going to wreck because i want to leave that i want to that'll go off anyway so i'm not too worried about that you're going to leave some of the areas unswiped correct some of these beautiful colored areas yep i'm going to leave that unswiped so you have the swiped areas that brought up the cells okay so now i'm putting this back we're gonna wreck and see what we get let's see what we get phil oops we've got the cells which are expanding nicely very colorful there are you getting hoarse phil i think so okay okay doggy i'll do a little bit of the wide end first as you can see the flat end of kathy's wrecking stick will make wider wrecking lines helps tie the different swipes together and she has the pointed end which will make thinner lines more wispy lines to accent those larger lines this is pretty darn cool pretty pretty cool yeah i got a comment the other day um from one of our subscribers and she wanted to know if i had an art degree no i do not have an art degree everything you see is uh self-taught i started out as a jewelry designer had my jewelry at macy's in downtown chicago on state street for about four years and i also did painting in the meantime i was certified in silver i have three certifications in silver i made my own rings my own bracelets my own necklaces um you name it i did it so you kathy's been doing various things for 30 plus years yeah it was a lot of fun i really loved making i'll have to show um some of you well all of you that watch me i'm gonna have to show you some of my uh rings and my glass jewelry that i got into macy's with it was absolutely amazing amazing time for me it was a lot of fun made a lot of great friends and just great memories but all right here we are on with the painting enough about me unless you really want to know more [Laughter] but i thought i'd give you just a little insight on what i did in my spare time okay what do you think phil i think we're ready to go to the next step see what happens you think yes too bad we have to spin it huh it's really pretty well very spinning always does add some other elements to it yes it does okay hear that paint spinning off yes oh oh oh baby oh is this pretty you've got lots of different areas that picked up there's the some of the colors from the primary swipe there and in through here then you're getting into the colors from the secondary swipe there unswiped areas there and as you can see oh you can see some of the sparkle from the prism pores it's much more sparkly in person but it is it's beautiful now here's some another area from the primary swipe colors and software so you get a good mix of the primary and secondary swipe colors all throughout the painting and then you have of course the base the lilac base showing through this is beautiful what do you think phil yes i like it a lot i love this oh my goodness this uh base color of the um forever lilac 9067 is really really pretty and it goes really well with these colors i'm loving this oh i can't wait to see this dry oh man and the line lock really doesn't show through it it's looking bluish well it does with the lights with the lights but but it really is once we show it without the lights when it's finished it's beautiful yeah it's so it's really a pretty pretty lilac color i have it uh this way so i can get yeah that way yep i can get kind of a overall view yeah see with the lights you can't really it looks blue well it looks more lilacky there than it does on the painting well it's from the it's from the light i know sure but it's it's a beautiful color it's just beautiful and like i said you know stay tuned because i have a whole bunch of new colors that i'm going to be painting with um give me a thumbs up if you like this please give me a thumbs up it would really mean a lot to me and it really helps my channel with some thumbs up if you like it thumbs up share it and um please uh subscribe to our channel we'd love to have you join our family we have a lot of fun here um i hope everybody stays safe and healthy and like i always say it's only paint if you don't like what you're creating just scrape it and redo it it's only paint don't get frustrated or really upset you'll get it so until the next time everybody i hope you enjoyed this as much as i enjoyed showing you how to do this and i love all of you and so does phil and we will all see you later alligators bye you", "rlcfmLMdiwY": "welcome to outlaw woodworking today uh we're back out to the the shop build and what recently recently i bought a one foot bucket a brand new one foot bucket and in the process of tearing out or pulling out those three big stumps i i actually lost one of the teeth and i wasn't able to find it but after looking at the teeth on that one foot bucket um it they're pretty worn out already from from digging through those three stumps and and the rocks here the rocks on this lot are really tough so recently i went to my bobcat dealer and they had some of these uh these teeth and i thought well i'm gonna go ahead today is a shitty day it snowed last night so i'm gonna do some maintenance today so we'll go down and we'll get that one book bucket and i'll show you how to replace the teeth on the bucket and also on our two foot bucket the guy i was talking to the guy about rocks and he suggested that i put two of these fork teeth one on the outside like this and then two of these pointed ones on the middle so we're gonna switch up we're gonna change the two foot bucket also and uh yeah something to do on a snowy day so let's get started and these are the pins they use but i'll show you i'll show you how to do it let's get started these type of teeth are really easy you just take a punch and punch out the little expansion pin in the center then you pull off the old one and put the new one on and you can reuse the old pins if they're not in too bad of shape i'm putting in new pins and you just pound them in level with the top these particular teeth you use the bobcat logo facing up i then switch over to the two foot bucket and punch out all these pins and then proceed to put on this these other teeth now these teeth this is a pretty aggressive pattern you got forks on the outside and points on the inside so this should be pretty interesting right after i get these on i'm going to go down here and try this out before the snow starts coming in too heavy if i get too much snow then it's really slippery going down this hill where i go in and out of my property and there you go so right here i go down to the building pad and i start trying out these aggressive teeth and they are really nice i the guy that recommended this i have to thank him it was a really good pattern and it cuts through the rocks really nice so anyway thank you very much for watching outlaw woodworking another as episode of outdoors on the building pad with the excavator and we will see

so i'm actually recording part of that intro right now so i'm going to hang up this phone call for the sake of the video and then i'm going to call you immediately back and we can have a real conversation about this [Music] all right buddy i'll come back to the second fight [Music] so [Music] now [Music] so today i am here at the builder's anonymous shop because they have one of the very first coffee tables that i ever built in their lounge area at this point this project is a few years old now and while i still love the overall design and look of it there are quite a few things that i would do differently if i were to do this project again today and frankly i think that's something that anybody who's pursued any skill or art can appreciate when you look at something you did years ago all you can see are the things that you would do differently today all those lessons that you've learned between now and then just scream out at you so today we are going to be building an updated version of this table for 2021 and i'm going to be imparting to you the viewer a few of the things that i've learned in the past few years about building sound good okay cool let's get out of here and head over to my shop and get to work on this table alrighty we are here at the shop and i think this intro is probably already long enough at this point so let's dive straight into the woodworking and while i'm doing that through the magic of voice over i will share with you a few mistakes i made on that first build and how i've learned to correct them oh also quick side note if you see me holding anything in a weird way it's because i think i might have broken this finger if you look sorry i'm not trying to give you the finger right now but if you look this finger is very swollen compared to the other one i was using a drill and my glove got caught in the drill and it cranked it really hard it's one of those things like i don't really want to go to doctor right now because of covid and they're just going to tell me to take it easy anyways there's nothing they can do for that so just uh if you see me holding a tool weird that's why all right let's get right into it the first and probably the biggest mistake i made on that old table was just not being precise and careful enough with my wood prep when you're working with a repeating pattern like a herringbone pattern even tiny errors can compound across many rows and create big problems so the name of the game here was precision i milled all the wood for this build myself and i took great care to make sure that all my pieces were perfectly straight and all of my right angles were perfect 90s on the old table i was using wood that i got for free and i didn't even bother to check it for square before using it i just ripped it on the table saw and then started gluing it together which was a big mistake and created a lot of small gaps in the pattern after many hours of cutting i had 36 pieces of walnut and maple that were 24 inches long 2 inches wide and 1 inch thick i actually didn't know exactly how many pieces i would need when i first started so i arranged all the pieces into the herringbone pattern as i cut them once i felt like it was big enough i set up for the next stage of this build which was the glue up so we got all these pieces cut and now we're going to start gluing them together but i'm not going to glue them together all at once what i'm actually going to do is get a good three rows of it done really tight at a perfect 90 degrees and then we're gonna use that as the base to glue the rest of them on when it comes to glue ups there's two big lessons i've learned one is be patient and the other is don't bite off more than you can chew and you know now that i say it out loud those might actually kind of be the same thing let's talk patience i started here by making sure i had a really good base that i could build the rest of the pattern off of i was patient keyword there and i spent a lot of time dialing in the first three rows so i know this looks a little crazy but we got a nice tight corner all our seams are well fit together it's perfect 90 so i think this should give us a firm base to build the rest of the table once that base was good i started slowly adding more rows and here's where the whole don't bite off more than you can chew thing comes in i started by trying to do three rows at a time but by the end i was down to doing just two rows per glue up once you apply the wood glue you really only get 20 or 30 minutes before it starts to set and that might sound like a lot of time but when you're trying to set and clamp multiple rows it can start to feel like a race against the clock on the flip side it also means that you don't have to wait that long between glue ups so i do two rows wait 30 minutes and then do another two rows this was a big change from how i did it the first time on the old table i glued up a third of the table at a time so like seven or eight rows at once and then i tried to join those thirds into one whole table trust me that was a nightmare and i never want to do that again in the end doing it two or three rows at a time took a bit longer but it saved me a lot of headache after clamping the last few pieces in place i left the night and gave the glue some time to fully set all right everybody it is day two of this build and day one didn't go exactly the way i would have liked it to have gone well i started the herringbone pattern very tight and precise as i got going with it small errors compounded and the pattern is less perfect than i would like it to be in the last few rows let me show you what i'm talking about if you look through this section here it's all pretty tight barring some very small gaps but then as you get here towards the end you start to see some bigger gaps obviously that's not ideal but there are some things we can do to fix that so let's keep pressing forward this thing is like the size of a dining room table right now so let's go with the track saw and cut this down to a more reasonable size for a coffee table cutting the table down to size was pretty straightforward the hardest thing about it actually was figuring out the midpoint of that herringbone pattern this line here this is the line you want to use anything else will just end up looking unbalanced and weird once i established the center line i was able to pull all of my measurements off of that and figure out the final dimensions with my lines traced i pulled out the track saw and got ready to do some cutting the two short ends of the table got a 30 degree bevel this echoes the original table's design and will play into the table base as well but i'm getting a bit ahead of myself so more on that later oh and make sure you properly set the depth of your saw before you start a cut otherwise you might end up with an awkward moment like this one now i always like to make my tables a bit bigger than their final dimensions so that i can trim them to the exact size i want but i went a bit overboard here and ended up wasting a lot of material on this build each of my individual herringbones was 24 inches long but realistically i probably could have made them 20 and still be fine maybe i'll add not wasting materials to my list of things to improve on for 2022 flattening the tabletop was next up on my list of things to do and while my technique for flattening tables hasn't changed all that much my tools certainly have i'm pretty sure i flattened that old tabletop using nothing but a belt sander a random orbital sander and a healthy dose of pure determination while those tools did do the job they also took an enormous amount of time to do it so in the last couple of years i've invested in some tools to help speed up the process namely some good planes and this big badass drum sander and i think there's an important lesson in there about evaluating tool investment decisions i always look to parts of my process that are painful time consuming or both and then i look for tools that will help with that no one's ever regretted buying the tool that makes the worst part of the job easier not okay so that was a lot of sanding on the drum sander let's do a little bit more sanding with my new duro650 by the way if you guys are at all interested in speeding up your sanding you might want to check out my review of this particular sander it really has cut down on the amount of time i have to spend standing here in the shop which nobody likes to do honestly i don't have a whole lot to say about sanding other than that you should invest in good dust extraction even if it's just a shop vac that you duct tape to your sander it makes for a much nicer sanding experience and helps to keep your whole work area clean okay so that's all sanded 150 grit now and before we go any further with the sanding let's see if we can fill those cracks you know i was really hoping that my herringbone joints would be perfect for the sake of this video but realistically that was probably never gonna happen there's always going to be some teeny tiny gaps between pieces whether you realize it or not and wood filler when used correctly can hide those blemishes i started by using some off-the-shelf walnut wood filler i watered it down a little bit so that it would get into the cracks a bit easier and then when it came to doing the maple i actually had to custom mix my own color i mixed together golden oak a little bit of pure white and a hint of cherry until it matched closely enough to pass i think the most important thing about working with wood fillers is just knowing the limitations of what it can fix and what it can't it's really at its best when it's filling smaller gaps and cracks anyways after a couple passes with the wood filler i sanded the whole table to 220 grit in preparation for the finish okay that stopped sucking and that's looking pretty good is it perfect no it's not perfect if you get right in there you can still see there's a little bit of wood filler but once you get about this far away it's really hard to see that there was ever a gap there all right now that's out of the way let's move on with finishing if you watched my last couple videos you know that i have recently tried odie's oil and i was hoping that it would become a permanent fixture here in the shop it kind of might go too but i'm still doing the durability testing so for this table i'm going to stick to what i know works and that's this seman stain hybrid floor varnish i've been using for a while this stuff is great really easy to use takes two or three coats but it holds up really well when it comes to finishes there's about a million different options to choose from all of them have their pros cons and their own special quirks as well in the past i've always been tempted by new products the excitement of something new is always really alluring to me but there's something to be said for practicing with a specific finish and really getting to know it don't get me wrong i'm not saying you shouldn't experiment and change but i would avoid using new finishes on mission critical work on that original table i actually tried rubio monocoat for the first time and i was never really truly happy with how it turned out it wasn't the fault of the product i just didn't know how to use it properly yet so for this build i applied four coats of my tried and true finish to the top three to the bottom and then i left it to dry overnight or at least so i thought okay so it's been about two weeks since i've last worked on this table and the reason for that is because i was waiting on this package now what's in this package i'm glad you asked i have this here which is a magnetic angle gauge for welding and this guy here which is just a little magnetic block for welding and i think this ties nicely into the theme of trying to do better and learning from your mistakes because in the past when i was working on this table actually that last table i did was the first thing i ever welded and as a result i didn't really have proper welding tools i just kind of made do with what i had here in the shop so this time i went out and i actually bought a few things to do this project that will make it easier and faster for me and i think you almost always get better results with better tools so yeah let's see if a couple welding blocks can make my welding experience significantly better but before we do that we have to cut all the metal for this build i bought a bunch of one by one square tube steel and i spent a little bit more money to get the thicker walled stock on the previous table i used a lighter gauge steel angle iron and because of its open design it was never really as rigid as i wanted it to be by using a thicker steel with a closed wall design this table base ended up feeling a lot more solid i started by doing all the straight cuts first and then i got into doing the miters i wanted this table base to have a trapezoid shape just like the previous table so i started by cutting a bunch of 30 degree miters which if you remember is the same angle as i put on the underside of the table top all right so that is it for all of the 30 degree cuts and now it's time to do the 60 degree cuts fortunately we have a little bit of problem this metal saw is great but it only cuts up to a maximum of 45 degrees so in order to do all these 60 degree cuts we're gonna go manual and in order to do that i will be using this dewalt's cordless 60 volt angle grinder i mean i don't really know if i can truly say manual when i'm using a power tool but i'll be cutting all the cuts freehand and full disclosure actually reached out to dewalt and angle grinder to cut metal inside unfortunately it's both snowing and raining outside right now so i'm just gonna have to spend a lot of time at the end of the day vacuuming up obviously cutting metal freehand with an angle grinder is a less than ideal solution but it did get the job done welding is a little bit more forgiving of a process than many people realize if your miters are slightly off one way or another you can often bridge those gaps with the bead of the weld after i finished cutting i switched over to a flat paddle disc and i used that to clean up all of my cuts i also took a second to add a slight micro bevel to all the miters i would soon be welding this is a trick that makes the welds a little stronger and makes the welding itself a little easier another mistake i made with that previous table was not taking the time to properly prep the metal before welding it and finishing it so if you look all this metal and you'll see that's actually why i've been wearing these blue gloves the whole time is covered in this really nasty black oil that gets on everything and that oil will burn off when you're welding and create a lot of smoke and give you crappier welds and it will also prevent paint from properly adhering to it so i'm going to use a little bit of mineral spirits here and a damp rag and just wipe it off and then i'll also give these a quick sand to also help with the finishing process two pieces quick rub down and now just look at the inside of this rag makes a big difference now the metal is all cleaned up we can spring out the welding table actually come to think of it that's a pretty big difference between now and what i did last table as well now i actually have a proper place to do my welding a little setup like this will save you a lot of hassle when it comes to welding and will help keep everything straight while you work if you want to check that out i have a link to the video where i make this table up here in this corner or maybe this corner i don't know how youtube works let me show you why i was willing to wait two weeks for these tools to ride so one of the biggest problems with welding or one of the hardest things about welding is just getting everything to stay lined up perfectly while you weld it together the heat and the forces evolve tend to move things and shift them around and then you end up with legs that are slightly out of square but these will hold everything perfectly in place while i'm working so i want to weld this miter connection together what i do is put those together slide this mag switch into position and now what i'm going to do is flip this switch here which now locks this piece of metal to the mag switch into the table and now i lock this switch as well and this whole thing is now very firmly attached to the table and to the mag switch so it won't move around at all while i'm welding welding with these magnetic blocks made my life so much easier i spent a lot less time checking all of my angles after each weld and i was really able to just focus on assembling the stand the nice thing about these blocks is that they're variable so they work for 30 degree miters 60 degree miters and even plain old 90s once i had the two main trapezoid pieces welded together i started installing bracing that went between them i wanted the top of the table to appear like it was floating above the stand so i welded these little one-inch blocks into position and then attached a piece of flat bar steel on top of those that i could screw the tabletop to one detail that i completely overlooked though was the bar underneath it would block me from accessing it so i had to drill some access holes these are the kind of details that often get overlooked when you're building on the fly one way i've found to avoid them is to create quick and dirty 3d models before you ever hit the shop wait now let's take this thing outside and grind it down i finally got a little bit of nice weather so i was able to take the stand outside and do all the dirty grinding work out there as a beginner welder i spent a lot of time grinding my welds to get them to look acceptable but hey that's actually the nice thing about welding you're adding material so even if you suck at it like i do you can always grind it away until it looks good all righty now that this guy is all ground down nice and flat we can start painting them we're going to start with a nice white primer and then transition to the final color which is going to be a strong contrast this i'll be able to see if i missed any spots um the actual color give me a little bit of a surprise i've been doing a lot of black lately but for this one i went with something just a little bit different most spray paints these days are combination paints and primers in one but i don't know i always feel like i'm doing a better job when i use primer first what do you guys think will you still apply a primer before using a paint and primer in one or am i just being wasteful let me know down in the comments all right so before we get into painting the final coat there's one last little thing i want to do if you saw my last build where i made that industrial bookcase you know that i used these little felt pads that i attached the bottom of it actually made for wood but it's pretty easy i'm just going to take out the screw that they come with and i'm gonna swap in a little self-tapping metal screw and put that in there these are great because it makes it so the furniture doesn't scratch the floor and if there's any little inconsistencies in the floor and it's not sitting level you can very easily shim these and take care of that discrepancy despite the fact that i was using self-tapping screws i still piloted out the holes ahead of time because i wanted the felt pads to go precisely in the middle of the frame and self-tapping screws have a tendency to walk all over the place before they bite so like i said i'm going to be using a little bit of a different color today i'm going to be using krylon's oil rubbed bronze color you know if you look it's pretty close to uh black but it's got like just a little bit of color which i think is will be nice because honestly i've been working with a lot of black lately and it's starting to get a little boring we'll change things up a bit i was pleasantly surprised by this oil rubbed bronze finish it has a really interesting texture to it and not only does it look good but it also made for a pretty forgiving finish i like to use a lot of flat paints because i find they hide imperfections better but this paint did just as good of a job and had that cool metallic sheen to it okay i think that's it that's about two coats so let's lick this dry and then we can attach the top with my handy little holes all drilled out attaching the top was a breeze i just grabbed some three quarter inch fan head screws and went to town blew this bad boy up into the truck and take them home all right give him a truck i actually have the table here in the back seat because that is far too nice of a table to be in the bed of the truck and we're gonna take this thing home where i have one last surprise for you guys and that surprise is that i've moved let me put this down and i'll explain the truth is with all the builds i've been doing lately i just kind of running out of space at the old place so this guy will go here in what will eventually be the living room area but i think you guys can see this place is looking a little sparse right now and that's because we haven't done the actual move yet so in a few days we're gonna bring the rest of the furniture here and i think that's when i will pick up this video and shoot the rest of the outro because honestly you guys don't want to see this shot with nothing interesting in the background you want it to kind of look like a home so that you get a feel for how it really feels in the space so i will pick this video up in a couple days but don't worry for you at home it will seem as fast as one two three now that looks a little bit more like a proper living room let's shoot some b-roll [Music] so what do you guys think does the 2021 version this table look better than the old one personally i think it looks really good and i'm really happy with how it turned out but then again i was really happy with how that old one turned out too so maybe in a few years i'm destined to only be able to see the flaws in this table unfortunately that's just how it goes when you're working at a craft or some sort of art as long as you're improving you're always gonna see your old work as less than perfect i'll probably spend my entire career chasing some sort of ethereal idea of perfection without ever actually getting there and personally i'm okay with that because i think as human beings we don't derive meaning from perfection we derive meaning from reaching new heights and the process of continual improvement and that's just what i did here i improved on my old design i improved on my process and i'm happy with results at least for now anyways i would love to spend all day talking meaning and philosophy with you guys but i think this video is running a little bit short on time so thank you so much for watching if you like this video please like subscribe and maybe even comment down below on your thoughts on meaning too i'd love to hear some of your guys takes on it if you really like this video please consider supporting me on patreon i'm trying to get enough patrons together so that i can afford to hire a video editor and get these videos out faster alright i think that's it have a great day and i will see you in the next video [Music] peace [Music]",

youtube channel my name is evan and if you're new here take one second hit the subscribe button hit that like button and get ready for an awesome youtube episode in this video we're gonna be completely transforming my three-car garage and my new house here i'm so excited i've always wanted that dream car garage i'm gonna be kind of documenting this whole process over the next couple weeks here and transforming the garage into something really special so without further ado let me show you where we're currently at this is going to be the before and this is going to be the after so as you can see huge transformation stay tuned sit back relax and enjoy time to figure out the first project for the garage renovation this is a christmas gift that chelsea got me we're gonna disassemble everything and see what we got here we go [Music] a lot of this is kind of similar to how like ikea is assembled but everything is really nice like the hardware is nice and everything is organized really nicely and it comes in like a little yeah like a tackle box [Music] [Music] tada just everything went together just like the instructions said pretty straightforward uh we're clearing out this side of the garage today starts the first construction day so i've got my friend memo coming by and they are going to be dry walling all of this we're going to be replacing the lighting we're going to be scraping all this popcorn sealing off okay so the first step of the process is going to be scraping all the popcorn ceiling as you guys saw but once that's scraped off then they're going to be doing some framing and then the drywall is going to start they're doing pretty quick work i'm excited to see what this thing looks like in just a couple hours [Music] so on this section it looks like they spent most of the day focused on the wiring they also ran the wiring for this hvac unit inside the wall all the way this way there's kind of like mouse holes just kind of drilled everywhere it's just like they got this more or less fully complete with the drop downs for the wiring obviously we have all the storage up here which is a ton everything in here is going to be drywall it looks like they also got that all framed up ripping all this out i've got some really nice cabinets the same company that makes these cabinets [Music] all right so it is the end of the day i just got back from the shop um but they looks like they spent a majority of the day on this side getting all the drywall up or most of the drywall up so we'll check with you guys in the morning well here it is the day is here the guys finished up with all the paintwork yesterday they did a lot of work uh they got the bean painted in gray all of their new drywall was all painted up the lights around the ceiling looks amazing each bay now has its own light switch basically and the lights are super bright next up is going to be flooring uh we're going to be working with laticrete now laticrete is a company that i found through evan shanks and they specialize in epoxy floorings and all types of like concrete refinishing justin from laticrete has dropped off a bunch of supplies and today i know it was going to be prep day what are we going to be doing here today justin first step is going to be to prepare it to a concrete surface profile of a two or three which basically we're going to diamond grind it to open up the pores and get the concrete to be able to absorb the epoxy primer that we're going to use what do you call this monstrous this is a lavena elite from super abrasives it's a planetary grinder it's about 800 pounds or you could take a look at the bottom this is where the diamonds there's nothing there yet so there's three heads one two three and there's one big plate so one's spinning this direction and these are spinning the opposite direction so you get a nice grind [Applause] [Music] all right so here we have it a freshly ground concrete floor the next step is going to be patching so we're going to be patching all those cracks any holes like this have been cleaned up those are all going to be filled so that when we put the epoxy coating down it's going to be super super smooth like a sheet of glass all right here we are end of day one with latakri and floor is all patched up and ready for tomorrow we're going to do one final grind in the morning then we're going to apply a black primer and that's going to be imperative to making sure that everything else sticks right now we've got our short filled pigment based moisture vapor barrier and we're adding our black pigment to give us a black base for your three custom metallic colors [Music] foreign now we can officially walk on to the base coast this is the gloss black base coat and today we're going to be putting on the metallics but before we do we're going to go ahead and use this floor sander here and just quickly get out any little imperfections you guys can see that hopefully the camera's picking it up whether it's outgassing or some kind of contamination i'm going to sand all that down [Music] so um so we've come through we've sanded the floor off so this is the last step and then we're doing the metallic next [Music] [Music] [Music] all right well here it is i am so pumped we went with like a carrera marble design which is something that i've always loved so we actually mixed three different colors a white a gunmetal gray and a silver and this is the effect that we got so epoxy makes it so cool uh because everything kind of blends together and if you didn't know it you would probably think that this was actually a slab of marble all right so the next step and actually the final step before this whole project is done we're going to be applying a polyaspartic hybrid urethane coating this polyester coating is going to provide a ton of abrasion resistance as well as chemical resistance just to make sure that anything that gets on this floor is not going to damage it i won't have to worry about if a couple drips of oil coming out of my bmw get on the floor i can just wipe it up and know that it's not going to stain this beautiful white amazing marble [Music] floor [Music] it is the next day and i honestly couldn't wait any longer to start assembling the cabinets so we brought in the cabinets on this section here and more stuff is here [Music] all right so you guys saw me build like three or four cabinets earlier in this video now we got the mother lode so these are the tall cabinets they're gonna go all along this wall here i'm kind of dreading this because it took a long time to do that little section that i did but i know it's gonna look super good when it's done no no no no [Music] hello [Music] all right so we got this section in here looks good i think i may want to get some kind of top for this just so it may be a butcher block top or something but we move on to the heavy stuff the cabinets are going to go over that whole wall we might need to call in some reinforcements because this is really heavy i built two of them and then we've got three more to go are you the reinforcements these are [Music] myself [Music] so [Music] so that's so awesome we're also going to be putting a bracket probably on top to connect everything together as well as to the wall just because we live in california and i don't want these things to ever fall on penelope or anyone else who's using them but man these are gonna provide so much storage and they look so much better this is gonna be the meguiar's detailing cabinet [Music] that looks pretty cool a couple more tools to throw in there but that is the first time i've ever had enough space to just lay everything out we've got the cars in here for the first time and it looks so good i'm so pumped at how it's turning out got all the mcguire stuff set up some stroller parking here at the end and just i love the way these led bulbs turned out too these are from obsessed garage i brought in this upper this is gonna go somewhere here and then the tv [Music] all right so there we go tv is up and mounted and looks perfect [Music] so now we have this at the perfect height we have a nice space in between here for a pegboard or something like that if you want to hang up some tools but still a lot of stuff to put away but man i'm out of breath [Music] do do all right that's it the garage project is officially done i'm so excited let's go inside check it out [Music] now that you guys have seen the garage let me give you a quick little tour of all the stuff that we did so on this side we got rid of all of those original racks that came with the house we replaced them with the ultimate garage set up here with tall cabinets plenty of storage half of them are actually unused right now because we haven't even filled them over here we covered up that hvac unit with a 50 inch led samsung tv we've got lowers and upper cabinets as well as a toolbox here that rolls if i need to move it over to one of the cars that i'm working on so we brought a refrigerator in from the house that now is our second refrigerator and this one's dedicated to some nice cold frosty beverages we've got more cabinets over here and this right here is pretty special um this was some artwork that was on display for my 30th birthday where we debuted the e36 with delivery from premium auto styling so super special day i figured we put that on the wall it's got all the friends and family signed it and then last but not least you guys just saw me install the quick jacks with the little wall mount set up quickjack's like an alternative to using a floor jack but they're a lot better so not only do they get the car a lot higher off the ground so you have a lot more room to work but everything is really safe and really heavy duty so they all have locks it comes with a hydraulic pump and everything you need to set it up and that's pretty much it so i hope you guys enjoyed this project as much as i did huge shout out to all the partners that made it possible memo and his whole team justin troy rick yaz everyone from laticrete super super excited to finally have my dream garage so thank you guys so much for watching appreciate each and every one of you for sticking all the way to the end we'll see you guys in the next one later ultimate garage ultimate ultimate alter nate no yeah i don't know what she got me it's probably a terrible color you can't do hey spin the thing this no comments oh hey what's your name okay victor cut that out don't go vic leave that in

of the body and proper functioning of our body so what are we waiting for let's prepare some interesting detox drink this today so as the summer is around the corner so let's prepare some satwik detox drink but before we jumped into preparing some surfing detox drink let me just give you a quick recap of what is satwik food satwik food is a food which is natural which is fresh which is easily available and more important which is seasonal and which is free from additives which is not processed and it's not packaged so in short we can say satwik food is a complete holistic and nutritious food so the question arises now why sucking food yes of course it lights our stomach it's easy to digest we feel energetic throughout the day so why not satwik it's i assure you the once you get start benefits of satwik food you will fall in love with it as very well said by mahansaji as the food so the mind as the mind so the man so today's session let's try some satwik detox drink the first drink which we are going to make today is green cooler yes very well as the name suggests green cooler means there has to be some green element in it so just first let me introduce you the ingredients needed in this greek cooler the first ingredient which we need is cucumber so here i just want to mention you that we are preparing for one serving okay so if the cucumbers are small that you can go ahead with two cucumber so here i have kept here two cucumbers then we need one inch ginger we need one lemon then we need honey and then we need few mint leaves and a handful of coriander leaves okay so before we start i just want to say that be free enough to be innovative at experimenting because here we just want to show you that how simply you can make those detox drink okay so that you did not have to go on for searching for the ingredients so you can just quickly you can check your pantry and you can just see whatever is easily available or you can check your fridge so you just don't have to look for it from where to get it's not that but feel free on experimenting be innovative with it in this you can use a green apple but mind you it has to be soft thick means it has to be seasonal so you can use green apple or the red apple whichever is available at your home you can even use spinach so you can't keep on trying new new things in this so it's not that only this much ingredients i have told you so you need to be use only this the basic ingredients in this drink is the cucumber okay so just let's start with cucumber so here we are using two cucumber i will be using one and the other half okay the complete two cucumbers i won't be using it i will be using only one and one and half so okay now one important thing is that i'm not peeling the cucumber i'm using it as it is because the skin is also having many new prints in it so need not worry about it wash it properly then you can use it as it is so just let chop the cucumber okay one more thing what we have to do when we chop the cucumber remember just the edge cut the edge and just rub it so that if it's bitter the bitterness will go away so just rub both the edges okay from both the side you need to do so that if any bitterness in the cucumber is there so it will be gone okay fine so similarly i will be using the other one also i just from the edge just take the slice and just rub it so that the bitterness goes away okay very fine i'll be using one one and a half for one serving okay now just slice it into you can slice it in any way you want big pieces or small it's all up to you but remember don't forget to wash it properly okay so just chop it just chop the cucumbers and we all know how cucumbers are good and especially summer is just around the corner so we all know that cucumber helps in hydrating our body it keeps us hydrated okay and cucumber is full of fiber and loaded with water content so it's very good for summer okay so we have chopped all the cucumbers and then the second ingredients we need is one inch of ginger so we'll chop that also okay fine chop the ginger even you can grate it also see your wish okay and we'll be using just a handful of mint leaves okay and we can use handful of coriander leaves so basically we are including all the green elements in it so that refreshing drink and it's ready so just we'll put it in the grinder and we'll blend it just put all the ingredients okay just blend it into smooth paste okay if you find it it's too hard to blend then we can add with water to it around half cup or one cup water to it so that it blends easily check in between where all the ingredients are blend yes we need to do it once more okay we'll do once more i think it's ready let's check okay okay now what we are going to do next is we'll just strain it off okay so we put the strainer and we'll pour it okay if you are okay with it then you can consume it as it is no issues or otherwise just trade it to get this fine cucumber juice okay so uh steady will it add little water to it so whatever is here so it will just come off yes okay so cucumber has many benefits in it it hydrates our body and for the diet people who are diabetic it's very helpful for them because the cucumber juice product produces such hormone so which the cells of the pancreas needed to produce the insulin so for the diabetic people at least they should consume cucumber whole year or throughout the year and especially in summer it's for everyone it helps in reducing cholesterol it even balances our blood pressure whether it's high blood pressure or low breath pressure so it balances we'll strain it so whatever fiber is left it's left in the strainer okay now one more thing which i need to say that don't throw this fiber okay why because it has got many nutritive values what we can do is we can knead it we can along with the atta we can need this fiber and form a dough and make roti or chapati you can easily made roti chapatya parathas you can make with it so don't throw it away so you can use it in that form also so need not worry that i haven't peeled the cucumber so what to do with the skin or bit there's nothing to do worry about it so you can use it you can keep aside and so when you uh make a dough for roti so you can add this fiber in it okay so our juice is ready let's keep it here okay fine okay so the next step what we are going to do we have to take a glass here it's okay so in this now the juice is ready so now what we are going to do we are going to squeeze lemon okay so i'll be squeezing the half lemon in it okay okay now the second step what i'm going to add is honey so we all know the nutritive value value of honey it's superb it's uh it's an antiseptic it's an antimicrobial so it has got excellent benefit and it's also very good for a skin okay so i'm using around one teaspoon of honey so this is completely optional if you want you add it otherwise it's okay but please don't use refined sugar in it okay so it's advisable to use honey even you can use the coconut sugar or jaggery if you want otherwise use it i'll recommend you to use honey if you are not okay with it then don't use it it's just an optional okay so mix it well and now we are just going to pour it in the glass so the remaining you can add water so if you are okay you can use a full to large cucumber or with the one cucumber so but at least we have to use one cucumber in it so i put with water okay so what we can do now we can just garnish it or you can put few rounds of lemon in this juice to make it more refreshing so here we got three-fourth glass of cucumber juice so if you want you can add bit more water to it okay so now there are many many benefits of cucumber juice you as you all must be knowing it's very good for a skin it's very good for a hair and it as i said it balances the blood pressure level whether high or low blood pressure and besides in that it contains all the vitamin b complex whether it's b1 b2 b12 b6 so what that happens what does it help us it helps us in maintaining and balancing the stress level so it's rich in vitamin c it has got magnesium potassium so there are many many benefits of it and besides then this cucumber is rich in fiber so as the food which cutted fiber so which helps in digestion okay so it prevents us from blotting the people who are suffering from constipation it's excellent drink for them okay so this was a cucumber juice or the green cooler so as i said you can add as much as greenies in it so feel free enough to be innovative and experimenting regarding whatever is available at your home you can add spinach here we have used uh coriander mint isn't it so here our first drink is ready that is green cooler or the cucumber juice so this detox ring is ready so i'm keeping here so just let me quickly clean up this place and let's move ahead to the second okay now as it is advisable to you know when we get up in the morning to have to start your day with some sort of detox trick okay so whether it's coconut water or just a lukewarm water or a lukewarm water in it you know some lime juice in it or the uh juice of any vegetables or fruit isn't it so the first thing what we consume early in the morning or when we wake up in the morning actually decides that how our stomach is going to work throughout the day okay so if we consume something heavy that what happens then our whole energy is used in digestion of that food is it so if you consume something light then our energy would be consumed for other activities so it's very very advisable to start your day with some sort of detox water but as we all know that del came more so we we need that sometimes we keep on experimenting you know we it's very essential also otherwise it get very monotonous having the same drink every day so we keep on experimenting with new new things so that you make a detox ring and that too it's super refreshing and super easy so let's quickly move to our second drink what we are going to make today is the savory sattu okay so here the ingredients we need here is sattu so i'll tell you one by one and the second ingredient we need is the roasted uh jeera powder or the cumin seed few mint leaves few coriander leaves and last but not the least or the pink salt okay and of course we need water okay now here we are using satu so sattu is a superfood okay now basically sato is nothing else but it's a flower made from the black chickpeas or in hindi they say it's a kala chana so it's a powder of the black chickpea so it's a is considered as a super food so even you can use if this is not available to you you can use the jaw satu also that is jaw means barley so you can use also that flour also you can use for this drink okay so basically it's it sorry it's consumed at the state of uh say bihar uh jharkhand and some parts of mp if i'm not rock so it's traditionally now we all get these things in the supermarket or in as well as on online also but traditionally what the like the dadis and is what they used to do they used to get the black chana and then they used to grind it and keep it in the jar for uh for the uh drink purpose or you like the jaw satu also what you can do you get you know get that barley from the market and just roast it in low flame and make a powder of it and that's it or even uh if this is available well good otherwise you can use the jaw satura also or you can use the bigs of both the uh chana one and the jaw one you can even you mark it you get the both mix one also and the individual one also like you get the chana one also as well as uh this so it's a uh just considered as a super bit superfood why i'm saying super food because it's far far more better than the supplements which we get in the market like uh horlicks and bon vita pedia pediatric why we are not you know following a tradition it is very sad you know actually this hydrates our body it's you can consume it whole year no issues regarding that but specifically it's very helpful in summer because it hydrates your body and it protects you from sun stroke and the secret benefit of it you know what is it it's a brain booster that's why we no wonder why we get all the super 30s from bihar just a joke about it but it's really a super food it's you know it has a nutritive value is much more i'll tell you later about it so just quickly start with the uh drink the detox drink what we are going to make today so for this we need one glass okay so here i will be using one tablespoon of okay here i am using uh chana satu so here i'm using one tablespoon so let me use one and a half okay and around half teaspoon of sendanam or you can use it according to your taste okay and we'll use uh chopped mint leaves okay we are using the chopped mint clips in it that's it not too difficult to make very simple very easy first i'll add little water and i'll just mix it so that it dissolves okay so here we are making the savory one means the namkeen one okay so you even you can use a sweeter form also so both of it if you like the sweeter one use a sweeter option or you can use the savory one for sweeter option nothing more what you have to do you have to instead of this salt what we have to use you can use a jaggery powder or the lump of jaggery whichever is available at your place or even you can use a mystery so you can use that and mix it so only the difference between the two would be that the sweeter one we are using jaggery and here we are using salt okay so it can be used as a post workout drink okay so what from workout you can use it can be given and it's very good for the diabetic people also because it helps in controlling their diabetes and it also balances the blood pressure whether it's high or low blood pressure so it's rich in iron calcium protein so there are many many tremendous benefits in it okay okay now at the end to enhance the taste we will add around half teaspoon of roasted jeera powder and finally we can garnish it with coriander leaves so this is completely optional if start available it's okay fine so the quick and healthy detox drink is ready for the summer okay now it's not that we can use this satu only acid drink it can be used in many other ways like you can use it as a stuffing for your parathas it can be used as a cereals and even you can make desserts out of it so you can use it in any form you want and it's uh you know it's consuming daily it's also very big good for your hair your skin and it's rich in fiber protein so the food which is rich in fiber is bound to help our digestive system so the people who are suffering from uh constipation is definitely but basically what i meant to say is very helpful for our guts so for easy uh gut functioning so this all the food and and we all whatever drink what we are preparing today are all saturday and which are all rich in fiber so definitely it going to help our digestive system it helps our metabolism and satur is such a it's a super food that's why because it you know it builds your immunity it builds your strength so and as i said it's very good for the growing kids so by you know by consuming or by having this satu it's definitely in you know build the immunity and build the strength and rich in iron calcium so it says just a super food at the super drink okay so here goes our second detoxifying drink so let's move to the third one now the one question must be arising in our mind key okay these are all detoxifying drinks so wait to consume it when to have this drink basically it's advisable to take early in the morning or in the first half of the day so if not possible to consume in the first half of the day you can consume it in between the beans or you can what you can do you get you know it place of snacks if you can skip the stacks in place of stacks you can uh consume this detox drink instead of sipping into a tea or coffee you can consume this detox trick as simple as that okay so let me just clean up this place and we'll move to the third detox tray okay okay the third detox trick which we are going to make is natural detox drink i have named it as natural detoxing because the ingredients is very very natural and it's a superset let me just introduce you with the ingredients okay so what we are going to use here is sabza or the basil seeds or is also known as tupmaria or faluda seeds so it's considered as safe super seeds like we have chia seeds and uh like we have for marshmallow seeds or the pumpkin seeds so it's also one of the super seeds and the miracle seed indeed okay so here then the next ingredient what we have is basil leaves so the basil leaves as we all know is how beneficial for us you know it's purifies our blood so let me go ahead then we have fennel seeds are soft and the fourth ingredients which we need is lemon okay okay now just start with it we need a glass you can use a glass or mason jar whatever is available to you okay so one of the uh thing about sabza seed is one people generally get confused with the chia seeds the the one of the way to you know to identify the substances is black in color and it need not just okay it need not have to be soaked overnight or for an hour or so you can instantly soak it and you can consume it so just soak it when you get up in the morning just soak it and you get go and get freshen up by that time it will get so so it doesn't take much time it's hardly 15 to half an hour so so not more than that okay so what we need to do we'll use around one tablespoon of sabzasi okay so one thing i need to say about is very important to in fact to say about the subject is that try to whenever you start preparing uh consuming the sabza seeds so try to consume start conserving it from small quantity say about one teaspoon to one tablespoon not more than that don't exceed from one tablespoon first you start with one teaspoon then go ahead with one tablespoon okay and it can be consumed by everyone even the diabetic people or the people who are suffering from pressure is no issues regarding them but if you are under certain medication then absolutely you have to take the advice of doctor and the pregnant woman can also use it but it's advisable to consult doctor before using it okay so what we need to do we need to soak it so i have added little water okay so the sub acid is full of fiber it's rich in fiber high on protein calcium okay add it the like what we are using in it is the basil leaves and the meats the basic property of the basil leaf as it has a medicinal value as well we all know it it's very good for skin if you have a sub skin infection then you can what you can do you can just grind the uh basil leave and apply it over it and just apply it till it gets dry that wipe out and by frequent using of the basil leave in that form also helps in reducing the skin problem and the subject is it has a cooling property in it and it's low in calorie very important so the people who are looking for weight loss it's very helpful to them isn't it so see just a few minutes hardly a minute or so uh it got soaked i'll just stir it once more yeah so it did not have to soak for an hour or so hardly a minute or or so if you want the maximum benefit of it then at least soak it for 15 to half an hour it's okay okay so i will be using around one teaspoon of fennel seeds okay so fennel seed is also has very uh medicinal values yes it secretes some digestive juices and enzymes which helps in digestions so it happens most of the time when we have heavy food or something like that or when we go to some party or some restaurant they serve us soft that is the fennel seed because by chewing it it helps in digestion okay so i have put here sabza seeds uh one teaspoon of fennel seeds and now i'm going to fill it with water okay and just stir it and one of the important uh benefits of tulsi leaves is that it purifies our blood okay so the next thing what i'm going to add i'm going to squeeze lemon say around just remove the seed okay i'm keep squeezing half of the lemon yeah just stir it okay so ah the 30 top stick is ready add sabza seed is very beneficial for a skin for a hair as well as it contain fiber as i said it's rich in protein it's rich in fiber and it's rich in iron and calcium so as it is rich in fiber so it helps in easy digestions people suffering from constipation is definitely going to help them out even the bloating it enhances your mood it removes fatigue-ness okay so there are many benefits of it so these are the three drinks so we can add a little water to the green cooler yes so all our three drinks are ready yes and one of the important benefits of sabza seeds here in this drink is that it's antioxidant yes so an anti-inflammatory also the people who are suffering from urine problem if they have they can use it okay so just let me quickly clean up this place so as is detox drake not only flushes away the toxins from your body it also makes you feel energetic it makes you feel light yes and it's very helpful for a digestion okay like this green cooler is have the very cooling property in it okay so it hydrates your body it maintains your blood pressure and the people for the those who are suffering from diabetes is very good for them it's anti-inflammatory it's antioxidants so and the secret benefit of this you can say of the cucumber juice or we can say about the cucumber if anyone is suffering from bad breath so you can just slice a uh one cucumber slice and just chew it your bread get fresh enough so the ingredients which we have used here are the mint leaves so mint leaves is we all know it has also got some medicinal values in it it's a cooler and it's anti-inflammatory so here we have the first detox drink is the green cooler so you can use as much of as green elements in it we can experiment it with either with spinach here we have used coriander leaves you can use spinach apple uh any other fruits which are fibrous you can use all those uh things over here the second one is the savory satu so it's hydrates all this drink hydrates our body basically so it protects us from sun strokes and it's a super drain so instead of depending on the supplements which are available in the market we can consume this so it's very help for the diabetic people it maintains our blood pressure level yeah so the third drink is the sub seeds so this all this ingredient the basic uh reason why we have used only few ingredients in it so that you can easily make it you need not have to get first key you know what they have put over here from where to get all these ingredients is nothing to worry about it so besides in this this drinks helps us in detoxifying our body so it flushes out the toxins from our body and it makes us beautiful from inside as well as outside but besides that i would love to say that our institution the yoga institutions believes or works on the four pillars of yoga that is the aha bihar achar so this besides them this drinks are definitely for sure are going to help us in detoxifying our body but in along with it we should practice the principles or whatever the yoga says that we should follow the four pillars of yoga that is the aha means food then bihar means recreation achar means routine and vr means thought so if we follow those four pillars on which this institution works on then definitely we are going to stay healthy stay fit and so stay healthy stay fit this summer and what are we waiting for so let's try this interesting detox during this summer and enjoy the maximum benefit of it okay and don't forget to share your valuable comments with us your comments are always welcome and do follow us on social media the yoga institute and eat healthy stay fit stay safe till then bye see you on another interesting session of life satwik cooking show namaste", "WH3HXF8C2ak": "[Music] [Music] welcome this video shows you from start to finish all the steps i took to make a metal dust collector if you want to see my future blacksmithing projects go ahead and subscribe whether you forge swords knives or even axes you will end up in front of a belt fender grinding metal generates a lot of metal dust that will quickly cover all surfaces in your shop dust collection is the usual answer to this problem but for grinding metal the solution is not so easy the metal sparks are quite hot and will burn and smolder at high temperatures as you can see here the solution is a dust collector made out of metal for metal dust the main component is called a theme baffle which assists in the mechanical separation of metal dust aided by gravity the theme baffle has a cut out slot which allows the metal dust to drop i will show you how to build that at the beginning of this video the inlet converting from round to square will also take a fair bit of work in this visualization you can see how a lot of sparks drop out into the collection chamber through the cutout slot the rest of the dust collector is basically just managing the suction and putting a large frame around the theme buffalo this video will take you through the whole process of building this metal dust collector including some of the challenges i encountered i hope you are ready for the journey it will involve lots of sparks and even lasers instead of using water for a spark trap this dust collector will be made from sheet metal and use a thin baffle to separate the metal dust the ingredients are fairly straightforward i'm using a blower with a steel impeller see a link in the description 16 gauge sheet metal and one inch angle iron tony and i will now construct the theme baffle from the aforementioned sheet metal unlike a cyclone separator the theme baffle is much shorter and includes a bottom baffle that allows the dust to drop out but prevents it from getting sucked back in for the theme baffle we need to create two 24 inch diameter circles from the 16 gauge sheet metal [Music] on the bandsaw we almost cut a complete circle using a simple jake we built but stop short of cutting the complete circle to leave a raceway for the inlet since 16 gauge sheet metal is fairly thick i am somewhat worried about bending the walls that will support the top and bottom circle that we are currently cutting out while working on this project i had looked into buying sheet metal tools but the smaller sheet metal brakes and rollers are not rated for 16 gauge sheet metal the tools that are are much larger heavier and more expensive one circle is cut out and what we stopped cutting is where the air inlet to the dust collector will be located the size of the inlet will be six inch square which is the same dimension as the height of the baffle and big enough to not significantly reduce airflow for the baffle to work the compartment into which the dust will drop needs to be airtight otherwise airflow would move through the dropout in the baffle and prevent the operation now we are completing the bottom part of the baffle the top part of the baffle will receive a 6 inch diameter circle in the middle where the blower will be positioned and the bottom part of the baffle still needs more material removed to create a dropout before we do that we need to cut a 6 inch wide strip of sheet metal that will form the outer wall of the buffle since we don't have a shear we mounted a guide on the bandsaw table let's talk about the 6 inch hole in the middle of the sheet metal initially we thought we would use a circular hole cutter attached to a drill unfortunately my drill press does not have enough clearance and stabilizing the drill by hand seemed impossible instead we are cutting four one-half inch holes and we'll use a sheet metal snip to create enough space for a nibbler how convoluted another option could have been using a plasma cutter but i no longer have access to one and have not seen the need to buy one yet however i'm pretty sure a plasma cutter will be a likely future acquisition this is a good point in case for how proper tools can make everything move much faster while the nippler works exceedingly well getting the right turning radius took some practice as a result i'm approaching the circle with multiple overlapping operations and there we are almost a perfect circle [Music] draw filing is pretty quick to remove the sharp and jagged edges left by the bandsaw all this preparation is really just procrastination to avoid bending the strip of 6-inch white sheet metal into a circle with this brilliant realization in mind i proceeded to make myself a frankenstein pyramid roller it consists of three rolls where one sits on top and can be moved down to increase the bending amount ideally i would have used a lathe and solid rolls but that was not an option in this case instead i welded something together from black plumbing pipe yuck nonetheless it seems to get the job done and my vice grips constitute an almost perfect crank what more could i want i occasionally check how close i have come to the right radius but in the end managed to slightly over bend the sheet metal anyway it turned out that that was not really a problem and the jig i built for clamping took care of removing gaps in the joint usually when welding the clamping setup is the interesting part that makes for a successful welds here you see a circle cut from plywood that i'm using as part of my clamping setup the cut corners from the plywood circle are placed on the outside and allow me to press the sheet metal tightly together i'm using a stitching approach to prevent the metal from getting too hot and from blowing through the walls with a welder high-end large that seems to be going well although the weld beads are somewhat ugly and need to be cleaned up later i am slowly working my way around the circumference of the circle and reposition my plywood clamping jig as needed to get [Music] access inspecting the inside shows good penetration on the welds what i forgot to mention was that the strip of sheet metal i had cut was only three feet long and not enough to make it all the way around it's okay i will just cut another piece and continue along to match the remainder of the circle to the inlet i will first weld in another wall since i don't have a break that will make joining the bend wall to the inlet much easier to bend the wall to the right radius my couple together frankenstein roller will have to do the job i'm still surprised how well it is working when bending metal it's never possible to bend the whole piece evenly and so the extra length to give the roller something to grab needs to be cut off [Music] after placing the sheet metal into my little plywood jig welding everything together is quite fast there we go the walls are completed and the only thing missing from the theme buffle is the bottom with a dropout where the metal dust can fall into the collection bin the cutout is a 240 degree arc that stops at the inlet since i want to use my circle cutting jig on the bandsaw again i need to figure out where the cuts need to be placed and where i need to make space for the bandsaw blade [Music] creating the opening for the blade requires many small cuts due to the limited turning radius of the blade i have installed once the opening is there cutting the remainder of the circle is fortunately quite easy at the moment i'm keeping a small tab to help with welding the bottom to the rest of the baffle and i don't know yet if i remove it eventually or not as i have some rigidity in the whole structure now i only need to insert one of the plywood segments previously trying to clamp both of them with my parallel jaws clamp resulted in either one or the other frequently falling down before i could put down clamp pressure another video i'm working on in which i'm very excited about is to visualize the pattern welding process and sorts i liked my visuals so much that i made myself a few t-shirts if you like the design and would enjoy a t-shirt as well follow the links in the description i will figure out how to suspend the blower and the baffle from the frame that i will construct i am removing the sheet metal stand and will build a frame from mild steel that can hold the whole blower so that the inlet points down as you can see here i am taking down the distance between the screw holes so that i can drill the flat steel bar at the same distance and then hopefully fit everything together just correctly before i drill the holes i will carefully mark the center of the bar and then use a center punch to create a small indent for the drill bit the blower is not really designed to run in this particular orientation so it will be interesting to see if the impeller comes loose more easily when compared to operating it upright for my other blowers i definitely had to adjust the impeller using various set screws to prevent it from scraping the housing my somewhat simplistic idea to making the frame is to screw in the individual pieces and then just weld them together to make it easier to fit the screws i used drill bits with a slightly larger diameter however for this to be really of any benefit i should have assured that they center the screws on the holes as i don't want to damage the finish on the blower housing i'm just placing a couple of tack welds before taking the frame off and welding it together properly the cross brace from angle iron is hopefully strong enough to stay upright under the weight of the blower which is surprisingly heavy that said as the impeller is made from steel perhaps it's not so surprising after all as the frame will stick out of the metal dust collector i'm giving it a coat of spray paint to make it look better now i have to figure out the overall frame of the frankenstein machine i want it to be on rollers and essentially clad in sheet metal held together by angle iron [Music] once i have tack welded the four pieces of angle iron in place i can do a proper weld from the other side there will be two of these frames one for the bottom with rollers and the other one for the top and the blower will be suspended to attach the four rollers i will need to make some plates to which each roller can be screwed fortunately there is a cut-off just perfect for the drop but that needs to be straightened a little bit first none of this needs to be very precise the most important bit is for the rollers to be level at the end i am transferring the location of the screw holes to the plate and then we'll center punch and drill them [Music] a drill press is really a great tool to have for drilling into steel with the handheld drill i usually blow out the holes by not being able to hold the drill completely steady none of the welds here need to be particularly strong since they just need to hold the plate in place however since it's easy to do i'm doing a complete weld against the seam the saw horses make it easy to hold the frame and to clamp the plate for the rollers so that it does not move when welding clamping also still allows for small adjustments with a hammer to center the plate against the frame and ensure that there is easy access to the screw holes all the way around alright after some cleanup it's time to attach the rollers and see how it all fits together looks good now let's go back to the top frame and figure out a way to suspend the blower from the little frame you saw me make earlier for this construction i just end up using more angle iron as it is fairly rigid and still very easy to work with putting everything together is still a little bit difficult welding long seams has a tendency to warp the pieces due to the heat involved and clamping does not completely solve the problem in this particular case the frame lifted up a little bit and while the blower still fits it's a little bit more difficult to attach than i would like i need some more strength from the frame and will attach a couple more pieces of angle iron that can hold the frame for the blower in more places than just the one long seam i welded with the blower in place i cannot weld the bottom so it's a little bit back and forth to completely weld everything the remaining step in finishing the top frame is to weld two more cross braces in place that prevent the blower from tilting down under its own weight this whole operation somewhat marred my beautiful paint job so it's time for another black spray coat i'm sure this will be distinguishing mark for the whole project after all this work i wonder if the theme baffle will still fit but more importantly i need to figure out how high to make the dust collector based on how far of the floor i want the inlet to be afterwards i just cut the legs to the right length and weld them to the top frame the next challenge is welding the top and bottom frame so that everything is at the right angle and not skewed to one side or the other a lot of clamping and the saw horses will need to help you again [Music] at this point the overall frame is finished and now i need to figure out how to make airtight compartments from sheet metal in addition to weather stripping i suspect some silicone cork may be required as well first however let's get back to the challenge of cutting the sheet metal without a break i am trying an electric shear here but the 16 gauge sheet metal is pretty thick cutting with the shear is quite slow this will be the bottom piece and i will just reuse the holes from the rollers to attach it this time using a handheld drill rather than my drill press you can see how much longer it takes to drill these holes even though the sheet metal is quite thin in comparison to attach the sheet metal against the plate for the rollers i'm inserting a couple of spacers to fill up the gap [Music] [Music] to attach the sheet metal to the angle iron frame i'm cutting little steel squares with tapped quarter inch holes to which the sheet metal can be screwed [Music] these get welded to the frame in multiple locations while it would be much easier to just weld the sheet metal against the frame i'm keeping the option to remove each sheet metal panel in case access is needed at a later point this may be optimizing for something that could be very unlikely however as i'm building this as i go without having a concrete plan i'm sure i will forget some small detail that needs to be revisited and besides the option to weld continues to be available and at that point the screws just become visible ornaments cutting 16 gauge sheet metal with an electric shear is quite challenging and takes a fairly long time better tools such as a plasma cutter would certainly be nice the process for attaching the panel is the same as before little tack welded squares that receive screws to attach the panel the next step is to place an inner wall that separates the dust chamber from a filter array that cleans the exhaust air [Music] duct tape is of course an essential ingredient to any project and needs to play a crucial role here as well the angle iron in this case needs to be shaped for the circular tube from the blower the belt sander makes short process of that task and a perfect fit is not important here [Music] it's time to cut the sheet metal again and it's not getting any easier the plasma cutter sure would be nice after a lot of work the hole is big enough and fits over the exhaust pipe the sheet metal is a reasonable fit but the chamber really needs to be airtight and to help with that i'm placing some weather stripping eventually some silicone caulking might need to come into play as well once i'm done with that i need to cut a few more pieces of sheet metal and also need to cut another circular hole as well as a hole for the intake with that prospect in mind i finally broke down and realized that the plasma cutter is really a useful tool to have in the shop let's take a look at how that is working out let me tell you it's really night and day the circle is almost perfect and cleanup is minimal this is so nice i should have invested in the plasma cutter from the get-go some more weather stripping and we're getting close to doing a first test of the contraption [Music] however before that can happen i still need to build the intake port which will also support the buffer the intake port will also need to be cut into the sheet metal panel that covers the side of the dust collector without the plasma cutter cutting this precisely would have been difficult as well let's see how easy everything now seems to be and there we go a panel cut to the right size with the correct opening for the intake port now it really gets to be the time to do a test run i collected a ton of metal dust and shavings from the floor around the bandsaw let's see how much we can collect the hope is that almost everything is just on the floor of the dust collection chamber and did not just get blown out let's take a look i'm quite happy with the result i'm currently cutting the panel that was covering the front side of the dust collector so that i can turn the lower part into a door to retrieve the collected metal dust as i mentioned before i do not have any sheet metal tools and i'm coupling this together with whatever spare steel and tools i have in the shop most of the work here is no longer on the dust collection mechanics but rather closing up the outside without too many air gaps as i'm making this up as i go i attach most panels with screws so that they can be removed if i need to get back to the insides of the monster i'm still wondering what i should call it in the end frankenstein comes to mind but that's a little bit long for a spray painted stencil instead of tapping the holes i just tack weld a nut on the inside which is fast and sufficient now that the upper part of the front panel is attached i have to figure out the door the hinges which are store-bought should be fairly easy to attach for now i am center punching the holes and then we'll drill them on the drill press which is much faster than drilling by hand i plan on welding a nut on the inside again so that the screws have something to tighten against [Music] in principle this is super easy tighten the screw against the nut and then a few easy tack welds remove the screws and done here is another questionable decision i decided that they would weld the other side of the hinges instead of trying to drill and place nuts my reasoning was that if i ever had to replace the hinges i would just grind them off we'll see how much of that will come to be true i thought i would just buy some kind of ledge at the hardware store but they don't really have what i need instead i'm taking inspiration from the trusty metal bandsaw in the shop and decide that forging the ledge handle is the way to go this is definitely one of the benefits of doing all the work in a blacksmith shop while precision is something i'm limited on creative transformation of steel is always an option the flange i'm forging here is meant to secure the handle on the outside so that it does not move through the hole where the handle engages the latch one of the challenges here is to keep everything centered as you can see i am off center and will grind the excess away to hold down the ledge on the inside i'm drilling a hole that i will tap for a quarter inch screw later before i can do that and before i will attach the square latch driver let's fortune the handle [Music] there we go handle for the latch is finished and instead of using the transformative power of blacksmithing i will just weld on the square driver as i had already drilled the hole i now just need to tap it to cut in the threads for the coarse one quarter inch screw one of the problems with this construction is that the sheet metal while quite thick is still pretty flexible ideally i would have a bending break to bend the edges to give it more stability i don't yet know if that's actually going to be a problem in terms of creating a vacuum inside of the dust collector the one ingredient that is still missing is a piece of square steel that can move the ledge i will just weld that on as you can see i chamfered the corners to have more surface area for welding this should be sufficient for it to hold together [Music] the chamfers are important as i need to file the weld beads back to the square of the steel and they need enough surface to hold it together the square hole for the latch is one half inch wide i'm drilling a one-half inch wide hole and will then use more hot work to drift it to square overall drifting is much faster than a firework or using square brooches and precision is not really a primary consideration here finally i need to create a large enough hole in the sheet metal as well and that will require filing as i don't have any larger drill bits at the shop let's put it together and see how well it works there is not all that much work remaining i have to close up all sites make a place for the filters to go and make an inlet [Music] my process is the same drill the holes all the way through the angle iron and weld a nut on the inside for the screw to grip i had a little bit of a transition but some weather stripping will close that up i told you i'm just cobbling it together as i had mentioned before the theme baffle is meant to separate out most of the metal dust to test this i just collected whatever had accumulated underneath the grinder as i turned the dust collector on observed the exhaust of it i was quite surprised how much fine dust made it all the way through it's not really surprising though most of the stuff is at the bottom and waiting to be taken out the filters should take care of the fine [Music] dust [Music] in addition to the mechanical separation of dust i also plan to install two stages of filtering to the exhaust air the first filter stage filters out particles larger than 5 micron and the final filter stage steps it down to 1 micron this whole project is not designed and rather follows the slapper together philosophy of construction here i'm creating the box that will hold the filters angle iron that gets welded into place works quite well for that the main challenge will be the mechanism for holding the filters in place while also allowing simple replacement of filters as needed [Music] my solution to keeping the filters in place is to weld a tab on the top cover that presses the filters together at the top simple but effective checking by hand seems to indicate that they will stay firmly in place without any movement between the filter stages the only work remaining is really just to close everything up [Music] you can actually tell by the interruption in the plasma stream we are not fully cutting through the 16 gauge thick sheet metal for this particular project that's all okay though in terms of safety i'm using a low profile mask to filter out fine particles from the air i'm breathing when i recorded this video in california we had fires all over the place and the general area around where i live was not healthy to breathe either as before i tack weld a nut in the back and that's it there was one challenge though i needed a screw to hold the cover in place right underneath the filter box and i could not quite reach that with the welder so i need a little help you will see with the temporary tack weld in place i can properly weld the front and then just get rid of the tuck welded helper field there we go the only remaining item that is left is an inlet if you recall the theme baffle had the six and square opening and i'm now trying to adapt it to a six inch diameter round inlet i took some sheet metal and rolled it on my homemade roller and now just weld the seam [Music] without any sheet metal tools my bending operations are a little bit odd i now need to create the square box on which i will establish the transition to a round profile [Music] the idea here is that i will make four cuts into the round profile and bend the pieces of the inlet so that they align with the square box 16 gauge sheet metal is surprisingly thick and this would have been much easier to do under heat actually the whole construction from square to round transition could have been done using a single sheet of metal and a bending break anyway with a lot of welding i'm thinking of the welder as a metal printer that fills in all my gaps of imposition the inlet slowly comes together it does not look pretty but it will work the remaining work for the inlet is a base plate that i can attach to the metal dust collector with screws the plasma cutter is handy to just quickly cut it out i'm using a piece of straight steel to guide the cut which is definitely better than my wobbly hands i am using the existing cover to place the screw holes and will drill those with a cover in place as a template at least the holes should match up then now i just need to cut away the inside yes the plasma cutter will do that for me again and then weld the base plate to the inlet and voila inlet is ready for action [Music] it is interesting that i can get away with so much inaccuracy on the other hand it also makes this project very forgiving it means that in my limited time i can make steady progress the inlet is a little bit long and i'm cutting it to a shorter length with a cutting disc this way it will not stick out too much from the dust collector but will still leave me enough room to connect pipes with all the pieces done i figured i would take care of the optics of it as well with the help of my wife it shows a very cool performance boosting two color scheme this is my first time to play with director metal paint and i get to use a high volume low pressure spray gun that has been unused for almost a decade the shop is not really meant for hanging anything so i repurposed some of the construction table tubes in my sawhorses with a couple adapters that i quickly welded together before i can paint the sheet metal i need to remove the grime from it using an industrial degreaser that is working quite well another interesting challenge that i did not foresee was that with the limited space in the shop and the existing lighting it was somewhat difficult to see what i was doing to protect my lungs i was also wearing my positive pressure respirator with organic vapor filters the face shield was hard to see through as well so i mostly was guessing at overlapping the paint while spraying nonetheless it was working quite well and two coats of paint seemed to be fully sufficient [Music] the rest of the dust collector will be sprayed with an accent color to be honest the coloring is mostly just for fun but i am hoping that it will provide at least some rust protection as well to protect the windings and the nuts i place some painters tape those areas will not be painted but they will also not be visible my other hope is that the paint will make the inlet a little bit less ugly as well overall this works surprisingly well and does not use a lot of paint much much better than just brake cans there you have it everything painted and just waiting for assembly [Music] putting everything back together took much longer than i thought and i needed to replace a few nuts as well instead of putting it back together with screws i just used medium carbon bolts with hex heads anyway here it is all put together since it's a mighty machine it cannot be complete without at least some stencils this was also a fun opportunity to design stencils on the computer and 3d print them i jury rigged the dust collector and gave it a test run there is still more work to be done but i figured we should see it in action at least once this definitely argues for a movable intake that i can place based on the stream of sparks let's try again [Music] we can definitely see that most of the sparks make it into the intake however that seems to be the case even without suction more testing is needed here and it will involve lasers i have had the dust collector and used now for a few months and wanted to get the sense of how well it is working ideally i would find a way to measure how much of the grinding dust ends up in the dust collector and how much of it remains in the air and potentially gets into my lungs you can see here how a beam of sunlight clearly shows the dust suspended in the air maybe there is something i can do with that a beam of strong light sounds like a laser to me so indeed i set up a 50 milliwatt laser with the diffraction pattern that fence it out into a plane here you can see how easily it highlights the smoke from the coal forge it looks quite pretty so let's watch it for a bit let's see if we can measure the performance of the dust collector by [Music] laser you can see that the laser picks up some clay sprinkled into the air but let's see how well it works with grinding dust not very well at all part of it is that the laser is not strong enough and the grinding dust is probably low albedo as well here's the comparison without running the dust collector i was hoping to count the frequencies of particles near the laser but it seems to be about the same [Music] i'm trying it with clay again with the dust collector on and off it's really hard to see though however i can say that in practice the intake chute ends up collecting a lot of the grinding sparks and there is definitely much less of it to be found on the floor in terms of using a laser to count the amount of suspender grinding stuff in the air well that clearly was not successful but still worth a try in the end i used some compressed air to chase more of the clay that is now all over the place into the dust collector that created some pretty pictures as well [Music] my next videos will go back to blacksmithing i'm forging a few tools that will help with forging access and a good blacksmithing for beginners projects you may also want to check out the video in which i'm giving away a mandalorian baskar ingot until then perhaps check out some of my videos on forging viking age swords or spears they are quite detailed and give you a good sense of all the skill involved in creating them for now i'm done with making videos on the dust collector but this is a new and well working tool in the shop hopefully it will help for everything to stay a little bit cleaner as always thanks to everyone on patreon if you are interested you can find updates and pictures there and you will also get access to these videos a few days early see you next time [Music]", "AIc7mwBLwG0": "hello and welcome to the shop if you're a penn turner like me i'm sure you faced this question how do i store my bushings every pen turner who turns more than one style of pin is going to have this question in the past i've been using plastic hobby boxes you can get them at the hobby store you can get them at the big box store the local walmart and their little boxes you open them up and there are little compartments in there i would store my bushings in those compartments but it always made me nervous if i ever drop this box and it hits the floor and the top pops open probably 20 to 24 sets of bushings are going to go all over the shop and then i've got a real nightmare trying to figure out which bushing goes to which set well a good buddy of mine eddie stipe we were on a live call and he showed me or gave me a little tour of his shop and he showed me his bushing storage and i totally ripped him off because this is honestly one of the best ideas i have ever seen for bushing storage you could literally drop the entire drawer full of bushings and never have a single issue so let me take you over to my bushing storage drawer and show you what we're going to do today i recently built this drawer and i've got two projects going right now with it one is bushing storage the other is building a front and that video will come out very soon so please don't take too close of a look at the front of the drawer it will look better when i'm finished but it's a full extension drawer and when you open it up the inside of the drawer is very spacious and we can just put our bushings right in there no problem that's not what we're gonna do we still have the issue of how do we keep these bushings separated so we know which kit they go to i went online to a company called uline and i purchased these four inch clear plastic tubes and these rubber caps i'm also purchasing a label maker and i'll print a label that can be put right on the front of this tube that will list the bushing id number as well as the kit that it goes to and let me show you what we're going to make today this is a test piece that i use it's just a board i drew a line right down the center of it and i drilled 5 8 inch holes all the way down the center of the board cut it in half on the bandsaw and what we're going to do is i'm gonna place it in here i'll put some type of a brace between it so that i can keep it from moving around it'll set nicely in the drawer and we'll have all of our tubes laid out in the drawer with readable labels right on top i got some scrap wood and i cut some little blocks just kind of sanded them up so they were nice and smooth and i've sort of just laid them in here to kind of get an idea of how many racks i can put in the drawer i split my blanks in half with a line i then found the center and every 7 8 of an inch i put a dimple we're going to head over to the drill press and using a 5 8 inch bit i'm going to drill holes at each of these dimples so i've got all of the holes drilled in my pieces there are 11 holes per piece now that's not overly important except to say that with seven pieces times 11 holes i will be able to hold 77 tubes full of bushings so way more than i have currently so i've got plenty of room to grow you'll notice that the line that i drew down the center of each one of these pieces is still there we're going to take these to the band saw and split them in half and each one we split in half will form the left and the right half of a rack to hold those individual tubes with everything cut apart we're now ready for the fun part of the project and that is a little light sanding to clean everything up before we start assembling our racks after i finished sanding my rack pieces i grabbed two tubes and i put the rubber caps on them place one at each end of the rack and then stretch the rack out until it touches the rubber tubes from there i'm going to take an interior measurement which is two and almost an eighth so what i'm going to do is cut several two inch pieces that can be glued between the ends of each of these rack pieces and that should give me a very nice rack to place into my drawer i've got all of my connecting pieces cut they're two inches exactly it's time to go ahead and glue everything up in this configuration i used my label maker and i made labels for many of my sets of bushings i do have a few more sets than this i just haven't dug them all out yet those labels will be applied right to the tubes the bushings will be inserted in the tubes and these will be displayed in the drawer after i finished labeling all of the tubes i placed the racks in the drawer and the tubes on the racks and now my bushings are very easy to find and i've got plenty of room for expansion almost half of my drawer is still empty the plans for this half of the drawer are many of the bushings are too large to fit in the half inch diameter tubes so i'm going to buy some three quarter inch diameter tubes and we'll build some racks and we'll store those bushings in this end of the drawer i am very happy to have added this drawer and this tube method of storing bushings to my shop for a couple of reasons the first of which is it is literally right behind my lathe so if i'm turning a pin i can turn around open the drawer easily identify the set of bushings i need and retrieve them to get right back to turning that's a huge bonus the other advantage is i always worried about what would happen if i dropped my bushing case it hit the floor popped open bushings went everywhere not only would you have to spend time trying to re-identify which bushings went with which kit but how many bushings would have rolled in a place in the shop that you'd never see them again they just sort of disappear with this method if i were to pull that drawer all the way out and drop it to the floor each plastic tube it has rubber caps on the end of it they're not going to pop open the tubes might roll everywhere they'll be easy to retrieve and store right back in the drawer that is a huge advantage for me so i'm very happy about having this i hope you consider building something like this in your shop i want to thank you for joining me for this video i want you to know that you are always welcome in my shop come back and see me again real soon and have a great evening you", "4p_46ZduVnw": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] all right so let's turn the grinder on this is the main power we'll cut power to the VFD this is your forward stop reverse so this uses the VFD to break so if you turn the power on you're here let's light wine that's the VFD kicking on and then this is the forward something is wrong and then stop reverse something's wrong but we don't know forward speed yeah [Music] because hey everybody Chad seek anything to welcome back to the channel how you do office is finding you well it's warm here in Washington Washington I'm here with Thaddius this guy was real mean because he told me all it's a balmy you know it's so cool it's so nice it's refreshing it's warm out here I'm not used to some a lot I'm a Western Washington Tony in I don't know how these guys survived but anyhow I'm with Thaddius his shirt speaks for himself this is black hawks this guy is a knife make grinder genius this is my new knife grinder and I want to make you do see you all to Thaddeus because of the fact I came across to an Instagram yep and it was amazing cuz I'm looking for a grinder I've been shopping around for grinder and I wanted to give myself something for my 10,000 subscribers that hopefully he's gonna do that sometime this year and I also been very busy and I found one grinder is not cutting it mm-hmm so I needed a second grinder but I'm seeing guys with grinders that rotated under axes yeah and did you know basically horizontal grinding and I need that but they're huge yeah these big V of DS variable frequency frequency drivers this variable speed drive but variable frequency drive yeah and it's a big box and then it's this big grinder and they're heavy and they're awkward and they're a boatload of money as we were talking earlier and then I came across Thaddeus on Instagram and I just reached out to them and and Here I am six months later yeah that's a later so it's been a long thing it's been a long road to hoe I've been very busy this year and so is Thaddeus because he's designing and engineering all this himself so that is this is YouTube he's no stranger to YouTube he's got that it's black fox land supplies by parts knife works works everything just basically done everything in my garage I don't have a photography background so it's very basic you know it's more photography than me stubble that mark learning and then you get the same thing with Instagram yeah because that's how we learn about you there yeah I'm more active on Instagram somewhat on Facebook okay how though okay now I know your back's pretty bullets everybody else how did you get your start in I guess why a grinder yeah so I start at night making probably three years ago from a colleague we're both engineers at a company here in Walla Walla Washington and I just enjoyed knife making a lot you know being a mechanical engineer that background of metallurgy and making something which is really fascinating so when I started the grinder search you know probably about four years ago I saw a lot of good options out there but nothing that really did what I wanted it to do with my mechanical engineering background I thought you know I can I can make something that is more cost-effective for people as well as you know learn more about business and how to run a business and and have fun with it really it's cool and this is so small of a package and so clean and streamlined I was commenting on this is the V this is VFD breaker this this little spot right here it's amazing and we got here early and we got to watch you assemble everything and put all of this together and and it was so cool the design ideas that you came with different types of materials not just metals but different types of materials and how you just use yourself as a sounding board with your background and knowing what would work good with this and then kind of trial my hair yeah and it just led to this and it was it's so impressive what he came across this no there's something else that you dabbled it okay so not only does he have a full time job he's married he has 20 dogs five of five or six lizards ooh it's a zoo and he does falconry yeah which I thought was cool so what led to that how'd you get into that one so that was really by my wife she worked with Raptors at wcu and the rehabilitation center so she really liked working with them and hanging out with them and we moved back to Eastern Washington from Seattle we kind of had the opportunity you know more space a little bit more house for your money here and so we looked around and found a falconry sponsor in the area and you decided to take us on so we've been doing that for probably about five years now so it's so funny and like talk about such a strange background yeah and all this different stuff and it's and again things are meant to be a certain way because here you go to you go off to college okay you're closer to me yeah okay for school and then you could probably get work out there with all the big companies that are out there yeah but yet you end up meeting your wife get into falconry come back to your hometown mm-hmm and then find a falconry mentor for the most part yeah it just all kind of just matched now just kind of was meant to be it was just meant for you to be here again exactly it was meant for me to come over here and sweat yeah and eat on Washington I'm melting away everybody that's like a no no no well getting back to the grinder though because that's what this is all about you have a huge table and what was this table made out of again this is called Thomas Eagle is the generic name or it's called Delrin by 3m it is a material that we use a lot in the food industry that's my current backgrounds we also use it for and like ups where they do all their sliding packages so it's a really nice sliding surface it's not gonna rest on you because it is a plastic material it is a very hard and durable plastic material some people liken it to aluminum but you get that editability of being able to slide it so when you're working on a knife or you have a jig on here it just really makes it really easy to work with this table actually could rotate and go basically parallel with this my platen so you can grind like this or better yet well let's show won't you show me what this does this is amazing it rotates see what I mean guys this is what I meant about that and then you can take this table off and spin it around and it does that so now you can work granite won't be this high you guys know that but you can do this and work all your edges the belly the of your blade your spying everything working on here really nice and if you're not doing knives doing other types of metal fabricating it gives you that perfect option it's a it's just amazing and then also this could come off and you could do you could take the table off you could take the platen off you do 10 inch grinding wheels you have a new grinding wheels 10 12 14 smooth and serrated and all those dimensions we do a surface grinder we're working on a few other attachments that will come out at plate show us this year in 2019 so yeah man bleach Oh laughs I'm not gonna be their gang I can't do it but he's gonna be there so you're gonna have to look him out if you're gonna watch this and be there check it out that Portland alright yep Portland Oregon this year that's gonna be great your motor yes that's impressive yeah because that's a Leeson Louise Sam you have two ORS are motor runs thirty-six rpm 3,600 rpm so it's working in you know a large manufacture we have I get a lot of good contacts with motor supplier so we get a pretty good deal on this and it works really well with the VFD I know a lot of you guys are technical out there so this is a premium efficiency motor and that's the only way you could pair it with the chassis small enough to fit it in the base something like a standard ball door it draws too much power but these premium efficient motors are perfect for that and this can be ran you've got it wired right now for 110 or go you got to 2110 yeah okay it's we're right here for 110 right now so I'm gonna have to either leave it at 110 or figure out how to do one-to-one 220 yeah so you can do it either way just like Frankenstein I get the shock when I first got and it was 110 and then I switched it over to 220 actually buddy electrician buddy Curt I know you're watching this guess what you're gonna do pal you're gonna have to help me with this he came over and he helped me switching over to 220 and we did all that stuff but I already got one fence sign I could use it for right now and then I can convert it over since I already have the spare 220 that I can I could probably use yeah but it's anything else you want to talk about because there's so much with the the compacted Nisour the body the fact that the VFD is in here the motor is amazing direct drive mine's belt yeah old-fashioned I learned from Jeff sorry Jeff but it's a little old-school everybody just say you got a removal link every couple years because the belt just gets stretched in yeah it's less moving parts you know just a really simplistic design is what you want to look for when you buy really anything how simple is that to use to maintain so I've really tried to strip everything down towards as simple as possible reduces cost that way and makes a better user experience now folks want this what are they gonna do alright you can go on our website black fox knife works calm or find us on instagram at black box knife works there as well okay it's just basically picking put in your shopping cart and just go and just checkout and that's it yep right now we use a website that allows us to do flat rate shipping so if you want to actual quote for shipping just email us we can send you quotes through email with the exact number otherwise that it'll charge 180 for shipping and then if it comes out less already find you okay well that's cool anything like any key factors that you want to say like if somebody's getting you and the grinders that are that I had a couple of guys that have been following me I talked with them their new knife makers even as a hobbyist I think this would be really good as a hobbyist because it's not just for an iced exactly so what would you say for you know for other people if they're sitting around looking at other competitors why I know now why you versus others because not only have I been here for the last 3-4 hours we're going through everything but watching you someone talking about the materials but for them because the videos not going to be that big you know what could you tell that why why this versus some of those other competitors what do you think sets you apart what really sets part I think are a couple things first is the dry plate we use a really heavy-duty dry plate that way if you flip it in horizontal or vertical it doesn't rotate on you or sag the drive plate because this motor is about 50 pounds so you need some really strong that doesn't do that we designed it all with a single reference surface which means that as you add components that reference surface your manufacturing tolerances can skew the grinder tracking we've designed this such that the tracking and forward and reverse is pretty much dead on once you get that you're you're good to go a lot of manufacturers you know I talked to guys that played showed so you know we only provide reverse because as you know it's really hard to get it in Reverse it is really hard to get forward and reverse tracking out of a grinder and this one's so smooth yeah very same you turn it on and as soon as you wanted to switch it from forward to reverse and it just or stopped it instead of killing the power you just flip to the neutral the yeah you put it in stop right there yeah and this motor just it just stopped instantly yeah and then it would go back and forth for reserves so smoothly yeah yeah I mean the power was impressive yes that's I've been making knives for a better part of five years in might an old Frankenstein doesn't do more than 1700 rpm this is 36 and you know as you build your skills a knife making you know you can start off with a dedicated vertical grinder you can you can totally do that you could be with you you know 1 by 32 or belts and work your way up but once you get into more my knifes and you start making more knives and you want to get better more efficient tool change over time between a grinder to grinder can be can be your next step to where you try to optimize and bring that cost down so by providing a grinder that is to purpose horizontal and vertical you can save money by not having to grinders while having a little bit more tool change over time because you're not just sloping from one to the other but it still gives you know a really good cost-effective way of getting into profiling flip it over grinding your bevels and you got we can buy an extra arm like I was talking about so I got to get extras and get tech wheel from you used to do the same thing extra arms so you do small kind of tech wheels for like when I do guys you'll you'll see you've seen when I make that grinding but I'm doing grinding videos you'll see how the belt goes to almost like a point that's my other small contact wheels you could do everything on this I can rotate it which is really cool so yeah and you recommended like you were asking before about the bench to workstation I'm gonna bill is I said it would yeah that would probably be a really good yeah option for that because the woods gonna absorb some more of that energy wouldn't it yeah so on my website I've done a full full technical of vibrations for design so go check that out it's a lot more explanation I think I wanna do here then a lot more new ease yeah yeah like with how you design this to begin with exactly all the vibration stuff that's really cool I mean the guys that might be really into this kind of stuff reach off of Thaddeus contact him talk with him email him he can go through all that stuff now but I'm impressed and the other reason why guys you know I like to support the small businesses he's here in Washington stain that was another big thing when we talked months ago I'm like okay I could go to these other Grindr companies and businesses and have a mail to me but I drove all about here I drove out here we're staying out in the tent everything we draw here cuz I wanted to eat him onto video I want to promote the business he makes knives you could say you're a competitor but I mean this is amazing give credit where credit's due guys it's got it's a small world and instead of is that we were mentioning I've come across some guys that are very defensive or very combative when it comes to knife industry yeah but you've got it I mean you make different knives than I do you do different things this is a huge niche that you have that's gonna help me help my son that's gonna help other knife makers and that's why you know that's why I wanted to showcase that is because I think this is important and I think building the relationships and the friendships within the knife community is important because there might be something I don't understand I'm gonna reach out to you I'm gonna reach out to my kitty come knives okay I might reach out to will Staedtler or Alec and I music hey guys what about this this you know the way that our Seattle buddy Forge yeah Dave the Tuthill sorry Dave I'm just only chatted with you a little bit an Instagram yeah but another guy a really nice guy just the quick little chat I had you want to keep it that you want to keep that tight community you want to talk like that yes at the end we're knife makers you're trying to compete for a customer but it should be a cutthroat industry no pun intended you know it should be something that we can all get along and learn from each other yeah because there's so many guys that don't know certain things about knives like you do you like the business aspect you'll want to learn more about that and I want to learn more about this and I want to order just how to be a better knife maker for my customers yeah what product can i what can I do that I'm not doing now to give my the end-user my customer a better knife at the end or even faster yeah and I think that's will do that yeah so so gay thank you appreciate it remember like share subscribe all the good stuff keep me from the bottom of the YouTube bucket yeah Thaddius thank you very much sir you've preciate all hospitality as well yeah I'm gonna go and sit down on the couch for a little while and Thaddeus is gonna go load this in the truck so ah [Music] [Music] you", "5bsBgsBZwP0": "hey everyone what's up guys how are you guys doing today okay guys so you welcome back to my channel and you're welcome back to today's video okay so in today's video i'm gonna be showing you a cellulite removal remedy now this is actually going to help you to smooth out your skin you know removing all of those lumpy lumpy stuff okay and it's going to make your skin really really plump literally so if you want to know all of the natural ingredients that i use for this video do continue watching and don't forget to thumbs up subscribe and share and now let me take you right into this video okay guys this is an this is a great way to get rid of cellulite now are you actually troubled with your cellulite and you've actually been trying so many things you cannot find solution this is a very simple solution that would actually help to get rid of all of your sunlight and your skin will go smooth again okay guys so here i have my coffee now you can use either your coffee grain or a finger coffee like this any coffee you have as long as this is a coffee it's just going to serve okay so what we're going to do now is that's going to be i'm going to be turning the coffee into this bone you have to take a reasonable quantity of coffee not too much here so this is about one teaspoon of coffee which is okay except you are applying it on a large place on your skin that's when you will be needing it much about up to two tablespoons yeah all right guys so the very next thing with that which is very important for this cellulite um removal remedy is this and this is sugar now sugar has a smaller grinder particles and as such it helps so much in terms of scrubbing out cellulite on your skin and it also helps to leave the skin looking smooth to also help for removal of cellulite when mixed with um coffee okay so what we're going to do here is that when you're taking your sugar you have to take a good quantity of the sugar because that is the particles in the sugar is actually what we need is scrubbing out your cellulite alongside your coffee yeah okay so after you've put it together you then mix it and mash it together yeah just like this you have to mix it dry first then also the very next ingredient which is very important and needed here is petulum jelly now you need your skin to stay moisturized as much as you have those cellulite on your skin you need your skin to stay moisturized and petroleum jelly is going to do you know create a glow and leave the moisture lock into your skin preventing further cellulite and also making your skin glow most definitely so peculiar jelly is actually well needed for this particular ingredient here okay so i've actually put a little of the petroleum jelly in here but the camera die but i just want to show you guys here so so you put in your petroleum jelly the next thing you do is that you're going to mix this up really well just like that so try and mix it first this is one powerful and strong cellulite treatments you can actually make this and store it yeah so that you have it it's not going to go bad even if you store it for some while okay so the very next ingredient you're going to be needing is egg now do you know that egg actually helps so much in tightening up your skin creating a glow onto your skin and reducing the appearances of fluffy skin and loose skin so mixing it up with coffee alongside with sugar scrub it's going to be ideal to remove cellulite okay so what i'm going to do i'm going to be breaking in just a little of the egg don't know how to stay it's don't don't over put the egg so that it won't the treatment will be watery okay you need the treatment to stay thick and firm enough to enable you scrub all right so as you mix do not um take too much of time because of the sugar so that the sugar would not dissolve all right into the bowl now when is when the sugar dissolves there won't be any particles for you to scrub with so you you have to make sure that in as much as you mix the sugar does not dissolve totally so after doing that anywhere you have cellulite which is mostly on the thai and of of course you guys know i can't show you my ties so i'm actually going to be demonstrating this using my hands yeah those places you have your cellulites your tie and your back side you grab this treatments you're done mixing you grab it like this and then you put it onto your back side and your tie now you'll have to massage it really really well as you massage you're going to be feeling the sugar particles on your skin that is actually why i told you that you are not supposed to um make the sugar particles dissolve completely now the sugar particles is going to go around your skin you know scrubbing your skin off and then removing all of those cellulite all right so for this one to collaterate when you want to scrub it you can scrub it in an upward and downward direction just like this okay or you can do it in a circular motion it depends on the on on which one you actually want to do okay so after which you scrub it then you have to leave it on on your skin for some for some minutes okay let the treatment just sit today and help you in getting rid of the cellulite yeah so for those treatments you have if you can and if you really want this to work guys you'd have to use it two times in a day for a couple of weeks for at least one week a few days or two weeks or two about okay you have to use it twice every day so you just mix it like this and keep it in your um so that's it now in some cases you can actually use a brush you know you know use it with these products and then scrub your cellulite area and you're going to be feeling really really good it's going to smooth it out and it's going to be glowing okay guys so that's it if you do love this video please don't forget to give me a thumbs up subscribe to my channel and share this video and i will see you again in my next video bye guys", "UdlBIzJLw4c": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] fundamentals of gasoline engine repair this training program on fundamentals of gasoline engine repair is intended for the technician who is just getting into the field of engine repair and is eager to learn more about it now although this program provides a general overview of gasoline engine repair it does not replace the specific information in the various service manuals instead it has been designed to complement the information in the service manuals and this program is the direct result of requests from retail service managers through the 1991 partnership study and the only the best club now to help us out 1991 national technician advisory council member steve mckenna from doble chevrolet has kindly agreed to demonstrate the procedures and techniques we'll cover today and in this program on fundamentals of gasoline engine repair we'll cover operation diagnosis inspection during disassembly component checks and measurements and assembly tips and techniques operation the gasoline engine that's used in every general motors car and truck is of the four-stroke cycle design a four-stroke engine is so named because it has four distinct cycles of operation in order they are intake compression power and exhaust the intake stroke begins when the intake valve opens and the piston begins moving down in the cylinder as the piston moves down the cylinder it creates a vacuum this vacuum draws the air fuel mixture from the inlet port into the cylinder filling it the compression stroke begins when the inlet valve closes and the piston begins moving up the cylinder as the piston moves up it compresses the air fuel mixture readying it for the power stroke the power stroke starts when the piston is at or near the top of its stroke at this point both intake and exhaust valves are closed then the spark plug ignites the compressed air fuel mixture when the air fuel mixture is ignited the fuel begins burning rapidly expanding as it burns the expanding mixture pushes down on the piston which rotates the crankshaft producing power the exhaust stroke begins just before the piston reaches the bottom of its stroke at this time the exhaust valve opens and the pressure in the cylinder causes the exhaust's air fuel mixture to rush out the exhaust port as the piston moves up the cylinder it expels most of the remaining gas completing the fourth and last cycle of engine operation diagnosis in this segment we'll discuss excessive oil consumption abnormal noises and poor performance diagnosis that leads to engine repair is usually the result of three types of symptoms excessive oil consumption abnormal noises and poor performance but just because a vehicle exhibits one or more of these symptoms doesn't mean the engine requires repair and that's the case for careful diagnosis so let's take a closer look at each of these symptoms beginning with excessive oil consumption excessive oil consumption is probably one of the most frequent complaints you'll hear when you're in the business of engine repair but you need to know that oil consumption can be external or internal external oil consumption is a result of leaky gaskets seals or gasketed components and you need to find and correct every external leak before you can determine if there truly is a problem with internal oil consumption but use common sense if an engine has a lot of miles on it the major cause of oil consumption may very well be worn rings or bearings not an external oil leak now if an external oil leak is not readily apparent clean the engine and add fluorescent oil additive j28431-1 to the oil then let the engine run for a while to allow the dye to mix with the oil after 10 or 15 minutes have passed direct the high intensity black light from kit j28 428-e at the suspected areas of leakage any oil leakage will glow a green or yellow under the beam of a black light now internal oil consumption is the result of engine oil leaking into the combustion chamber where it is burned internal oil consumption is most frequently caused by leaking valve guide seals or worn valve guides but it can also be caused by excessive bearing clearances plugged oil drain back holes in the cylinder head misaligned piston ring end gaps worn or stuck piston rings and even a faulty pcv valve if the engine is using oil excessively you need to ask yourself two questions one which components are most likely to cause oil consumption and 2 which components are easiest to check since the pcv valve can cause excessive oil consumption and it's the easiest component to check check it first be very suspicious of the pcv valve if the excessive oil consumption problem developed after the pcv valve was changed if the pcv valve is old or plugged replace it and be sure never to interchange pcv valves just because two valves look the same doesn't mean they have the same flow rate and the use of the wrong valve can cause oil consumption now one easy way to determine if you're dealing with an internal oil consumption problem is to start the engine cold if a puff of blue smoke comes out of the tailpipe during startup the problem is most likely due to faulty valve stem seals or worn valve guides then let the engine warm up to normal operating temperature and then quickly floor the accelerator pedal if the oil consumption problem is significant you'll see blue smoke come out of the tailpipe you can usually further subdivide the problem by when the smoke occurs if it occurs when you first put the accelerator pedal to the floor chances are good that the piston rings are worn on the other hand if the smoke occurs when you take your foot off the accelerator pedal the problem most likely lies with the valve stem seals or valve guides to isolate the problem remove the spark plugs from each cylinder and check to see if they're filed with oil note any plugs that are fouled and be sure to double check the valve stem seals valve guides intake manifold gasket and piston rings for that particular cylinder when you disassemble the engine abnormal noises are another typical complaint and some abnormal engine compartment noises may be due to an internal engine problem but some aren't so before attempting an engine repair as a result of an abnormal noise you need to determine whether or not the engine is actually causing the noise if an abnormal noise is heard when the vehicle is standing still and the engine is running chances are the noise is due to an engine accessory or the engine itself squeals and squeaks are usually caused by loose or glazed accessory drive belts you can differentiate component accessory noises from internal engine noises by simply removing the drive belt from each accessory one at a time if the sound stops after removing a particular drive belt the accessory the drive belt was connected to is the source of the noise just remember that if you remove the water pump drive belt only run the engine long enough to see if the water pump is responsible for the noise or you may run the risk of overheating the engine of course this type of testing only applies to engines that use separate drive belts for each engine driven accessory engines that use a single serpentine drive belt to run all the accessories as well as many engine noises can be diagnosed using a technician stethoscope the advantage to using a technician stethoscope is that it can help you pinpoint the location of noises to use the stethoscope slip the ear pieces into your ears then simply touch the end of the stethoscope rod to the area where you believe the noise is coming from if the noise increases in volume when you touch the area with the stethoscope you found the source of the noise alternately you can also use a length of hose to help you locate some types of noises but before you disassemble an engine due to an abnormal sound you need to characterize the sound is it a ticking sound you hear or is it a knocking wrapping or rumbling sound is the noise light heavy or hollow is it engine speed sensitive or more noticeable when the engine is under a load these questions need to be answered before you begin engine disassembly now here are some general guidelines as to the source of some common noises a ticking noise usually indicates something is wrong in the valve train it could be something as simple as an engine oil level that's too low or too high or maybe there's slack between the push rod and rocker arm or maybe the return spring on a mechanical fuel pump is broken now steady knocking noises that are relative to engine speed are usually due to a component or components that are connected to or are in contact with the crankshaft pistons piston pins rod bearings and main bearings all fall into this category however loose torque converter bolts or a loose or cracked flywheel can sound a lot like a rod bearing knock so be sure to check for these before disassembling the engine if you do find a crack flywheel or flex plate be sure to check the alignment between the center line of the crankshaft and the center line of the transmission input shaft misalignment here is the usual cause of flywheel or flex plate cracking in the reference book supplied with this program you'll find a listing of all the different types of noises you'll be most likely to encounter take some time to read the various descriptions carefully then keep the book in your toolbox for quick on the job reference poor performance is another common symptom that may indicate the engine needs to be repaired but you need to do some careful checking first  ignition timing a slipping clutch dragging brakes and faulty fuel or ignition systems can cause a poor performance complaint but these things certainly don't require that the engine be repaired however some items that would cause poor performance requiring engine repair are low compression a leaky or blown cylinder head gasket worn camshaft lobes and incorrect valve timing let's take a look at these one at a time a compression test measures an engine's ability to compress air and this test will allow you to check the sealing properties of the piston rings valves and cylinder head gasket to perform a compression test the engine must be warm the battery in good condition the throttle plates open and all spark plugs removed doing this allows the engine to seal properly and lets the engine crank at an rpm high enough to ensure accurate test results before starting the tests the ignition system must be disabled you can do this by following the instructions in your service manual after the ignition system is disabled screw a compression tester into the spark plug hole for cylinder number one make sure the needle is at zero by bleeding off any residual pressure now have an assistant crank the engine while you watch the needle on the compression tester the reading should rise on each compression stroke normally you'll need four to six compression strokes to achieve full pressure for each cylinder depending on the type of engine if the ceiling of the cylinder is good compression will build up quickly and evenly to specifications however if the piston rings are leaking compression will be low on the first stroke and will build up on the following strokes but will not reach normal now if the valves are leaking compression will be low on the first stroke but it won't really build up on the following strokes as it would with leaking rings if the reading for a particular cylinder is below specifications perform a wet compression test by putting about three squirts of engine oil into the cylinder then run the compression test again if the pressure reading rises more than about 10 pounds chances are the piston rings are worn the oil has sealed them enough to increase the pressure in the cylinder on the other hand if the compression reading changed by less than 10 pounds the valves aren't sealing properly now when you finish testing all the cylinders compare their readings if two adjacent cylinders have similar pressures that are significantly lower than the other cylinders chances are good that the cylinder head gasket between those two cylinders is blown this would allow pressure to bleed off from one cylinder to the other which would account for the low pressure readings camshaft lift can also affect engine performance if the camshaft lobes are excessively worn performance will diminish or the engine may run roughly an obvious sign of possible camshaft lobe wear is a loose rocker arm now camshaft lift can be measured when the camshaft is in the engine or out of it for demonstration purposes we'll show how to measure lift with the cam in the block now on engines with the camshaft located in the block one of the easiest ways to check cam lobe lift is at the rocker arm end of the push rod and since you need to check the total lift you'll need to position the camshaft lobe to its lowest point known as the heel to do this slowly rotate the crankshaft so the push rod end of the rocker arm you'll be checking lift at is at its lowest position then remove the rocker arm and ball next mount the dial indicator and stand from kit j8520 to any relatively flat steel or iron surface in the area where you'll be working now position the end of the dial indicator stem so it fits into the lube hole in the end of the push rod and is aligned with the push rod then lower the indicator stem onto the push rod so the needle of the indicator rotates about one revolution or so this pre-loading of the indicator helps ensure accurate readings then rotate the ring on the indicator so the needle points to zero now while watching the indicator needle slowly rotate the crankshaft in its normal direction of rotation as you rotate the crankshaft the indicator needle will reach a high point then as you rotate the crankshaft further a low point at this low point the indicator should read zero if not rotate the ring on the indicator until the needle lines up with the zero mark this is called zeroing the indicator and is required to get an accurate camshaft lift reading now slowly rotate the crankshaft one more time while watching the indicator note its reading just as it reaches its highest point this reading represents camshaft lift compare this reading to the specifications listed in the appropriate service manual if camshaft lift isn't within specifications the lobes are excessively worn so the camshaft and lifters will have to be replaced inspection during disassembly in this part of the program we won't illustrate the engine disassembly step by step instead we'll concentrate on the telltale signs of trouble you need to watch for during engine disassembly with that in mind let's begin after removing a rocker arm and ball assembly take a close look at their mating surfaces deep grooves in either the rocker arm or ball can indicate that the engine oil wasn't changed according to the owner's manual damage of this type dictates that the rocker arm and ball assembly be replaced now loose or broken cylinder head bolts as well as damaged cylinder head gaskets can cause cylinder head sealing problems such as low compression and two adjacent cylinders or coolant that's mixed with the engine oil so as you remove the cylinder head bolts take note of any that are loose or broken if you find any remove the cylinder head then carefully examine the head gasket a close inspection of the head gasket can give you strong clues as to what caused the problem for example a head gasket that wasn't compressed evenly suggests that the cylinder head or block is warped possibly as a result of overheating or the head bolts weren't tightened completely or they were bottomed out erosion of the gasket between two adjacent cylinders can indicate a low spot on the cylinder head or block this low spot prevents the head gasket from being clamped securely which in turn can allow hot exhaust gases or coolant to eat away at the gasket camshaft timing is another critical area the camshaft has to be correctly timed to the crankshaft in order for the engine to operate if the camshaft isn't timed correctly the valves will be open when the piston is on the power or compression stroke or the piston will be at the wrong position in the cylinder when the valves are closed either situation will cause the engine to run poorly or not at all and in some cases it can even cause bent valves so you need to check camshaft timing also be sure to check the condition of the timing chain if the timing chain is excessively loose it can jump on the sprockets which would cause engine performance to change or in some cases bent valves so be sure to check the condition of the timing chain during disassembly and replace it and the timing gears if there's any question about them and what's true for timing chains is also true for timing belts a loose timing belt can cause the engine to jump time just like a loose timing chain timing belt tension can be checked using this general rule of thumb if you can twist the edge of the belt more than 90 degrees using about three or four pounds of pressure the belt needs to be retention also if you see any cracking on the belt the belt should be replaced refer to the proper service manual for these procedures now when the cylinder heads are off you can check the condition of the cylinder bores the cylinder bores should be smooth with no signs of deep vertical scratches scoring discoloration or cracking now although cracking is highly unusual it usually occurs in the middle of the cylinder any visible cracks mean the block must be replaced turning our attention to the main bearing caps you should note that you need to make sure that they were installed correctly each cap may have a number that is cast or stamped into it this number indicates the caps position on the block the number one cap is fitted to the front of the block closest to the timing chain or belt and the cap numbers grow higher toward the flywheel end of the block if the main bearing caps are not marked mark them with a punch before removal this will help you install them in the proper position main bearing caps also usually have an arrow cast into them this arrow should point to the end of the engine where the timing chain or timing belt is positioned if the main bearing caps are not in the right sequence or are turned around the chances of a bearing problem are increased greatly so if you see the bearing caps are in the wrong sequence or turned around you'll know why the bearing for the misposition cap is severely worn and if you find the bearing is damaged be sure to check the crankshaft for signs of damage as well the crankshaft journals and thrust surfaces should be smooth and shiny with no scratches scoring or signs of discoloration now both rod and main bearings can last a long time if correctly sized installed in a clean environment and carefully fitted according to a major bearing manufacturer 45 percent of bearing failures are due to dirt on the bearings during assembly this is followed by misassembly 13 misalignment thirteen percent insufficient lubrication eleven percent overloading ten percent and corrosion four percent the interesting thing is that in many cases bearings fail prematurely from a combination of these causes consequently if a bearing has failed prematurely you need to find the cause of the problem to prevent the failure from happening again the reference book supplied with this program details the most common bearing problems and their causes so be sure to take a close look at this section turning our attention to the cylinder block carefully check the oil return holes for signs of casting flash casting flash is residual metal unintentionally left over from the casting process this flash restricts the flow of oil returning to the oil pan and if the oil isn't allowed to return to the pan quickly enough the engine will starve for oil this will result in valve train noise and excessive engine wear so be sure to check for casting flash if you find any it can be removed with a die grinder or file now cracks in the block are another concern when checking for cracks take a close look at the lifter valley in extreme cases some cylinder blocks may develop cracks that usually run from the front of the engine to the back at about halfway up the side of the lifter valley these cracks can be caused by overheating or by a flaw in the casting if the block has any cracks you'll need to replace it and the vast majority of the time you'll be replacing it with a partial block assembly but check with your service manager to be sure finally prepare the block for cylinder head installation by running a tap through all the cylinder head bolt holes doing this helps clean out debris from the bolt holes and helps ensure an accurate bolt torque reading component checks and measurements in this section we'll talk about checking cylinder bore diameter measuring piston ring end gap and checking cylinder head flatness checking cylinder bore diameter is an important step as it allows you to judge whether or not an oversized piston is required or the cylinder needs to be re-bored to the next oversize to check the bore diameter push the plunger on checking gauge j8087 in and position the gauge in the cylinder push it down to the bottom of the bore then slowly pull it up while watching the reading on the dial note the highest reading then turn the gauge 90 degrees and take another reading a difference between these two readings indicates the bore is oval shaped now if either reading is just slightly beyond specification say one thousandth of an inch or so you can probably use a factory oversized piston however if either reading is significantly beyond specs the cylinder will have to be rebored and an oversized piston fitted measuring piston ring end gap will allow you to accurately judge whether or not the piston rings are worn or are the correct size for the cylinder they're being used in to perform this measurement on a block that hasn't been bored position each ring one at a time at the bottom of the cylinder bore then square the ring in the bore with a flat top piston then insert a feeler gauge into the end gap the largest feeler gauge that fits into the end gap represents maximum end gap if end gap is too large the piston rings and possibly the cylinder bore are worn and need to be replaced or serviced if the end gap is too small use a fine file to increase the end gap be sure to file the ring from the outside in to prevent chipping the piston ring coating checking cylinder head flatness is another important process a flat cylinder head and cylinder block deck are essential to the longevity and performance of the engine if the head or deck are warped coolant can migrate around the cylinder head gasket and mix with the engine oil this severely reduces the lubricating power of the oil which can lead to excessive engine wear and in extreme cases engine seizure a warped cylinder head or deck can also cause engine performance to suffer as it can allow combustion pressure to leak from one or more cylinders this lower pressure will result in lower engine performance since the procedure for checking the flatness of cylinder heads and cylinder block decks is the same we'll avoid repetition and only show how to check cylinder block decks to check the flatness of a cylinder block deck or head the gasket mating surface must be absolutely free of any gasket material or other debris this helps ensure an accurate measurement you'll also need a machinist straight edge and a set of feeler gauges now since cylinder blocks and heads tend to warp along their length begin checking for warpage by placing the narrow side of the straight edge in the middle of the block parallel to its length while lightly holding the straight edge in position try sliding a 1 000 inch thick feeler gauge between the straight edge and the block at at least four equally spaced points if the gauge fits in at any point try the next thicker gauge keep doing this until the gauge will not fit in the last feeler gauge that did fit in represents the amount of warpage be sure to note this reading then compare this reading to the specifications for maximum allowable warpage in the appropriate service manual if it's within specifications perform the check again positioning the straight edge from corner to corner as shown now depending upon the block or head you're checking it may need to be checked in as many as 10 places so be sure to refer to the appropriate service manual and if you find the block or head is warped it will have to be machined flat or in severe cases replaced assembly tips and techniques in this segment we'll cover camshaft timing measuring bearing clearances with gauging plastic piston ring orientation and intake manifold sealing now before we get into this last segment you should be aware of one thing and that's cleanliness an engine is comprised of many components working within extremely close tolerances any foreign substance such as dirt or sand that gets into the engine will act as a type of grinding compound destroying the surface finish of components and increasing their operating clearances because of this it's very important that all components and your hands be perfectly clean during measuring and assembly with that said let's begin camshaft timing is important to engine operation because both ignition timing and valve timing are based on a camshaft or camshafts that are accurately timed to the crankshaft if the camshaft is advanced or by just one tooth the engine will run poorly if it runs at all to ensure correct timing both the camshaft sprocket and crankshaft sprocket have a small dot circle or line near their outer diameter when these marks are aligned with each other as shown the camshaft timing is correct for all chevrolet v8 and v6 engines now other chevrolet engines use this same basic principle to set camshaft timing but because of the many variations on this theme you'll need to refer to the appropriate service manual for other engines now one of the biggest problems you're likely to encounter during engine assembly is keeping the camshaft and crankshaft sprockets in alignment with each other when installing the timing chain to avoid this problem trial fit the cam sprocket to the front of the cam and rotate the cam so that the timing mark on the cam sprocket points straight down to the six o'clock position and make sure the timing mark on the crankshaft sprocket is pointed directly at the 12 o'clock position next take the camshaft sprocket with its timing mark still pointed directly downward and slip it into the timing chain now slip the timing chain over the teeth on the crank sprocket then carefully position the sprocket onto the cam placing the alignment dowel on the cam into the dowel hole in the cam sprocket hold the sprocket in this position and screw in one of the cam sprocket retaining bolts finger tight then install the two remaining bolts now carefully tighten the retaining bolts until the sprocket is pulled flush against the front of the cam then check the timing mark alignment one last time if the marks are not aligned remove the camshaft sprocket and try again when the marks are aligned tighten the sprocket retaining bolts to specifications measuring bearing clearances with gauging plastic is what a lot of you may be doing in the future now in experienced hands a micrometer and telescoping gauge will provide the most precise measurement of bearing clearances however for those of you who aren't experienced in the use and feel of these tools gauging plastic will work nearly as well and is easier to use as a matter of fact use of gauging plastic is the only way you can measure main bearing clearances with the crankshaft still in the engine now gauging plastic is a precision extruded plastic that compresses at a controlled rate after it's compressed its thickness is compared to a scale on the outside of the package it came in when the thickness of one of the bars on the outside of the package matches the width of the compressed gauging plastic the number on the bar indicates the bearing clearance it's that simple now to check the main bearing clearances of an engine that's still in the vehicle all the main bearing caps except the one you're checking should be tightened to specifications and the crankshaft should be supported to take the load off of the lower bearings you also need to remove any oil that remains between the upper bearing and the crankshaft with a chlorinated solvent such as brake cleaner this will ensure the most accurate measurement when the surfaces are clean and dry pinch off a piece of the gauging plastic that's about a half inch longer than the bearing is wide now place the gauging plastic across the bearing and bend the ends over the side of the cap to help keep it from falling off then carefully place the cap into position on the block slip the bearing cap bolts through the cap and tighten them into the block with your fingers when the cap is seated into the block with the bolts tighten the bolts to specifications after the bolts are properly torqued loosen them and remove them while being careful not to drop the bearing cap when the cap is free of the block find the widest part of the compressed gauging plastic and match it to one of the sizing bars on the gauging plastic envelope when the two match read the number on the sizing bar this number represents the smallest clearance between the crankshaft and bearing now compare this number to the specifications in the shop manual if the measured bearing clearance is greater than specifications you will have to determine if the problem is the crankshaft or the bearing this can be done by installing a new standard size or oversized bearing and rechecking the clearance with gauging plastic if the clearance is still excessive the crankshaft will need to be ground and new oversized bearings fitted and keep in mind that this process can also be used to check the clearances of connecting rod bearings as well proper piston ring orientation is critical to engine compression and oil control piston rings are open on one end to allow for thermal expansion during engine operation the space between the two ends of each ring is called the end gap however if care isn't taken orienting these end gaps away from each other engine performance can suffer or oil consumption can soar for example if the end gaps of the compression rings are aligned with each other a substantial amount of cylinder compression can leak down into the crank case and this results in low power from the affected cylinder on the other hand if the end gap of the oil rings or rails as they're called are aligned with each other vacuum in the cylinder will pull oil into the cylinder and once the oil is in the cylinder it will be burnt along with the air fuel mixture so you can see the position of the piston ring end gaps is important to properly position the end gaps follow the positioning diagram in the proper service manual now intake manifold sealing is also important because a good seal between the intake manifold engine block and cylinder head is essential to proper engine operation a leak at any point here will result in a vacuum leak which can cause an unstable idle and surging at its worst an intake manifold leak can allow engine coolant to mix with the engine oil and this could result in a seized engine so you need to make sure the intake manifold is properly sealed especially when the heads have been resurfaced a sealing problem is more likely to occur on v8 and v6 engines due to the fact that the intake manifold has to seal against the heads and the block because of this you need to take extra care when sealing these areas first make sure the mating surfaces are absolutely clean now on intake manifolds that use a rubber seal at the front and rear make sure that the seal doesn't run up the side of the head then apply a generous dab of sealer where the seals meet the heads do this to both front and rear seals now on engines that rely on rtv for front and rear sealing use a chlorinated solvent to make sure the mating surfaces are absolutely clean and be sure to put a little extra sealer where the heads meet the block and run the sealer up the heads about 1 8 of an inch or so then immediately install the inlet manifold and torque it in the proper sequence to specifications if you follow these steps you'll minimize the chances of an intake manifold leak that completes this program on fundamentals of gasoline engine repair in this program we've covered operation diagnosis inspection during disassembly component checks and measurements and assembly tips and techniques now i know we've covered a lot of ground here today but if you put the techniques we've discussed into practice you'll be well on your way to becoming a respected engine repair technician and who knows maybe someday you'll become a national advisory council member just like steve mckenna [Music] you", "2W7v2K10crw": "[Music] foreign [Applause] [Music] okay tonight's sheet pan meal involves salmon so i got the salmon from costco it's a lot of it how many pounds is this 1.8 pounds i might you know what this can be two dinners my phone so i had big plans for this dish but i might split this in half and then share my amazing salmon recipe with you later in the week or tomorrow oh my gosh mama four interruption about every four minutes that's accurate okay i think i was talking about my amazing salmon recipe i will share that with you soon it is incredible i just i'm missing like one at least one ingredient i don't know i haven't looked at the recipe okay so tonight this is what i came up with i thought what's good with salmon dill lemon everyone knows that combo everyone knows it's delicious i found uh this recipe calls for maple syrup or you can use honey i've seen it used interchangeably and then some dijon mustard and i remember last time we used this combo oh specifically with this seasoning uh this wasn't in the recipe that i saw but this is just from my brain and i thought wow that's gonna taste delicious cause last time we used that combo it was delicious but it was with chicken i assume it's gonna be the same you can use meat interchangeably as well and i'm just gonna throw some sweet potatoes on my sheet pan and some broccoli and it's gonna be delicioso i'm just gonna cut up the sweet potato into pretty small pieces because salmon doesn't take that long to cook i mean i'm sure i have i didn't actually read the recipe it might say to cook the potatoes and then to throw the salmon on which is probably what i'm gonna do let me just cut them up okay i'm just gonna throw the potatoes on the sheet pan and get them started i have some oil and then some salt and pepper and that's all it takes even though that's all it takes i'm gonna do a little extra and add on this buttery seasoning it's so good i don't use it enough okay i'm gonna give it a juice and then i don't know leave it in the oven for at least 15 minutes and then i'll add the rest of the stuff on all right i am going to cut my broccoli next and i saw someone uh more famous than me do this this way is this how they did maybe they were cutting something else i don't know you know what don't don't listen to me guys that would make sense no it doesn't make sense i'm doing it anyway well i got it off the stock pretty quickly maybe it is what they did you know what subscribe for more for more cooking tips that was so much faster than like taking off the floret piece by piece but here i am doing it anyway because we need smaller pieces to throw in the oven i'm a mess for the salmon topping you need a quarter cup of syrup and i'm gonna do a bit more because that's always what i do because more is more two tablespoons of dijon enough of that then i'm gonna add this in just for fun mostly because it's delicious maybe a little more it's a lot give this a good mix and then we're going to throw it on the salmon and then maybe it'll like you know drain off and hit up the veggies and stuff while it's cooking smells weird i cut into this salmon and this i feel like it's a 20-minute meal oh except for the potatoes you know cook it with rice or whatever smells like fish all right i'm just gonna use half of it tonight where's half well this i don't think three pieces is enough for my family but good thing my kids don't really love salmon some of them do some of them don't i also have some leftover chicken in the fridge so we're gonna be all set tonight if i really wanted to i can make the whole thing but i don't really want to there's that washing my hands okay the sweet potatoes are are you know they're cooking they're on their way i'm just gonna shove these over to the side yeah it's hot i don't know how i'm going to dump everything else on here oh the person in the video who did this must have hot hands rubber hands fake hands where's my baby hand okay you know what else i found in my fridge that i thought yeah i could eat that because that just doesn't look like enough veggies to me i found some green beans so we're going to do that up same thing with these veggies a little bit of oil oil is my blood salt and the pepper then this magic butter seasoning that just makes everything smell better am i getting any on the veggies i'm gonna give that a good toss as much as i can with my wooden hand my whisk hand oh it's not that hot yeah okay i can do that look i'm a real chef yeah i could totally do this touch the pan and stuff give me some more oil yeah it's not bad guys don't be afraid of the hot pan no big deal it's like the test of a real chef you know all right let's scoot that over now let's make room for the salmon the star of tonight doesn't that just look good you know what i mean i just touched the pan it was hot 411 degrees hot i'm just gonna sprinkle this with some seasoning i don't know if the recipe says to do this i feel like you should season along the way feel free to add some s p on there should i be fancy and get a what's that thing called a thing brush one more thing to wash over here i did it for you i'm just gonna brush on this oh shall we call it a glaze and be super fancy about it dijon maple glaze last one over here oh something about salmon makes me think that i'm eating healthy all right that looks nice and coated and we still have a little bit left so i just feel like i can dump that on there we go okay and back into the oven i do 411 degrees because my oven's broken and it's whatever you can do 425 until it's done my guess is about 15 20 more minutes all right look at how delicious that looks mmm hold on i don't think you can truly see the deliciousness can you can you can you i guess you can just take my word for it it looks delicious i'll let you know how it tastes cheap pinwheels are so simple okay we're gonna see if the fish is actually ooh nice and flaky taste test for the chef oh my heavens the dijon the maple the glaze oh my gosh i could eat six of those salmon pieces just for myself can't wait to dive in it's gonna be a dinner another taste test for the chef i can't wait to be seated you know what i mean get that glaze up on that how about a sweet potato this time around a boon epithet so good how about a broccoli dip that in oh yeah by the way i cooked it for 15 minutes perfection okay i'm throwing dinner together tonight i didn't know what i was gonna make i mean that's really every night for me so this is what i'm throwing together oh the name is lemon pepper chicken i actually don't know lemon pepper chicken let's call it that but of course i'm taking my own spin on things so you're gonna need just some fresh fresh veggies whatever you want to use i have some sweet potatoes carrots an onion i've got some broccoli there i found this bread at publix oh cheesecake factory hold on i'm nursing meredith so i have like one hand our famous brown bread ooh all right we're gonna slap some butter on those and then some olive oil and then this is just leftover chicken that i need to use up which really was the inspiration behind dinner tonight did i say you need lemons because it's lemon pepper chicken and then some what is this garlic you think it's time to eat the garlic oh really the inspiration behind this was wow i need to use up this stuff these potatoes are on their last leg the carrots are kind of the lemons i've had them for like seven months so it's time to get this going okay so for lemon pepper chicken you need obviously some lemon pepper well i have this like grinder i don't know if i'm gonna do all that because you need like three tablespoons so i thought hey maybe this will taste just as good so to kick things off we're gonna slap the marinade together let's do it first thing for this marinade we're gonna get our juices flowing we've got some lemons here it's pretty ridiculous that i'm nurse i mean this is real life okay we gotta get dinner going i'm hungry everyone's hungry okay we're just gonna get half a cup of lemon juice oh merida's gonna do it [Laughter] i'm telling you right now i have like several cuts on my hands just little nicks and this lemon juice hurting something fierce okay is that half a cup i feel like that's good enough do our marinade we're going to add lemon zest how much lemons one tea no hold on so what i get for not reading the recipe before i start oh great my battery's dying oh what a night oh what a night okay back to the lemon zest how much lemon is it two tablespoons lord i'm just gonna zest one lemon and call it a day this is definitely not a zester i'm using a cheese grater because you work with what you have this is my life i just i can't deal with any more kitchen utensils watch next time i'm shopping i will buy like four lemon zesters only get the yellow part the white part of the lemon is bitter and you don't want that it'll mess up your entire day then we're gonna grab three cloves of this really fresh garlic straight from my garden what you thought i bought this from publix eight months ago incorrect it was nine months ago but it's still good if you leave garlic for long enough it'll start growing i have this really nifty uh garlic masher here so i just throw a couple in smoosh them and then throw that in okay this thing i gotta tell you it's really fun to clean okay so we've got that going on what else do we need feel like this is taking me 20 minutes how much olive oil a quarter cup all right that well i wasn't watching but is that a quarter cup or should we do more that's good i'm gonna have it a little more it separates so i feel like i've got a pretty good gauge on how much is in there here's where the recipe gets its name one teaspoon one teaspoon and the whole recipe is named after this how is that fair well i guess all that lemon juice all right well i'm gonna put that in but i feel like that's not enough i'm gonna season it with this as well this italian seasoning that'll be good you just give that a mix great you know what you don't even have to give it a mix my chicken was in this ziploc bag because i saved it from when i made dinners i'm just gonna dump it all in there really i could have just mixed it all in there oh marinades are my absolute favorite guys ideally you want to make this the day before let it marinate 24 hours overnight morning of you do it um so i'm making dinner now so i'm gonna let this marinade while my veggies kind of pre-cook in the oven i'll let you know but i'm just gonna let this sit as long as possible before my kids order takeout while it's marinating i'm going to prep my veggies you can use any potatoes you like or have i have these sweet potatoes and they need to be eaten so that's what i'm using and i haven't fully decided but i think i'm gonna cut them like in just little pieces probably around the same size as the carrots so they all take the same amount of time to cook so like this size see that perfect someone have food network on speed dial because these knife cuts i'm telling you pour it on blue this will make julia child proud throw the sweet potatoes onto the sheet pan and gosh there are so many reasons why i love sheet pan meals i washed my carrots i used to peel my carrots but now i just find that it's a waste of time and i'm just gonna go in on an angle and just chop it chop it chop it like so i like that it's a little fancy anyway so sheep and meals are one of my favorites because you can just throw any meat on it any type of sauce i'm using lemon today i feel like that adds a lot of flavor without adding a lot of calories but then we've got the olive oil that's just gonna keep the chicken nice and juicy right the possibilities with sheep and meals are endless you throw everything together there's minimal cleanup the majority of them i would say are pretty healthy because they do include a lot of vegetables or maybe those are just the ones that i like to look at because this is what i like to eat nice and simple every night of my life i could eat roasted veggies it just brings out all the flavors i'm just gonna throw my carrots on the sheet pan as well are we gonna have room for the broccoli we're gonna make room right i have something green on your plate i'm just gonna throw the broccoli right on there and since our root vegetables are cut pretty thin uh i think they'll cook at around the same time as the broccoli so we're good on that but i am gonna throw some olive oil on all of the veggies and then salt and pepper hey maybe lemon pepper tie all the flavors together maybe we'll throw some lemon zest on them too why not right one of my favorite things is broccoli with lemon juice oh my gosh talk about delicious and simple i don't know lemon and sweet potato i don't know so let me let me just concentrate on this section let me throw some juice on here just for fun oh wait i still have my onion at this point should i even bother i'm just gonna give it a nice toss to the veggies make sure it's all coated oh wait i forgot salt here's a salt and pepper one of my favorite things is just carrots and onions roasted in the oven oh marco i could have that breakfast lunch and dinner i need a bigger sheet pan okay well i thought i was gonna pre-cook the veggies but turns out i'm not going to so i'm just gonna lay the uh non-marinated chicken straight on here it'll be fine okay so i cut the bigger pieces of chicken into smaller pieces of chicken just so they would cook at a decent time and then i have all of this juice so you know what i'm going to do with that add it to the veggies okay into the oven i have it at 4 24. if you can believe it uh i don't know how long 25-ish minutes this looks good watching my hands and there it is not cooked but that is some good-looking raw chicken here it is all cooked oh you can't really see the color on the chicken but it is divine how about that the broccoli uh i like it a little crispy like that but everything looks good i'll let you know how it tastes i think i mean it smells amazing i'll say that i'm gonna take oh taste test it's gonna burn your mouth it just came out of the oven i'll take a photo for the graham tonight i'm about to throw together the easiest sheet pan dinner and it is super delicious total crowd pleaser every time i make it not only is it amazingly simple it's simple i don't know how else to sell it so i'm just going to get started by the way don't you just love when target does this 6.62 cents for this entire pack of chicken plus a three dollar off coupon what you know life doesn't get much better than that it's the little things it's the simple pleasures you know you're an adult when things like that make you happy right okay so i may need to break the rules a little bit on this one and use two sheet pans actually there are no rules so actually i'm making up the rules well maybe there are sheet pan right so i'm not breaking the rules i'm just using more than one i feel like a normal size family could get away with just using one sheet pan for this meal but my family's pretty large and i'm making all of these chicken drumsticks so i am going to use two pans i've also made this chicken in a casserole dish before when they're like literally hugged up against one another and it comes out just fine that way in case you're wondering washing my hands so here's the easy part all you have to do to make these incredibly delicious and crunchy and oh my gosh mouth-watering just a little bit of oil i just drizzle it right over the top you season it with salt and pepper you could certainly include literally any other seasonings that you like but my kids are easy to please with some bland food you could also get some citrus and drizzle some citrus over the chicken and that would be delicious as well i have some limes and lemons but again i'm keeping it nice and easy because if this is like a middle of the weeknight meal which it is for me it's like crunch time to get these in the oven right and then i just rub the oil all over the skin yes give it a little massage and of course i have my oven set to 411 degrees and then you just cook these until they're done about 30 minutes next up i am going to cut up some potatoes they're rolling all over i'm using my old crusty pan over here but it still works so i'm keeping it i just cut them in half i throw them on the tray for now while i cut them but i'll show you what i do with them later to ensure that once they're cooked they are like french fries the easiest ones you don't have to soak the potato they come out nice and crispy every time and my kids love them i love that everyone loves them okay it's my favorite way to cook well really at all vegetables but especially potatoes well i mean unless i'm having baked potatoes or mashed potatoes or potatoes i'll grow tall potatoes scalloped potatoes since we're cooking all our vegetables at basically the same time you want something that's going to take a while to bake because potatoes take well to bake so i thought huh brussels sprouts is a perfect option not only are they delicious baby cabbages they are cruciferous and uh they take a while to cook not too long though but pretty long if you want them nice and crispy now that everything's cut up we give them the same treatment as the chicken just a little bit of oil i use avocado oil it's a new found love i guess it's healthier for you has a higher heat smoking point is that what they call it oh my gosh it's bobby approved look at this expeller pressed right there and bonus it does not taste anything like avocados so just a little bit of salt and pepper for these as well running low on peppa and then you give them a juice and here's the kicker with the potatoes you flip them over so it's the cut side is down and that is going to give it a nice crisp in the oven well i cut a lot of potatoes into the oven with the chicken okay here it is all finished i left the potatoes in a little longer than the chicken but if you can see the skin on the chicken it's nice and crispy just how i mean it's delicious that way and the bottoms of these potatoes oh it's hot are nice and golden brown and crispy as well crispy i should say and then the brussels sprouts are a little burned but that's how we like them there's also a lot of drippings here you can make any kind of gravy if you're making anything else with it but we just eat it i forgot to mention these are the leftover potatoes but what these are fantastic for what you could do or what i like to do is load them up and then put cheese on top and some bacon oh my gosh boom appetit this is lunch the next day um delicious all right guys are you ready for the easiest cheap and meal in the history of sheet pan meals what's in that bag oh red onion i don't know the name of this does it really matter at this point let's just call it hawaiian chicken i don't know why we could just call it pineapple chicken why are pineapples associated with hawaii i'll never know i could google it but it doesn't matter let's call it pineapple barbecue pepper and onion chicken sounds fantastic because that is all that you need to make this meal also top it with some cilantro if you have it if you don't i'm sure it will still be delicioso i'm also going to throw some rice in the instant pot because well why not right you gotta get those carbs so there's not much to this dinner you basically just chop everything up and throw it on the sheet pan uh well you tossed it with some barbecue sauce but it's super simple so i'm just taking this pineapple device that makes cutting up a pineapple so fool proof but if you don't have one the easiest way that i used to do it before i had it was i just cut the sides off all all the way around cut the sides off and the bottom and then i cut mine in half all the way down and then cut that half in half and then tilt it on its side and go in at a diagonal and core it hard for me to explain without actually doing it then you can use your imagination it's actually quite simple but so is this i know pineapple is quite polarizing for some people when you add it to normal dishes i know adding it to pizza is like the biggest controversy since well i don't know what the biggest controversy is but i happen to love pineapple on my pizza i love it alone i just like pineapple in general because it is sweet delicious nature's candy how could you go wrong oh it's dripping everywhere look at the inside of this oh the pineapple juice i should save it for something amazing i don't know what but look at this magic slices it all the way down oh yes how can it get any easier you can't i'm gonna give some pineapple to wentworth and we'll put the rest on the sheet pan there you go kiddo okay you could get a bowl because you're supposed to toss all of this with some barbecue sauce but i'm just gonna use my hands so i don't have to wash a bowl so i'm throwing all the pineapple on a sheet pan and then i'm gonna cut up my two peppers the recipe calls for one orange one red but i'm sure whatever you have will suffice i'm sure a yellow pepper would be oh i have my dull knife hold on yellow pepper would be delicious in this but for the distinction of colors i think the red pepper and orange pepper i think that's why they went with that in this recipe but you know do what you want presentation is not everything my friends so i'm gonna take my peppers toss them right on the sheet pan and then i'm just gonna cut my chicken i have chicken thighs you guys know my love affair with a good chicken thigh i'm just gonna cut it into bite-sized pieces but i'm sure if you wanted to make a meatless meal just add a few more veggies and you're good to go here's the chicken you guessed it straight onto the sheet pan washing my hands uh oh hold on i forgot the secret ingredient oh and i get to use my special uh where is it here it is my special double-sided whisk my favorite utensil uh for the time being you need the juice of one fresh lime i love uh to get all the juice out i just roll it i put a i put my whole body weight into it and give it a nice roll like you're dancing with it you got to get your feet down lying down and roll you don't have to stand like that you're basically just crushing the insides pretend that it's someone you dislike oh limes are so delicious this would be such a great summertime treat uh yeah and then just squirt the juice all over the place the whole lime you know what fresh citrus and fresh herbs they just elevate food just to another dimension that is one thing that i think is underrated fresh citrus and fresh herbs in a dish oh really after all that you use half a cup of barbecue sauce uh-oh this is the end for this one you know what i also feel like this is ruining the dish oh my gosh we forgot the onion hold on okay this is a really sad looking onion but here i go and now that i'm thinking i don't know if you add the barbecue sauce before you throw it in the oven but what's done is done and i'm just going to mix it all together okay i just added the limes on the sheet pan just for presentation maybe i should just throw the top on there too looks good simple easy oh my gosh the lime makes the smell absolutely incredible here we go there we go that's a shot okay so this is the before picture in the oven recipe says 350 but you know how we do 411 degrees for about 20 minutes until everything's nicely cooked through you know what i just realized we didn't put any salt and pepper on this and that just simply will not do so i'm just going to add some salt and pepper here it is it smells fantastical i added a little bit more barbecue sauce on it um obviously i was out of like the sweet baby raise so i used this is from trader joe's carolina gold it tastes great i feel like barbecue sauce is all made pretty much the same this smells great i'm going to throw it over some rice and we are going to eat a boon a petite nice a boon a petite this pineapple chicken was delicious as was everything else that i made aside from like the gnc dish not my favorite but everything else i would totally make again oh my gosh you guys i'm laughing too hard let me explain why tonight's sheep and meal includes i don't know what it's called this is nothing new i i don't read things and it's very apparent in this recipe so i thought i saw a picture of on pinterest five awesome sheet pan meals whatever with gnk so i viewed a few of them and this one came up and i said i love making that it's gnk with bacon and brussels sprouts and a little bit of cheese on top i thought simple easy always a crowd pleaser delicious everything with bacon come to find out i just looked at the recipe the actual recipe because i wanted to make sure i had everything i needed come to find out it is gnk with sun-dried tomatoes not bacon and spinach not brussels sprouts i just created this whole concoction on my own but here we're gonna roll with it and it's gonna be great usually i make this in a skillet just cook the bacon then throw in the brussels sprouts cook it in the bacon fat oh my gosh it adds so much flavor and then boiled and yunky add it to the bacon brussels sprout mixture i don't even throw cheese on top it's all you need is so good but we're gonna whip this in a sheet pan meal and see if it's equally as delish so from my research on those sheet pan meals i would say you could throw just about anything you wanted oh wait i was looking at another one too with gnk it was like gnk and sage and brown butter oh doesn't that sound good well i guess i could have made that but i chose this instead these brussels sprouts are on their last leg so i'm happy this is that's one of the reasons why i went with this meal today because we need to eat these brussels sprouts i bet they barely have any nutritional value left in them oh you know what man i didn't plan on quartering these my plan for these was to just shave them so it cooks like spinach too late i'm gonna throw the sprouts on the sheet pan and then i'm just gonna cut up this bacon and now i'm second guessing my brain did the original recipe called for sun-dried tomatoes or fire roasted red peppers i'm gonna go check well it called for sun-dried tomatoes so there's that but in the past i have made a sheet pan meal with gnocchi and a bunch of veggies like eggplant and i don't remember what else but it was okay moral of the story you can add anything to a sheet pan and it will just come out delicious i'm just adding some salt and pepper to this not too much salt because of the bacon and then i'm just going to give it a toss okay into the oven 411 degrees for about i don't know 15-20 minutes well here it is folks uh i don't know the texture of the gnocchi is a little strange they're soft but crunchy on the outside i'm gonna mix it around and see if like mixing it with the bacon grease will make it it's a little softer it's kind of chewy i also just microwaved some rice and we're probably gonna have leftovers alongside this because this definitely is not enough to feed my whole family but i knew that because i knew we also had leftovers to eat through so um yeah i'm gonna mix this up maybe the bacon needs to cook for a little bit longer okay now that it's mixed let me give it a little chef's taste test okay i actually enjoy the little crunch and texture of the gnocchi it's soft on the inside and then just a little bit of crunch i like that if you don't you can certainly boil them before you throw them on and i think that will help but anyway this is tonight's dinner a boon if it hit i forgot the main attraction this will definitely make it taste better maybe i don't know i don't really love cheese but my kids do so does that make it look fancier better or worse or the same i feel like i'm at the eye doctor is this better or worse or the same uh do it again okay how about now better or worse it's like snow is this even a nutritious meal anymore was it to begin with no better or worse or the same tonight for dinner i'm trying something new another sheet pan meal but a new protein i don't eat with shrimps a lot mostly because one time someone said that they were like the cockroaches of the sea and i just can't stop thinking about that but lo and behold i bought some shrimp you also need some potato oh it's like a crab boil no there's no crab shrimp oil i don't know i should just stop even mentioning titles of dinners because there isn't one we're gonna eat shrimp and corn and andouille sausage with creole seasoning garlic and potatoes for dinner that sounds like a great name let's get started i've been putting off making this recipe for a long time just for no good reason alex really likes shrimp so i figured tonight's the night you know i'm just gonna cut the potatoes into pretty small pieces i'm gonna cook it uh with the corn and the sausage and then at the end or toward the end i'm gonna throw this shrimp on and that's all she wrote so i'm just going to get everything cut up and on the sheet pan that's the mvp of this week i'm using these baby corn uh but i'm oh my gosh maybe i'm not going to cut them in half dang yeah i'm not going to cut these in half because i'm not strong enough to do that no big deal i am going to throw them on here and if you've never had corn on the cob in the oven oh my god just do it you're missing out on your life it's one of my favorite things the way i normally cook it is throwing it on a sheet pan into the oven 411 degrees for about 20 minutes uh just with a little bit of salt and pepper you can do garlic seasoning on it too that really jazzes things up and then a tiny little pat of butter on each one comes out stupendous each and every time i'm cutting up these oh my gosh these a story behind them and dewey sausage i googled it i i guess i've never bought them before so this is what i found a thousand dollars for four links this cajun style and dewy what is this chicken sausage smoked sausage made with pork yeah definitely not chicken the other white meat anyway i was happy i found these because they said and dewey but i am semi-worried about the spice but i thought cajun kind of plays into it right because we are using oh this is creole seasoning is that the same are these pre-cooked can i try it just tried it oh it's kind of weird what is in it it's like a chewy something chewy all right yeah yeah now i can kind of kind of taste the spice straight onto the sheet pan with these and i love this brand amazing also i love chicken sausage another sheep pan meal idea but i've shared it with you before so i thought don't be redundant anyway another sheep and meal idea uh is that same brand sells chicken sausage it's like apple apple something it's my favorite just throw that on a sheet pan with a ton of veggies cut up any veggies you like and then just throw that into the oven with some salt and pepper oil it is supreme every single time confession time oh i shouldn't have smelled it straight up the nostrils oh man i'm definitely gonna sneeze in a minute uh i've never had this creole seasoning before i don't know why i went to smell it again you need a tablespoon i think i don't know i'm just gonna go a little overboard what's so great about this stuff i don't know i just use it that's what the recipe says okay you know me i like to follow directions okay give everything a good mix with your hands and then uh throw it into the oven i feel like i should throw another vegetable on here but that's all it said to add oh and these are all the potatoes i had so into the oven it goes for 25 minutes that's almost done cooking i'm oh i'm gonna throw some shrimp in a bowl what is all that water oh i guess they were frozen well i guess i'll drain it after i pour it all so the recipe calls for a pound i'm gonna do more than that are you surprised how much is in here two pounds well i mean i might as well cook it all i don't know what i'm gonna do with the rest so there's that good news is these are already peeled de-veined and nothing crappy is added so there's that i'm going to season these up with a little bit of salt and pepper and then the star of the show the creole seasoning i i don't know a tablespoon or more let's just give it a few shakes and for fun we'll add some oil because i i just feel like it needs it the recipe doesn't really well you know what to be honest i didn't read the recipe okay i watched a video it was like halfway down the blog page and i thought yeah that's good enough i think it needs a little more creole oh maybe not am i ruining it oh well what's done is done okay let's spread these out on the pan oh it's heavy oh i should've got two mittens definitely a two mitten job i'm just going to flop the shrimp all over the place back in the oven 10 to 15 minutes well they cooked eight minutes before they were nice and pink and i know if you overcook shrimp they just get chewy and nasty so i didn't want that to happen i pulled him out everything looks good i don't know i've never done a shrimp anything so bon appetit oh hey what alex just ate some and it's like burning his fingers will they ever learn something straight out of the oven is hot imagine that anyway he says it is bleeping delicious you heard it here first however i haven't had a taste and i'm the true chef in the family so let me do that tonight for dinner time we are going to make some directive cuisine we're making quesadillas on a sheet pan did you know you can do this it's actually kind of cheating because a lot of the prep is on the stovetop i even thought about sharing this one there were other recipes that i thought about sharing that i have decided against it like crock pot or whatnot what's it called sheet pan chicken pot pie because all of that prep is on the stove but i know alas here we are everyone in my house loves quesadillas not everyone in my house loves chicken pot pie so i figured this would be a good one just some bell peppers if you have them an onion a lime if you want to add it some cheese it actually calls for well you know i don't really follow a recipe so it doesn't matter what it's called for a can of black beans or any beans that you like and then i have some ground turkey you can use any kind of meat that you like i don't know oh my gosh another one fajita sheet pan but i figured everyone knows about that one bunch of bell peppers onions chicken some seasoning you're good to go oh also you need a seasoning for a bunch of seasonings for this like cumin paprika we'll get there when we get there i didn't want to pull him down yet okay i'm just gonna get my miso plas ready i have just the veggies to cut up and that's basically it it's a super simple dinner oh you know what else you need that i didn't bring out tortillas of course the star of the show can't have a quesadilla without tortillas you know what okay you know what really grinds my gears so i like tacos and they're super simple right but when i make tacos for my family they would rather have uh what are they called chimichangas i don't know how to make an authentic chimichanga so you know what i do i grab the gfg the george foreman grill and i just wrap the contents of a taco without the lettuce into that wrap it up and then i put it on the george foreman and they love that so i figured they would really like the quesadilla in the oven because it's basically the same thing except for i don't have to you know roll out each of them individually so here we are i don't know where i was i don't know what i was talking about i don't really know what i was doing what year is it mom life so i guess i'm just to finish cutting this crap up all right let's take this to the stove top i'm going to saute all of the veggies at the same time that i cook the meat and i thought about adding two pounds of meat i don't know if that's going to be necessary ground turkey is always such a delight i'm gonna go in with this thing i'm gonna tell you what i don't like cleaning this thing okay i'm gonna go in with a little bit of salt and pepper the basics yeah okay i'll add more meat i mean we have to fill up a whole sheet pan right while that's cooking i pulled these from my pantry and now i'm thinking wow i hope i have enough also wow this is a huge pan most of the pans do two layers and that like flops over the pan you know so then i guess you can get away with one pound of meat wow what am i gonna do what would you do with the clock what would you do with the clown duck bar what am i gonna how am i gonna figure if i had more tortillas it wouldn't be a problem but i don't have more tortillas so it's a problem used a couple of my brain cells i figured i'd do it in this it is not a sheet pan but what do we say it's good enough yes that's right all right for the seasonings you just add some paprika not too much it just gives it that smoky flavor a little bit of depth some cumin a lot of that a little bit of garlic powder and i think that's it i just smell it if it smells like taco seasoning it's good you can add a little bit of water but the ground turkey is kind of liquidy so i just this is good i'm going to spoon my mixture in uh mostly because that pot is so heavy i guess i could just dump it in all right let's just dump it in why not ah i don't think i'm gonna throw it all in there i like having leftover taco meat for like taco salads the next day wait is this a sheet pan quesadilla you could put anything in a quesadilla right chicken well i don't know what else anything you want i'm going to add a can of beans i'm going to reserve some just because meredith likes to eat them plain just shred some cheese over top or if you don't like cheese don't add this part i don't really like cheese well i don't really like quesadillas i make them for my kids though you know i aim to please you know what i do like though flautas you know what mexican restaurant i miss so much don pablo's is that even still around it's not here in tampa i could drive two hours but like i don't miss it that much you know what i mean all right is that enough i feel like that's enough and then i guess you just put one tortilla on top and then fold the rest over i'm just realizing i didn't like grease the bottom of this pan oh well okay and then you put a pan right over top of it to keep it from unfolding into the oven 411 degrees for until it's done i don't know it's already cooked this is done not much to look at i'll serve it with some lettuce cheese i don't know what else and hummus or hot sauce i forgot the limes i'm setting plates and stuff but i thought i'd get like a thumbnail picture oh so fancy and finally we have made it to dessert oh you guys it has been and eat chocolate chips out of the bag kind of day that's why those are out that's the kind of day i'm having it's daylight savings time and meredith woke up at four oh my gosh somebody i understand why people drink caffeine nowadays okay anyway uh oh it's also pi day hello if i ever needed an excuse to eat a pie make a pie today would be the day so i kept thinking what kind of sheet pan dessert am i going to make i can literally make anything cookies are technically a sheep in dessert because you put them on a sheet pan right i thought i have so many strawberries maybe i'll make that strawberry shortcake kind of thing but i've already made that with you last july so then i thought um i really wanted some what is this called pie what is what is it what is this my sleep deprived brain some nuts some nut pie pecan yeah there it is pecan pie i looked up a recipe typically i do pioneer woman recipe but i'm just trying to switch things up you know what i mean we've already made that together and plus this is a sheet pan pecan pie so i figured it's legit you need some vanilla six eggs pecans of course star of the show light brown sugar kero syrup and what are these oh i was going to make this from scratch pie crust and then i found these in my freezer oh they look really sad uh so hopefully they work out is it horrible that i'm making pecan pie in like this spring mixing bowl i don't think so six eggs straight in double crack every time that is what will get me a food network show a little bit of vanilla extract how much ooh two tablespoons that's too much i'll do that much one tablespoon about i make my own rules when is this goodbye cause i know i found this october i'm gonna hope that says 2021 but i can't really read it i mean it's syrup right it can't be bad it's not discolored or anything so i'm going to say that's a good sign okay whisk away we're going to measure out one cup of hero syrup this is called multitasking uh welcome to adulthood right or parenthood i don't know one cup to the top make it hot and it sounds muddy all night i don't know the words my club songs were like i want it bad way i promise i will never try to beatbox again what else do i need oh brown syrup one cup of brown sugar oh great that's not coming out yeah you know what here that's good enough all right what else four cups of pecans here how is this gonna fill up a sheet pan you guys i think my sheet pan is too big it's gonna be a really thin pecan pie should i just make a pie no i'm not doing it guys okay i already cheated on the quesadilla okay four cups of this stuff should i chop them up i think that's like the pioneer woman secret right oh more brown sugar two three four i'm just gonna give these a rough chop [Music] i should have got my food processor out i don't know what i was thinking you know what guys i've always wanted a pecan tree always my whole life maybe we'll find a house with a pecan tree right could you imagine pecans for free but also cleaning them up off your driveway okay well that's quite enough also i don't really care so in go the pecans lovely lovely i kind of feel like i should double this recipe oh man i got rid of my sheet pans you know what i mean my smaller sheet pans because i never used them and now look at me needing smaller sheet pans twice in a row okay well these pie crusts look uh great nothing wrong with them at all they're not discolored they don't feel weird totally fine also they're round oh man i should have just made my own it's too late what am i gonna do this is not gonna fill this up well we're gonna have to cheat again sorry guys cause i'm cheater cheater the pumpkin eater and the part is just i'm gonna use this is this good technically it's the same idea just um smaller right right just saying just say right okay i say right you say right right that's good you know making your own pie crust isn't difficult at all i just i've had these in my freezer if you can't tell forever so i needed to use them before they went bad but um i'm kind of thinking that ship has sailed okay cool cool that looks groovy oh look all the pecans rose to the top oh i love when i could just eat this with a spoon dump all of this in here oh that looks great oh yeah that looks real good you guys this looks so good alex is gonna be so happy he loves pecan pie i love pecan pie my mouth is salivating let's get this thing in the oven 411 degrees i don't know 50 minutes this is the star of the stinking show can't wait to eat this come on pie on pie day and it's pecan pie and it's not thanksgiving what a treat i'm about to dig into this and you guys i whipped up literally some whipping cream you just do like a cup of whipping cream a couple tablespoons of powdered sugar a dash of vanilla i even left the vanilla out because who cares so easy so delicious this is seriously the best part of my week let's be honest though i'm gonna need about double the whipping cream anyway thank you guys so much for watching and hanging out hope i gave you some dinner inspiration if you want to subscribe put a little happy in your day and i'll see you next time bye oh heavens to betsy meredith is waiting for me to hold her she's like mom i'm ready", "vwkfFFP_X2I": "hello everyone and welcome back to prodigal overland my name is brad if you're new here welcome in today's video i'm going to be attempting something completely new to me uh which is kind of exciting for me because i really like to learn new things so what i'm going to be attempting today is removing the cast hook from my winch line and replacing it with a closed system thimble style attachment point from factor 55 called the splicer in order to do this we're going to have to cut my winch line rope and then actually attach the thimble and then splice the rope back together properly so that it will be just as strong as it is right now so let me show you uh what we have currently on the end of my winch line talk a little bit about why we're making the change and then we'll get into hopefully doing a correct splice and getting the new factor 55 attachment point on our winch line guys if you're brand new this channel and you like this video consider hitting that subscribe button hit that bell if you want to be notified when a new video is coming out and let's get going [Music] so hopefully you can see here our current setup so this is the winch hook that came with our winch this is the schmidty built x20 gen 2 that's hiding under my bumper all in all i've been very happy with that winch i'm you know it's it's a quite a bit cheaper than a worn winch and it does have a wireless remote that i can use um and also a wired one but we've been able to use the wireless one just fine one thing i haven't been real happy with is the protective cover that kind of comes along with it it tends to bunch up in my fair lead and then often will kind of get caught up under there my understanding is that synthetic rope has a tendency to be sensitive to uv light exposure and over time if the rope would be just kind of left out and exposed it can really um weaken your line so what we're going to be moving to is actually a thimble kind of um attachment that will actually kind of get sucked all the way in and rest kind of right on my fair lead and then i can get rid of this and hopefully won't have any more binding up happening another thing i'm noticing with the hook other than it's just kind of wrecking my um chief products recovery points the paint transfer is that it seems to be that although this is convenient to just kind of hook to something uh this this this here the uh spring loaded thing can fail if um you know something were to shift and a line came down here it would just let go um it's also a pretty heavy hook in comparison and i you know i've seen videos of winch lines breaking and these things just rocketing and so the idea of a large cast iron object with a hook on the end uh flying towards me or someone out on the trail one of the kids um isn't very comforting so i'm trying to get this off my line um however it's it's kind of cast on so the only way to get this off would be to saw it off maybe with a grinder with a saw tool and just get it off that way uh if you do it that way then this eyelet would be intact and you could just attach a new point what i'm going to be doing is actually cutting the winch line and removing this whole thing and then we're going to be splicing the whole line back together so hopefully that all goes well and we'll show you what it looks like come on baby this is in free spool right now and actually just yesterday i had this winch line out took the whole thing out inspected it but what i've been finding is that this this sleeve is just getting all kinds of caught up and doesn't want to pull out easily and so when we're out on the trail and i can't get my winch line out when i need it i've been able to get it out but i don't always look like a super stud doing that makes me look silly um and it's really this this is getting bound up in there so i really want to get this off but again i don't want that line to be exposed underneath to the sunlight and potentially damage it so i'm going to work to get this thing out another thing about my winch and i've had some people ask how do you do the free spool not or not the chief products mount has a hole right under the bottom here and actually i was able just to clock my winch and get that very accessible right down here i don't have to do anything weird up top um so it's right here so let's see if we put it in gear if we get this thing out and that's a big fat no um so let's see oh my gosh there it goes but that's on talking about it just gets all tore up under there all right so let's pull this out okay so we're able to get it out and as you can see this is just getting all kinds of chewed up being sucked back in in there so it's really doing nothing but just causing issues at this point there's another thing i want to show you just that outer covering it's kind of really messing up the rope just from where it was rubbing so what i'd like to do is actually i think i'm just gonna come back i can tell the current um splice or the deep bury stops right about here because i can feel that rope inside we'll get to that later what that means but it's kind of all chunked up kind of down a little way so i'm going to cut it just here not worry about this line up here um and then we'll start fresh so again that deep berry which honestly from what i'm reading uh it only goes to about right here which man i'm gonna bury mine a little bit deeper than that but we're going to cut off hopefully right through here and kind of start fresh all right so here we go we got a cut line all right so here is the splicer from factor 55 and this is what we're going to be putting on the end of my winch line rope now and if you look on the back here hopefully yeah there you go you can see that what we need to do is kind of feed the rope up through and around there's holes on the bottom here to do that but before we actually feed it through what we need to do is kind of work on the end of our rope here which looks pretty nasty and frayed now for my expert cutting job but what we're going to be doing is actually removing some of the threads or the cords maybe of this this rope to to work on getting a good taper on the end of our winch line what we're going to be doing today is actually what's called get a little more line here uh a deep berry so we're actually going to feed this line through the splicer and then back in on itself and this this end of this line is actually going to get buried into the center of of our winch line rope and and by doing that we don't use any kind of knots they really um you're not supposed to knot your lines up anywhere there's a knot you're really decreasing the strength in your winch line and the center of this rope is a channel and we're gonna put the end of the rope down through and then with tension what actually happens is the the winch line kind of grabs around itself and holds holds it in place very much like a uh chinese finger trap if you had one of those when you're a kid and you put them in and you pull them out and it's it's kind of tough so let me show you what we're going to be using to do that so guys what we have here is a fid this again is from factor 55 and you can see right here that it actually will tell you how far we need to bury the line based on a diameter and i believe we've got 3 8 inch so that looks like 20 to 27 inches and then they've got a 7 inch kind of marking right here on the fit what you'll notice is that there's some overlap here so if i take the highest on the 3 8 which is 27 inches and go over and look at the half inch that falls in that category as well i don't think burying it further is a bad thing so i'm going to make sure we are definitely over that 27 inches and you want to be a little bit past that because as you go and pull your rope through at the end it's actually going to kind of get sucked up a little bit other tools that they recommend is electrical tape this is not electrical tape this is masking tape i think you need a tape that's not super sticky so because you're going to be taking it off so get something that holds a little bit but not so much that it's difficult to get off masking tape electrical tape i didn't have it so and then you need something to mark your line with my line's black i got this pretty pink marker to kind of make some marks and the reason for that is uh we're going to be pulling some of the part of this line out to kind of taper this rope down and so what i'm going to be doing is marking these threads cutting them and then pulling them out from kind of here down and what that's going to do is give us a little bit of a taper what you don't want is a big fat knot like this sticking in side of your line because any kind of abrasion as you saw just even with the outside of this line and that was just from a smooth kind of uh that outside cover as you can see has already been kind of wearing and tearing the outside edges of my line so you don't want that happening on the inside so you might inspect the outside the outside might look fine and dandy but what's happening is it's tearing on the inside so in order to avoid that we want a nice taper on this end um so that it's smooth and not abrasive so what i'm going to do here is this is a 12 strand rope so we're going to mark if you see these little v's here i'm going to come in about a fid length about seven inches and then what i'm going to be doing is marking these v's here you see kind of a v happen so i'm going to put a mark here put a mark here i'm gonna skip put a mark put a mark skip a v and put a mark put a mark i want to show you guys up close there's my marks so starting back here we're about again seven to eight inches down mark there skip mark there skip mark there and we're going to cut and pull those out and that's going to make the rest of the line down start to look very tapered and then when we get to this mess of an end if it still looks like a mess of an end i'm going to just trim this up so that again it's a nice smooth taper so what i'm going to actually do is kind of use that tool help pull that out then just come in here get that and you want to cut towards this v because again that's going to get sucked back into the rope and then what we'll end up doing is just pulling these out once we get to that see and just pull that out like so so just move down the line here so this is the last one here cut pull out and what i'm gonna do is kind of make sure these edges get kind of popped back in to the rope itself it's still woven there all right so what you guys can see is that we've removed that and that's helping to give us a nice taper down and then i'm just going to come here and kind of trim these even more so that at the very end we have a nice tapered end so again as hopefully you can tell my camera will get it yeah is that areas where we didn't mess with and then as we start to come down it's nice and tapered so we got a little bit of tape on the end hopefully that's going to make it easier to kind of feed through the thimble and i think we could probably just even use our splicer or our fid to kind of help it through okay guys now that we have it through the thimble we've got a length here next thing you want to do is actually mark the winch line to how deep we're going to be burying this so again it's recommending at the max on the 3 inch 3 8 inch is 27 inches so what i'm gonna actually do is just do four lengths of my fid approximately which should get us closer to 28. again i don't believe more is a bad thing so i'm gonna do that now and then we'll mark the line and that'll tell me how far down we're to bury this thing and then kind of where our exit point is going to be so there's one [Applause] two we've got three four so that should be plenty deep enough right here so again here we have that fast fit by factor 55 it's got a threaded end you just screw it on now on the other end again we've got this kind of metal chinese finger trap so if i get my finger in there and pull it's grabbing and it's not going to come out this is this is really what's going to happen on the end of our deep bury if you need a good visual on this pretend my finger that's now good and stuck is the end of the winch line we're going to bury this deep down and then when tension is applied it's actually gonna grip and be very difficult to pull out so hopefully get my finger out of this okay so we're gonna push this all the way down stick our rope in there let it come back and now it's going to grip that nicely for us there's my mark so this section here is kind of gnarly looking is actually what's going to be inside the rope here at the end so here's our fidd we kind of have it pulled to the length that we're going to need to bury it next what we're going to do is come down just a little bit and find one of these v's here let me see if we get to focus and we're actually going to bring the fid through one of these center points kind of like weave it through we don't want to split these sections we want to go through the cords and then we're going to pull it through and actually come back the other way so let me do that and kind of show you what i mean so if we kind of open the rope up it's very easy if you guys just kind of push on it the rope a little bit to find your way through there we go we're through we're gonna pull it through here and then i'm actually going to come skip down just a little bit and come back through the other way so let's do that through the center and we're going to pull it through so you can see so here we are that's what we've kind of done so far next comes this whole deep berry portion okay and so we're going to come actually kind of open this up again and we're going to try to get into the core of the rope and actually take the rest of this line down the center so again we're going to push this rope together i'm gonna come down and find an opening and actually get into the center if we can of our rope yeah and so now we're in the center and this is where if you kind of just keep pushing the rope down working it through you can bring that fit with that line attached all the way down into it so that's what we do and this again is that deep bury that we were talking about and measured out and this is actually again to go back to that kind of finger trap that we were talking about this is what's going to hold your winch line where it needs to go and here's my pink mark okay i don't know if you can see that but we got our pink mark here so we're going to keep feeding down to that and that's actually once we're past that we're gonna bring it out okay so we've got the rope through and out the other side now we can release the rope from the fit just push down pull that out this point we can get rid of that tape and hopefully masking tape works just as good as electrical tape once you've exited then they do what they call milking where you just kind of start at the at the base or where your thimble is and you just kind of milk it the rope back down and if we did this right the rope should kind of just go back into itself nice and easily like this so when i measure that we did end up getting about 28 inches on our deep bury um and this is supposed to be as strong as um when we started there's no knots in the line and then as you can see all of these cross sections along here when tension is applied it's going to actually clamp down hard on the rope inside so that it doesn't slip in on itself i really wanted to show you guys the comparison of what we had here's the original hook that came with it here's the thimble i have now obviously i need another other attachment point so i can show you how the splicer actually you would attach things but i just want to show you that the original burry that they had came to here the burry i just did so if we line up our eyelets here's my eyelet there's their eyelet my brewery actually is going we stopped great around here so we've probably got another seven inches or so on the brewery we just did as opposed to what was done from the factory so the splicer will actually take this three-quarter inch bow shackle you can either run it through like this you know put your what you would do is put your loop or your attachment that you're hooking to a vehicle or whatever your toe point in put this through and then get your pins down in and tighten it up like so or it will also fit you can actually bring it up through like this and then around as well and then attach like that so there's the bow shackle or i mean your saw shackle you know you would feed feed it through put in your connection point and then go from there okay and then you're set okay so that's how you get both of those through the splicer as far as strength rating uh factor 55 says actually that your rope is gonna break um before the splicer does they don't want any side loading so you want your every your forces in line they don't want you to side load it like that uh but when i read online because there's no actual like weight rating or breaking strength on this what it said was actually that this rope whatever it's it's dependent on the the strength of the the winch line so there you go guys i hope this video was helpful again if you're thinking about doing this remember this was my very first time doing it i did do a bit of research watch several videos uh factor 55 actually has a video on getting the splicer on and how to do it but i would recommend for sure that you check out some other folks doing it what i'll try to do is maybe link a couple videos below in my description so that you guys can check out how others have done it it's definitely something you want to get right um as opposed to just kind of guessing and having something go horribly wrong um anyway and and and i will more than likely um try just to maybe i'll hook her dooley up or something and just put it in neutral and flat ground and kind of see how it holds um but with this system i now have a closed winching system so i don't have to worry about uh this this part failing i also have a much um significantly lighter um attachment point and it doesn't have a nice hook that could come flying back at somebody okay so again guys i hope this video was helpful if if you liked the video give it a thumbs up any feedback go ahead and put that below guys if you're not yet a subscriber to this channel consider subscribing and we will see you guys again real soon you", "4ksfOINwIK0": "my friends tonight we're going to build a scenic base for dispenser 2 but it's not going to be a regular everyday base it's going to be a scorched base this tank is situated somewhere on the eastern front in 1942 and scorched earth was a tactic commonly used by the soviets they pretty much burnt everything left behind i felt like that would make for an interesting scene so let's give it a look as always i started with a simple paper sketch which helped me with some basic measurements i've cut the eps foam on my rudimentary hot wire cutter from ebay this gray eps foam is just what i was looking for it has almost no visible texture and it's also pretty tough which means it's perfect if you don't enjoy making walls for your bases from wood or plastic it can be just painted as it is with black or any other color after a quick check if everything is in order i proceeded to carve the terrain as i said the foam is very strong and having a blunt knife doesn't help like at all so instead i decided to employ the foam cutter again i had to be very careful because it's easy to cut too much and then there's just no way to go back so it's better to take our time and slice it in thin sheets my intent is a dirt road on a mellow hill with a lowered and raised corner pretty much the same thing i've been doing with all my bases so far but this time i have a reference photo for it as you'll see later the wire will leave us with a very uneven surface so i had to make some finer adjustments with a knife knives yeah if the foam was already tough carving it with the heat made it even harder now it has something like a molten crust on top but after about 20 minutes of cursing and carving i was able to make the road section straight enough at least to a point where the tank wasn't levitating above the ground i also carved some rods and deep track marks this i think this seems pretty good so far i wanted to make another small compact base so it would fit into my display case small bases have one huge advantage we can focus more on the small details and there's not that much work to be done compared to let's say 2 by 2 meter diorama with 20 buildings and a skyscraper moving on it's time to sculpt the actual terrain for this i absolutely love to use air drying clay pva glue will help it to adhere to the smooth foam surface and in fact it'll also make it easier to sculpt as it somehow softens the clay i started with the rudded sections to make sure the tank will have a solid foundation to stand on because i had no leftover tracks which i could normally use for imprints i had to again use the model as a stamp yeah a thin plastic bag will protect the painted tank tracks from getting all messed up from the soft clay this reminded me how tedious the process is so i quickly borrowed the spare track and used that instead the bag is easy to remove and it won't damage the clay whatsoever the only small downside is that the imprints will have a rather soft detail but it's the best i could do with what i had now i could proceed with the rest of the ground the clay that i'm using is a generic air drying clay which i found amongst school supplies in my local tesco not all clays are made equal though for example the reddish brown clay which i've been using on my previous bases was much easier to sculpt this one is quite messy but it's better than nothing especially now during another lockdown in slovakia the soft gooey clay has some advantages though it's very easy to shape with different tools so it's not just a foundation layer for our groundwork we can in fact create lots of shapes and terrain features with it not to mention it can be actually textured with a sponge i kinda forgot to cover this large hole in the ground so instead i filled it with a huge rock and some loose pebbles it's not like it's gonna be visible in the end because it's sitting right under the tank but i thought it would be a nice detail at least for the video one of the best features of the clay is how it can be used to sculpt the torn earth around the deep track marks i purposefully set a small amount of the clay aside and left it for a while to dry once it starts solidifying it'll create these nice jagged shapes which look pretty authentic with the basic groundwork done we can start adding some textures i received a few diorama products from ak interactive and this base was a nice opportunity to try their crackling earth paste it actually has no texture it's just a smooth earth colored acrylic paste but once it dries it'll create realistic in scale cracks just like in real life when the ground is extremely dry i felt like this would make for an interesting effect especially as these parts will be scorched the road was covered with pva glue diluted with water and sprinkled with 0.5 millimeter sand it's gonna give it a very nice gritty look to avoid any large piles of sand i so to say blended the wet surface with more glue and water so you know spreading the debris into a more even layer earth from my garden was then added for additional texture i placed large clumps around the rods and the finer stuff in the center of the road when i was looking at reference photos i noticed how a destroyed dirt road can get really messy so this was a nice opportunity to make the most out of it the crackling paste took a while to dry but the results are pretty nice i didn't want these sections to be completely smooth though so i added some fine grains here as well just to you know blend them slightly more with the gritty road the texturing stage is now done so let's now make some vegetation the first layer will be trampled and burned grass cutting a dried sea ball is a great way to get tons of randomly sized and irregularly shaped stalks i mean who needs static grass just like any other thing you might sprinkle over the ground c-ball also needs some diluted pva glue as i was applying it i suddenly realized that this is just not a one-off technique that's gonna work for burned grass it actually looks super cool everywhere especially when combined with some tufts or some taller grass you'll see what i mean as soon as i start painting it i already mentioned static grass but this time i used it in a different way instead of using an electric applicator like all the times before i grabbed a large chunk of it and after dipping it into undiluted pva it pretty much turns into a grass tuft which can be planted in the ground i saw some very disheveled grass stuffs in reference photos and this replicates them pretty well in my opinion the result isn't so neat like with static res applicator it just looks more random and natural but of course it's only viable in small amounts like in this case i mean i found some use for the applicator as well there was a spot in the reference photo with short grass standing straight up but it was completely burned it's kind of interesting when you're closely following a real-life photo beat something you found on the internet or some random picture you might snap outside you'll find so many interesting shapes textures and patterns so if nothing else this base will be at least a nice learning experience long stocks were made from paintbrush bristles and these are obviously very long and all the same length so after planting them in the ground i did some trimming with scissors and of course a few seafoam twigs found their way into this project as well one of the interesting things about burned ground is that a surprisingly large amount of trees survive the fire without any harm even small saplings like these i also made sure to add one one golden weed because photovetch plants are expensive but the base is now gonna have higher street cred with some bling the last detail consists of all the fallen brothers which didn't survive the fire these are made from some dried roots and just like everything else they are fixed with pva glue with the groundwork being finished i wanted to make the foam sides which are already pretty smooth i wanted to make them even smoother by brushing some undiluted mr surfacer as it turns out it was a total disaster struck moment because the primer started melting the foam ah yeah whoops i was able to fix the damage to some extent with sanding but it's still gonna be there so yeah at least we learned something new today okay everything is in place and we are ready for painting here's the reference photo by the way this is actually how i often find ideas but before we continue i know that i've promised you something something like two or three figures yeah about that my plan was to try painting plastic figures i remember dragon being the hot stuff when i was younger and i thought it would be a nice experiment to you know see how they hold up against the resin ones when we look at the sprues they don't look bad like not bad at all i'm sure everyone is familiar with plastic figures and that you actually have to build them from several parts they also require more cleanup but to be fair this is utterly satisfying especially when you're removing the seam lines and filing all the faults and recesses and for the most part they look pretty good of course but it's just for the most part i mean when i assembled these two guys i was just i was disappointed to be honest their poses are stiff and unnatural and yeah their gear just looks like glued on if you catch my drift i didn't realize they'd need some re-sculpting and some modifications it's something i didn't plan for and honestly i don't even feel like that's something i'd be interested in at this moment at least so unfortunately the bass will have to do without them i'm very sorry i mean i had the best intentions but this was quite i wasn't feeling motivated at all but okay pinky promised my friends next time there will be figures look i already bought them it's definitely gonna happen okay so let's just go back to the base as always a dark primer is a good start for any type of terrain it's gonna add some depth and fake shadows around tight places such as between the grasshops for example not to mention it'll unify all the different materials and as such the paint will be adhering to one consistent type of surface spraying it on the exposed foam is okay it's just the brush application that's gonna destroy it i actually went over them one more time with black primer so the final brush painting with acrylics would be easier the ground already looks pretty scorched enough if i do say some myself but then we wouldn't have any fun with it all the vegetation on this base will be dry no happy green tones whatsoever i haven't done dry grass before so this was as good time as any to finally give it a shot dark yellow from tamiya is a great color for this and yeah it's the same color we would normally use for german yellow the ground was painted using the same colors like i used on the tank it's a quite boring base coat if you ask me but at least we'll be able to make the most out of it with enamel washes the burned grass was sprayed with german grey then i added some highlights here and there by adding white to the cray it's kind of funny how grass can be painted with german colors like german yellow german grey what's next oxide primer and finally the charred ground around it was sprayed with a greyish brown burnt ground usually has a dark brownish color so not only will this take care of that but it's also a good base coat for the ashes which we'll add later so anyway this might be the weirdest base coated vignette i've done so far but it's just a base coat which means now begins the real fun enamel earth washes are in my opinion the most effective and most efficient way to paint groundwork their low surface tension means they'll flow effortlessly around every detail on the gritty surface i really enjoy working with the so called wet blending method which means we don't have to wait for the first layer to dry but instead while still soaking with enamel thinner we immediately add the second color i like to create the first pass with random stains of lighter and darker tones in order to obtain some variety you know and then the second pass is more controlled i'm purposely not saying layer because this is still one layer and so the second pass is more focused on bringing out the terrain features lighter dry tone on the raised parts and the darker tone into recesses rats were flooded with a dark color it's not like i'm trying to make them completely muddy or anything i'm just sort of matching them with the tracks on the tank small amounts of both colors were also blended on the scorched parts to give them a more earth-like quality so to say and then i went back and added even more dark earth into the rods to make them you know noticeably darker than the rest of the road again sort of defining them you know adding more visual interest and as you can see a few enamel washes can do a lot of work and the best part is it's very easy groundwork is just a large canvas where you can experiment and just mess around it's essentially like adding mud to a tank but infinitely easier now it was time for some detailed work with acrylics the dried grass in my references had a much lighter color so i gave them some highlights so to say with a buff paint painting grass with the brush is pretty easy however the paint must be slightly thicker otherwise it will act as a wash this is super useful on the trampled grass as well which sort of blends in with the ground but this way we can make it stand out nicely i also made sure to pick out some of the larger stones with different gray and tan colors it doesn't take too much time despite how it looks and it gives the groundwork a lot of visual detail just a few minutes of brush painting and the road looks a lot busier now going back to enamels i added even more highlights with rain marks effects we can often go back and forth until the result looks just right but nothing adds more volume than a dark brown pin wash this is a technique which i'll be using more in the future because it really does wonders especially when there's loose scatter or grass on the ground this is why i was so stoked about it in the first place but be careful because it's very easy to overdo now we're gonna go back to acrylics yeah i know i'm jumping from one thing to another but don't worry we're almost done so going back i added even more highlights to the dried grass with pale sand just on the ends though and all the desolate disintegrated vegetation was painted with black then some middle tones with a dark gray then a highlight with light grey and finally some ashes with very light grey almost white and then back to enamels again yeah i know it's chaotic but bear with me this is like the first time i'm creating something like this so you know i don't have any by the book step-by-step guide on how to do it efficiently but okay i'm gonna put all the enamel bottles aside like for real this time and instead i'm gonna need something i hoped i'd never use again pigments but okay all grease is a dark grey pigment with a little touch of brown which is perfect for our needs and white well that's too white so i had to mix it with a little amount of old grease to get a light gray ashen color the application is very simple actually i just loaded the brush with a large amount of pigment and tapped it like a cigarette so it would fall down on its own it's yeah it's very straightforward however i'd highly recommend to apply less and then add more if needed pigments in general are very hard to remove and trying to wipe them away would just leave a huge mess i hold them in place with enamel thinner no pigment fixers or anything mainly because i don't have any anymore i just loaded a large amount of thinner touch the ground and let the capillary action do the rest this way i wouldn't manipulate the pigment particles in any way large amount of thinner takes a while to evaporate so i sped it up by blowing air from my airbrush over the surface and of course in post-production as well and then i repeated the application wherever i felt it was necessary honestly i don't see any way how i could replicate this effect with enamels or oil paints so even though i'm not a fan of pigments like not a huge fan at all i still have to admit they sort of i i guess they still have some legit uses in modeling but that doesn't mean i'm gonna start using them only if there's no better option which is quite rare so here we have it i'd say the groundwork is pretty much finished i don't know what else i would add so the last thing is to paint the sides with black paint it's interesting how the primer from goonsey started melting the foam but tamiya has no effect on it whatsoever i'd say it's because the primer is a pure lacquer based product and tamiyas are acrylic lager hybrids normally i'd glue the model to the ground like usual but it sort of fits in its place without any issues so i'm just leaving it there to see the insole and there we have it a scorched earth vignette to be fair this base was kind of a i don't know bumpy ride that hall of figure fiasco left me very demotivated to be honest yeah i was looking forward to some figure painting but they were just i just knew it wouldn't be worth it and i wouldn't enjoy the process like at all and i really don't feel like i'm ready for re-sculpting and you know modifying figures so yeah i had the best intentions and it just backfired at me i'm just i'm sorry for that and as for the base itself there's one extra reason why i didn't glue the model to it well i'm very happy with the result i mean the scorched ground turned out pretty well i think and the road section might be actually the best piece of terrain that i've done so far the model just doesn't fit in i don't know i'm not overly bothered with it or anything but there's just something that you know doesn't sit well with me but hey at least we have another model of the workbench and that means time for another project which i'm actually very stoked about because it's gonna be a huge american tank and i have a very clear vision for the diorama and yes this time it's finally gonna be a real diorama because i want to make a small building uh some figures which will interact with each other you know like socialize so yeah it's a pretty ambitious project so let's just hope it'll all go well without any issues so in the meantime let me say a big thank you for watching all the way to the end and thank you to my cool patrons who make this weekly show possible while you're watching this video i'm already working on the next model so that means all the updates are right there on my patreon page this is the kind of stuff i post almost every day and that means there's like hundreds of these updates from all my previous projects as well so it sort of reads like a modeling blog or a magazine but obviously that's not everything we have um one week early ad-free videos so you know you next model you can watch it right now [Music] yeah that's also there and of course we have bms so we can get in touch and the super nice studio photos which you can download in full resolution but anyway that's pretty much everything i had for you this week and i mean the model is not gonna build itself so until we see each other again stay safe stay awesome have fun and take care and i'll see your friends next week cheers", "bC9-ZUPDkHw": "ugh

scanned successfully your teammate will return to the battle when the next revived flight arrives airdrop has been delivered ah", "q5rdqLzy-Gw": "i think that like maybe there's always a number uh but one thing that i think about a lot are like this idea of like decision dilution and stakeholder types so right now it's just like me and trends pro members and i can optimize decisions for us you add sponsors on top of that you add employees on top of that you add partnerships on top of that you on all of these different stakeholder types and now you have to sort of dilute decisions to satisfy everybody at this table and i think that a lot of times people they focus on uh revenue diversification and don't necessarily think about that part of things where you may dilute your product by trying to satisfy all these different stakeholders and sometimes there are like win-win-wins wins but this is like the more demand that we add to this equation the harder it gets to find making everyone happy so hey drew welcome to the show thank you for having me dude man so look we've been speaking for i think almost a year or so i was looking at our emails and whatsapp not whatsapp sorry imessage twitter and core history so i think i'd been i'd seen your work maybe because you would listen to the fabrice grinder episode on createlab and um i was just like oh wow this guy writes incredibly concise and he takes these 20 30 hours worth of work and research and distills it let's give people a sense of what trends.vc is yeah so on the surface uh trendsvc helps entrepreneurs discover new markets and ideas uh below the surface i'm using what's changing to show you what doesn't change there's also a community component that a lot of people don't see uh and just to narrow down from entrepreneurs i would say those are like agency seeking entrepreneurs um entrepreneurs that prefer uh freedom over status freedom over glory completely man yeah i think that's what when i was kind of mapping out the different players in this space i see yours closer to the indie hackers style and i know you've been a huge part of that community as well and you've been on indie hackers podcast and talked all about that in the past um and then on that spectrum on the other far side i see like the go big or go home unicorn status vc backed high growth startup where 98 might fail um could you tell me a little bit more about that like where were you on that scale originally and did that change over time yeah i think as far as i can remember i've been towards the like freedom side of things uh some of that probably comes from um just not liking the ass like i don't like to ask for permission to do things and it just seems like uh maybe there are more gatekeepers uh when you take like the status route uh so that may be part of it uh and then also just think about the hedonic treadmill a lot of times where you may just be chasing uh just like gold you reach into the rainbow and then it just continues when you're chasing status or chasing anything outside of yourself as opposed to knowing what's enough yeah completely man and so when we first spoke i think you were only i i don't think you would even launch the paid newsletter yet i think you just started trends and i don't know how many issues you were into it um but you know you you you were taking every single week a completely new industry or a new trend that you're interested in and and distilling that down um talk to me a little bit about the scale that you're able to share whether that's revenue number of people subscribed anything to give people an understanding of that yeah so in terms of subscribers they're about 36 000 uh free email subscribers right now uh close to a thousand trends pro members about 800 or so are in the community you were previously a software engineer so you were you were coding day in day out it sounds like you're a technical person and then you went into this business which doesn't necessarily use those skills in um from an obvious point of view maybe on the mindset point of view the way you think things through and analyze things but like uh tell me a little bit about your background as a software engineer and like how that paved the foundation for what you're doing now yeah so you pretty much said it i taught myself ruby and ruby on rails in college and then out of college i went to school in tallahassee moved to atlanta worked in atlanta for five years as a software developer uh in terms of i guess transferable skills i think the logic helps a lot um in terms of if you get something wrong it's your fault like it's never the computer's fault you told it what to do uh in a similar way when i'm looking at things like predictions or opportunities i'm just looking at incentives and i'm like as long as these incentives stay static um this may happen or this may happen um so it's that type of ruthless logic of not what you want to happen but what might happen given the current incentives and the current players yeah and and you've kind of shared this transparently that you'd saved up 250k before you took the plunge and and took what you call like a sabbatical or a mini retirement or something like that um tell me a little bit about that because you you seem like quite an intentional person who who plans things out um and and like thinks things through so that seems like you know obviously not everyone can do that from day one and you're obviously earning enough money to to save up for that time um but how intentional was that number even was it like a certain number of months runway that you needed to get to to feel safe because i think a lot of people suffer from this right like they're in a job they might not hate it but they don't love it and they're just kind of in this in between period um so yeah i'm curious how what was going on in your head when you kind of decided that yeah so it wasn't a specific number that i had in mind and it wasn't even a date that i had in mind at first i remember i was reading uh tools of titans and uh he sampled tempura sample before our work week in the book which i never forget the four-hour work week i couldn't get past the intro but i went back and re-read it after this but whatever he put in that um in the sample it just made me put a date on my phone for like i'm gonna give notice on this date uh and i'd always save money like always sort of plan for the escape if you will um and that 250k felt like enough um to try to build an airplane while falling down yeah yeah i love that man that's interesting i'm surprised that you didn't like four hour work week because as much as um like i hate the title of the book but just knowing you now and from your work anyway it seems like a lot of those ideas would resonate with you like did you change your mind on it or no i love the book i love the book i just couldn't get past the intro maybe years ago years before that i would have started in the middle um what i actually did sometimes i do this trick of if a book is hard to read the physical version is hard to read i'll listen to the audio version and then if it's really good i'll go back and read the physical version and that's exactly what happened before our work week so yeah i love the book uh the intro was just a little tough to get to yeah yeah i know what you mean that's a great that's a great tip i've never done that before but yeah there's so many books where you start and you're like okay i can't believe people everyone's recommending this book is terrible and i think a lot of the time the author is like having to pitch the book in the first part whereas you've already been pitched by that point so the the context has changed quite a bit um so um let's talk a little bit about the mini retirement slash sabbatical um you you told me when we had our first ever call that you did jiu jitsu you were doing some improv classes you're creating these projects like tell me a little bit about that because that's not something most people get a chance to ever do yeah i guess some people have like gap years i felt like i had to create my own gap year gap years in a way um [Music] yeah that's pretty much it like a lot of people they fixate on the travel part but i didn't do a ton of traveling i went to like rio i went to europe i did travel there but i was spent most of my time in atlanta um doing things like jiu jitsu and improv and aggro yoga and just yeah trying new things could let's go into jiu-jitsu a little bit if you don't mind because you you strike me as someone who's quite philosophical in a way and we'll get into that in the second half of the show i've only heard about jiu-jitsu from like you know the mma folks joe rogan's podcast and it seems to become seems to have become one of the most popular things in that world now but the the thing that's really interesting to me is a lot of people tell me it's quite a creative process or while also kind of marrying like the logic part of your brain i don't know if if it's getting too deep but like like how do you see like jiu jitsu in the way that did it teach you anything by going through that process of doing it so much yeah it taught me a lot um a lot of times like i focus on the community part of it in terms of it was the like highest concentration of like high agency people that i've ever run into not individuals but just as a group it's almost like a forcing function for if you don't take accountability for these things for for things in your life like you will get hurt or you'll just get churned out of this sport um so i think that it's just like an interesting filtering function there uh and yeah i mean it taught me a lot competing taught me a lot um facing fears it's like hard to keep showing up early on right um i remember leaving the house before i went to my first class and i looked up on the forums uh like right before walking out the door like hey like do people get hurt they're like no you will get hurt it's just a matter of like when uh and it took a lot to like you know still walk out of the door and still show up early on uh but with a lot of things and i'm gonna make like a lot of these lateral jumps but with a lot of things like for example building a community it's a lot of work but it's worth it jiu jitsu you know there are some prices that you're going to pay and there's a price that you're going to pay but it's worth it um yeah some things in life interest completely no i love that man i'm glad i asked so let's go on to trends.vc so you you're writing this this uh newsletter every week you're enjoying the process you're not bringing any money in at the moment at this moment i think it was like two years or 30 something months you hadn't really earned that much um but then there was a person called uh is it whitt i think um whit anderson donated 15 for one of the reports i'm curious like you weren't even asking people for money at this point right so like have you spoken to that person i'm sure and and like like how did that make you feel because 15 is nothing compared to 250 250 000 dollars you had previously but the meaning you that is attached to that is so much more so if you could take me back to that moment like kind of how you felt and what it made you feel at the time yeah so wid and i we're in a mastermind um and that has a lot to do where i don't know if trends vc would exist without that mastermind so he's a member from the mastermind so i know who it was that donated it uh and yeah it was definitely before i started charging for reports i think i just dropped like a buy me a coffee link inside of the uh report and he was the only person that donated anything and i don't know if that was like one two three weeks uh before i started charging for reports but just because um i'm curious in terms of like seeing traction did that did something click in your brain to say oh someone's actually willing to pay for this this is something i need to double down on or had you already kind of made that decision i don't know if it was the traction idea as much as the idea around like there was literally no income for more than three years and like that was the single source of income it would have probably come off this traction of like wood and i didn't know each other um but i think that the like overriding feeling was there was some form of income uh and there had been three years right it wasn't like i was actively trying to make things work during that whole period um but it was like a it was it was a different feeling yeah man i i'm just going to share from my point of view as well because i used to have a job you know making a good salary similar to yourself and when you make that jump even if you saved i don't actually know how much i'd saved but it was in the hundreds of thousands as well and i was like okay i've got x amount of runway i don't need to worry about anything i can chill out and enjoy this process and i'll be honest like three months in i was like oh this is like i hate that feeling i was like seeing your bank account go down every month even if you've planned ahead there's just something that that's the rational part of the brain the emotional part of me was like oh man that's this has taken me 10 15 years of work and saving to get to this point what am i doing um like did you have that feeling as well or is it am i just being overly emotional about it no i had that feeling um something that you just made me think about that i hadn't thought about before but the type of person that it takes to like save large amounts of money it's like you save that and there's a feeling that comes from watching it build up and then we probably feel that stronger watching it go down um i will say that i didn't stress too much about it during the time i was like more focused on um i guess the thing i kept telling myself as i left that job was that i was doing this to grow faster and i felt like that was always worth more than that was that that feeling that positive feeling was worth more than the negative feeling of watching um my bank account dwindle yeah i've asked this question to quite a lot of people who have taken quite a big jump including for british grinder the guy that you had shared with me a long time ago i remember him saying like what's the worst that could happen like he he like was in lots of debt he was like getting people knocking on his door asking for money and i don't know if that's like a romantic story but i have a feeling it's kind of true like the way he's gone through it many times and i do think there's a certain type of person it takes and i'm not trying to say put this person on a pedestal i'm just saying it's a certain type of person who's okay with that feeling and that's a huge chunk of the entrepreneurial journey i think a lot of people underestimate that that feeling so i just want to bring up a tweet that you had shared in the past so this was right in the middle of you starting to um to try to monetize your newsletter so i'm just going to read it out and if you're watching on youtube you'll see on the screen here too my first shot of monetization failed last week 102 views zero sales just made my first sale on gumroad and another one while writing this tweet celebration so i'm just curious like that moment there man because again it's not really necessarily about the money but when you've when you put something out there and it doesn't necessarily work the first time this is something a lot of people have to deal with and they kind of just stop there because they feel embarrassed like i've done this uh to be really frank like you in fact i probably haven't even got to that stage sometimes because i was kind of so scared to do it so um i'm curious like did you feel that at the time as well did you have ways of navigating that yeah so at the time that i put that out there and it failed it was it felt bad um it felt bad particularly because a lot of people said like oh you should charge for these things you should charge it was almost like a pulling of the market out of me right if i was comfortable waiting longer but people said that and then you actually do it and no one uh purchases on the flip side when it actually did work and when i sent that tweet um on the yeah what ended up happening was that it might seem it might seem extreme but it's just like i knew it was going to work i i knew it was going to work whereas always the question during those three years of will i have to go back to work for someone else and it's like that that morning answered that question if that makes sense that's that's interesting because yeah you you by this point you tried so many projects that hadn't worked necessarily right but you just knew that if you just kept trying different things one of them was going to stick i didn't know that but that morning i knew that yeah okay yeah yeah yeah yeah got it all right got you got you man um yeah well and and so that was probably quite an amazing feeling um our mutual friend uh jack butcher writes on the internet uh what making one dollar on the internet can change your life and i really think that's really true i think it's such a great way of putting it because again it's not about the amount it's about the confidence you get from someone paid me for something that i created it was in my head i figured it out i wrote something i shared something i made a product wherever that was and that is such an amazing thing and i think what you've done an amazing job of is sharing that journey along the way from way before you even made that money um and even people like myself i think i signed up to the pro version the first time i saw it which was the paid communities newsletter so and i think even then there wasn't like a yearly um option it was just like pay for the paid version of this and i'll be honest like the main reason i paid was because one i thought i was going to get value from it but honestly it was more because i was like this guy's doing some amazing work and as a creator myself i'm like i want to support this person not in like a charitable way but just i know that 10 15 whatever it is is gonna like help um in a way and move them in that direction and i feel like that's the big shift we've gone through whereas i read a bunch of newspapers that i always open incognito windows to see the free version of the site because i don't feel the same affinity to that like how important do you think that individual versus a brand of a company um toss-up is in this evolution we're all going through i think it matters a lot and it used to bother me because i felt like people should like want to pay for the value of what you're gonna get from this and less so buying into the story uh and i've just become i've just come to accept it because i've heard it so much whether hey i saw your story here or i saw this tweet or whatever and it's just like it's it's a part of the game story matters we've got 100 man well and to clarify on my side just to give the nuance point on that like i was already getting value up front for free and it was just more like a way for me to say keep doing the valuable thing you know and i think we've gone through this evolution from like the thousand i've mentioned this on the podcast a few times but the thousand true fans model of like kevin kelly's model which is really based on altruism and like supporting the artist but went going all the way to like the hundred true fans model lee jin which is really more about i'm gonna pay for value and that's why someone can charge for a four thousand dollar course versus like you know just like a ten dollar cd or a concert ticket you know and that's a simplified view of it but i think we have really gone through a shift there um so yeah um last thing on trends before we go into some of the the areas that we're the underlying areas from trends um someone made you an offer quite early on to buy trends right i don't know how much to invest to invest i don't know how much you're allowed to share about this or whatever you're happy to share but i'm curious like what was that offer like and like what made you say say no at that time yeah the offer it was almost like two extremes like i talked about before these these extreme feelings on one end it was like a day or two it may have been like a few hours before i posted the report um not the report the post three years no income so it was a couple hours before that that they reached out uh so on one end uh i have sort of this like irrational respect for like early believers of people that like believe without a good reason or support you without a good reason uh so that was that end on the other end um i just had a lot of belief in trends vc itself and it didn't seem like the offer matched like i had more conviction than they had completely um has that person made an offer again since then or or have you had other offers like that since yeah i've had a lot of other offers uh that person we've talked but um they haven't made another offer do you think you'd ever take investment or or something like that to take some money off the table or you're now at the stage where it doesn't really make sense i think that like maybe there's always a number uh but one thing that i think about a lot are like this idea of like decision dilution and stakeholder types so right now it's just like me and trends pro members and i can optimize decisions for us you add sponsors on top of that you add employees on top of that you add partnerships on top of that you add all of these different stakeholder types and now you have to sort of dilute decisions to satisfy everybody at this table and i think that a lot of times people they focus on uh revenue diversification and don't necessarily think about that part of things where you may dilute your product by trying to satisfy all these different stakeholders and sometimes they're like win-win wins wins but this is like the more demand that we add to this equation the harder it gets to find making everyone happy uh so i think that uh bringing on invested investment would compromise that i'm gonna ask a question man about like you if you're watching youtube you can see me grinning right now right and and you're obviously watching me grinning while you were giving me the answer i'm curious like have you always thought like this because i feel like that when i've spoke we've spoken maybe like three four five times on the phone or you know we've texted we've we've spoken in clubhouse for some time in the past as well and i'm always so impressed by like the way you think you you seem to have all these frameworks in your head of making decisions or thinking about things in such a unique way do you feel like you always have had that as an adult anyway or is this something you think has developed because of the way you write and the the research and the work that you've put in um i'm sure it's a bit of both i'm curious like do you kind of know what i'm talking about or like that way of describing like the decision dilution or whatever you said there like that's something like again you articulate that in a way that i wouldn't have articulated but it makes complete sense so just cut us on your thoughts on that yeah i think i've always had um what you're talking about but i think that like over the past year of like working on trends dc uh like i've learned to love conflict in terms of if you're saying something that something's maybe not like landing with me it's probably not because you're wrong it's something that i don't see so i'd like i'm drawn to those points of conflict and that's just caused like all these models to tighten up um whereas before it's just like oh like you know he doesn't know what he's talking about she doesn't know it's just like no there's something that i'm missing um so i've learned to like love those areas and like everything that's made everything else tighter if that makes sense and do you find writing about stuff tightens that more than anything else even more than talking it through it's on par right i would say writing is on par with having conversations so at some point we may talk about the like research process and since report 30 i've been doing these report reviews where i have conversations with beginners but as well as domain experts uh and it's in it like having to break this down down to another person or like pull things out of them so i can like clarify my own thinking that helps a lot uh but that wouldn't be enough writing also helps where i just feels there's this sense of accountability where of 36 000 people somebody on the other end of this is gonna know more about this thing than i am so that forces a certain level of like intellectual honesty out of you of like you're on stage each week um i know i'm jumping around but like lenny and i like we talked about where a lot of times people talk about like this content treadmill and at least at the time when i talked to him we were both like we don't feel this way like when you love what you're doing you don't feel like you're on a concert trip no but there is a sense of a trust treadmill where each week you have to maintain the level of trust that you have with your audience completely uh and that can be draining like you're almost an athlete so yeah that's a great point about um that's exactly how i feel about the podcast so it's a place for me to take these black and white examples and takes that i read elsewhere and really go into nuance and find the gray area um and and second the second part you talked about the the content treadmill versus the trust treadmill i do feel a little bit of the the content treadmill because when you commit to something once a week and it takes you know yours takes 20 30 hours of research it sounds like whatever it is yeah yeah and and mine is the same like you know the the one podcast might take 10 hours of editing sometimes it takes a bunch of research beforehand you know booking post promoting so yeah it's the same thing um but it definitely helps when you enjoy that process what i found though is the trust part is something i've really that resonated a lot where you just said that because i've kind of challenged myself especially this year um to say like every single episode i put out i need to be 100 proud of and i need to have taken out stuff if it was boring or not useful to people and and that's hard when you're doing long form right because you know when you're actually writing something you can it's incredibly hard when you're writing too but there's something with like long-form conversations where it's it's quite subjective what's useful for someone and you don't always know until someone listens to it a lot of people with newsletters they talk about like editing and i don't have editors but that's something that the report reviews help out with because it's almost like i'll describe a report review really quickly so the report the draft the outline is already there and at this point i'm just throwing up ideas to try to get someone to poke holes in them but in the way it's like i'm doing stand-up where i'm trying to fight figure out i'm looking at your eyes looking at your reaction to see what hits and what doesn't so like while there aren't editors but i do understand like how content or how ideas will land each week so that helps a lot otherwise like i would be very nervous sort of like you're saying like does this get cut because it sort of hasn't been exposed to air right it's just we've been in this vacuum the whole time yeah i love the stand up for example because this that's exactly how like a comedian might spend two years in the comedy club every night performing for hours uh or like you know multiple sets just to get like one hour's worth of a special down and that's exactly like i've talked to quite a few people who write and they feel the same like there's the writing part and then there's a refining editing part so we'll definitely go into that a little bit i'm curious to to go into that a little bit deeper around the signals you're looking out for because i think that's useful for you know multiple areas of life whether that's writing like you are podcasting like i am or even in a sales meeting a business meeting a relationship so what are those kind of signs that you've noticed from doing so many of those conversations where you're like oh that person's finding interesting or they find or they're looking confused like are there some uh common things that you're looking out for yeah i think one of the best feelings is when like someone spent 10 or 20 years in the area and they hadn't thought about like an opportunity or connection that was made uh and usually that type of stuff also helps people just entering like or thinking about entering this market um so i think that's one of my favorite uh sort of feelings when i see that like i help them make a novel connection um [Music] other than that i mean it stuff that like anyone would see whether it's like you can see like confusion on someone's face or like follow-up questions it's like okay look i need to clarify that i need to tighten that part up uh but i think that's table stakes was there any is there an example of one of a time where you where you went into it with a report and you're doing this process and you were quite surprised by how many people misunderstood a certain point or had an opposing view because i'm sure that happens all the time where what you've written doesn't completely land in the way that you think but i'm i'm thinking from another angle which is just completely surprised like blindsided almost yeah um there's been a couple of things where i've talked about like uh one to n or zero to one versus one and i forgot which report i dropped that in i know i've talked about it recently but way before that it was dropped another report and i'm glad i had audio uh and report 52 to sort of like get the point through uh where there were actually people who thought they were going zero to one that were going on the end that like adopted the language of one to end it was just a big like confusion there uh the other thing was probably around um sometimes i'll talk about like uh data insight and signal whereas just like data is just a commodity like we're picking up data now uh insight some work some operation has been done on this data and then signal is the point at which you just stop questioning like your source of data like naval probably has signals naval says something we're just gonna like follow him wherever the hell he's going right uh and that also has a flip side where it's like around the colder personality and i think that um with data like it's hard to like earn money or anything off of like data insight you can do that but it can get stolen versus signal with signal you almost have to attach what was said or what was done to the person for it to have value uh and i used that i probably last time i probably used that framework was in the paid newsletter report when i'm sort of looking at like can you charge for this can you charge for that is your work able to can you commoditize like this work um but yeah that's probably something else that was confused yeah that makes a lot of sense man um so we're going to go into the next section thanks for sharing that on on trend so you're writing about all sorts of trends from nfts to paid newsletters to communities to d5 like anything under the sun that we've probably been reading about i always go to your source like this weekend i reread the nft report because obviously right now nfts are super hot again uh or more hot than they've been in the past and um i found that to be incredibly useful because i can click into a lot of the links that i previously didn't click into and then i could spend half an hour reading a long guide that you've already kind of summarized but picking up more details um but what we were going to focus on today is beyond just the trends that we're all looking at because people should already just see that in your reports what we wanted to dig into were um meta trends so so first of all could you kind of explain what you think of uh when we talk about this idea of meta trends what does that mean yeah i think about it in two ways where it's like early on i talked about like using what's changing to show you what doesn't change like that's one manifestation of it the other idea is just that it's a sustained trend i have a friend we just hopped off of a call but like we were talking about no code which is like there's no code trending yet no code is trending but no code is also here to stay it's a sustainable trend um so i'm sort of being messy in a thinking there by combining two ideas into one of these meta trends and and when we've spoken about this in the past you described um i i can't remember exactly what you said let me see i wrote this down but essentially it was about you're you're using what's changing to show people what doesn't change i thought that was amazing line because you know often we look at we get excited by the things that are changing like you said like no code okay now everything needs to be built and no code no one needs a developer anymore is the obviously i'm exaggerating but what you are really looking out for are these underlying things that are applying across the board so why don't we go into a few of those that you've been seeing from your vantage point um the first one that i've kind of noticed from a lot of your writing is all about democratization um and i thought of that as two different parts one is the access to knowledge and access to relationships but like when i say democratization as a meta trend like is that accurate first of all and like where do you see this happening yeah i think that's accurate um also think about it in terms of it allows it allows you to like just understand the business logic of the problem that you're solving you don't have to understand the tooling or all these things that go into it it almost puts more pressure on you for you to like understand your audience and your customer than how to code or how to animate or how to do all of these other things um whereas before that would have been a barrier to entry got you man and and are there any particular areas that you're really seeing this be more prominent than others like if you think of the reports that you've written about um you know like uh example that i can think of is just the internet as a whole for many years has obviously democratized access to information uh but in in more recent years even though social media has been around for some time i feel like the barriers to connecting with people which i think has always been a huge barrier to um i don't want to use the word broadly as success but just you know improving your own life circumstances whatever that is um a lot of the time it comes down to who you're learning from who you're surrounding yourself with the environment you're in and i think for i could speak from my own self like if i think about like the things i'm interested in now versus as a 16 year old they're actually pretty similar but the people that i now know who are interested in the same things people like yourself like even if they're virtually me speaking to those people is 100x now and that's because that's 10 15 years of compounding research and digging but it's also because there's twitter and there's clubhouse and there's all these worlds where like those people are coming together so i'm curious like is there anything else to add to that point there around like ways that you've felt that yourself as well yeah no i think i think you're spot on like it applies to connections it applies to creating where i probably also mentioned like newspapers and newsletters code to no code tv to youtube all of these areas where again the barrier to entry is coming down completely um so another trend that i've noticed from your work is around um this idea of smaller firms having kind of a lot more leverage than they did in the past and i think you mentioned no code there um and access to data and information as another part of that when when we had talked about this in the past i had actually said companies versus individuals and you rightly corrected me in a way and said actually my point is more around like you're able to do a lot more now as a smaller individual or a small team than you might have done in the past so like are there any examples of that that you've seen um like why is that first of all before we go into example yeah i would i would even break that down further to say that the fact that there is these there are these tools that give you more leverage that leads to the smaller firms right like it's sort of path dependent that way um but again let's take no code right if you take the the constraint from you know to build this app you have to understand the business logic you have to understand the problem that you're trying to solve but you also have to know how to code uh you you whittle down like the number of people who can attack that opportunity but if you could say hey there's this visual development tool and all you have to do is understand the business logic and be willing to put you know in some type of like minimum threshold of work to understand how to like build that app or whatever whatever the product is you're going to get a lot more people attacking that uh and now they don't have to like hire a developer or find a co-founder and you see it with anything right like you lower the friction you get more of that thing uh and then that also means that companies don't have to be as large as they had to be in the past because you sort of have these tools that are doing the job of people which gives you as an individual more leverage i'm curious how you think of that as someone who is technical who's spent time learning to code and and build things with you know custom code um i've heard you write that code is being commoditized there's still a game being played but it's in distribution and that was in one small snippet of a wider idea um on the on the flip side you know if you think of the last five to ten years a lot of people in the press even in politics have talked a lot about the need for coders more coders and more technical people like what's your opinion on that do you feel like that was overstated and now because of a lot of these tools the what we're actually looking for is technical proficiency not necessarily the ability to custom code or you know i'm curious what you think about it yeah i wouldn't i wouldn't push back on what they said i would just say that perhaps we need more builders we don't necessarily need more coders there's probably like an 80 90 overlap in terms of i have friends that can build things and they're better at breaking down problems than developers are if you work as a developer at some company for i don't know three four five years and you never build anything outside of that you use the you lose the ability to break problems down you lose the ability to build products but you see a lot of no code people that can build things so i would like sort of tweak what they said to say hey we need more builders i forgot the first part of the question no no that makes a lot of sense no i was curious on um as a technical person do you feel a certain way about that or like because because you know you spent many years learning that um i think you're probably a bit more pragmatic than to say oh well i spent so many years learning it therefore i need to protect this position but like i'm curious do you think that that makes a difference now like if so another way of phrasing this question is if i if we're speaking to someone who's 18 years old right now and they're trying to figure out what to spend the next five years learning and they're interested in building stuff do you think that they should learn to code or would you say maybe just start with the no code route and and practice actually building i think that no code is a great rant one to like anything you're gonna do and i would also say that like no code doesn't solve all problems you can't you may not be able to build halo with the no code tool or like go work it near a link right so it just depends on like sort of working backwards like what's your goal what problem are you trying to solve uh and more and more um you can solve more problems with no code or low code solutions and i just think about it in terms of abstraction if you're going to go for more if you're going to use some type of abstraction you have more leverage you have more power but you also trade off uh custom mobility or custom you can't customize as much uh so there's always that trade-off here the pros and cons for sure man um the other thing that i've noticed in a lot of your work so you've done uh reports on d5 crypto world uh nfts non-fundable tokens these are all like lots of buzzwords so if you're listening to this and you're like what the hell are they talking about don't worry most of us still don't know including myself so but this i would bucket in the the meta trend of decentralization and i think in 2021 this is being talked about as like a big 10-year trend that we're going to be moving towards and there's debate to be had there um i'm curious on your take do you think that's accurate are we moving to a world of more decentralization is it important um yeah curious what you think yeah we are and i do think it's important um it's hard to overstate how important it is uh yeah i just dropped a report last night on decentralized autonomous organizations dowse um yeah i have nothing else to add that you just have to check that report out because anything i say uh might seem extreme but i also don't yeah i'm just to go into that a little bit more from devil's advocates i might say well what's wrong with um a centralized currency for example not to turn this into a bitcoin podcast but you know for a lot of people who are still learning about that world they're still saying well yeah the price of bitcoins going up and um you know clearly there's value moving in that direction but what's wrong with having a centralized uh what's wrong with centralized institutions controlling things in the first place do you have an opinion on that yeah you asked about uh the currency example and it's just like i think that depends on whether you live in venezuela or the u.s or the uk i mean people keep talking about like inflation in the u.s that that line might not be uh so solid you know going forward so uh it also reminds me of conversations where people would say like oh like bitcoin mining is wasteful i'm not a bitcoin maximalist but people who say that i think it just depends on the experience that you've had have you had you know currency that you're holding uh hyperinflated or not so i've also seen you talk about positive sum networks and this is something i took from one of your reports you'd written that networks of the future will be more positive some i think that ties in a little bit with some of the decentralization stuff we've we just touched on previously i'm curious like if i say that statement networks of the future will be more positive some you might have written it some time ago but like what comes to mind for you i'm sure you've seen so many examples of this happening i think crypto is probably an example of that or or d5 anyway uh the way things are kind of split up in in some of those worlds but are there any examples you can think of where where you would think that's why i made that statement yeah actually i don't remember making that statement but the report that i just dropped on daos i think is an example of that where you just have you have more equitable networks where the the threat of a fork will keep power and check right where it's just like the the barrier to exit for facebook to some other platform or amazon to some other platform that barrier is very high but when you're saying hey like this code is open source and i can just fork it look at like unit swap and sushi swap of what happened there it doesn't even have to be that the the network itself is doing anything predatory opportunity costs can hit a certain threshold where there's a better way of doing something and then a team or a person attacks that opportunity again because the like switching costs aren't as high um as as they typically are with these like more private networks what's also happening and uh chris dixon talks about this in terms of why decentralization matters are is like the s-curve of market marketplaces where they tend to be like you know very generous up front of uber they're going to give you cell phones and they're going to give you all these things until they hit liquidity and then they start to capture value from that network you know which is fine uh but again now we have this alternative where the network principles can also be the network participants uh and if all else equal you can be part of a network where you have equity in it early not eight years after that i feel like facebook but early um you're gonna be more invested in getting that network off the ground and then it's gonna be stickier for you right um on the backyard could i just consciously we mentioned daos could you just um define kind of what dao is or explain what it is for someone who's never heard of it before yeah yeah so it stands for decentralized autonomous organization the like most well-known dow that this is sort of controversial it shouldn't be controversial but like bitcoin is a doubt miners are voting for the future of the future of the reality that they want uh ethereum as well with proof of stake the people actually holding ether are involved in staking either they'll validate or not validate they'll they'll sort of vote for the reality that they want to live in uh but it's all over the place like you're seeing doubts created around communities dao is created as like venture funds where um there's like no central management uh there's a governance system but the governance the rules are very clear it's not arbitrary right of we're gonna uh prosecute this person we're not gonna prosecute this person like it's encoded that that can't happen or if it can't can happen is transparent right that's a very different reality uh that we live in right now where things are just you think about robin hood you can't uh buy more game stop shares but you can buy everything else right like if we knew those with the rules of the game you know when we signed up for robin hood what if many as many people signed up no so we talked about do these things matters that's like one small example but i think it's going to change social networks marketplaces nations this is this is the extreme part i'm talking about but you'll just have to check out the report yeah that's that's a great summary thanks for sharing man i think we could probably talk for two hours just about that world so for the sake of time we can move on but definitely i'll share the link to your report on this uh really interesting area um you just mentioned robin hood there um and one of the other kind of trends that i've seen around alternative assets investing the things that i've been really most interested in from your work actually the alternative assets report was maybe one of my top three favorite ones and it's one that i keep going back to to see the references again um but fractional ownership is a big part of that right so the example i think you've shared in your writing around art is masterworks they've come around and said well maybe you can't buy a basket painting yourself but you can own a tiny percent of this thing that we're buying collectively robinhood also you can go and buy you know a certain percentage of a stock rather than the whole thing similar with bitcoin and crypto so um like how important do you think fraction ownership is in all of these things as we transition um and are there any other examples that are worth kind of sharing is fractional ownership um i'll just i'll just tell you where my mind went it's not really answering the question but it's about what does it do to asset prices if you can make this asset more liquid all else equal the price is going to go up right so we're going to see asset inflation like with something with this i don't know bulls championship jersey sell for as much of it as it is if i couldn't buy like a ten dollar share in it as if i had to like run all the money up front probably not like there's a such a thing called like liquidity premiums um that's that's what i think about when i think about tokenization that's a yeah that's a great example actually so um i'm curious since you just brought it up like what do you think about this whole nft space and you know you just mentioned the owning a percentage of a balls jersey which you can do on like rally road i think um they they offer that there's also um that's slightly different to kind of like nba top shot which is owning like a clip essentially uh of like lebron's dunk from like a year ago or in the finals um like how how much what's your opinion on this space do you think is kind of over-hyped or um do you think it's kind of here to stay yeah i think it's here to stay i think it's one of the examples of i see it a lot but like we're living in lags right now and when artists realize that you can create this piece of art that actually functions like music publishing functions in terms of like these continuous revenue streams a lot of people that might be listening to this they don't even realize that that's possible right so it's just like when our understanding catches up with what's possible um there's gonna be a lot of a lot of interesting things happening i i think that nft is like it's just it's it's a new form of not even a new form of art it's art right so people talk about like why do you need art why are people spending all of this money on art if that doesn't make sense to you enough cheese may not make sense uh if it does the entities may make sense to you yeah and and also just to clarify for people who don't know what nfts are just think of them as essentially collectibles is the way i'm seeing a lot of examples where where previously and that might not be an actual and accurate definition but the examples i'm thinking of like you collect art offline analog you know like on the wall and now there are people selling that are online but there's they're being able to do that on a blockchain and that means that if someone sold it for a thousand dollars today but in the future that got sold for ten thousand dollars that can automatically pay the original artist money through smart contracts or whatever so it's it's actually a really incredible use case where it actually just makes sense straight up whereas i think three four years ago when we saw this crypto boom there were a lot of there's still speculation across the board but i think a lot of people were saying well what's the use case here like blockchain sounds cool but where am i where am i actually going to use a smart contract and i think this is an example of something we all can just see straight away everyone agrees that the creator of that art should get paid later and if we can able to if we can increase that happening more often in a transparent way that seems like a much better way of doing things yeah it's just like provable scarcity like provable uniqueness um and again like art collectibles like that's a huge use case i think we'll also see um nfts applied to other areas like i talked about a lot of use cases in that report as well completely um the last thing to to call out here is direct to consumer so i think we've seen that for some time we've seen direct to consumer retail brands um i think you're a great example of a diet to consumer you know newsletter right like you don't need to have an editor in between to give you distribution you went direct you own that relationship through email um and there's there's a few different examples of that are there any other areas where where it's worth calling out like this meta trend yeah i think that like that's table stakes at this point where we see with like udemy or appsumo where like udemy they can take up to 75 percent of the revenue absolute mode could take up to 70 of the revenue and rightfully so like if you if you're bringing attention trust distribution to this relationship that's the scarce part of the value chain and that's the type of stuff that i'm talking about when i'm saying that like code is being commoditized but like proprietary distribution is not and i think that this is a manifestation of it so the next part we're going to talk a little bit about your research and writing process um as i said at the beginning of the show i think you're an incredible example of someone who can take lots of information and distill it down to the most important parts and i think that applies not just in writing but learning your job podcasting pretty much anything so hopefully anyone listening to this can learn from your process um so where does this all start i'm assuming it starts with an idea for a report but yeah you tell me where does this whole process start for you yeah so it starts with the backlog and evernote uh and i've had this since before trends vc started before the first report went out and the list just gets longer uh when the community spun up shortly after that we created this uh channel called nexup where it's like upcoming topics are posted in there so weeks months ahead uh you can like drop comments predictions opportunities that you see about these topics uh and that's where i pull from to figure out like okay what are we gonna talk about this week what's what's next up uh from there um i'm gonna like experiment with something uh this week but from there it's usually just going deep into research understanding what the topic is so like podcasts youtube videos books everything just like immersion uh something else i'll do pretty early on now is i'll line up report reviews before i've done any research so like who do i want to try to talk to for this uh later on in the week and sort of have those in place uh and then before those calls take place i'll do a draft and then yeah that's what we're talking about in terms of report reviews i'm just throwing ideas up to see how people react um and i'm really just trying to like extract conflict i'm trying to like get people to push back and poke holes and things uh we talked about this earlier but just to make ideas tighter uh and then after those report reviews are done it's it's this that's where the distilling starts where if what i'm reading off of or what i'm sort of like referencing these bullet points is very like rough idea it could be 10 000 words it could be 15 000 words i'm not like reading that out i'm just sort of like this is the big idea here and throwing that idea up to see what happens uh and then it's that process of taking those 10 000 or 15 000 words down to less than a thousand thousand each week and it's like that's usually happening on like a saturday and sunday so like typically how many like podcasts and videos would you maybe get through for like this recent report you just did on dows um i'm curious like what does that look like in tangible terms this may have been like 79 episodes or something or maybe i'm mixing it up like hours it's a lot that's a lot of research that's crazy sorry wait 79 hours of podcast i may be mixing that up with that so let's give me one second because i can tell you exactly let's do it it says 172 episodes is what it says yeah so i'll tell you what ends up happening yeah what ends up happening is that if a podcast isn't high signal at first i'll just hit skip and it's like when you've done this for i did this all throughout many retirement where i talk about this idea of if i wasn't doing trends vc i would still be doing trends vc like i would still be learning these things um but the fact that like i'm on this cadence of weekend and we got week out that creates this pressure um yeah that creates this pressure to get stuff out so it's like a lot of habits have to tighten up so yeah if a podcast of those 172 maybe i'll listen to like less than half because if it isn't a signal at first i'll just skip it and and just take me to that because even 50 is crazy to me so like like if you go through 50 of those i'm assuming you're not doing them at 1x speed because that would take forever um so you're going like what kind of speed you listen to these at as fast as it can so i switched to something called himalaya which has playlists it just it actually saves me a couple hours a week just switching apps from castro to himalaya um so yeah i think it's 3x is the fastest one thing that castro had was still like shortened pauses between uh words so i missed that feature but the time is made up and so so so this is actually i was in a clubhouse room a few nights ago and people were having a debate around you know listening to podcasts xspeed versus regular and i think there's a difference between doing research and like enjoyment and maybe we'll get into that in a second but let's go in to get a little bit more tactical i'd love to understand like you're listening to a podcast let's use my podcast example because i know you listened to the one with febreze grinder in the past on marketplaces so you let's say you're getting through that two three x speed whatever it is are you writing writing notes as you go along are you like highlighting things somehow now what does that process look like yeah so i'm taking notes in like apple notes though not the whole time but if something is said and that's the thing like i hate to seem critical but like there's a lot of like noise in podcasts so i end up i end up skipping a lot of stuff i think the highest form of respect is if i'm listening to uh a podcast that someone makes me like slow it down permanently like chris dixon did that last week when he's talking about decentralization when he's talking about dows i can't listen to him at 3x because he's dropping so many bombs back to back that i have to slow it down i think that's the ultimate form of respect but i can count on one hand the number of people that make me do that completely that's insane so then you're writing stuff down and then you get like a apple notes or whatever you've got what happens then after that you've distilled all this information in some note form take me from that process from notes to google doc or whatever else yeah yeah i'll air drop that note to my macbook move that into google docs uh and the process begins if i understand the framework and that's what allows me to throw all of this time that we just talked about in the research because i'm not playing with structure i understand what the structure is going to be so i can get crazy in these other areas uh and then it's just like okay is this a prediction that i have is this an opportunity what ends up happening with the podcast is that it's hard to describe but like it's not a lot of areas where it's like i haven't touched the area before but like if i'm listening to someone talk about this it's just like okay i understand what the incentives are now i understand what the players are that allows me to make predictions um yes it's hard to describe it's hard to describe what's going on in my head when i'm when i'm sort of like drawing these notes out okay um since we're on the podcast topic let's just close that loop the 3x versus 1x are there any times like that's for research what do you ever listen to podcasts or audiobooks for fun as well or are they always kind of like you know for this purpose yeah i listen to like um i prefer to read novels but sometimes i'll listen to novels and i don't typically do those on 3x but even podcasts that i listen for enjoyment um again like not to seem critical but there's just a lot of noise out there and it's not like a ton of gym so even if i do feel like um this podcast is like worth listening to for a sustained period it usually helps to like three exit yeah yeah completely fair enough and that's i guess the the beauty of it everyone can take that and do what they what they want with it yeah um i was in a room with uh julian you know shapiro and greg eisenberg is it and one of their friends and there was a discussion around this and i think you know if anyone follows julian's work he's he's a great thinker he's a great clear thinker i think and a great writer as well he organizes his writing really beautifully um but i felt like they were trying to apply that to creating a podcast i think he's been testing something out with cortland allen from indie hackers something like that and um their friend was saying well why don't you do this you can record the conversation and then like just edit it down so that every there's a dopamine here every like three minutes or something like that and i'll just share that because i think it's interesting because personally as someone who does a podcast i don't necessarily think that's what average is necessarily looking for um because i think that it's kind of like a movie if there was like straight dopamine here every single time like it's not like there needs to be a bit more of an arc to it but it also completely depends on the podcast so it's is we can't talk in absolutes here uh but that's personally like for me i'm trying to have a good conversation whereas like there are other people who are you know taking uh it's more question answer and it's a lot easier to do that whereas for me it's a little bit more like building on ideas and exploring them in a different way but i i think they're both valid they're just completely different approaches um who are the other podcasts like you said five are there a few that stand out that you actually do see quite a high signal from yeah i think about that in terms of uh the guests the guests that made me slow down but in terms of like consistently good podcasts like i love what uh sonal is doing with a16z their podcast i text you every other week about another fire podcast that you just dropped um to go back into uh d5 like the bankless guys that's really good yeah you're making me pull back up this app but i mean yeah there are a lot of them yeah no that's great i mean hopefully some recommendations people too um just to close the loop on the the writing process thanks for sharing that i haven't heard you share this in this much detail so it's really helpful even for me let's talk about the edit part because you talked about like a long list are there questions that you're asking yourself um when you're editing so for example paulina marinova who's on the who was on the podcast she told me something along the lines of does this benefit the user is this there for my ego um and like basically does this need to be in there but i'm curious how you think of that is there like a framework you're thinking through yeah if i was to simplify it i'll say like how many and how much how many people does this apply to how many people does this affect how much does it affect them i'm just trying to digest that so so how many and how much yeah so if i'm talking about let's say let's take the structured interview report which was uh 53 and i'm saying hey like there are investment funds that use this approach to find deal flow are more people likely to build content businesses or are more people likely to start similar funds that could benefit from this strategy my guess is the content business strategy so i'm gonna front load that and let this fall to the back possibly off of the many things that end up getting cut from this report that ended up making into the report but it wasn't as front loaded as the content part was and then let's take content and i can't think of another example from that report but let's just like imagine another bullet and then the question is okay this this affects a similar number of people how much which one is like deeper which one is um more novel or whatever which one carries more value hmm god no that's that's helpful um kind of on that part we we touched on the community input kind of earlier on but even once you send this out i'm sure people respond with emails people tweet you and respond to those as well something any content creator goes through is well any person who starts a business goes through this as well but specifically with content because it's so subjective there's there's lots of feedback so how do you filter out the feedback that is useful to you versus the feedback that gets ignored yeah it's interesting you talked about ego earlier uh i wouldn't share these but it's funny how like some people they like reply to emails out of ego um i i look i look like i don't know those are easy to sort of like disregard um i don't know i don't know because i don't think about it yeah to clarify the ego respond do you mean they're responding to show hey i know something about this that you don't or is that what you mean yeah or it could be this is what actually happens where it's just like oh like did you see this and it's like that's in the like 80 or 90 that ends up getting cut each week completely um or i will say like it's is what it's harder to create easier to criticize of like i love feedback i'm always open to feedback um sometimes it's just like sometimes sometimes it's just lazy thinking like on their part i'm just like i could like walk down this road with you for us to realize that this is like a dead end or you could like you know do a little bit more processing up front end up there um but yeah that's not the majority that's not the majority of responses uh to take a couple steps back i think the biggest thing that i've gotten from like email replies are around format tweets so if people are saying like it would be great if you sort of like give a short prescription to the players section even the idea that like links are now summarized that came back in email replies uh yeah that type of stuff always helps and that that helps a lot in terms of the format evolving all the time one other point i'll mention is um constraints i think this is something that we've talked a lot about uh what we've talked about before when we first spoke and i've seen that in a lot of creators who i see who are prolific the ones writing every week at speed at velocity um they have some form of constraints and i think for you from what i can see anyway the big constraint uh is the format like in the email so you've got why it matters problem solution players predictions opportunities key lessons haters my favorite section and then links um like could you talk a little bit about constraints like what how important is that in your creative process because i think that's something i've struggled with in the past because my mind goes everywhere and over time the constraints have helped organize my thoughts and i think a lot of people can maybe benefit from that yeah i think you said it perfectly in terms of it helps organize your thoughts and like signal and noise is so cliche now we have to come up with like another phrase but if you're saying that i have all of this stuff and i have to somehow prioritize what to include um that just i wouldn't say guarantees but that makes it more likely that we can in a week out um yeah we can't work out like you're coming with like consistent high signal stuff and it's also harder to do like i can like sit here and like type all day and not really care about the reader or care about their time uh but it actually takes more to like really distill something down to its essence how do you think about audio now that you've just started doing that in recent uh i think there's only one i saw maybe today's one i haven't read through that yet taking your approach on on the writing side are you how are you developing that in audio format yeah so i've done audio twice uh one was for competitor risk that was done for like the one year anniversary of trends bc the other one was on digital products and the pattern i've noticed is that i tend to have this strong urge to do audio when i feel like a lot of good stuff will get chopped from a report because of that a thousand word constraint that i have in place um and also just competitive risk that was an idea that like i really felt passionate about and i had a lot of conversations um about that uh about that idea and it it's just one of those things that sometimes people say like oh i should write a blog post about this so i don't have to have that conversation again so it was also that where it's just like i could wrap all the contexts up there inflection everything in a youtube video um in a report and just send people that work instead of trying to explain why this makes sense so why this is important it's pretty satisfying to have that space right yeah do not feel completely it's why i do two hour recordings dude so yeah um that's that's super helpful man um last part about trends vc before we move on to behind the mind uh on some of the more philosophical stuff um you've grown at incredible rate in in pretty short period of time uh up to 35 000 plus subscriptions uh subscribers you said um and a percentage of those are paying let's talk a little bit about the growth curve because i think you've done some really smart things and you've probably done them intentionally um but like if you were starting again today in 2021 with no one knows who drew is uh and you wanted to create this from scratch like what would you be recommending to people who are going down that route i don't know man i don't say what you did previously yeah yeah i also feel like i don't i don't i don't fool myself in terms of like the luck component right of like i was part of this mastermind zero to one where very early on um they helped start the fire and stoke the fire in terms of you know a lot of times people can like have great content but if you don't have distribution you don't have attention but they were just yelling about it yelling about it until other people started paying attention and then it started to take on a life of its own so i do feel like there was a big element of like luck involved and that's why i asked about that of you know there's a lot of clarifying questions i guess to that question i would ask um but yeah i would try to join a community and it doesn't have to be a newsletter community it could be a community around like whatever that niche is um i would probably also get a coach if i had access to capital i could pay for a coach um someone who's done what i've done before uh yeah and then other than that it's just execute execute execute and and so i i agree with what you're saying um on the growth part so maybe we use you as an example do you remember the point where because i know it's not just like hey overnight it just took off it was like iterative and and growing but i'm sure there were a few moments along where you got a big boost maybe one was the product uh hunt launch um or even working after product hunt launch you had already grown to a pretty good size um are there a few those moments where where you can look back in hindsight and say okay that helped um that helped your growth curve yeah there were a couple of moments there's this guy michael gill that was also in the same mastermind and he had a no-code coffee uh he gave a shout out to trends bc and no-code coffee and i forget how many subscribers um that led to but it was like a multi-fold increase um over like what was there before another thing i think about was the twitter thread around online courses where uh that sort of took off and it's just like okay like this works as a channel i knew that and then like you said with product before product hunt between twitter indie hackers and also zero to one folks yelling about trends vc we built up to like six or seven thousand subscribers before the product hunt launch uh but product tonight took it from like six or seven thousand and twenty five thousand uh so there were like multiple periods yeah that's incredible the last part of the show is just getting a little bit behind the mind more on the philosophy side you made it super easy for me because you've got this incredible post which is the 100 rules to live by and i'd actually i only read this after i had already spoken to you and i i realized when i read it i was like oh this is why we get on there's this like shared philosophy that we both kind of believe in and what i've done here is i've just taken a few that i thought were quite interesting and i'd love to get your thoughts on on some of them um so i'll link to that in the post as well in the show notes but one of the things you talked about is under the umbrella of decisions um this is maybe a famous quote now but i really love it and it's hard choices easy life easy choices hard life um and i think a lot of people might have heard of this from ben horowitz but um i'm curious to to understand like why is that so important to the way that you kind of live and and work yeah you could just well i'll speak for myself i can think about moments where i could have had a like tough conversation that may have like it may have led to like a high initial pain or feeling of pain um that or you're just gonna have this like goal feeling of pain for weeks or months or years if you don't have this conversation uh i also think those things tend to pile up and it's just a good reminder um yeah it's just a good reminder to have those conversations or like whatever it is whatever decision that you're trying to make instead of letting something drag out that's the way i interpret it completely um the the next one i had on here around decisions was think probabilistically um think gray not black and white this comes from any duke and a book thinking in bets i think we touched on this idea a little bit earlier but like how important is that to you and is there anything else to share more than just a quote yeah i mean it's important it comes up in almost every report where it's almost like a drinking word now where it's just like hey it's a spectrum it's not black and white like i said at every report even when we talk about decentralization there's this idea of progressive decentralization even decentralized projects uh they have different levels of um centralization as part of them like i also don't speak in absolutes where i think there are like almost no absolutes that exist uh it's all over the place the opposite of twitter basically yeah although with twitter i do find it funny when people jump in like as if like twitter has enough room for nuance like yeah there isn't four nuance right like yeah completely um i think on the communication side this really stood out to me because i think you're a great communicator especially you know not just writing but even in our conversation today you're quite thoughtful and you're quite to the point um so the one of those you mentioned is about using simple language whether which i think is more straightforward that the other one you mentioned is about stories so our brains are built to enjoy stories um stories help information stick i'm curious like what how do you think about that as it relates to writing about the the stuff you're writing about right because you're not writing a novel um but maybe there are elements of story in there or i'm curious how you've thought about that it plays a role in a very interesting way where we'll go back to like the barbell concept of like you sort of have like insights if you will and you have stories on the other end i'm long on this and if i don't feel like i'm if i'm not investing in trying to tell the best story what i will invest in is not wasting your time or if you try to skim something that i wrote i want you to be 70 through and say oh crap what did i miss above that um so that's what i'm really optimizing for uh if i talk about the importance of being concise but i think that if you're an amazing storyteller there's no need to be concise because we're going to escape into what you're writing right but if you're not don't you know don't say like hey i have a 10 000 word essay for you just because you didn't want to edit it down or you didn't want to do that work work hard so we don't have to whether that's writing an amazing story or not wasting our time by giving us exactly what we need completely man um yeah i'm i completely agree and it's something i've you know tried to improve over time is one learning some of those concepts and try to bring them uh into my work where i can but also not to overthink it as well because i think sometimes um what can happen is someone like me can learn a framework and just be like okay the hero's journey now we're going to do this and drew who's drew's guide now we're going to bring a guide into this and i don't do that with podcasts but i think um just in everyday life um like previously in my jobs my jobs were like sales and partnership related so there is an element of storytelling obviously there whether that's telling the story of google or charity war um it does really help to learn some of those things and actually i think the biggest one is really in the marketing sphere for me like that's what i kind of i'm trained on essentially as a career and i think that really lacks in a lot of companies like they especially the digital marketing world where i work they just see things a lot of like numbers and science behind it but they don't always understand how important the story the story is as well which is more overarching um so um just a few more we'll we'll wrap up in a second but on the people side i thought this was really interesting um this was more around the idea of incentives so you said appeal to interest not reason we don't care about what makes sense we care about what makes sense for us um like that's quite i i think that sounds obvious in when you read it but if you think about the way you actually behave in day-to-day life that isn't always how we all behave um like i'm curious how that's manifested in your life is that was there like a time that you realize this or uh like examples of where that's become really prominent for you yeah i mean i wanted to stay away from this but like i think about racism a lot when i hear that statement where it's just like this is my argument in this case uh and then my argument may do a 180 when it's in my interest for me to switch my arguments in that case uh or you think about protectionism or whatever it's just like when everything makes sense when you stop trying to make it make sense and you just look at incentives right so that's what i think about there the next one was uh we stereotype all the time rightly or wrongly don't ignore it signals matter i did think it was quite interesting and you don't have to share much but you finish this off by saying life is short not fair and and that one really kind of hit me as well because um as like a young person i think i was a bit more idealistic and i thought oh the world should be fair and the older i've got and the more experience i've had i've said okay well life isn't fair maybe we can try to make it a little bit fairer but that that's probably not the the right i don't say the right goal but the a realistic goal maybe yeah um is that is that how you feel about it too and i don't want to like open up a count of ones by curious like yeah yeah yeah yeah i mean those last two it attacks idealism right where it's just like oh it'd be nice for this to be the reality for this to be the way things work and it's just a reminder that things don't work that way and you could waste your lifetime someone else's and someone else's we can keep throwing lifetimes at you and you'll keep wasting them if you're sort of fixating on that as opposed to trying to understand like the dynamics of the property of the game that we are playing in the reality that we are in and say this is the hand that i was dealt and this is how i'm going to play this i might have to go and kneel i'm using state analogy i might about to go and kneel because i don't have any books but i'm about to try to get these 100 points right like whatever whatever your deal is just trying to be realistic about that yeah i think that's beautifully put man it does kind of tie into this next one which when i read this too i thought oh i've i've definitely clicked at one point and said i've made a change here which was don't try to change someone's worldview take those who see it and take them further i fitness supplies in business for sure but also more importantly in like your personal life too because i'll just share my point of view i think when i read that why it resonated so much was even this weekend we're talking about investing with a few of my friends i was texting you about this and um and they're asking about you know these nfts and stuff and like some of them are just so far behind in terms of like even knowing what like crypto is and i don't i don't mean that in like a derogatory way i'm just saying they haven't been interested in it for me to then like try to make a case for something there's literally no point in me doing this like there's no nothing for me to gain i'm not trying to sell them anything it just becomes this conflict of oh well i think this is stupid and i'll be like well maybe it's not stupid for these five reasons but i just have learned to like let that go and say well not everyone needs to agree with me um and maybe i'm wrong too so that that's kind of where where i left me but yeah i'm curious like was there is there a moment that that you realize this as well or like an example that comes to mind uh examples don't come to mind but it just it makes sense because i tend not to put myself in positions where i feel like i have to convince a cold audience and that's how i think about it in terms of if i have 10 units of energy am i spending these energy this energy on a warm audience or a cold audience like where am i more like most likely to succeed uh so a lot of these things some of them i actually don't believe it anymore a lot of them have just become second nature to me and that's one that i think has just become second nature to me where it's hard for me to even try to explain why that makes sense to another person if they don't get back you know the last couple ones to talk about when wisdom and growth i thought these were really interesting to know all is to forgive all you'd uh you'd be more underst you'd be more understanding if you knew every everything about a person look closer when something doesn't make sense and um that was actually a really beautiful one for me because um it reminded me of this story that or a moment in my life where i was with scott harrison the founder of chad's war we were flying back from i think like san francisco or somewhere for a work trip and it was like 5 a.m and we were getting on this plane and this dude was trying to shove like a you know the hand luggage or the carry-on into that tiny thing and it wasn't fitting and he was wiling out right like shouting he's like you guys are crazy i'm a like diamond status and you're messing with me and all this stuff and and like me and my colleague were there and just being like oh my god this guy's having a breakdown here and scott just turned over to us and said it's not about the bag yeah and when he said that like i've i revisited that line quite a lot to say it's not about the bag or in your in the supermarket it's not about being overcharged it's it's what else is going on in someone's life and i try to bring that when i have conversations with people and and maybe they're a little rude or something's happen and i'm like okay that person didn't need to be like that but then at the same time i'll say okay when i'm feeling rational and not angry i can say well i don't know what's going on that person's day especially nowadays um but yeah i'm wondering if if there's anything else to add from your side but that one really resonate with me man yeah no i think you nailed it it's like this deep level of empathy that doesn't mean you're giving this person license to act this way but just that you understand and it could also go back to incentives things apply both ways in terms of you know why did this person do this it's in their interests there's so many stories of this of like incentives going awry um and it's like that explains the story once you really understand what is it in this person's interest to do or not just the last couple here um memento mori your time is limited live with urgency remember death my mom's going to love this one if she's listening she's always reminding me about deaf so yeah like what yeah i really love that one what what stood out for you on that one man i guess what what comes to mind is um going back and forth on whether to tell the story or not i'll just i'll just use her as an example i hope she doesn't mind you just mention your mom i think about my mom as well where for a long time she talked about uh going to nursing school and i mean for years and years and years and years and this is just one example of you you talk about these things that you want uh who knows if like she would have liked it or not i think at one point she got in and she ended up like not continuing or whatever but that's just an example of like it's easy to dream and it's easy to say one day one day one day and it's just like you don't have forever yeah it just adds a sense of urgency to everything if you're in a bad relationship don't have forever you're wasting your time you know yeah 100 man the last couple here um play asymmetric games life is not baseball i thought this was a beautiful way to to summarize something quite visual for me which is like a graph of like this is what i can lose and this is what i can gain and that's what i took from it um like how does that resonate with with you like now like a year or two after writing that yeah i mean i think about this a lot where it's just like i think that came from bezos where he talked about like in business one hit can pay for a thousand runs uh and i'll abstract it even more and just say that like a lot of times you can be at a fork in a row to like work with more leverage or less leverage uh yeah and i i try to choose routes of like more leverage if that means more responsibility whatever like choosing the right i'm not gonna say always but choosing routes with more leverage because life isn't baseball right the last one here to wrap up man is around courage and again i feel like we could have just spoke for the whole time about one of these quotes because there were so many in here the biggest upside comes from being outside your comfort zone in the words of dj khaled major killer there will be an entire post about this and i don't know if you actually wrote about this but let's just talk about courage for a minute and training that muscle of courage um like what are some of the things you've done to kind of train yourself to to become more courageous jiu jitsu acro yoga quitting my job i'm about to go nomadic uh this is a habit that i have of like comfort challenges of consistently you talked about you treating it like a muscle consistently putting myself uh in these spots because i think that those that's where the asymmetric returns come from these opportunities if i'm gonna reach out to this person i'm gonna try this new app i'm gonna try this new food i'm gonna visit this new location any of these things uh nine out of ten of them may be duds but again back to life is in baseball that tenth that tenth one could be the thousand right could return allow you to run a thousand runs completely man listen man i know we're running out of time here i feel like we could keep going for another few hours but maybe when we get to me in person at some point we'll get to do that and i really appreciate you taking so much time i know you got a bunch to get through for the next report and everything that's going on um i'd love to do this again in the future but yeah is anywhere else we should be we should be driving people to obviously check out trends.bc at drew riley on twitter which we'll share on the screen and in the show notes uh anything else to share before we wrap up nope that's where you can find me just check out trendsvc if you're interested in anything that we talked about 100 man well dude thanks so much and uh looking forward to doing this again and speak to you soon awesome thank you cheers man [Music] you", "rLTJEzduiTo": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] okay i got this uh this section cut out these rough underneath there so there's gonna be a lot of a lot of rebuilding to do so i got it from here around like this i'll get this out cut it along there i'm gonna have to bring it back further because oh sorry the light i'm going to have to bring it back a little bit further because this lip underneath is rusted so i'll probably end up disconnecting all this but i'll just drill it out so i'll save that so that's the piece that i'll have to replace with the the template i made and then there's the inner you see this piece here there's the inside and the other side skin so this is part of the outside and i'm not sure if that's the inside i'll have to go underneath and look anyway that's it for now continue working on well i've got the uh mount off you can see right there the hole is uh it's a little thin around the edge i'll have to maybe do something with that before i put it all back together it looks like it may have had that that slot in it like that so here's the mount assembly it's pretty bad shape i had to put some heat on it to get it off but that's it oh yeah but it did come out and there's the top not for the apparatus so just leave it like that that's how it all goes together but it's pretty darn oh sorry pretty darn rough shape this thing so it looks like it'll be new mounts at least for the back actually i should try to loosen up all the mounts because if i if i like this car and i keep it i may want to do a pull the frame out from under it and clean it up really well so right here there's my little pointer so i've got this level of the uh of it exposed i'll get a better angle so this piece this piece came down here and then it came curved it went down and i think it terminated nope right here it terminated down here but this is all one piece so this belongs to this whole section right here and it looks like it terminated there and then the inner piece came all the way down you see the lights right there came all the way down here and it ran and you can see right here is where the other side he came out on the other side of the frame so it would have it would have come out focused come out like this and around that mount and i don't know if it went back in or not i don't know if i can find reference to it but that's it and then there's this it's all rusted in there obviously i'm going to just try i'll turn the light down in in the box part hang on there sorry i don't want to see what it looks like in there oh it's dirty and it's hard to tell if it's rusty a lot of dirt in it has to come out for sure so i could try it for my own uh use here just more than anything i think probably could clean that out and then rush treat it somehow we'll be okay but that's it um i hung on to the pieces right here i hang on to these pieces because they tell a bit of a story as well so this if you put a cleco in you can set it back in place right through that spot weld hole right there and you can see how that piece came down and around where the mount would have been and that big hole there's what's missing so and there's the underside of it so that's the lip of it so yeah it would have come out around the around the uh come out around the frame here around that hole and back in again and over to this piece over here this piece right there so i'm gonna have to build this piece i have to build all of this right here so from here down and then this is all part of it in around the corner here this is all needs to be rebuilt and it actually dropped down in here you can see it the lights are there you can see it was rusted there as well so this is all one piece this whole section here so this will all have to be built in pieces so i'll probably just do a square try to get that established and then there's a lip down here and this lip is where the valance set on and underneath the inner the most inner box piece the balance sat on it here and spot weld it so there's a lot of a lot of work to do just in this one spot but this looks like right there to me is where this terminated right like this so it probably went around and down it's hard to tell i have no reference on it so i really don't know i'm just going to maybe make it the best i can all right all right back again i am going to pull this tape off of this rig and i'm going to lay it out on here and then i'm going to from there i'll uh see what i need to do let's just kind of lay this out a little bit like that so i'll pull this tape off and see how this goes i wanted to mention too a little bit about saving the old parts i i tucked them away but i have them i've been saving the uh the scraps from this this project where did that one go because oh i put it in my storage bin for now but anyway so why i save them is because they have information on them that's important like this piece here i left it in i put it back in place with the cleco when i was doing the work and i'll show you what i mean and this is only one one example of this whole project so i have this piece right here so you think well i cut it off i could toss it but if you flip it over you see on the back side there's actually a a piece that can tell you where the perimeter is of this of the inner inner structure here on the underneath so it goes like that so underneath of it i know how far it comes out so i can duplicate that and i had another piece which was a sliver from here that actually had a that actually had this piece on it still that got cut off with the spot welds so that's that's important so when you're taking these pieces off just don't toss them right away hang on to them until you're completely done because you could get some reference off them that would be important so let's get this tape off if i can get it off with one hand without ripping it all up it seems to be sticking really well this tape this is a 3m product not necessarily need 3m tape for this but it does bite on pretty good all right so i'll pull that off and then i'm going to mount it on this and just do a tracing of it uh this is the last piece of the 18 gauge of the old scrap stuff i had laying around and i think it's gonna be big enough if not i'll go over there and get that sucker all right hang in there i got this all uh laid out um i lost memory on the camera so you didn't see me actually drawing it off so what i did here i've marked off i left myself some perimeters a little shy there but i'll be fine i'm sure i left a little bit of perimeter i left this on so what i'm going to do is cut these off where the x's have it i'll do them with the grinder and then i'll uh i'll get back to you you don't need to be well cut one and you can see me cutting it i mean it's not a big deal so uh pretty straightforward stuff so now that i have that laid out i can take that off and save it save it for another time and then i'll cut these off with just a zip cut so [Music] [Music] okay that's one piece off and i'll just grind the rest off camera you don't need to watch me grinding all right there's the grinding gun so that's kind of what i ended up with i'm just going to deburr with my uh chainsaw file just like that goes pretty good i i really quite like these chainsaw files for this i mentioned before if you don't have a deburring tool just go get yourself a chainsaw file from the hardware store for doing sheet metal anyway you can use the the grinder as well but i i don't mind that quick i usually do one side around to where i'm going to be and then i uh flip it over and do the other side but yeah you should your hands will love it if you deburr the tool of the the sheet metal because it sure takes a lot of sharp shards the little shards of metal off quite quickly so yeah id burr you can do what you like but i know when you're welding if you don't be burr you're going to have it can flare up on you not flare up but it kind of sends the weld wonky there i got kind of a rough cut anyway that's pretty much it for the for the deburring but yeah i get rid of those little pieces you don't need those stuck in your hands there all right i'll see how i'll see how it fits on the car i'll just take you over and see if it fits at all so hang in there i'm gonna have to look through the viewfinder to see oh yeah that's not bad i think you'll be all right let me get out of the light oh yeah the light the lights behind the uh the tripod so it could be uh a little bit hectic there for you but here we are so this is the the corner and and what i'm going to do once i get it fitting in nice along here which isn't yet but what i'll do i'll get some reference holes drilled for the clecos because then once i start getting it into where i want it closed i'll lock it down with reference holes also i wanted to mention that there's a a back a bolt plate there i broke three bolts off they were quarter inch bolts i i'll get i've got new ones but i need to get that plate off before i take this plate off i'm going to drill through everything once this is built and it fits nicely like i said it's not yet it actually has to go down quite a bit and that frame is right in the way so i'm gonna have to bend this to get down but anyway as i start working this piece i'll get a i'll get reference holes put in right through that pleat so when i take this when i do cut this out i'll know that that plate needs to fit in those spots and i'll drill right through the plate the plate's only ah it's an eighth of an inch thick it's not very much of a plate there it's got some knots i believe on the back um probably welded on i don't know hard to say but anyway so then when the part is ready and when i'm satisfied with it then i can take that plate and put on the back side with those holes with the clecos and then i can weld it all spot welded on to the back side and it'll be in place and it'll be the same over here with the hinge plate the hinge bolt so anyway that's the plan for there i got a lot of fitting to do for sure so this actually does have to come way down so i'm going to have to bend i think i'm going to have to bend this one first just to give myself some room i'll just make a bend actually right down here i'll do this bend right here the very bottom bend and it'll give me some room to settle it down like i say i don't even know for sure if i'm going to be able to do this whole this all in one piece more than likely i'll end up cutting cutting it here right here off and just work with this section down to well maybe down to here but if i can get this i might go all the way down with that part but this here piece from here down to here i'm probably going to have to make that separate there's quite a little bit going on there so i wonder how that fits i can't get it down the hole so that means that i'm gonna have to make room all right that's the plan all right after quite a little bit of fitting and trimming and you know i trimmed some out of here and i i trimmed some around here but it's pretty nice there it's got a pretty decent gap there because that's the way it's supposed to be there's supposed to be a bit of a gap it's down set resting down in there now it's resting down flushing that so what i'm going to do i'm going to put holes in around for clecos in areas that like i need to hold it there somehow until i'm finished with the whole part so i'm gonna have to put a i don't want to cut i'm not cutting this out yet until this is built so that's what i'm saying so i'll put a couple holes up here and maybe a hole down there three would be enough to just to give the uh you know get the reference points so that's what i'll do i'll grab the drill uh let's see if i can find a small drill bit oh actually i still have one right here [Music] all right i'll have to find a small drill bit 1 8 drill bit i'll be right back all right found a drill bit i don't know what size is i can't read it but i'm going to use it and i'm sure i'll have a cleco in that pile of plicos that'll that'll work so if i go actually i want to make it work all right let's do one right right up here for now actually come on do one right through that cleat that will be our first uh record hole oh let's uh get off there [Music] ah there you go it's almost through the battery guy i got one right here i'll grab it steal it from the impact drill all right so we'll finish this hole off it was almost through there so close but yeah fire away so put that aside i'll put that in my stash grab a cleco see what kind of cleco will fit in here now because i'm not sure i'm sure the black ones probably won't but the silver or the taco ones might let's see how it goes put it in the right way so let's put her up to the car i bent this back and i'm going to have to probably do something because this is meant to be cut on an angle or broke on an angle but i i i just didn't want to go that far i may end up cutting that right off we'll see all right in she goes there click will fit perfectly so that's that i'm pretty satisfied with how it's sitting this could be bent just slight bit there so i'll put a i'll put another hole in here if i can get in there actually break down it right here because i can't get the drill in there i'll put it down low because i don't want it through that plate right now i'll leave those there's a good spot for another there that one didn't bite very well maybe that is too small there it goes just didn't have it not really into the meat of things very well ah i'll go a little bit bigger see what this one does oh yeah that's in there i'm going to change this one to the black one because obviously the black one is the size i'm drilling for that's the great thing about having multiple looks like i'm going to be using the that's a that's a solid foot back there so it looks like i'll use the copper one in that in that spot just to hold it there it goes it's in there that's all it needs and that's what the stuff like this would they come in handy when you have the space to use them as is these clamps right so let's just say you needed to put it up here you could just clamp it on something like that you know they work good so if you needed to i needed to clamp a piece of tin in a piece of sheet metal so that's what these are for they look good not bad all right now i want to keep this down so i'm going to put a a cleco in here because it's kind of twisting so i want to put a reference in there so i don't want that [Music] oh there's something there all right what are we doing what's going on with that probably like 10 layers at least four layers wow there she goes doggies by the suffering ball headed that was that was a good one so obviously that's going to be a copper all right the whistling starting all headed down all righty that broke a sweat on me almost that one oh what did i say i was doing there yeah i was putting the black one in there yeah there you go a little tight for the black ones so i'm gonna go with the copper one back down here again there now i have uh i can always put this piece back in where i need it i think i'm going to need to do a little just a slight bit more trimming there i cut this out i needed because this is going to be built separate because it's going to have to have a uh a bevel on it right here so i think i'm going to have to still move this along just a little bit to make room for it so probably have to come in just the thickness of the blade of the uh of this cut off saw i'd say at least to there i'll just go to there for now so what i want to do i'm going to trim this off this needs to be trimmed i'm just going to go up i'm going to leave this on i'm going to trim this tail off and then i'm going to try to break this piece right here so i'm going to have to find this so i'm going to yeah i'm going to have to cut this down because i'm going to find this this spot right there let's line it up with the uh all right it's free hand but yeah so i'll have to cut and get rid of this so i can break it so this little piece here i'll have to kind of cut this out this out and then i'll break this i'll break it that way and then i'll break it this way to get this height right and there should be enough metal in that so i don't want to trim any of that off yet because i need i need enough to go so it doesn't drop in so i'll go at that and see how it turns out okay that's fitting in there pretty decent uh you'll see i marked a c and a b and a c because copper black and copper just for my own reference instead of fiddling around looking for uh looking for the clecos all right so i have it trimmed here a little better i'm going to have to do a little more down there but i need to make i want to i want to break this piece next so i want to break it so it sits down in here and this is going to have to be down quite nice quite well it's not perfect in this area but you know what um once it's welded in it could it could have sat a little closer to in here but once i build this piece i might be able to tweak it in some because this it's just right here in this spot here it's not perfect it looks like the line the brake line isn't done just exactly right it should have been up maybe a little bit lying but i can't change it now and i'm not going to redo it just for that little bit i'm not a perfectionist that way so anyway i'll go we'll break this and get it down so i'll have to measure the height of this the distance i need transfer to here and bing bang boom we're in bob's your uncle all right i'll get back to you when it's done okay i got that formed i think it could use a little bit more a little more tweaking on this corner right here that's out of the line i'm going to go i think i'm going to bend that just a little bit better in that way but yeah before i do any cutting here and you'll see i have two lines right there well that's because the outer line is where it will be when it's when it's all set back into place but yeah it's not bad there but i'm not i'm not completely happy with this actual bend it should be just slightly bit more this way so i'm going to take it back off and just bring this bring it in some and that'll change these lines so i'll have to redo those i'll just re-mark them with uh permanent marker and i took it back off again actually about three times before i got this where i'm happy with it this needs to be pushed back just a tiny bit but this is in line with this this is in line with this one well i can't really tell because it's gone but i'm assuming that that's the right way this is not bad a little gappy there but hey it's uh it's it'll look very factory just the same i don't think it'll interfere with anything and if it does well i'll cut it off and redo it so i'm going to take it back off again and cut this piece off right here and leaving this gap enough for the thickness of the steel so it goes so when we cut in this will all set back that way this will have to probably be trimmed anyway because when this for an order for this to go in this way i'm going to need more clearance here on this so i'm probably going to have to take a little off there anyway but for now well if i build this piece around it this this section here so i'm going to build from here here down actually from there down get rid of this hole this plate on the back has to come off so i'll have to find the spot welds to break to get this plate off because this plate is rusted out as well the bolt plate was a tailgate hinge so i'll have to take it off and either build a new one probably have to build a new one it's quite large so i'll see i'll blast it on the media blaster with the in the glass cabinet see what kind of shape it all is in if it's in decent shape except for this area i'll just i'll just build a new piece on the bottom so that's where i am with it um yeah so all all this will have to be well i think if i could trim a little more of this not much though because when i bring another piece in i'll weld right to that and then it'll all set right back inside so there is you know i mean that's gonna that little gap there will be filled when that settles back in anyhow that's what i'm gonna do that's all i'm gonna do on today i'll cut this off yeah i won't cut it right off i'm going to leave myself i'm going to cut about there i'm going to leave myself some room just in case you don't want to box yourself in too much with these so don't go crazy just yet cutting it all up and this will have to be trimmed out a little bit too and then i'll have to make this section so this section here actually the this portion comes down to here and then back up well it goes it's a triangle it meets this down to here and then it transitions to it stays flat it just has a bend in it right here but it stays flat with this but then this is inward and instead of out like this one was so it's a bit of a transition area right there so i'm gonna have to work on that a bit angles to me i find sometimes they're difficult to other people they're easy but to me i have a hard time visualizing them so for now that's what i'm going to leave it as and then we'll work on getting the bottom fixed on this part and then it'll be ready after that to start building this piece in here and then down in here this has to be replaced but not not all of it so it's going to be uh interesting because this is solid right here like all that is solid you can see it's just that where the water was lying the by the valance it rusted out put holes right in it so i'm going to have to put a new piece in there but i can just put a piece in it doesn't have anything to do with this i'll just put a piece in separate of this piece so this piece here will be cut off if i mark it out i'll be looking at somewhat like this or even tighter depending how the steel is if the steel's good i'll come tighter if it's bad there's no point and then there's a hole here so it has to come out so probably i'm thinking i don't want to be in bad metal so i'm thinking from there on an angle right between these bolts like that and it's good in behind there so i think we're gonna have a patch really not a big patch panel here right so just this size right here that's not and it's flat so it's not a lot of work so uh i can just make a panel boom put it in and then the same deal well actually i have reference because i'll be leaving these holes there's an alignment hole for this but if i have these holes already there i can just re-uh spot weld once i have the new piece in place i can spot weld that back that plate back on behind and i'll have a reference but this one up here i'll have to uh make sure i put another hole for reference through it probably right around here somewhere just so that i can align those holes that to be in the right place what that is that brack that bracket is for the uh in these tailgates they have a torsion spring so it's just a rod torsion rod that runs and it has it come out on an l i in it and there's another one here with an eye so when you lower the tailgate it puts tension on the torsion spring so it's an assist for raising the tailgate back up but when it comes up it has to tuck away so it it has a pivot point and it can tuck away inside so that's what those are for that that bracket and it's it needs to be put back on i can't leave it off all right that's all i'm going to do with it today and tomorrow i'll go back at it again", "sPktaLyHInU": "hey y'all i'm james wright and welcome to my shop today we are making scales for the hand tool rescue screwdriver this is a remake of the perfect handle screwdriver you haven't seen that it is an incredibly cool tool but that being said let's dive in and have a little bit of fun [Music] this is the kit from hand tool rescue something i have been wanting for a long time he finally made the perfect handle screwdriver and this is a monster really really really cool and i'm crazy excited now this you can either buy as a finished product with all the handles on or you can make your own and in this case i decided to make my own scales so i whipped out the 3d printer and printed out a couple scales really really happy with how quick and easy that was and because everything was of the correct dimension and my printer was set up well they actually fit in there really nice a really good tight fit all the way around no finishing needed anything and we have the perfect handled screwdriver isn't that exciting so for those of you don't know hand tool rescue just recently released the screwdriver it is massive and it is so much bigger than it needs to be but it is absolutely gorgeous and i've been wanting to work with this for a while so i thought i would make some hand scales for it no i'm not going to be using these ones they're kind of fun he provides the the files for these so you can actually print out your rune if you want the plastic but i'm actually gonna be making some wooden ones today but i kind of like the look of the pink maybe i'll keep okay enough of that silliness out of the way this was uh yeah it was kind of fun to try this out i wanted to see exactly how accurate these are but it actually came out really really well but i want to make them out of wood particularly i want to make them out of live oak because that swirl from the live oak will look fantastic on this and yes he does actually uh mark all of these so you know the number you got this is a chunk of live oak that actually came from tally ho uh it was a couple blocks of that that i bought brought back and i'm looking forward to using this on a few other projects i've been making scales and handles for other things out of this and it's just a gorgeous piece of wood live oak is an incredibly dense wood but because it's all twisted grain and knotty you're always going against the grain no matter what direction you're going it's it's just an incredibly painful wood to work with but it's incredibly beautiful it's one of those woods that just it pops and it is so much fun to work with so first thing we need to do is break this big block down into chunks now they should be a little over three quarter inch thick for each of the two scales and it comes with the actual designs so you can print them out and put them on there and i'll be using those here in a minute but i'm actually going to cut them out a little larger than that almost an inch thick because i want a little leeway to play with i'm going to be able to find the the best grain on each one and these two are going to be cut sequentially out of the blocks so they'll each be next to each other from where they come out of the piece so either side of the handle will have the next piece so the grain should continue across the handle from one side to the other this is a large hand saw not a panel saw although some people would consider it to be a panel slot and a handsaw and there's a whole other discussion on there but this is a 5 ppi handsaw that will make ripping through this very very quickly the only problem is it leaves a lot of rough marks and so we have to come back and plane those off i want nice flat surfaces that i can get the pattern onto these flat surfaces will be the inside surface of the the handle so the the marking and design will actually go in towards the the steel i want to make sure that these are perfectly flat and take off anywhere i need to so that they will fit into the handle and take your time on this make sure that you get a good flat surface because this is the reference from everything these are the patterns that come with the handle so you can print it out and make your own and you actually trim them to the inside of the line and it should be dead on exact i was very pleased with how accurate these came out he printed them exactly to scale surprise surprise i'm going to apply the patterns with a glue stick onto a block of wood onto the block of wood and then we can cut around this uh i like how the glue stick holds on it does not come loose it's not the uh the super glue and uh and painters tape problem because a lot of times the painters tape will peel off this will hold on perfectly and it scrapes off very nicely when it's done i could come out this with a chisel however with the wild grain of the live oak this is something you really need to saw out for the the top curve on this i'm going to use a turning saw and i have a couple videos on making these i think i've made two or three of them now but for the sides i want to actually leave the the rough sawn part close enough to the outside so i can follow the curve even with a straight saw and it will allow me to then actually run around that ever so slight curve with this you'll see here it's a pretty thick chunk on the other side and i'm not able to follow the curve so on the next one i actually come through and cut it a little bit closer before doing the final cut i'll talk about that here in a moment for the little step down at the end they're straight cuts so i need to extend the lines so i can follow those on in and just do them with a back saw and then i'm left with the majority of this chunk now the nice thing about this is you can learn on the first one and then make the second one and then if you need to you can make a third one to match because you messed up on the first one i didn't do that here but that's actually something i commonly do so here on the second one we can follow the same process i'm going to use the turning saw to follow along the the butt end of the the chisel and then on the first side it's close enough to the side i can cut down but on the second side it's actually not close enough to be able to follow the line so i'm going to cut down a rough cut and then i've got this little piece i can come in and i can follow the curve and actually bend it back to follow the curve around you can see how it's bending away from the saw here and that way i can actually cut a curve with a straight saw now these are roughly cut to shape we can start doing the actual fitting them to the handle and the nice thing about the design on this is you really only have to do the heel and toe of this so i need the rounded end on both ends to go right down to that line i actually want to make that line on the paper disappear but i'm actually going to stay a little ways away from it and then check it against the reality of the handle it needs to fit into so for this i'm going to be using a fairly fine rasp and i have a whole video on rasps and how to use them in different types i'll try and leave a link to that down below as well as links to the the ones that i use here but most of this is going to be with rasp or in this case a curved tooth file and then eventually i'm going to come in with a very very fine file and give it a really smooth surface and i want to take it right down to the the line it should be at with that fine file but before getting it right down to that line we actually want to check it in the handle so i'm going to be staying away from it as long as i can and just just getting it as close as i can without actually touching that line because the closer i can get it the easier it's going to be the actual checking on the handle and so in this case i'm just going to tap it into place and i want to make sure that the the curves look right but you'll notice once i actually go to file it kind of indents on the nose and this lets me know i need to file it right down to that indent and then we can check it for the fit and this way you can get a very very tight fit by pushing it in and then letting the the steel of the handle actually mark where it needs to go in then with the other side we can do the same thing again stay away from the line as long as possible and then check it against the steel this is a card file allows you to clean out if they ever get too gunked up with metal they're not cutting as well as they should be or gunked up with wood you can come in with a card file and clean out your files and scrapers and that will allow you to get a nice clean surface so they actually cut a little bit better so then we can do the same thing on the other side tap it down in place and let it mark where it should be make sure you stick your finger in the way of the mallet so you crush it yep that's a smart move and then with the mark on the wood you can go back and file it right down to that mark now before we go putting these in place we need to drill the holes for the pins so i'm going to put one half in drill the hole through that one and i'm going to let it blow out the other side because it's a lot lot larger it needs so i don't have to worry about chips coming out and then we can put the other half on and then drill back through from the first side all the way through and that way we know our pins have a straight shot to go all the way through the handle now before gluing them on we want to take them off and we want to remove the paper that way we get a good clean glue up to the the main surface of the steel and this comes off very very easily with a card scraper it's one of my my favorite ways of getting paper on that doesn't move and then be able to scrape it off i'm going to be using some of the tetools 30 minute epoxy for this type of application it is a great slow bond epoxy that works phenomenally on this i want to kick it in good and heavy i would rather have it squeezing out all over the place because i'm going to be coming back here and filing everything in place i don't care about squeeze off it's not going to cause any problems so put more on here than you need and let it squeeze out and fill all the surface that way you make sure you have a really good bond between them i did rough up the steel just a little bit although it has a really nice surface on it from the mill i just hit it with some sandpaper and it made a grid surface for it to connect with same thing with the pens these come supplied and we can tap those down in because these are a little larger i actually put a flag on my tap to make sure they go down the right depth then i want to make sure the squeeze out doesn't actually glue onto the clamp so i put some tape on there and then squeeze this down until the the glue squeezes out and i put a lot of force on these now they have been glued up and they have been long enough to set we can start taking apart and running it down my first thought is i'm just going to rasp this down into place with some heavy rasps but it was taking a little bit longer than i wanted to um and i thought oh i don't have that far to go so i dug down to see how far i actually had to go before i hit the pin i realized let's actually take some time and saw this down because i made these a lot bigger than i needed to be so i had the material to work with i wasn't quite sure if i wanted to change the design if i wanted to be perfectly round in the end i decided to go with the the perfectly round profile so it's easier to come in and take off a large majority especially with this live oak it is so wild and twisted that it's it really needs uh to be taken off with it with a saw it it resists the rasps and files quite a bit so i came down and basically turned it into a diamond shape cutting off the corners on each side getting roughly to where it was and that probably saved me a good 30 40 minutes of rasp work to get it down in the whole shaping on this handle was probably about an hour i probably have somewhere around two and a half to three hours total on this handle in the shop from pulling it out of the box to being completely finished so i'm going to be rasping it until it's close to the shape i'm still staying away from the steel but i want to get it roughly to where i want it to be and i'm going to use a finer and finer and finer rasp until it gets down and i'm not afraid of hitting the the pins i want to caress those just a little bit but i am staying away from the steel on the handle right now eventually we're going to get it close and i can start pulling out regular files and those will get me my finished detail and get it right down to the shape i want i'm regularly going to be checking it with my hand whenever you're shaping something file away and then check with your hand and then file away and check with your hand and make sure you don't take off too much but the nice thing is once i get down to files i don't have to worry about hitting the the steel so much it is a softened steel is it they send it to you so you can actually harden the tip the ones you buy from them are are hardened i decided not to do that on this one though if i get the smaller ones i may spend the time to do that with that i'm going to come in with a fairly coarse file and get rid of most of the marks from the rasp make sure everything has a clean transition from wood to steel you want to make sure that you're constantly rolling the file rather than doing it in one place the file should always be rolling from one side to the other and then hitting any high point regularly feeling it and checking it and then we're going to go to a finer file and a finer file until i get down to this little detail file that really gets it close uh basically the next step from this file is 400 grit sandpaper and that's as far as i'm going to take this one as to 400 grit i may and other ones take it up to a thousand grit but i didn't really need that on this one i kind of like the look of the 400 grit speaking of which 400 grit sandpaper now usually i'd use a bow sander here but i actually just broke mine the day before um i i used it in a way it should not be used and so i got to make another one that was that video probably coming here soon but the 400 grit allows you to really work this in and detail back and see if there's any scratches in the steel or any scratches from the files and rasps that you want to get rid of because the the dust will fill them up and so you can actually come back and file those off and then sand a little bit more and file this off until you get a nice clean surface so if there's any scratches in it from other things i can come back in with a file clean those up and then hit them one more time with the 400 grit and get it exactly where i want now the shape is there it's nice and smooth it feels phenomenal on the hand we can get ready for finish and this is boiled linseed oil if you've been watching the channel for a long time you know that this is my favorite especially for hand tools because it just feels so good and with this white oak and live oak oh my word oh yeah i'm just happy this is homemade stuff so it's safe to use on the hands it is a really really nice finish that soaks into the wood and really brings out that natural color especially with oaks the live oak in particular it is it's phenomenal i'll end it with my paste wax this is the stuff that i sell on my website and it allows me to polish it down in leave it for a little bit and then come back and polish off the excess it fills up any of the cracks and gives you a really nice clean smooth surface feels phenomenal on the hand and it looks even better so yeah there is the screwdriver all done ready to use and oh yeah i'm happy uh this one came out exactly the way i want to and now i gotta find a screw to use it on so there you have it the perfect handle screwdriver and this is uh this is absolutely gorgeous i'm loving this thing i mean this is this is so much bigger than anything you'd ever need but one of these days there's going to be a screw and i'm going to be like i've got the screwdriver for it this is phenomenal now some of you are going to ask i didn't harden the tip i didn't i might still there's enough meat here i'm not going to be harming the wood if i want to harden the tip on this but i really don't have any particular need to do so so i'm not going to right now if you do want to buy these hand tool rescue is selling them on a site and you can buy them with the handles already pre-made for it or you can be like me and buy the kit and make your own handles especially with having the live oak on hand uh yeah i love how this came out just beautiful i love seeing all the detail in this so yes thank you um i went as soon as i saw his video coming out with these finally i was like let's jump on it because he's been talking about making these for years so finally maybe he'll love soon come out with other sizes and i might have to make handles to match with the normal size screwdrivers that i might use more but this is a lot of fun i'll leave a link to his video as well as a link where you can buy them down below it's not sponsored anything i went out and i went out and ordered my own um but this is yeah just gorgeous and someday i might have a use for it so i hope you liked this video uh this was a fun one for me it was really kind of cool making exact fits to fit the steel from wood a huge huge pleasure so thank you for watching and thank you to

of the work that we did there about a decade ago and then we're also going to stop in on turret number one and just see what one of these gun turrets look like before the maintenance work but first here's a word from the museum my name is ken orris i'm a volunteer on the battleship new jersey i served during the vietnam war aboard a destroyer we are right now in mount 52 a 5 inch 38 caliber gun takes a lot of work man hours plus materials to keep these guns active they're very difficult without the hydraulics everything is manual we'd really appreciate if you click on the link below and send us some donations that we continue to repair our guns keep them upright and get more in operation thank you very much for your donation so this video is a companion to an way early video we did on work that we did in the engine room to set that up for a tour battleship new jersey has four firearms and four engine rooms and we only restored one of each that's what we had the money for and that's all we can show the public they're largely identical on the inside if not in their actual appearance than in most of the same equipment likewise with the gun turrets the insides of the three turrets are largely the same with the exception of turret two being elevated an extra story to super fire over turret one and so the museum chose turret two to restore for this tour the gun houses the top part of the turrets had all been previously restored and you can stop in on them on any regular self-guided tour actually coming down into the lower levels of the five-story rotating structure took time for the museum to open and we were open for close to a decade before we got around to this part not only did we have to restore inside there but we also had to restore parts of the ship enough to get to these turrets normally the turrets are accessed through the door under them on the main deck which you see whenever you access one on a self-guided tour or through a vertical ladder at the very very bottom on the fifth deck of the ship so obviously guests aren't using a vertical ladder and obviously coming in going down five stories and then coming up inside the turrets a little bit much so we decided to cut a hole in the armored barbette to let people in this hole had to be on third deck or lower because on second deck we're above the armored citadel which means that the bar bet is not three inches thick like this it's up to 17 inches thick because the barbette here is inside the citadel it really is just structural structural in holding the armor and turret above it and not thick for armor the belt has taken over for that but above above third deck here it has to have protection now part of cutting these holes also entailed saving what we cut off so that if the navy ever takes the ship back they can replace it so as you come through here you'll see that and you'll also see the little step structure railing and electrical that was added into this part of this electrical is for fire alarms and emergency lighting so some museum ships can get by with their original navy emergency lighting but in the state of new jersey they required a new and purpose-built system so we had to retrofit that in we are on the lower shell deck there are two identical shell decks one above us and then this one and this one because it's on third deck where we're entering is uh the one we chose to interpret so we had to do some work chipping and painting in here the navy coatings have largely flaked off so we had to completely paint the space and we had to clean up the decks in service these decks would have been bare metal but covered in oil the oil keeps the bare metal from rusting but it also allows you to slide the shells around on it relatively easily so the volunteers spent forever and a day cleaning up the oil in here and not only the oil that you move the shells on but also the hydraulic fluid from the various motors and hoists that are used to rotate the turret and lift shells up which has been leaking down the oil that was in here was so embedded in the metal that it still seeps up from time to time and needs to be cleaned the museum acquired a number of real 16-inch shells that the navy was getting rid of our initial intention was to do like other museum ships earlier museum ships massachusetts and alabama north carolina had done and used their crew their their volunteer staff to load the shells on like they would have normally been and outfitted a shell deck when those ships open as museums in the 60s their world war ii era crew was still largely in their 40s when we opened as a museum in the 2000s and then open this part in the 2010s our world war ii crew was less up to moving one ton projectiles around so we were able to acquire fiberglass reproductions of the shells and i believe these came from battleship north carolina that was getting a new set so we got the old set and these our volunteers could carry in just like they used to carry the one ton shells these shells were donated to the ship and are part of the interpretation so no you cannot buy any of the fiberglass ones here or the real ones that we keep in other places in the museum one of the last steps in the process once everything else had been cleaned up was trying to make the tour interactive these original hoists to lift a one ton shell couldn't be activated again but we could buy a hundred dollar hoist and a cable and hook it up to the original lever to lift the fiberglass shell and so the hoist has the appearance of functioning but we're not running big 440 machinery originally these spaces didn't have any sort of climate control and even though we've added heating and air conditioning back into the ship we're still using the original ductwork which does not come into a rotating turret and it does not cut through the armor to get here and so we had to add things like fans and electric heaters to maintain temperature in the space you can also see one of the smoke detectors that we added i already mentioned the emergency lighting that's throughout and finally access to the various levels of the turret is through vertical ladders which again we don't like to make our volunteers or and our volunteers and guests use so we cut a new lighter way interestingly any new ladders we install have to be up to code so we have to find space to make them the proper width and angle whereas ladders already existing on the ship usually taller and narrower because they are an original feature of the historic structure can be retained as is anything that we added like this we tried to paint yellow to show our guests that this is not original coming down to the mezzanine level that only exists in turret 2 because it's super firing things like the various gypsy head capstans used to move projectiles had to be removed because they were tripping hazards and so to make the tour a continuous loop and to give two ways in and out of the space per new jersey code an additional hole was cut in the bulkhead here has to be a certain width to be ada compliant and notice that we welded on pad eyes so we could move this piece out and just drop it right there and tack it to the deck so that it is retained but if we ever need to move it we can the ammunition storage rack that was here had to be cut out and that's been stored somewhere else and another stairway was added to get down as you come down you'll be able to see the vertical ladder on the central stalk of the turret that people had to climb back in the day you're welcome for the stairs another issue down here is below the water line all of these watertight doors have higher lips than around the rest of the ship so we had to add steps so that any sort of mobility impaired people had at least a fighting chance of getting through these doorways we want to leave hatches like this one open so that the space below ventilates but we also don't want small children falling to their death so covers had to be fabricated in addition to restoring the turret we also restored a magazine the rest of this tour focuses on turret number two however the turret two magazines are all crowded to the sides of the ship and so it was thought that the turret one magazine which is large and amid ships would be more compelling and there would be room to actually get a full tour group of guests inside of it this magazine is also how we get through to gun turret number one which is not restored so check out this inch thick strike plate on the deck in the magazine where clearly they were dropping these powder canisters as they came through the door and also look at me struggle to get through this watertight door that's cut so high so having come through a couple of those really high knee knockers we are now inside turret one notice that there's no mezzanine level so that deck directly above us is the lower shell deck notice the oil stains on the overhead where the grease on the deck has been leaking through in here you can see that none of the lights work these are all old fluorescent fixtures some of them don't even have covers there's a lot of empty racks it is possible that volunteers early on took equipment out of turrets one and three to fill in slots in turret two but i'm not confident of that or that it happened or that or which equipment it might be you can see that the paint is uh peeling off in layers the lower levels of primer seem to be pretty well intact but all of these uh oil based paints on top of them are just flaking off the navy switched to this white interior color in the late 80s and by then they had stopped using lead paint so we're pretty confident that it's oil-based layers and so it's easy to just chip off and paint new stuff without climate control in this space the temperature fluctuates greatly summer to winter winter to summer back and forth and that temperature change causes the paint to peel off even quicker so it's much worse in an unclimate controlled turret like this than it is in say a climate-controlled space like one of the spaces on the tour route which we only have to paint every decade or so you'll notice oil and hydraulic fluid on the deck not only did we fix replace light bulbs we also change them from fluorescent to led so they last significantly longer and cost more cost less energy you can see remnants of the original navy dehumidification system and you can also see equipment like this clearly some spare part or something removed from the line that was just taken out and left here imagine the scrap value of all that bronze you can't get it out of here now if you want to use the ladder to get up to other levels you certainly can but i don't recommend it if you wanted to go to a shell deck that's how you would go and then the navy also slathered asbestos hazard signs in spaces like this one all over the ship the navy did go through these vessels when they were being reactivated in the 1980s and they've removed most of the known asbestos there was some retained in the engineering spaces but any of the insulation that i've inspected in here like this stuff around the fire mains is fiberglass but regardless some poor shipyard worker was given a stack of these and told to go and paste them everywhere on the ship so virtually every compartment starts with one of those we have to do air quality assurance tests before we open a new space to the public and so that is another step that we have to do while we're going through this process and let's say we find a puddle of white flakes on the deck and it's not clear if that's paint or asbestos although the size of this it's clearly the paint chips we have an outside company come in and remediate that so a question that gets asked is the turret has to rotate how do you get things like electricity into the various levels of the turret well they all run through the catacombs underneath here along seventh deck up to this central stalk and if you watch our catacombs video there's a point in which we crawl into the space directly below this and you can see this like spider leg arrangement of huge 440 power cables coming up this stock and this stock goes all the way up the gun which is why it's a good place to put the ladder that you use to access the various layers it's also got access ports on the side so you can unbolt this and go in and mess with the wiring if needed and if these are mounted higher than you can reach from the deck level here like the one in turret two is because it's superimposed you climb up the ladder and then there are ladder rungs to hold on to and to stand on on either side of this this is for when the ship was in service and the turrets were rotating we don't rotate the turrets that machinery doesn't work anymore but because we have made cut-throughs all over the place we were able to run wiring in through the side of the turret if the turret was to rotate all those wires would snap and our emergency lighting wouldn't work in there but if that's what's happening it's the least of our worries mizora is probably being attacked by aliens at that point and so a process like this usually takes the museum about a year we've got about 40 volunteers who would join in on a project like this it takes about a quarter million dollars to go through and do all the remediation and add all the new safety features and get the outside contractors in who need to come in and then to buy the paint that is desperately needed in a space like this mount 52 on the ship uh we have two barrels here we got a left and a right gun there are five inches the projectiles truck travel approximately ten miles this on the floor is where the power canisters comes up there'll be one sailor here just doing that and the gun the guns projectiles will come right up up here and be loaded here first and then and then the rams in automatically when the these guns run hydraulically we have no hydraulics everything is manual whether it's turning the gun turret raising or lowering the barrels loading everything is manual and we modify the gun so that we can just fire a manual it takes a lot of hours we have a crew of about six gunners mates or wannabe gunners mates that work here and we're on here weekly uh firing this the salute guns and our quad 40 also it takes a lot of man hours uh and much better in the summer it's harder in the wintertime with the cold temperatures as these units usually had about 10 heaters in here to keep everything warm so everything stiffens up in the winter needing more exercise more lubrication and it takes a lot many hours you could be 20 30 hours a week working on these guns just to keep them going i am speaking to two people gunners mates and those that are not a gunner's mate so if you're gunner gunners mates have a problem with me i have a vt and it's the best i can do these are our five inch rounds they're a little shorter we cut them and modified them put black powder in and then we will load the gun and then fire we just loaded the shell into the barrel and she's ready to fire but she still has the safety on we're going to remove the safety and then proceed to i'm i'm gonna count down for five our gunners mate is gonna fire the trigger by pushing on the foot pedal next to the left gun in this gun mount five four three two one fire i think it fired start your tour off with a bag for a donation you can find our 40 millimeter saluting gun 5 4 3 2 1 fire anyway if you would like to support capital projects like restoring a

this way can you guys can you guys still hear me okay way back here all right all right cool good news that's good news all right so i'll show you guys what's going on today what prompted this quick live video uh i wish this was up a little bit higher suppose i can make that happen so what prompted this live video was that i got a package in the mail and i had some projects slated for the afternoon the truth is most of the time i i'm just one of those guys where i tend to get more done by myself i'm lucky because all the guys i work with i basically work with a group of my friends is really what it comes down to all the guys that work here are pretty awesome but i do get most probably the most accomplished when i'm running solo lone wolf style just just the way it is so today you can see that there's we've got the probing setup going on right here i've got a ruler which i'm probably going to cut in half and i'll explain to you guys why just a little bit but real quickly uh this is one of those do not do this at home you know moments but i made cheaters a long time ago they're just 3d printed they got some magnets and what they allow me to do is they allow me i made them so that i could run the chip augers in this machine and actually spray it down at the same time otherwise you can run the chip augers but you can't open the doors you can go around to the side door and unlock it anyways so i don't know why they don't just give you the option to disable the uh the door locks ha said something about legal but i couldn't tell you but i made these and they uh they're door cheaters so anyways what i'm going to do real quick i'm going to probe the top of this for z and then i'm going to probe the diameter on that and uh i'm gonna i'm gonna probe the top of z and uh i wish i could get this in here a little closer so you guys can see you know what we can hold tight i just happened i just happened to have this fancy little tripod right here which i think will do the job well and it's even better is that i can turn it around like this which you guys can see really good with the good camera okay so let's let me oh look at that that's snazzy all right so let me run this up real quick let's see it's still connected and it is let me show you what's gonna happen here this is a fixture for the tilting rotary table that's trt this is a 160 millimeter version you can buy it from hofstra about 30 grand it is not really designed for full 5x simultaneous machining but it can do it it can't keep up it's not going to be like a kern or a dmg it doesn't have direct drive motors i'm pretty sure this whole thing runs on belt drives and worm screws belt drives run worm screws it's not entirely slow but it's not fast enough to run really sophisticated complicated five access contouring toolpaths it can run them it just doesn't do a great job and that's that that's the whole issue of software is a whole completely different story which we'll get into another day but let me show you what we're going to do i'm going to take this part right here i'm going to cut this down to about 983 984 in diameter for all you uh normal people throughout the entire globe everybody but america that's about 24 millimeters 25 millimeters ish and i'm gonna set this on here and then i'm gonna bolt it down tight and then i'm gonna so it's gonna look like this and then what we're gonna do is i'm gonna use a small end mill probably not on this live stream because all the time and i've got to post it out but i'm gonna cut all this grooving into this so that this one ends up looking like that one and uh and i've done it before and it works pretty good in the old days when i wanted to do this i had to do a ton of edm work which is uh creating electrodes burning it in setting up all kinds of multiple jobs it was a it was a nightmare this is a much better way so anyways we're going to come down here hopefully we won't blow out because we're up we're live on camera right so if we blow out then it's on me we're going to set our zxl's we're set offset so all i'm doing right now is i'm setting g54 z that's it so it's just going to come down it's going to touch the top of this part it's going to tell us that okay maybe it's not going to do that all right so now our work offset if you guys just watched my work offset video you guys know that uh these are just locations just a g54 59 and then g154 p1 through 200 or just work offsets they're like locations x y and z so we're going to use the center this surface as our g54 this machine has something called tool center point control so it can do all kinds of fancy math so now now that we've got our z by the way i already swept this table in before i decided to do this video so now we're gonna come over here we're gonna go f3 and we're gonna do we're gonna measure the boss and i can't remember what the diameter on this thing was but ah let's just call it 2.3 inches and we'll go down i don't know half an inch that should be close [Music] now this is the part that is a little bit sketchy so we'll slow it down just 25 we're going to use we're going to use a uh a little stubby tool that's in here so this is a safe tool change position we'll stay back while it does the change and now we just want to make sure you just want to make sure you know this the temperature fluctuates mimic shop is not climate controlled and so we're going to go ahead and we're going to i guess i'll show you how this works you just come over here and you hit offsets f4 will take us from the work to the tool tab then we're gonna go all the way over here we're gonna hit tool offset measure one and then it's as you see run an mbi cycle start and now it's just going to come down and it's just going to make sure that uh yeah someone said i did keep a great job i'm you'd be it's probably unhealthy how obsessive compulsive i'm about keeping stuff clean [Music] all right so now we can just check our work offset we can just go to mdi g54 g00 x 0 y 0 enter just checking out of this versus my tooling yeah we're dialed all right so anyways so that's the first first set up let me flip this around real quick show you what else we're working on all right so man this tripod is kind of sucking well i guess hold on because you're going for a ride i'm putting the legs up on my tripod so if you want to see anything up up tall there that'll be you guys want some trivia the funniest stuff ever the number one comment i get when people have uh never met me is like you're shorter than we expected i'm up for the record i'm about five eight just so you know but anyways um what prompted this video i came in here uh it's late it's 4 30 pacific standard time and my whole plan today was to cut uh well if you guys see see those steel plates down there those are about three inch thick they're they're just cheapos they're a36 plates but i've wanted to tinker with some mold designs and uh and those plates all together all three of them together which is the way i needed all three of them were just uh just short of 900 bucks i got a i bought them from b and b b and b especially metals or b b metal supply here in bakersfield and uh those exact same plates if you bought those things surface ground and whatnot now this is gonna seem if you're a hardcore machinist you're gonna think i'm crazy but if you're a noob you're gonna think this is insane those plates which all have to be machined they have flamed edges all this kind of stuff we're like just under 900 bucks to buy those from like a pcs it's a mold components company uh seven or eight hundred bucks a piece 780 a piece so 2400 bucks and so for less than 900 bucks i get to throw them in the machine and i get to cut them down and and smooth everything up well those are pretty big i don't know if you guys can tell but just for the record here i don't i don't know if this will do it any service but just for the record that's a these are 18 inch by 10 inch by three inch pieces of a36 so these things that those things are not they're not they're not lightweight and you saw that the magnet is still on them i use that magnet along with my secondhand skyhook which actually works great you see guys might if you guys are hot fans you probably saw that they released this new uh it's like an engine hoist but it's a low rider because you can't get under the machine a guy named s2jesse puzzle box props you can hunt them down on instagram or youtube a long time ago he chopped off the front wheels on his engine hoist then just drilled holes and cut holes in the bottom and slid the the wheels up in there and that's another super cheap alternative to like the high-end house one but if you just want something turn-key the house will work here is what i was going to show you guys so this is why i this is what kind of prompted this video to start today i had tore this open i'm going to turn this over i had tore this tore this open and started pulling the top to show you how i'm going to do this so these are not the cheapest cheapest but it's kind of a pain in the butt to try and hold really big objects on the table of your machine they can it can be a pain to get in and out of the machine i've had two back surgeries so i can promise you from the bottom of my heart there's not a chance in hell i'm gonna be muscling anything out of this machine i just don't care at all period my back and health are far more important to me than trying to be tougher you know powerful in the machine shop i guess anyways these are mighty bike clamps i'll show you what these guys are all about you guys might see there's actually another mold set up right here i make molds for rubber products but anyways so these are mighty bite toe clamps and the way they work i'll show you is they just go down into the t-slot of your table and uh and then you tighten these things down and then these will bite in on the side this is these are super dialed for like large pieces of material that are tricky to hold you can just bite into it from the side and if you're worried about this marr in the surface up you could use like a little piece of i guess anything you could use like a little piece a scrap piece of aluminum or something like that and then you can still hold it pretty tight the only thing that sucks about these things is as cool as they are they're not cheap they're like 50 bucks a piece and uh i try to buy most of the stuff when i can from i got a pretty good relationship with msc guy over there is really good to me guy named randy's really good to me and so i try to buy most of my cutting stuff and work holding stuff these specific ones because i needed them so fast and long story short these were supposed to arrive on a sunday so i actually bought these from amazon lo and behold here's a tip for you guys amazon doesn't deliver to businesses on sundays so if you order something on a sunday it will only come to a residential address so i sat here like an idiot waiting all day and then i checked i'm like checking my phone checking my phone and it says uh i'm in bakersfield you guys and then it says uh it says hey we attempted delivery i'm like delivering my butt i've been sitting here waiting all day and uh lo and behold they did not attempt a delivery i called the post office i just happened to have the number because we ship a lot of stuff out of this this location and they informed me that they didn't even try they don't even attempt deliveries for businesses on sundays for amazon so i was i was needless to say quite bummed not a whole hell of a lot you can do about it so that's why i'm here late on on uh on this monday to my wife actually has some time off of work so i'm the nice thing about owning your own business is that you're able to spend a little bit of time whether it's health or family or whatever you might have to work like hell to do it you might have to when you when you're working you might have to work like hell but it does grant you some freedom uh so so those are two of the things that i'm working on right now i'm going to set this i'm going to finish setting this up and i haven't decided how i'm going to cut through i think i'm going to rough off some of the flame pieces i'm either going to use a disc grinder over here on the bench i want a high feed mill i'm going to show you guys i bought well i bought that one two tools that i'm going to be using on these this big old this big old beast i'm just going to bring you guys over here and show you these tools because they just make my life easier and then i'm probably going to cut the stream short so i can actually get set up but i just thought i'd show you guys what we're working on so the tools i'm going to use bought this a long time ago for the super mini mill and it's pretty magnificent it's it's a kyocera three-quarter inch i think they call it a mini raptor i'm really not sure but i can tell you that this thing works awesome and if it does use uh through coolant so if you want to run this thing with with coolant it's awesome you can run it super fast um i bought it because it was really unique for cleaning out some a pocket for a specific part i was making this is how i'm going to end up roughing most of the sides of those this is just a carbide corn cob ruffer i don't really like these super fine chips they make but for some of the nasty edges that are on that steel down there something like this works pretty good and then since i don't really have a good feed mill a good large diameter female i'd like to have one in fact i'm gonna buy one i'm probably gonna buy a cheap one to be honest because i don't use it all a whole hell of a lot and if this new design for this mold tooling that i'm working on if it all works out i'm just going to start buying pre-ground mold steel plates anyways um but this was a cheap way it was like easier on my pocketbook and i could just spend a little bit of time in here cut manual making chips and then this is what i'm going to use to rough off once once i get all the nasty off i'm just going to go ahead and use this thing to bring all the sides into spec this is a mark this is a mara tool so this is actually a martial shell mill martial arbor all that stuff and it's it's it's relatively cheap but it works good if you want like a beautiful surface finish and if you cut aluminum this is the king right here this baby right here this is i have a couple different shanks for this thing but this is a mitsubishi asx445 there's a dude on instagram like i don't know dave dave d's i don't care dave lee's there's a dude he's always making mirrors and stuff that's pretty awesome all right before i cut you guys loose i wanted to talk to you guys about one more thing somebody was somebody had brought up some of the data that i had brought that i had discussed about tool length offsets and stuff like this um and then we were talking about the gauge line and all the stuff and there are a variety of ways to run tool length offsets um these machines when you run probing systems in these machines this obviously just happens to be a hospital doesn't matter what you have if you use a tool like this okay and i have just just for kicks i'll show you guys see if we can do this without landing on my face so even this machine right here you'll see that i have one that i bought from our tool i actually have it didn't use it last time i set it up but what happens is you set these machines are ground to very tight tolerances and so this one just happens to be five point i'll see if you guys can read it i doubt you guys can we'll see maybe yeah this is five 500 yeah no maybe 50031 in gauge length and 5005 in diameter and what happens is this kind of calibrates everything it calibrates the tool setter and then everything gets referenced from the tool setter but it still doesn't change the fact that we use positive tool lengths g43 not g44 i believe it is um but anyways i'm torn on how deep we should get into this theory as long as you know how to get your tools as long as you want to get your machine set up to work for you not everybody's going to run a tool setter and i realize that and there's a good chance that we'll do some videos not only implementing the probing system but we will also do some videos implementing just touching our tools right off of our parts with a piece of paper just because it's easy to do you guys might be able to see right back here this is where my cnc education started this is a little cnc router it's a little 6040 cnc and uh i probably crashed that thing like 50 times when i first got it because i was just the amount of resources that are available to us all today weren't available at that point in time and uh what a learning what a learning what a journey it's been so all right guys i'm going to i'm going to look through the questions real quick um comments um i need to learn how to edit a five axis haas post okay guys if you guys enjoyed this video please do me a favor click the thumbs up it shows me that you guys enjoy when i make these uh short live videos and share them with you guys if you have questions or questions in the comments i'm gonna look right now it looks like there have been some comments roverville for mars you see that part you're making is for it's a it's a core for a mold it's a it's an inner core for a mold is the rotary mounted on a subplate yes it is i designed that subplate i designed this subplate and had the guys from nyccnc otherwise known as saunders machine works they made it for me um and they they had access to anodizing all that stuff and so they made it for me they got it anodized it's beautiful i believe they've actually taken my original drawing and actually made it even better and i think they sell it so if you're looking for a plate if you're looking to hang a rotary off of a haas machine if you go look you'll know because it's got these two little chamfered edges and a couple of slots down the middle and i think they added more to it but they do have something like this and you don't have to make it yourself so it's cheap and relatively easy to make yourself if you know what you're doing but at the time i had so much going i'm actually thankful i think they charged me four or hundred bucks and and i was thankful for that let's see here okay price deal's going up yes i'm in california yep bakersfield that's correct yep uh let's see here let's see here do i do injection molding in house we do our own molding of our rubber products we're working on doing our own plastic products next so yes we do our own molding um i have a friend that makes mold bases how hard do i think design for injection molding is rahul cavapati is asking rahul uh there is no question that how hard do i think design for injection molding is oh that's a little bit of a tough question bud the all of this stuff is a little bit of a black art to be completely honest to you um that's a deep question and i don't mean to be all i don't know dramatic or whatever but here's the issue if you don't know what you're if you don't know dude you could waste a ton of time energy and money uh designing something that is unmoldable or is on mobile it isn't reliably moldable uh understanding draft i kind of went through this progression we ended up outsourcing our stuff in the earliest of days um and so luckily i would design a product and i would send it out and the production engineer would send it back and be like look dude no like your wall thicknesses aren't uniform enough you don't have enough draft and so he would troubleshoot you know i was just dreaming up what i thought i wanted to make and he was kind of like putting the handcuffs on and saying well cowboy like this this isn't how it works like there are some guidelines and some rules you need to follow and so i would definitely encourage you to go get some injection molding books and do your due diligence before you start investing or start trying that kind of stuff um clint uh clint uh clint carlos says hey jason what materials did you machine with my style x5 and how did it handle them um mainly graphite and it did a great job did a absolutely fantastic job it was bought specifically to cut graphite if i were to buy a style today uh the the just here just so we're clear the the x5 is a table it's it's a desktop kind of a tabletop style machine and and i guess i'll i'll show you guys here with the 1100 mx real quick so a machine like this like this vf2 this whole damn thing underneath the the sheet metal it's cast there's a great big cast iron base that's sitting on the floor there's a great big cast iron column i'll show you guys here in a second actually well i can't show you the base that's sitting on the floor but let's see here oh boy but you can see see this big old column and it's bolted to that big old base right there that's not that isn't the way some of these other mills work and so that x5 is a lot like that x5 is a lot like this it if you notice if you notice this this is a little bit more modular this is the actual base of the machine this is the casting the base of the machine that bolts down to this stand and this frame and then the enclosure's built around it but this stand the column is bolted onto the stand and then this as a unit is set down onto this uh uh i guess you'd call it a weldment a welded base and by the way there's nothing wrong with this design it just isn't a design machines are designed for a purpose that is so important and it's it's been so oh man it's been so all these videos that i watch i'm about warning if you don't want to hear me rant leave the live stream now my biggest gripe uh about all a lot of the cnc content we're seeing is that it's so hyped up and it's about like we're ripping chips at you know x speed and we've got this much material removal rate and all this kind of stuff and that's all well and good but how often do you even need that i only turn this machine on like a couple times a week okay i don't i don't need that and so whatever machine you're going to use whether you're going to use a little a little 60 40 cnc router that's down here or this tormach 1100 mx or a grizzly or a sile x5 or silex 7 it's all about knowing what you have and knowing how to use what you have to accomplish whatever you need even that little x5 i would say the biggest danger of like the little style x5 as an example is that it's got a very small work envelope it's like it's probably like literally like this i want to say it's about 10 or 11 and 10 or 11 inches maybe and the x and about five and a half on the y or 5.8 on the y it's pretty small right where this vf2 is like you know 30 inches on the x 20 inches on the y i believe the tormach is um 18 on the x 11 on the y maybe and so just just just understanding all this right there's so much to learn and there's things that don't things that you think would make sense when a machine starts to chatter when i was new my instinct was always spike the spindle speed like that's the first thing you think you should do spike the spindle speed but that's that's in my experience almost always the wrong thing to do and i'll give you an example if you want to skip skip a rock across water you throw it faster at a shallower angle if you want to throw it into the water you will you could just drop it into the water and so just like when you're in a swimming pool and you push your hands through the water and it's relatively soft and then you slap the water and it's very hard many times if you're getting a bunch of chatter in any machine it doesn't matter if i'm chattering in this or chattering that or chattering anything a lot of times pulling back some of that that rpm while leaving the feed constant will start to eliminate that chatter you're actually taking you're taking a better bite obviously you don't install the spindle so be careful it would be the first time anybody ever did that but anyways i'm gonna get this thing set up i'm gonna start i guess we'll talk for a little bit while i get this thing set up i'll let you guys just kind of look over my shoulder real quick while i start putting these clamps in place and uh if you guys have any questions i'll do my best to answer them now this is a good old-fashioned dilemma i really thought man i thought for sure i thought for sure i was gonna oh thank thank you jesus i'm gonna show you guys something this is gonna make you guys laugh this is why when you set your machines up like this i promise you if you're watching right now i promise you someday you will thank me for this you might not thank me for anything else ever but this you'll thank me for the the rotary is on the plate is on it's bolted down here it's bolted down underneath here and then the the plate is bolted down the rotary is bolted down our tool setter is all set up we've got the airline for the pearson pal system which you guys know i'm a fan of uh even though i might be selling them all and switching to some permanent fixturing but check this out i need to get this into that slot right this would be a dilemma you'd have to tear things down set things back up when i built the setup on day one i always left a set of t-nuts in there i know it sounds corny but man that is like leave some if you're gonna have trapped if you're gonna have like i i guess just trapped t-slots throw some t-nuts in there and i promise you someday someday at a moment just like this you'll think you'll you'll be like you know that guy on youtube that one time told me to put some t-nuts in my setup thank you for that so i'm a happy guy right now because i thought for sure i was going to be tearing stuff apart oh that's super funny i can only tell you how many times i've i can only tell you how many times i haven't had the t-nuts in there i you know i love cutting metal i really do i love making parts man it's like it's it's super fun to me um i'm thankful to have access to the machines that i do i'm thankful to have access to the resources that all of us have access to out here on the internet i really am it's it's pretty magical time it's crazy time you know politics and all this kind of politics and technology and all this kind of stuff it's a crazy crazy time but i am genuinely from the bottom of my heart thankful to to be able to do what i do you know even when i'm griping about it and crying about it like a little baby sorry i know that's super loud all right so what i'm gonna do is wipe this down a couple of things i always thought were really good tips were before you clamp your part down wipe the you know obviously get the table super clean it kind of makes me laugh peter stanton used to always say that he felt like half of his time as a machinist was spent cleaning i would arg i would argue that it's far more far more time spent cleaning but anyways oh look at that happy camper although this is a little bit tighter than i thought it was going to be to the uh to the rotor to the rotary so i hope i have enough reach if i don't i guess i could just pop the rotary out real quick but then you have to set all the stuff what do you think what do you guys think we got is that enough room we got 12 inches there i can already hear that i can already hear the comments on youtube right now [Music] we're just going to leave these something like that all right that's the first set the second set oh i didn't realize it you know when i bought these clamps i didn't realize it until just now i'm assuming we can use both sides but this side has the bite on it and then there's a smooth side for aluminum or you know a non-marring surface so that's pretty cool i'm going to look in the comments here in just a second that that look right now let's see here are you going drilling the water lines in my mold bases no i no i have not at the moment luke says i can tell you how many times i have not had them in there way too many yeah the story of our life you know there's two types of machinists those who are gonna those who who have best crap up than those who are those who have mass crap up and those who will mess crap up you know i guess that's the polite way of saying it maybe i used to have a uh a crotch rocket or a sport biker call whatever you want the day i got it my buddy told me he's like there's two types of riders jay those who have been down those who are going down i didn't like hearing that that day it turned out to be prophetic so you get out there when wind in your visor throttle wide open on the freeway 2 am no traffic it's pretty amazing i don't think i would do it again all right so we're mostly set up i'm just gonna grab a piece of this is hilarious because i don't really have anything to shim this let's see if you guys can help me out i need something to stand this off because i'm not going to let my brand new machine well what i consider brand new i'm not going to let this beat down piece of steel with all these ragged edges and chunks and crap hanging off i'm not going to let it just like mangle the table of my cnc machine okay so i just planned on i don't really have anything super useful i'm torn i don't know if i should cut this all dry for those of you that don't know if you cut if you use inserted tooling it's nice to run it dry so you don't thermally shock the inserts the the intense heat from an aggressive cut combined with you know the rapid cooling of an insert can explode the insert i've done it so cutting dry is nice if you have a compressor that can keep up with an air blast you can see that we've got the we've got the air blast right here the kicker is i don't really have anything i don't really have anything at the moment that's relatively low profile like this i need something that's lower than this clamp is you guys can't see i need something that's basically that's very very thin so i just decided before i came in today that i was just going to cut this old crappy yardstick that's been laying around the shop for years and a half and then just use two just set it down that way i can put the steel on this tap it around it should move relatively easy easily we'll we'll tighten it down with the clamps we should be dialed but if you guys have any other tips i have a couple thin pieces of wood like quarter inch wood but then of course if we run coolant that's that's ah that's nasty and i don't really i have some shim stock but nothing thick enough to get this job done so if you guys have any tips or tricks i know i do have some shim stock but not much in fact hold on we should do like a list of like top 10 like everyday machinist tools you know things like um having a mirror that's that's super useful having an indicator that's on some type of swivel that's super super duper useful having a scale i put i just use magnets by the way these are just magnets just uh taped but like this shim stock super super uh super useful to have around and there's a whole bunch of different sizes in here well according to this yeah the thickest piece of shim stock in here there's there's sheets of steel in here and the thickest one is 15 thousandths and that's just that yeah demagnetizer that's a good call someone just said yeah someone just said i don't know if you guys can see that but there's a bunch of pieces of shim stuff that you can trim so i think we're going to go with the operation chop up the yardstick and i think that'll that'll that'll get us done for today um but yeah that's about it you guys i'm gonna i'm gonna cut this to size real quick so that i can run this get this five axis toolpath going and then if i'm happy if i'm happy with the setup on this i'm gonna run this today if the setup is sucking and i just don't feel like i'm on my game then i'm gonna dump this project and i'm to jump on the uh operation clean up the clean up the mold the steel for this mold so i thought i'd just do a quick video i appreciate you guys watching looks like 17 of you guys gave me a thumbs up i appreciate it keeps me motivated shows me that you guys care you're interested that you get something out of these videos um as always this video will be uh will be up on my patreon account probably by the end of the night it takes a little while i've had a couple videos where it's weird youtube is supposed to process them and it doesn't it like don't ask me why but when i open my youtube account even now it still says processing i don't know if it's because maybe i swore or said a like a a mild cuss word or something like that but it'll just say processing forever and it won't make itself available i don't know why and most the time i just don't save these to my phone i just let them stay there so if i don't if youtube doesn't process it i'm just sol so as soon as this is done i will try to get it up on youtube um someone said run a flat wheel on the plate um question what do i use for cad and cam i use both i have i use solid works and i use fusion 360. i think i think fusion 360 is the freaking best there it is the best value by a country mile when it comes to what you get for the money you pay but when it comes down to like cold hard usability oh man the sketch environment the assembly environment it cannot keep up with solidworks there's a variety of things when you're building um when you're building sophisticated assemblies and stuff it just it just isn't there man and it sucks because i get it you know solidworks is like what 4 000 for the base license plus 1200 bucks for your first year i can tell you because we just re-up it's like 5 900 bucks it's insane but um but if you can live without that really sophisticated kind of development environment if i were just a machine shop if all we did was machine products i don't think we would ever need solidworks i think would be totally good with fusion i really do i don't think i don't think we would need it but because we do so much product development we do need that sophisticated sketching and uh that's physically sketching and servicing environment someone said mastercam is the only cam yeah that there was a time there was a time when that was probably true but there are a lot of i think hyper mill would disagree i think even power mills are pretty awesome cam package there's a lot of there's a lot of amazing cam packages and the truth is you guys every one of you that watch this video know that am not a fanboy i don't care i don't care you do you man if you like mastercam or hyper mill or bobcat or you know whatever it is you use you think then keep uh then keep rocking and rolling dude just you know whatever makes parts whatever if it makes dollars then it makes sense so keep keep hustling so all right guys i'm out of here it's been 41 minutes i got crap to do and uh the", "U2s4T7pQChk": "uh my name is chuck gildstein i work for bunsel processor division i've been with the company for 22 years uh primary functions for the company that has been with the stunner equipment captivate standard equipment the electric stunners along with some other duties but uh our company has made a pretty major commitment uh to eman humming handling and stunning for the industry uh there are now two two specialists myself included and ryan malone who just recently graduated from kansas state university we're going to team up from a service standpoint and support standpoint throughout the united states for captive bolt equipment so at any time you ever have questions on this type of equipment operationally maintenance wise troubleshooting things like that not only do you have a bundle processor division you've got myself and ryan malone but we also have technicians and experts from manufacturer from jarvis that are available they actually have 20 plus service technicians throughout the united states that if need be there could be a service call made to your client to to help you through a situation if there happens to be one or to demonstrate equipment whatever it might be um that being said what is there's several different types of centers on the market uh first and foremost whatever type of device that you're using today whether it be a pistol an inline tool whatever it is make sure that everybody that's using the equipment knows how to use it safely some equipment has manual safeties on some or operationally before you make it ready to fire it's automatically safe but others don't have any type of safety so make sure anybody that's using this equipment you have the manual from the manufacturer share it with them if there's videos whatever it might be make sure that you're sharing that with anyone that operates this type of equipment they need to fully understand from a safety standpoint how they operate um so just kind of get started with this a little bit we're going to start out with with one of the more popular models for small animals basically look at it from the standpoint i recommend pistols like this type of a tool waist down that type of an animal so think of swine lamb goats those types of things we do have plants use these for beef market sized beef would be about the maximum size that i'd be using the pistol uh you should really have some type of a head restraint if you're going to use a pistol style because imagine trying to shoot like this you're going to feel it here you're going to shoot straight on with the pistol if at all possible these tools have a built-in safety it's called a running block safety so i pull back on the hammer right here that i pull back with the firing block there's the chamber so the the power load will go into the chamber there yeah i happen to accidentally pull the trigger with the firing block open cartridge there it cannot fire that's called that's the rolling block safety is activated once i'm ready to use the tool so i'm within two or three feet of the animal i intend to use this tool on forward on the fiery block now it's in full fire mode so if i were to pull the trigger here the hammer would strike the firing pin and cause it to fire if the animal becomes agitated and stressed you need to put it back in safety it's just as simple as pulling back on the firing block again notice i keep my finger away from the trigger even when i've got it pushed forward i only go to the trigger when i'm ready to use the tool then i just put it back in these tools are available in a 25 caliber and a 22 i would tell you that 95 of these tools that we sell are 25 caliber tools not that there's any difference in power to it it's just the most popular model that we have in the united states uh and that's where we push these particular tools these tools inherently just because of the design very safe you understand where the business end of the tool is so from a safety standpoint we never ever place our hand on the business end the penetrating rod end of the tool there is a an exhaust but you can see that there's an exhaust port here for the hot gases from the cartridge being fired we want to make sure if we're using this tool it's not designed to hand if you do use two hands to steady the tool you're going to burn your fingers your hand your palm whatever it might be it's not going to put you in the hospital but you're going to definitely feel it and you won't do that again put it that way any time using a captain bolt tool like this especially these tools you want to make sure at the end of every day that you're cleaning it it's one of the big step-backs plants uh where they get things done they use the pool continuously but they never go through and they maintain and don't maintain it and don't clean it these tools are designed there's wear parts the more you use them the faster they're going to wear with pistols the type of cartridge you use in terms of strength is going to accelerate if you use a stronger cartridge it's going to accelerate the wear of some of these parts i'll show you that so bear with me while i take the muzzle off here and uh chuck i just want to thank you for making the trip out to the pacific northwest uh well while you're doing that so it's been an enjoyable trip long flight yeah but it's an enjoyable trip out here i enjoy doing this this is a this is part of the job that i really like it is to teach awesome and love to teach these things so and if if you guys have any questions uh ask and i'll uh let chuck know and yeah we'll continue going on uh this i learned earlier today and this just blew my mind as someone who's used one of these machines for many years so yeah i love this what's about to happen so so this tool this is what's called a self-retracting system what that means is when you fire this particular tool and use it for the intended purpose this tool will actually reset the penetrating rod back into position for the next shot provided you've maintained these components and the way it works so what you've got here at the very top this this washer here is called a stop washer it's designed to do just what it says it's designed to stop these sleeves from being pushed out the end of the muzzle so they don't get pushed out here the wear on that is always on the inside diameter so as an example this is a brand new one if there was wear on this side you could flip this over and put it back on the other way and get longer life that'll extend the life of that particular washer next are what we call stunning rod buffers and on this is happens to be the standard length there's eight of these stunning rod buffers okay very important that these are maintained these are what retracts the bolt back out of the animal's head and resets it for the next shot never recommend when you're cleaning or doing maintenance we don't want to use oils or solvents or anything to clean these these should be taken out dry use a washcloth of some type clean them up these are nice and new they're going to turn black they're going to get dark but don't use solvents on these just wipe them and check them for anywhere and then at the very base here there you can see this blue washer that's called a flange washer if that's designed i'll show it to you here in a minute but that's designed to flatten out that first one on so what happens when you fire the tool a pistol like this the energy of the cartridge is extended right here it when it's fired this little dished out area right there that expansion chamber is where the cartridge fires into directly that drives the bolt down into the animal's head if you're using for small animals say baby face as an example we might use a pink cartridge that's a 1.25 grain cartridge this might compress to about right here so these sleeves will compress down once they get down to that full compression then they have to reset themselves yeah so when they reset that's what draws it back out the strongest cartridge a black or an orange cartridge the maximum you're going to get is about right here to this sleeve uh and what happens is if you're using a blue cartridge like an example just start with that a 3.0 grain cartridge you're going to get about the same compression is the orange and black is just going to get you to this point faster it's not going to go any deeper into the animal's head it's just going to be the speed that the bolt travels so these will compress to about here so you're going to get about two and three quarters to three inches of penetration depth on average with a pistol once they go full uh hydraulic meaning that they are fully engulfed inside the barrel they have to reshape themselves and then reset back into the gun if these are weak or worn the bolt can have a tendency to stick that's an indication you need to service the tool okay so it is recommended when you're doing maintenance and service on these the first one on and the last one on take the most abuse so when you take these off of the penetrating rod try and keep them in the same order when you take them off and then take these two and put them into the middle okay for the next time so you're getting longer life out of them that way okay so they share the brunt of the um they all equally share the force that's correct okay awesome you get more even aware out of it um do anyone does anyone have any questions the next thing that we want to talk about is the stunning rod itself so it's really important this is obviously the most important part of the tool other than the cartridge the chamber firing it uh stunning rods have to be taken care of these this is a brand new one obviously you can see it's nice and clean and shiny as you use these they'll start the same it's really important to clean what i call the piston end of the tool use uh the easiest thing and cheapest way to do this green scratch pad okay just use a 3m or whatever kitchen scratch pad clean it all up we want to make sure we get any uh burnt on gunpowder or things like that this should be nice and smooth all around through the piston area okay and then do the same thing down the shaft of the bowl you want to make sure that we get it clean so we can inspect it we're looking for any kind of hairline cracks or anything like that yeah and then we're going to make sure we clean out this end of the penetrating rod it's hollowed out to about 5 8 of an inch i don't know if you can see that on the video but this is actually hollow to about here on the penetrating rod so you want to make sure you get a pick if there's a bone chip or debris other debris built up in here you want to get that out this is purposely done so this tool on the penetrating rod if you put your finger on that travis you feel the sharpness on the inside yeah that's crazy it's sharp on the inside edge not the outside a mistake that a lot of plant operators make is they think they're sharpening the penetrating rod by taking emery cloth sandpaper a grinder a file and filing the outside edge yeah you don't want to do that you want to make sure you're sharpening it on the inside edge there are sharpening tools that can do that on like a dremel or a drill so myra hi it's travis i'm also here so with that being said it's real that's why it's so important so these are designed to cut through the head and what happens is when they cut through the bone chip that actually the penetrating rod chip cuts through when the bolt gets to its full extension at that speed that bone chip now becomes a projectile and it goes through the brain and sometimes it's embedded as as deep as the brain stop so it causes a deeper stop yeah that's why it's important it's like a stamp that stamps out that all the way through okay yeah so that yeah and then uh and then what model is this one that we're we're going over just uh so this is the jarvis pistol uh pass stunner uh model this is model number let me look here real quick this is the model 4144 132 so this is the long board i just had to recount this is not the standard ball so there's nine sleeves here yeah on the long bolt the standard bolt has eight okay okay cool so cleaning wise real quick i like to cover cleaning and maintenance very important that this is inspected after every day's use don't let it go a week don't let it go two weeks if you shot this tool during the day and you're harvesting your plant it should be inspected at the next next operation or before the next operation most importantly so that you're treating the animal right you want to make sure equipment's working correctly yeah that certainly is something that will help um with humane handling in a great preventative measure to ensure uh you know animal welfare so yes that's awesome yeah so the other part are these two components you want to make sure that you're cleaning these all of the jarvis tools are shipped with the proper cleaning tools pistols have one unique device this tool is used to clean what's called the undercut and it just bottoms out this should be done every week should be cleaned yeah it's got two little areas for scraping oh no okay right there they're built one side's flat the other side has these two little kick outs that's what goes down to the barrel okay like that so we should clean this out if you need to use gun cleaning solution don't use wd-40s and stuff like that use something that's made for weapons okay let's recommend it and just spray a little bit in there let it soak up take the brush cleaning brushes come with it if there's loose debris you can use the brass brush if it's very heavy debris you can use a steel brush and do it that way awesome so we want to do the same thing with the muzzle make sure that the muzzle is clean there's one additional part if i can get it out of there oh wow there's a barrel lock washer and it actually there's a seat right inside um if you can see that or not if there's a good view of it but basically what it does is this is a cushion that cushions the barrel end right here to the inside of that muzzle if this part is missing or worn what will happen is these sleeves here they will break up and cut off in little rings about this side okay if this is missing yeah wow so we want to make sure it's in good condition as well because that lip will act as a cutting edge when it expands when it expands into that it'll cut them off okay exactly science everybody wants yeah so yeah so then we just put everything back together we want to make sure we clean out the the muzzle end here get all the debris built up out of that and then we can reassemble it's very simple to do we just go back here and screw it in hand tight with this tool is perfectly fun okay awesome we do have full maintenance videos safety operations cleaning and full maintenance we're not going to tear the tool completely apart but there are about 10 to 15 components internal yeah one thing that i look at there's what's called a a sierra zero spring here a release pin release pin spring if we have this closed and i reach over the hammer if i can move the firing block yeah my hand that's an indication that that release pin spring is weak oh it should be replaced okay the other thing is it does have a built-in extractor so if you watch here this part notice how that pulls out when i pull back on the firing block that's what extracts this back cartridge so i can pull it out that should snap back watch as i pull forward or pull back on it it automatically snaps back in place if this part does not do that there's an extractor spring it's a curly spring that would need to be replaced on that tool okay we want to make sure that is functioning yeah and that that's something you'd recommend just a plan have on hand like an extra one or two yes okay you should have all the components internal that we just went through here should have full backup set awesome should have a release pin spring and an extractor spring yeah at a minimum yeah and i'll just say that if every plant should have a backup system but don't plan on your backup system to harvest parts off your traditional system that's right so as you probably are aware most inspectors will require you to have two different stunning devices yeah so one should happen to fail and god forbid we hope that it doesn't but it happens i'm not going to tell you it doesn't happen you can't use that particular that same tool for the second shot yeah and i've got to have a backup tool yeah i've had to write uh you know getting a no we creating a robust handling plan to correct something like that so let's just keep parts around everybody that's right and maintain it yeah i mean i i hear from customers that say my stutter's not working properly i'm not getting it to fire or whatever it might be or i'm not getting the penetration actually it's not it's not stunning the animal and you start to question them and then you find out well we haven't taken it apart in two or three weeks i've gotten stutters like this back where i couldn't get the muzzle off because it's just some cake but caked with it's rusted together it never and once i do finally get it apart then it's just a mess on the inside yeah so it's really important to take care of your tools yeah and and store in a dry area we all know uh harvesting floors are notoriously wet damp humid places so certainly store correctly don't use water to clean okay don't use water if you can avoid it if you have if you feel you have to spray it off or clean it off with water completely disassemble it and let everything dry let it completely dry before you put it back together okay rust rust is your enemy yeah so all right so we'll move any questions any questions uh did you see no not people just waving a bunch i'm going to go set up my phone so i could get people from mine okay but without the audio delay gotcha i'm going to go ahead and keep going yeah absolutely so next we're going to talk about what we call the pas cylinder or c-type stunners and i have three three different models today that we're going to talk about um the first one is probably the predominant tool in the industry uh as far as beef plants and swine plants right now this is the model 4144 o61 this is the standard length uh cylinder style stunner uh that we we have uh this tool is of what's called a free flight bolt system uh we'll explain that uh from a safety standpoint this one it does have a safety all of our cylinder style centers do have a manual safety on them so if you watch at this point right here and granted everybody i just want to rest assure you i don't have any cartridges in this so typically i wouldn't handle it this way but i wanted you to see this so right now i it's in safe mode so if you can see this when i rotate you'll see that there's a separation right here maybe there's a good shot so when i put it back in safe mode notice how it closes that separation that gap what i just did by putting it in safe mode if this tool were ready to fire if i were to accidentally pull the trigger it cannot fire because the firing pin is locked away from being able to start the cartridge yeah so these are designed as a two piece stunner so you've got the breech barrel assembly and you've got the firing cap assembly the way i make this ready to fire we'll run through this first is cartridge is going to go into this chamber i'm going to put my my cartridge here there is a triple thread i don't know if you can see it with the lighting but there's three different positions with which i can start this cap that makes it very quick so now i've got my cartridge here i'm going to this tool that's still in safe mode and when i go to use this when i'm within close proximity to the animal within two or three feet of the animal or if it's in a knock box notice i keep my fingers away from the trigger button trigger button is here i keep my fingers away from that i'll reach up and i'll rotate the fire and then i'm going to put it in the animal's head in fire if the animal is stressed rather than just firing the tool i'm going to rotate this back to safety and take it apart ultimate safety that way yeah and then i'll just say if if your job is knocking and you feel your have an animal that you can't comfortably not um i think it's up to you to make that judgment call to maybe put this one back in the pain you know there's so many other things to avoid uh causing more stress or injury to you or that animal good point yeah like you said if the animal is stressed it's ambulatory uh whatever it might be let the animal settle down don't get yourself or the plant in trouble by trying to keep harvest moving yeah do it the right way do it the right way for the animal yeah exactly that's awesome um with this particular tool as well uh with that being said we're gonna actually i'm glad you're here we're gonna talk a little bit about handling this particular tool because as you can see for some people that have never used a captive bolt tool an inline tool might be a little bit uh intimidating to them so what i do in terms of safety first and foremost because i'll be honest with you and i think most plants will say this hardly anybody uses the safety yeah once they get it to fireboat have you experienced that yeah i've experienced that as well yeah that is just uh it's something that is glossed over it is and you know yourself in a hurry you don't think about it you use this for so many years or months or whatever it might be that you just don't think about it so what i like to teach is from a safety standpoint if i am the operator i want to make sure i'm keeping my co-workers safe as well with tools like this so imagine if i if i have this tool i don't know if there's a cartridge in here oh and i want to hand it off to travis yeah you know if you think about this who's in trouble here you know travis is right here and i'm trying to hand it to him who could get injured obviously him travis if i hand it off like this and he accidentally grabs it by the trigger now i'm at harv the best way for cylinder style stunners break it apart and hand it off in two pieces okay that way nobody can get injured that's great because i've i've uh i've experienced that thing where people are like quick hand me that or quit you know and there's just if this is being stored as a backup if the person handing it may not know that it's in the go position yes and they get handed and then all of a sudden it could just be a weird fumble a a little duck yeah because a lot of the um it's just accidents yeah they and the are thing is with this your co-workers get them into the habit they don't accept it from anyone in one piece you make them back away and and make sure that they get it in two pieces that way i would like to say just like shooting range etiquette just do everything you think like don't cross the path of someone else don't do all these things to in the mig you may think it's silly or overkill but if if you have a zero incident record then is it really silly right now exactly exactly so this tool is designed for market size beef animals swine lamb goats pretty much everything with the exception of very large animals you may get caucasian success with a bull or a boar or a sow type of an animal or a large holstein animal you may also experience bad experiences for that animal with this type of a tool there are others made for those larger animals but this for for a small plant medium-sized plant uh market-sized beef animals this is a perfect tool with this one so we're going to take maintenance-wise and cleaning-wise on how these operate let me break this one apart and you'll see based on what you just saw with the pistol this is what i call a free flight bolt system if you remember on the pistol the penetrating rod was fully covered those are very useful for small animals very safe to use and has enough power to stun those smaller animals with that pistol you're at about three inches of penetration here with this one with the sleeves on here you're going to be at around three and a half to three and three quarters of inches of penetration but not only that now i can bump up my power to a five grain cartridge so it's a little stronger cartridge with these and it can withstand that added power okay and someone uh just asked a great question and maybe uh they said is the bolt supposed to remain out after fire yes on on a free flight system yes okay uh just to show you that as an example so when when this tool is fired and i'll show you here when i get it all back together but it can range where the bolt will stay out there it could go about anywhere and in some cases i've seen it bounce all the way back into that that that is normal these are not designed to retract not a free flight the advantage to the free flight system is a better stun a stronger stun so there's more power invested in these uh or available in these i shouldn't say invested um the drawback is as we talked about earlier with these types of tools 75 to 80 of the time it's going to retract itself back out of the head yeah but in that other 20 to 25 percent it could stick in the animal's head and you got to be on it you got to be on or my suggestion if it sticks let it go yeah you aren't going to really damage the tool okay they're pretty hardy okay and it happens yeah just from a safety standpoint just let let the tool fall with the animal and address it once you get the animal shackled and everything else okay cool yeah so you know that's normal and we'll walk you through operationally okay how to reset that good question really good question go try to do that thing again to get so from a maintenance standpoint same types of things here you've got two black buffers these are a harder buffer they're more solid and then the red buffer is a little bit softer it's sandwiched between the two blacks just like that on all of the cylinder style tools that are free flight so you've got it just like that there is also a barrel lock washer that accomplishes the same thing it is cushioning this surface of the breech from the inside of the barrel so it just goes here a lot of times when i'm out doing service calls or maintenance and training this particular part is missing so we want to make sure that those parts are in there everything that i have in my hand here these are replaceable parts penetrating rod works the same way as on the pistol we want to make sure that we're cleaning and maintaining the piston end the shaft of the the penetrating rod and then also the same thing it's hollow so we're going to clean that out and also it's sharper that edge so make sure that that is maintained and not ripped off if you find that you're not getting a good proper stun on an animal this would be one of the first things i would check is to make sure that the penetrating rod is not rounded off it should be a nice sharp edge if it's rounded or blunted replace the penetrator okay now how do these work these particular tools um when we start talking about the power of the tool there's actually two components that drive the energy of this tool besides the cartridge so you've got the breech the breech actually has four grooves built into it they're machined into it that start about the top of the threads and then they come out so they are machined in an outward fashion so they get wider at the base all of the energy of this tool will take you back right there sorry so right now if this tool were set up and ready to fire the rod would be about in that position inside the breech all of the energy of this tool is developed in that short travel period right there these grooves start right at about the top of the of the threads so if we maintain the breach and up inside above those grooves we want to inspect that if you get a lot of heavy pitting rusting damage up inside the breech that can cause a loss of compression okay so again i mean if you think about that you're looking at about an inch and a quarter travel distance is where the speed goes from zero to upwards of 205 feet per second put this back together maintenance wise we want to make sure so we're cleaning this we're maintaining the rod maintaining all the different parts and so forth and then also the barrel we want to inspect the barrel here let me put this back together so i've got the barrel washer is there the lock washer's there i've got the buffers on there and i'm going to put the breech back on another important part of this particular tool is there's what's called a breech locking cover right here it's this rubber cover around the breech that is actually it's not designed for comfort although it will give some comfort for the operator this is actually designed to lock the firing cap mechanism onto the breech barrel assembly and you can probably hear that sweep that's what we're after we want to make sure that that's good and tight and we assemble it all the way down if we don't assemble it all the way down we could have a space or a gap here between there and the inside face of the firing cap if that happens when you fire the tool the top part of the cap could flatten out on you now just to address the question that we had earlier about whether the bolt penetrating rod should stick out so with the free flight systems there's actually what's called a retention system here at the end of the barrel there's a pin there's a collar there's a ball and there's a spring it's a rubber spring there it actually puts side pressure on the penetrating rod so when this tool if you just use this tool it's important we don't just that's not resetting the penetrating rod yeah if we were to use this tool with the penetrating rod in that position we've lost about 50 of the power of the tool okay so the cap is actually designed to fit right into the end of the penetrating rod and we push it in okay wow so now it's back up in there about 3 8 of an inch i just want to know how many people have been doing it wrong i see it a lot okay an indication of that this if you see this cap there's a knurled part of this cap some people do this but if they try to hit it back in there don't do that use the cap properly put it on the end it's designed to fit perfectly into that end of the bolt and push it back in there okay the other thing i see is some people just take it push it down onto a flashlight countless people just doing that on a piece of concrete yeah and then you'll have an ineffective sun yeah and then they wonder why something is turned up yeah yeah storage wise with these tools i suggest you store them in two parts never ever have the tool laying around with a live cartridge on it inside the chamber just for the safety of everybody in the plant store it like this no cartridge yeah okay there's any more questions or not yeah so so the second one that we have this is one of our more popular tools right now so this is an inline tool operates basically the same way as the last one that i just went through so it won't take as long on this one but this particular tool has a self-retracting bolt okay so the firing cap assembly the safety everything is pretty much the same on this particular tool where we see a difference is just like with the pistol now we've got the retraction available so i get that there i was gonna say my guess is there's more bushings in there there are a little bit different configuration oh look at that they put that one together smashed and that's why we inspect yeah so that one was kind of out of position when this tool was assembled so if you can see that so that would be something always inspect the tools that's why we did that and then do that intentionally by the way yeah so there you can see now we're back to the self-retracting type of tool biggest difference between this one and the pistol is now you've just got a little bit different type of a stop washer there's four of these smaller stop washers in sequence here so this one i can use a stronger cartridge and i can get up to the five green not the three and a half or four frame like with the pistol but i'm still going to get about three and a half inches of penetration with this particular tool okay okay but this has probably been our most popular tool uh of the last several weeks now if not months okay so the same thing is true here we're going to do the same cleaning and maintenance as we did with the pistol we're going to go through all of these different sleeves we're going to clean the brakes we're going to clean the the barrel end uh notice there's no retention system here not required that's one of the biggest benefits of this type of a tool from an inline standpoint gives us more power uh but less that we have to think about for resetting the bolt okay so we're going to reassemble this guy and weight wise these all will be in that six to seven pound weight range uh very comfortable to handle um and i and i don't know but we still have yeah oh yeah we're still on so very comfortable handle same thing is through here i'm going to use two fingers some people like to use their palm yeah i see that a lot what do you think of that i don't i don't like it yeah i have more control from a safety standpoint here than i do here yeah because there's no you could just mess it up and just fire it yeah into a place you don't want it to go and one thing we didn't cover from a safety standpoint so if i take this tool let's say i have a live cartridge and i assemble it and i don't have this in safe mode i don't know if a lot of people know this but this tool right now if i were to drop it if i were to drop it and it landed on this cap yeah yeah that's why i was saying that if if it's if it's loaded even in safety if someone bumps this that that person handling it you get a good shot yeah exactly exactly and just back up just so you know this as well don't think that this if i had a live cartridge in the pistol so if i open this up put a live cartridge in it then i'm thinking i'm going to close this all up and have it ready to go same thing is true if i drop this tool and it lands on the firing pin or the hammer if it lands here on the ground it's going to fire yeah because essentially these are rim fire it's a hard drive that's right that's right okay so that one again so this tool uh market size beef and everything below okay sheet hogs all those types of things very very user friendly tool yeah the last one that i brought this is if you do large bowls if you do bores if you do sows things like that that's where this particular tool comes into play this is the super heavy duty model uh the 4144 on 59 is the jarvis number on it everything is operationally the same okay the biggest difference is is if you compare the barrels full cylindrical so solid metal versus the cut out metal and the standard much heavier yeah and there's a reason for that so what we're trying to do is drive more energy into the bolt system the penetrating rod yeah this helps that weight helps to hold it down onto the head more so there's less bounce back let's bounce back all the energy is delivered forward this is a long bolt version so it's about five and a half inches of penetration free flight has the same retention system just a little bit of a different setup with it but the same retention system so we still have to reset the bolt after every shot the bolt will stay out okay so we still have to reset the bolt on this yeah that's but very powerful tool yeah and i think that just the information if someone didn't know about using this to reset that they're watching this for the first time that this video has already helped out helped out something good thank you well the other thing is a lot of plants the smaller plants that i've gone to don't even know that this can be taken apart i we've got the maintenance video if you wanted to see the maintenance video just request it we can get it to you but this all breaks apart one part that i find often is customers will call and say hey my tool's not fired i pull the trigger nothing happens if there is no strike on the rim of the cartridge it's not the carpet yeah it's going to be something with the firing cap either the firing pin spring is weak which is why i'm compressing or pulling here or the other thing it can be is this safety note i can't turn that by hand yeah this part right here the inner safety we call this that can turn the wrench okay so if it's loose if you can just freely turn this by hand after you're using the tool that can cause it because if i don't get it turned tight all the way back then i've got it basically engage the safety okay i think that with a thing wow a quick easy test for firing pin springs now this is brand new one but put put the tool in fire mode hold it upside down and compress the trigger okay so when i compress that notice this gap it didn't change yeah if that changes say and it drops to there then you got a bad pin it's an indication you get a bad spring okay firing pin spring needs to be replaced okay very simple i like that that's something that people could just do before their first animal the other thing i'm going to back up just a little bit so the other thing that i find with loss of power is because of the retention system these four parts are replacement parts with the more you use it the more the likelihood you have to replace the spring especially but there's a really simple test to do before you start using this tool for the day don't put a cartridge in assemble the tool together and do what i call a snap test okay just shake it two or three times if the penetrating rod if this rod drops out freely and very easily you need to change these parts okay get them changed out of there okay yeah okay like that that's the tools okay let's uh let's set up and and show the testing system sure all right so so jarvis has got a digital testing system that actually will tell us about the operation of the tool you know a lot of people will take a stunner no matter what brand it is so put a cartridge in it they'll assemble it it'll trigger it and they'll just fire it in the air if you think about it all that's really telling you is that the cartridge fire it's not telling us whether or not that tool is actually in proper working condition and can be used on an animal it's it's important to know the bolt velocity how fast is that bolt going is a true measurement that gives us it'll tell us if we have proper compression within the barrel uh in breach assembly and we actually have a performance tester that tells us that i'm going to wait until travis comes back in but basically this tool is it's two components you have the display module for programming and storage of the data and then here this is the test base itself now this test base is not mounted properly uh just because of the video state from a video standpoint and ease for today but there are three mounting plates that this should be bolted down to a solid surface it shouldn't be just mounted onto a wooden table or anything like that we want a really good solid surface to to make sure it's operating correctly the way it works there's actually two laser eyes that are built into this unit and what it does is the first laser eye they're about an inch apart from each other um once the penetrating rod passes that first eye it starts the timer when it passes the second one it stops it and the device actually measures that speed between the two is what happens there so we can use this for any cylinder style impact stunner pistol style stunner that's out there from a from jarvis standpoint we've got all the parameters for that um and i don't know travis you want to maybe zoom in yeah let's go through this so what we're going to do is we're going to program in the first tool and this is all touch screen so we're going to go to add edit and all i have to do is hit serial number and i'm just going to use one one zero zero zero two if i make a mistake i can backspace say i wanted that to be a three real simple i hit enter next is the model of the tool and let's go ahead and we're going to go ahead and just do this particular model and most of these are are set up so it's got the model number right on it so we're going to go four one four four zero six one so we're gonna hit enter on that next if you want to keep track of maintenance and who's doing the maintenance on the tools uh in most larger plants they do this you can put a four-digit coat for the operator who's actually doing the maintenance and stunning testing so i just use for me i just use the last four digits of my phone number six one two one and i hit enter now it's all ready to go there i save that and hit the home button now i can see all of the information that i just entered is actually on the screen and i can verify that before i go and start the test i do have if you're okay with it yeah a little loud absolutely i'll be honest with you right up front with this being loose on the table i don't know what we're going to get normally they're melted down so we might not get a correct reading here because of that so now i'm going to put my cartridge into the chamber actually back up i'm going to go ahead and mount this in just because of that so if you look down in there there's a cushion i don't know if you can see it down inside so this is going to stand up on that cushion and this is going to be self-centering so when i pull this there's actually four pads jaw pads okay that when i pull this notice how nice and perpendicular it is now and it's straight for me now i'm going to put my cartridge in and i'm going to make sure back to safety okay so i've got it in safe mode i'm going to  that make it ready to fire before i do anything else and then i'm going to assemble so i do that so that i don't accidentally fire the tool next i can start i have to hit start test here and arm tester notice here i can do the same thing here i can hit the button on the base so if you wanted to mount this remotely you could do that and arm everything here i've already got it just so you know so i'm set up with the yellow loads it's a lighter load it's not the most powerful load for this tool but we can test it with these and i prefer to test with a lighter load on the screen now i'm ready to fire you can see i've got the yellow load selected notice the number here right below the cartridge it says 132 that's our minimum speed for passing okay so this penetrating rod has to operate at 132 feet per second to pass okay yeah we'll show you we're going to go ahead and fire so fire in the hole here typically and i apologize right up front i don't have the safety gear could potentially should be wearing a vest a knocker vest to protect your glass or earplugs and eyewear yeah so apologize for that up front this isn't proper but we're trained enough we're going to go ahead and do this so we're going to rotate the fire and i am going to hold down somewhat try and get the best result we can so i'm ready to go and now you can see on the reading that was with just a yellow load so the minimum speed to pass was 132 this is the actual speed of that bolt was 168.01 feet per second so we passed that's green the background is green that's a visual indication that it passed and if it's programmed that if it didn't pass it would be red let's let's do another one all right and here's a perfect training example for you with a cylinder style tool that is free flight you go out there so let's just imagine somebody did that okay instead of doing it properly let's retest yellow again and you'll see a difference in bolt speeds here again it went back to safe mode i'm going to go here arm tester goes back to zero so we're ready to fire okay so i'm gonna go back here and fire the hole even audibly you get whoa look at the difference 30 percent 35 percent of the speed of the bolt just went away yeah because we did not properly reset the penetrating rod on the tool so that's why it's really important that we maintain clean maintain replace worn parts double check everything before you use the tool of an animal let's talk about the cartridges a little bit so this is a rimfire cartridge you can see the indentation here if you were to use a tool any stunner especially a rimfire type stunner if there is no mark whatsoever on the cartridge and it is not a cartridge issue i get that call a lot the cartridge didn't go off i got dug cartridges yeah you know we talked to him about it there's not a strike point yeah so it's not a cartridge it's going to be something within the tool itself okay whether it's a pistol or an inline tool whatever it might be awesome okay and then i i would say what what you want to um to end on uh uh well let's be sure okay okay i'm going to show you there are two different types of uh of uh percentages this is pretty typical for pistols this particular you see the step down okay pistols will always have a step down okay the inline tools typically are going to be just a full jacket okay no step down and don't interuse them uh you can then use these in an inline tool but you couldn't use a straight one in the pistol because it won't go okay so i'm pretty fit okay okay all right all right do you hope that was helpful yeah well we're still live if you just want to tell people where where they could find all this stuff yeah so we have a website a bundle processor division uh you can call me directly at 319 570 i'll be more than happy to help you answer any questions whatever it might

to make a universal motor speed controller and this what you see is the machine that runs on universal motor it's a vacuum cleaner a dead one so that's the inside view you see the universal motor i have to take it out [Music] so here is our high speed universal motor and as you can see here it is 1000 watts and that's the impeller also if you have an idea where i can use this impeller let me know in the comment section this is a 9 volts to 24 volts variable dc supply i'm going to test this motor with this supply so the motor is working let's do some oiling now it is running pretty good so let's make our own speed controller components needed for this project are mje 1309 power transistor variable resistor 100 kilo ohms and a 35 amperes bridge rectifier i also plan on using this capacitor for better starting top for the motor and we are also going to need a heat sink i'm going to use this one it has six mosfet slots so i can easily mount four transistors on it [Music] so that's the max i could do it's much better than before at least and all the transistors that you see in the front will be connected in parallel so guys here i'm going to use this universal board here the green wire represents common positive for collector and black one represents common emitter for negative [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] so here as you can see in this video i'm doing the step-by-step transistor connection three transistors are being used each one three double zero nine and all the three are going to be connected in parallel meaning base to base collector to collector and emitter to emitter after that another transistor is used to drive the base of the original three transistors and then to the base and collector of the driving transistor i have connected the variable resistor and the circuit looks somewhat like this the output is variable output from 0 volts to 120 volts dc and input is a 120 volts dc so guys it's time to connect the rectifier and here i've already connected the wires to the ac terminals of the rectifier now to the remaining two terminals which are dc these two wires will be connected done this is the supply at present it is turned off now it's time to connect the universal motor at the output so guys here i'm going to start with the 500 watts seawing machine motor so let's turn it on you see it has started running that's your home supply and the rectifier that is converting home supply to dc and after that comes your circuit and at the output i've also placed this rectifier as i said before and that's your motor although it's 220 volts but i'm running it at lower voltage so the rpm is a little low but still it is running quite good let's increase it now guys let's try this vacuum cleaner motor 1000 watts okay let's increase the speed whoa up for vacuum cleaner motor super close up for the vacuum cleaner motor turning on the switch slowly increasing the speed just started running more more more more more now guys let's test this circuit on this super big washing machine motor okay increasing the speed more more more more and guys you can also use the same device on dc motors obviously the voltage rating is different for this motor i'm going to run it at 50 volts although it has written 40 volts here yeah no heating at all increasing the speed more more [Music] more 50 volts input from an e-bike charger now guys what will happen if i connect this one kilo ohm half watt resistor to the output terminals of this speed controller circuit for input i'm using the same 50 volts supply from the e-bike charger let's connect the multimeter to check the output here it's 3.127 volts and remember that the input is around 59 volts max let's reduce it and see how low we can go you see as low as 0.5 volts dc yeah 4.1 volts almost that is best for charging your lithium-ion batteries let's go for 5.1 this is the voltage at which your mobile phone charges 6 volts for your six volts lead acid battery usually used in emergency lights your rechargeable nine volt batteries and again we can go or increase to as high as we want so as you can see that this device is just perfect for charging your batteries okay and here as you can see that we are doing full pretty good huh but what if we don't have an e-bike charger we can always use our old laptop chargers and charge our 12 volts batteries setting it to 14.4 volts very smooth increase in voltage yeah we have the exact 14.4 volts so let's connect it and the voltage drop is around 12.16 and the battery is charging with time it will increase and finally reach 14 volts when i will claim it fully charged oops it has auto turned off so guys as you can see that it has gained 13.27 volts from 715 to like 740. you", "2vcghi3J0uk":

grinder today I'm going to use an angle grinder to grind down a bolt as you can see the move before it came with three sanding discs so this black & decker 6 amp angle grinder came with three sanding discs if you watched my unboxing as well as I bought a separate metal sanding disc right here which comes in this size package only five two dollars at Walmart where a metal sanding disc the cutting through the metal bolt on ta the trashy trailer that's right behind me and she's gonna be showcasing her skills in a few minutes and I added I actually with this angle grinder you can actually put the handle on top it screws in and on the side but on the side you can screw it in or you can screw it in on top which I'm going to be screwing on top so I can get a better hold the bolt on the trailer so I never use the angle grinder before but online is said that had about four stars out of five there are some what five stars they're a little bit more my like $50 that come with all the cutting discs as well as the metal cutting disc but I decided to purchase the Black & Decker six amp they do make an eight point two amp a little bit more money but this one is really sturdy it's lighter than the ones on most of the shelves out there in Walmart and it's very easy to attach the disks it actually comes with a wrench I'll show you the wrench is in the box and minute here we go so when you use this when you attach that disks on to the bottom angle grinder this part right here gets screwed on when it comes out of the box these two pieces are actually touching but you take this piece off you put the disc on then put this back on this part take you a wrench and then you turn it clockwise but first thing you have to do is press the lock button right here there's actually a button that locks the shaft and then you put the wrench on with the button locked and turn counterclockwise but then this is the button to turn it on over here as you see is on handle to hold it and then there we go its belly above about a 6 foot cord that comes with it so overall is a 6 foot cord and I'll be plugging this into extension cord and outside of my house so I'm gonna review this and see how well it does and we'll see if it does the trick to cut the 2 bolts on my trailer first thing we have to do is put on gloves safety glasses hat and a full full set of clothing so the sparks don't burn me so I will go right back and I'm seeing a little bit and we'll test out the 6 amp Black & Decker angle grinder so we're ready today to plug in is an angle grinder the black & decker 6 amp angle grinder like I talked about just a minute ago and we're gonna plug her in with extension cord a about 25 foot extension cord from my house got my trusty glasses my face mask my gloves and ready to go let's plug her in and test her out I'm going to zoom in for you in a second here pull your end is turned on it's the first time turning her on actually didn't sound too good right first time turning her on this knows that ladies love me so that's the bolt right there is what I'm trying to cut right there can I cut the top of that bolt off or under bottom on the bus first thing I'm gonna try to do is cut off the top of that bolt as well as over here I have to cut off all of that handling this whole part right here I have to cut the whole thing off and get to get to that one little bolt using the angle grinder so I'm gonna try the best that I can I just read the manual and I had to adjust the angle grinder I will zoom it over here and as you see how the angle grinder is on so right here is that circle spot right there that piece is there's two of them there's one on one side of the disc and one on the other side of the disc you got to make sure that the lip is on the inside and the disc is totally centered if not it's gonna completely lose balance and rotate and cut this part right here of the guard I already cut a little bit on the one side when it wasn't on credit correctly so make sure you read your manual I was in a hurry to try to do this but read your manual this is a nice looking angle grinder as you can tell the close-up of it and my trusty work gloves next to it and the wrench that comes with it so let's get to work I'm gonna put the camera down and we'll get the work [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] I'll cut right off a little bit crooked when I can get to the part I want to get to she works guys so just been a review process I just want to show you how to cut through metal it's almost a quarter inch thick and she cut through so took about twenty minutes first time using it but it's actually working with the metal disc so i'm JC signing off here with t and the tractor trailer and [Music]", "hRa9ACCCtmE": "Yurika the scale from Seattle copper gear and it isn't all about just Eureka as in Eureka it's Eureka grinders imported from Italy it's going to be a new product on our web page we're real excited about it let me go over some of the features and what they you know what this grinder is all about comes in stainless and black as you can see nice mirror finish or the matte black finish hopper up here is removable it also has a valve on it to shut it off so you can take it off I'll show you on this one here since it's empty you can see it closes it off a little bit stiff on this one's brand-new closes it off hold eight point eight ounces of coffee so about a half a pound of coffee features a hardened stainless or not hardened stainless they don't say that hardened steel flat bars down there 50 millimeter so that's pretty nice 1350 rpms so not too fast not too slow adjustment ring right up here which lets you adjust from the finest to the courses and this is a grinder that's designed to do everything from what I can see Turkish right up to a coarser drip it is not designed for French press and it's infinite it's stepless so anywhere you put it that's you know you can dial it in to whatever works best for you it has a porter filter rest right here so you can put your portafilter right in there and push oh so that there's a button back here that it pushed against one of the other features that's really nice about this grinder is it had this is your on/off button but it has a timer you can go from the smallest amount to be ground time-wise right up to quite a bit and then you can push this in and get rid of that button so that doesn't you know get damaged when the button is in the out position it is manual when it's in the imposition a little clock here it's going to time whatever you have it set for over here what I just did was in the manual position so I controlled it by pressing the lever on the front weighs a whopping 10 pounds its metal casings those are some of the key features about this on the backside of the black one it says minion on the black side of this one simply the Eureka logo with nice shiny mirror finish ah where can you see these grinders as a matter of fact we happen to be featuring these on the wall which is our coffee tasting wall that we have over our at our store at the Alderwood mall in Lynnwood Washington you can go over there and see 34 of them lined up like soldiers we have the black ones over there we're using them for the wall so check them out over there this is the grind that we came up with we did some testing this is the finest right here and when I felt this this is talc this is definitely down to what I would call Turkish that's my own personal opinion on it anyway then your medium grind nice for drip a little bit coarser drip right on the edge of what would be good for pour over as well what I did notice without disturbing those it's very consistent and a lot of grinders when you get up to the coarser end of things they're not so consistent this seems to be very consistent on all grain settings if it went to French press it might be different but it doesn't so there you go so that's the minion by Eureka we're real excited about it check it out on our webpage subscribe to our YouTube channel write in the comments below ask us questions about it tell us what you think of it if you've already purchased it from us although we just got our first shipment so let us know what you do think about it when you do get it we love feedback from you guys check it out on the webpage subscribe thumbs up and you guys have a good day

designed to be reusable so we have a top cap which you know about because that keeps the ingredients in and the dust and so forth you turn it over and you turn this this one kind of hard and that creates say the materials to come out and you season your food okay and you pop this back on that keeps it fresh so how do you get the top off so you can refill it well it's really easy just this part spins so you'll spin that for a long time and it will never come off this bottom part right here if you can see it you hold that part not the top but that part really hard and turn it and it comes right off and the whole point is you want that to be super hard you want that to be tight because you don't want it to come off by mistake and ruin a perfectly good meal by dumping an entire bottle in

brilliant cut grinder I've never done a review on grinders I've only owned three grinders in my own Tsai existence of living my first one was Santa Cruz shredder I had a four-piece I loved that thing then I got me a SL X which I love that thing too specifically for the ceramic coating that kept all of the goodies off of the grinder and kept it from gunking up and now this I don't want my grinder this is the one I love the most why well one of the reason being they come with different grinding plates so you have this one which is the old to grind ultra fine one then you have this one which is the coarse grind as you can see brilliant cut grinder and then this one this is the more you know if you want some bigger chunks a lot of people like to vape bigger chunks because the bigger the chunk the better the taste I'm not saying that if you mince it up with the fine grinder you're not it's not gonna taste good because it will it's just that the bigger the pieces the more terpenes that comes out of that chunk like if you for instance if you put a nice piece of a bud like a point 20.3 you're not gonna get as much vapor out as out of motive apes without the bud being grinded up but you will get some vapor and the taste will be awesome and my the bigger one is in pink as you can see but um nothing no threading that's another thing I love about it super magnetized look at this this thing is a beast I don't know what kind of magnets they might be using neodyne IAM magnets but yes this thing is amazing one thing about this grinder that I love so much is that the ease of just grinding a lot of these grinders you put butter on them and it is so hard to growing like you have to act you have to put so much force with this one you barely need any force like literally need anything look like barely boom look at this literally twisting no problem no problem at all I am using the coarse grind plates as you can see I took out the other plate and put the coarse grind so coarse grind I'm gonna show you exactly how hard it is to do that in other grinders so I could've easily just made this one of those grind there versus grinder videos but I'm not I'm just showing you the ease of use from when I use the brilliant cut to this one the same pieces same type of size putting it in here it's not even twisting people look I am adding so much force and it's still not twisting as you can see him my hands are turning red I'm hiding mad force look still hasn't rounded up what kind of grinder you want that's gonna freakin meat you trying to talk it's just to grind it guys as you can see I'm twisting the top and the bottom and trying to get some type of good force and friction I can still can then it's ridiculous like this is no joke believers and gentlemen as you can see I'm twisting as hard as I can I can't I can't grind it for some reason weirdest aw I cannot grind it but the minute I stick this inside look it was grinding just a little bit well you can see as you can see it is not grinding at all ladies and gentlemen I was adding so much force twisting at and nothing still nothing this is exactly what I'm saying that's why I'm in love with my brilliant cut because I don't have that problem not even not even not even 2% of the time I don't have that problem not at all that's why I don't I don't I really don't know how they did that how they how they got it to where it just no matter how much bud you put in there it's still gonna grind but this on the other hand I don't understand it just doesn't grind I wish I had some type of meter that could test the force of how I was twisting it cuz I'm telling you skin how red my hands got I was twisting this [ __ ] hard a zone but nothing it still wasn't grinding it was just stuck stuck now almost show you exactly how easy it's going to be to do that here obviously you never want to put weed in the middle because it will not close and it will not grind at all then take it back out coarse grind plate but close it up look easy already twisting look with two fingers two fingers I'm twisting it I would break my fingers on the SLX trying to do this they won't even twist look at that two finger twisting I'm not even having a twist the bottom and the top like I was doing there and I still couldn't do this look two fingers no problem no problem I mean as you can see it gets no better than that why bye I loved my SLX I really did at one point and it just it was just too too much work trying to have to twist that damn grinder and and put all his force just to break up bud like you don't know how happy I am with this brilliant cut it wait into you guys have to try this for yourselves in order to realize what I'm talking about of how easy it is to twist that damn grinder no matter how much bud you put in it no matter how sticky the bud is no matter how dense the but is this grill brilliant cut grinder we'll cut the [ __ ] out of whatever you throw out of it I promise a selects I have not even I used to using my SLX every single day every single day the second I got the brilliant cut I promise you I have not used this not all not one bit I can't wait so they come up with a four piece this is my first three piece so obviously I don't have a bank for Keith this has the bank for Keith you know I mean but I love my grinder I'm sure if you guys got this you guys would love it too I know there's a lot of other grinders that everybody says is better you know there's a lot of top brands 60 70 $80 grinders I understand I never tried those but for those of you that love grinders and probably have those crazy ass different grinders I know I can't remember which ones exactly are out but there's a bunch of them out there that a lot of people are swearing by for those of you please get your hands on one of these and then you could tell me exactly what I mean how easy it is to use it's amazing remind you this is isn't the final product I think this gold will be a little bit more gold I'm not too sure you know they're going through different finishes with different companies as you can see this whole diamond thing I mean it's exactly like a diamond but for me I like to call this sacred geometry because that's exactly what it is if you really look at it it's almost like the Lotus I hope everybody had a good day hope everybody enjoyed this review don't forget to hit the subscribe button hit those thumbs up don't forget to turn on that notification bell and stay waving my friends", "8VbavVQWcYU": "hello senior stoner fans this is the real senior stoner back at you with a very important message this is extremely important everybody needs a grinder I just reviewed $169 grinder I have a $99 grinder I have a $25.00 grinder well now I have a $19 and 99 cent grinder I think we're $21.99 grinder from Amazon it's a crux coffee grinder okay this is the grinder that I use when I make Jimmy Lutz we're gonna unbox it and we gonna talk about it because this is the solution okay why spend hundreds of dollars why spend all that money when all you have to do is get a small coffee grinder mrs. stoner told me about this 20 years ago and I think I've had I don't know three or four I use them as you might imagine pretty heavily okay so this can be my new look but we're unboxing it together it's a very simple machine as you can see here it stands this is it you're looking at it and what it's for is grinding coffee okay but as you can see inside there are blades okay and this thing whirs at such a level that it really gives you good consistency for your bud and what I'm gonna do now is I'm going to use my microscope my weed microscope to determine and reinforce with you that inexpensive old school is the best way to go so I'm gonna pick out buds that might be difficult to grind okay you know fresh buds for example that might be difficult to grind in this case I'm picking out grape inferno this is grape inferno okay so let's take a look at it the consistency so we know what we're dealing with this is how it starts out okay nice nose trim really nice color let's put a few under glass and take a look okay and we're gonna put it in there let's put a few under glass oh it's very evident that what we're dealing with is beautiful flower all the way through now how do you make sure this beautiful flower along with any of the other ingredients you want to put in don't get lost don't get wasted etc okay you open this glass hopper actually that was left this Plexiglas then you put in whatever the amount is you think you want to use for this session let's say you want to roll a few Jimmy joints okay this is a few Jimmy joint for it let's see what happens put it in gonna close the top gonna plug it in you guys see me over here plugging it in oops it has a plug cover on it I'm being very basic with this because I want you to see how basic this truly is it's in my hand I'm gonna move this so you can see that it's in my hand by the way they need to make a longer extension cord it's made for people in kitchens who have the plugs and the walls but here we go and you're gonna tell me the consistency of this compared to the consistency of something that was a hundred and twenty nine dollars or a hundred and sixty nine dollars or ninety nine dollars from thing else that's made for weed let's say check it out you tell me okay this is the base recipe for Jimmy Joyce you're looking at it great weed okay but what I've done is I've gone generic I've gone simple in my grinder and if you want to give it a whirl with your finger at the end or click it with something metal okay to dislodge any of the flour that gets on it okay and to smack it down you'll get a few pieces and then you're gonna see that 99.99 percent of it's gone a little dust on the side now to this I would add for Jimmy joints my teeth and Moonrock my THC eight diamonds I would add midas to it and i would add another thing i would add some different exotic weed so what i would now do is take this move it aside and go further so this grinder isn't just for grinding wheat its to making more complicated things like jimmy joints think of it as a blender okay i think it's even stronger than the ones that are made for us alone okay you know to use for you know weed and things like that this is made for herbs vegetables coffee specifically a very hard bean and now it's done a wonderful job over here so I really recommend in any expensive coffee grinder you'll be really satisfied get an extension cord okay because you don't want to have to be reaching over to the outlet but it's a solution for everybody and I wanted to share it hope this was helpful to everyone this is the real senior stoner saying save some money and time go old-school by a small coffee grinder take care everybody have a great day", "fwE8KbGO_hw": "during the holidays a lot of recipes called for cracked black pepper corn but if you don't have a grinder that can grind black peppercorn thick there's an option take some peppercorns place them in a heavy skillet then place another small heavy pan over it you don't use all your weight it's not on the crock and you've got your cracked black pepper", "0NWojB8tUWY": "visit aromacup.com the world's leading single serve coffee guide join our forums talk with other coffee lovers find coupons and reviews on great single serve gourmet coffee machines coffee capsules and more great information all available at aromacup.com hey everybody this is brian from aroma cup.com how y'all doing today welcome to my virtual coffee shop brought to you by aromacup.com as always we like to show you the coolest new tools for making coffee and making your own at-home coffee shop and we're going to continue that tradition today here on aromacup.com by showing you the botom bistro electric coffee grinder I've used a lot of different coffee grinders you know I have used professional-grade coffee grinders for grinding espresso and all the different grinds of coffee which you need to make in order to be able to create the many recipes that one can create with coffee drinks and this one is winning right now I think is one of the best grinders I've ever used so let's talk a little bit about some of the features on it it looks really cool first off like that's the thing I love about it you know like this is one of those things if it's on your on your kitchen counter and your friends see it they're gonna say ooh what's that oh so that's really cool it's got this nice kind of rubberized exterior right here the name of course is emblazoned across the outside of it and you've got your power button right here off and then on real easy to use just the same as what we've seen and a lot of coffee makers actually on the top right here this is where we put our beans this is our hopper and very basic it has this nice big lid that pops off big opening this is something that you know a lot of coffee grinders you get this tiny little space and you have to spoon your beans in and I don't like that I love this because you can just pour beans right into it and just kind of measure by eye which is really cool and it's real easy to use and clean we'll talk about some of the usage in a moment but let's take off the bean hopper right here you see how easily this comes off we've got this red indicator here and we point that at the kind of grind we're gonna do and we'll talk about that as well so this just twists right off and then if we take a look inside of the unit right here this is the conical burr grinder so if you reach in you can pop out the one half of the grinder right here this part spins around and takes your beans down into the grinding mechanism the cool thing about a conical burr grinder is that it's a lot quieter than your average coffee grinder I don't know if you've all been woken up in the morning sometimes by your significant other or someone else may be grinding coffee but they usually do that sound and this one's a lot quieter which i think is really cool so it's super easy to clean because of this you can just pop that grinding mechanism out and you can just take a little brush or something like that brush out the leftover grounds and you're good to go so that's something that I think is really cool about this machine I wanted to mention of course I was talking about being able to select your grind type there's a lot of different grinds which you can choose from right here as you can see we start off at espresso or the most fine grind that we can do using the machine so that's going to be really suited for espresso machines things like that as we go up we get to about middle of the grind which is a filter type of grind that's very good of course for filter machines some single serve machines obviously things like that and as we make our way up and again you can choose kind of middle of the ground for each of these when we get up to the top right here we've got French press so the most coarse ground coffee that we can do which is great for French presses and so you get all these different choices which you also usually don't get with most machines and that's another thing I like we've got two controls right here as you can see we've got this time dial which starts off at five seconds and it goes up to 20 so this obviously just very simply sets how long you're going to grind your coffee for now the manual does suggest that you should not do more than one twenty-second grind within a five-minute period so if you do a 20 second grind which would be grinding pretty much about a full hoppers worth of coffee you would want to wait because you don't want to overheat this motor this motor does a lot of hard work don't overheat it usually when you're just grinding a little bit though somewhere around five ten seconds should treat you just fine here's your your on/off grinding button and when you press this once you'll launch the grinder if you press it again you can stop the grinder so the great thing about this is you only need to grind as much coffee as you would like to grind and that's really important because of course coffee tastes the best ones fresh ground so you don't want to grind a whole ton just grind as you need to so you get access to that with the with this electric coffee grinder from bodom I think that's really awesome so then we make our way down here is our receptacle for receiving all of our ground coffee simple it's glass so be careful with it it's got a nice rubber lid right here and you can just spoon right out of there pour this into another container anything that you would like when you're all done and then if we take a look on the bottom of the unit we've got this little kind of cable hideaway right here so this is cool because you can wrap the cable around as much as you would like and just kind of hide it a little bit so you can see right there I hide a little bit the cable pop it out through the back end here and boom I'm good to go so these are pretty much all the features of this machine on the on the right hand side again it's just kind of nice and rubberized it's easy to pick up if you need to but you're probably not gonna have to pick this up too often so I told you about all the cool stuff that it does let's make some coffee which is of course the coolest thing that it does of course right grinding coffee so let's do that I'm gonna take my hopper and with the little red indicator pointing over to the right here I'm just gonna kind of slide this in there's two notches right there just slide this into those notches and then you simply turn and make this red indicator match up with the kind of coffee grind that you would like I'm gonna do just about a regular filter grind today because this is what I would usually use with most single serve machines and so I want to keep it kind of middle-of-the-road with how course we're gonna make our grind here I'm just gonna use some coffee beans right here and just dump these guys right in I'm not gonna do too much do about like that again you're gonna want to grind for how much coffee you think you're going to drink roughly because then you're going to get the freshest coffee that you're gonna be able to make so pop our lid back on which seats real nicely on top of the hopper right here slides right on in so now we're ready to grind so all we need to do is choose how much time we want to grind for I've got a little extra coffee in here so I'll go a little above 10 seconds and now all I need to do is just hit the button and let's start grinding oh sorry turn it on would probably be good right always remember that folks turn on your coffee grinder it's the first question that the IT guy always asks right is the computer on is the coffee grinder on it is now all right let's go we're going to just go ahead and press our button right here and start grinding some coffee so you can see this is actually pretty quiet for most coffee grinders this is actually very quiet so there we go the machine stopped it only ran for as long as I told it to I still have some beans left over so you'll kind of get to know how long you should grind for with the kind of grind that you need to do the kind of coffee that you want to make things like that I don't really need to do a whole lot more other than this because really the awesome thing about this machine something that I noticed when I started to grind coffee with it is I could smell the coffee before I even took the lid off of the receptacle where all the coffee grinds go into and I really don't notice that with a lot of other coffee grinders in all honesty you know usually you kinda have to grind it and smell it and then you can tell this machine does a great job of really getting everything out of those coffee beans which i think is really awesome so you know there you go this is a regular filter grind right there I could keep grinding if I wanted to I could grind a little bit stop it in the middle really just depends on what it is that you want to do now what we did is we went ahead and we did some grinds to show you the three most popular popular grinds you're probably going to use with this machine the reason that we did that is that anytime that you're gonna go to grinding a different coarseness of coffee you're gonna get a little bit of your previous grind in there so what we've done is we just gone ahead and ground a few different ones right here so here's an espresso grind and you can see how you know this is almost like powder which is awesome so this is perfect for an espresso machine when you're making espresso it's really important that you have an incredibly thin grind of coffee and this is almost like powder this is perfect for espresso and I've really never seen an at-home machine do that first press oh here's filter which of course you've already seen with what I ground right here but here's some more kind of course not incredibly you know looks like a lot of coffee you might buy pre ground in a can and here's our course for French press now the cool thing about this is that it's very hard to get pre coffee that's already ground for a French press you can't really buy it in a can very often you have to make it yourself you have to grind it which means going to the store and all this kind of stuff and using their machine and it might still not be right remember those machines that stores are used by literally hundreds of people a day this machine you're gonna be the only one using it hopefully right so you get like a perfect French press grind right here it's nice it's course it's gonna work really well for when you pour that hot water in and you do your French press in your final coffee press that you're going to be doing so there you go you can see all these different grinds that we can do and of course you can customize this based on all the different settings that you have on the machine something I really dig about this machine as I say I haven't seen a lot of at home ones that have the range of this it's relatively cheap to only about 90 bucks give or take and that's pretty that's incredibly awesome because if you buy a really if you want to get this range of coffee grinding capabilities you're gonna spend a lot more money so really awesome machine I highly recommend it I think it's really cool we will make some coffee with this in some future videos so check out our other videos for making coffee using just this machine and one of our great single serve machines that we talk about check us out on aromacup.com of course for a lot more great videos and tips on awesome gadgets like the Bistro electronic coffee grinder from Bodom and other great single store machines i'm brian your host here in our virtual coffee shop from aroma cup.com thank you guys so much for watching and please check out our other videos have a great day and enjoy your cup", "b4mjW0qliIQ": "ah okay everybody now this is a bit of an unusual video for this thing we normally we're doing vlogs and no bike stuff but today I had a video for you guys that's why I'm will grow because I've been doing bike stuff I'm not gonna make too many spoilers but it does involve this trusty angle grinder you know I'm not gonna say I'm not gonna say anything else yeah but the reason we're doing it were view video on this angle grinder is because well it's because my drill that I'm using on the other video try not to eat too much it died and it's fully dead and I ain't gonna be able to complete the rest of it until the next day tomorrow so yeah that's that I just can't make the video until tomorrow so tomorrow for me in two days time it'll be out for you tomorrow it'll be out today you're getting there's a review video it's not very it's not very interesting I'll be honest and it's probably not what you're gonna be into but I'm making at least I'm giving you something you know I could just give you no content but I'm not like that so let's just get on with the review I have got a black and decker angle grinder it's a 115 millimeter disc I think it's 210 210 watts no no no no no it's not seven 710 watt 210 210 though is wattage 710 I used it today as I said even though I did kind with it I'm using the grinding disc because I don't have any cutting discs and it only came with grinding discs now this exact winder when you get it from the box I'd say I'd give it a solid 8 out of 10 you know it cost me UK UK price 35 pounds for this grinder and that comes with obviously the grinder itself to different changeable guards comes with five grinding discs for for metal one for brick which is pretty good to be honest you know normally when you buy an angle grinder they don't give you anything to give you the grind and that's it but came with the grip oh and the tool to UM to do this up but um yeah for regard to get better so that they ever ten just because it came with so much stuff and stuff the reason why I wouldn't give it a solid ten was generally because it costs right five pounds and I don't know how well I'm not a angle grinding expert so I don't know what's good what's bad I know Black and Decker pretty good make but I know for forty five pounds it does make you a bit wary about forwards faults and stuff but I'll give it a bit of a run down you can tell I've used it because of the picture it's come off but um yeah it's a bit of information about it but no I was wrong it's - 500 - 200 250 but there's what the information needs you know but you know for like buying it I'd say eight at ten because it could have came with a mixture of cutting discs and grinding discs not just all grinding this even though the name has an angle grinder it kind of makes sense but um that's just personal with me being a bit of a nitpick but um working wise and like production I'd give it a ten you know it works outstanding for angle grinder no matter what price it was it works incredibly well you know it does it's just a very work we're working it quite lightweight you know it's not too heavy you know it's got the grips you know it's really really easy to hold really easy to actually like do any work with it looks its presentation it looks nice I know I'd say ten out of ten for like production and usage but yeah where else can I say you know work so well you know if what I recommend is grind a hundred percent I would recommend this for the price it's really good for the price so if a fight five pounds that's very very good for angle grinder but if you want to get something that you know is i 100% liable and everything else you want it to be perfect i would up your budget and go for something that's a bit more pricey just because I never see you but you bought you get what you pay for and you be honest but no yeah this is I think this is good it's a good grinder did what we need to do really excited to show you this to show you next video but wait in waiting so if I should have made sure it's fully charged before we even started the video but the person that I lent it to you know they should have charged it when they given it back to me even though I told him I needed to use it you know they should have already chose it for me you know it's a bit of you know it's a bit of it Fulton boyfriend's you know I should have made sure it was charged honestly if you let someone borrow your tools you kind of expect them just to the courtesy you know of you letting them use your tools for them to at least give it to you back to you fully charged you know that's what I would do to someone anyway but no keep into the angle grinder on the review what give it give it a ten would recommend it's a very good grinder next video you'll get to see in action so then you could definitely look for yourself um what do you think about it but for me personally I think this is very good I definitely recommend it if you want to get something you if you want to buy something you want you need to angle grind you know you need to do it ASAP you need to buy an angle grinder honey percent recommend I was looking and searching for angle grinders so I could get my bike fixed and the cheapest I found was fifteen pounds and I didn't really want to go down to fifteen pounds because I felt that was a bit sketchy and you know that's a bit you know you're kind of asking for danger right there and this was the cheapest one I found that looked good that had all the cool stuff with it like the grip and the guards too changeable guards and five five discs you know that will came in the price of 35 pounds so it's perfect if you need to buy something there and then that's good that's lasting it's got very thick cable very good heavy duty it feels good you know it's very very good growing to grinder where it's worked very well grinded through anything it was brilliant so yeah I won't make this thing too long because I'm literally reviewing a good angle grinder I don't really want you to be sat there for a long time just staring angrily and me talking so I'll end it here and then the video here at least you have some sort of content kind of like an update on what's going on but no it's erm it's a black and decker angle grinder 15 no discs well could you ask for brilliant product for me recommend 10 at 10 would do again goodbye again I send for this video hope you enjoyed I hope you were looking forward to next video because that is like a big excitement video and I'm really really excited to get that one out to you because it's the first time I've done anything like angle grinder your stuff so yeah be excited for next video for this one the peace and life of zero I'm out mix what make sure before you go subscribe", "WSfSnqITv2c": "I want to show you how to reuse one of these things it's a pepper grinder which you can buy from the supermarket's now these things only made to be used once you know and I want to reuse these and it's a bit of a waste you know just buying it and throwing it away so if you you know you don't want to have a hernia row or pop a vein trying to pop this plastic cap off because it's pretty tough I want to show you a method how I easily open it no you know there's some videos out there on YouTube telling you how to open it by drilling into it or putting it in microwave you need to cannibalize it I'll show you you know pretty easy waited so what you want to do is make sure it's pretty much empty you know pop the pop the cap off because I want to get a leveled surface so I put on to the ball right so fill this ball up here with some some water which I just boiled I'm going to submerge it to it and I'm going to let it sit there for about say 10 minutes and then hopefully the cap plastic cap is going to be you know soft enough for me to just slowly pop it right off and then we can reuse it alright so we've left this for about 10 minutes should be enough time and soften up the plastic hopefully we can just pop the cap right off easily so hole like this plan bit of pressure bag just pops right up just like that ready to go in alright thanks for watching the video", "zYJCLzGaaB8": "ergo his change in the fit RV I'm pretty excited today because the weather is nice and Steph said I could go outside and play with my group tank it's a black tank simulator they said it was math they said it couldn't be done but I did I build a black tank simulator why in the heck would I do that well I'll tell you um the standard RV advice is to not empty your tanks until they're three-quarters full and the reason for that is so that you get a good rush of fluid and it carries all the stuff out of your tanks and that's always made sense to me that's always been what I've done at the same time there are a number of people that use other products like a macerator pump or something called the sewer solution then nd through a one inch hose now you don't have to admit at the head of your class in fluid mechanics to realize that this is going to empty a tank a heck of a lot quicker than this so it seems that the sewer solution or mass Raider pump is sort of at odds with the traditional RV advice so I just had to know what was going on in the tank that's why I built black kid simulator now I could have tried to use something like like this to see in the light tank while it was emptying this is a remote probe camera I've got but I just couldn't bring myself to put it in the black tank especially all those full because you know it's mine so I built the white tank simulator and today we are going to use it to test the silver solution from Volterra so some particulars on the black tank simulator it's basically a box it's made out of quarter-inch acrylic that I've solved and welded together my first time actually solvent welding anything so I'm pretty pleased it actually worked I've also got a standard three-inch ABS pipe for the outlet like we've all seen on our RVs at the end of this I have an attachment for a standard hour V blade valve which attaches some basic to twist on so it just attaches like that okay now the tank is 23 and a half inches long by 17 inches wide by 11 and a half inches deep there's about 231 cubic-inch in the gallon this is just under 4,600 so it's like nineteen point nine gallons the outlet tube is three inches in diameter and it's a twelve and a half inches long so that's like another point four gallons all of which is very long drawn out way of me saying this is about a 20 gallon tank so that's what we're going to be working with a couple other notes on the tank a real RB black tank doesn't have right angled corners um the only place that this is really going to matter for this experiment is right over here towards the outlet so compensate for this I've put an enormous glob of silicone on this part of the tank it sort of formed it into a round and that will help guide things towards the outlet the other thing to note about the RV black tank is a real RV black plate is sort of sloped towards the outlet now I actually went out and measured the slope of our RV black tank it found out that it was about four degrees so you take four degrees the sine of that times twenty-three and a half inches all of which is a way of using trigonometry to say is basically I need to do that this is going to give me about a four degree slope which is the same as what I've got out in the RV and that's how we're going to test the black tank so having a black tape simulator is great at all but I've got to have something to put in it um believe it or not I first actually called the laboratory at the local wastewater treatment facility and I don't know what I was hoping that they'd have some sort of standard proving a bag but they don't they're only advice to me was to keep it to less than six percent solids so beyond that I was on my own uh without getting too graphic I wanted to come up with something to simulate what was in the black tank and so I reasoned it was made out of the following kinds of stuff um first a lot of water next is going to be stuff that floats and then some stuff that doesn't float and then some stuff that's broken up and some toilet paper so I made a standard solution out of mostly household food products that I'm going to use for each of the runs that you're about to see here's what's in it there's a one cup of peanut butter one cup of shortening four cups of cornmeal and then I mix that up with some food coloring divide it in half half of that will sink to the other half I add two cups of rice krispies and that half will float I've put an unnatural pink food coloring in there and then to the tank itself I'm going to add a can of mixed vegetables and one cup of instant mashed potato flakes I'm also going to add 40 sheets of RV toilet tissue that I cut into half inch strips and then to help break things up I went at it with a paint mixer for 30 seconds on low speed and 30 seconds on okay so here we are I'm not sure what the inside the black tank really looks like but this is pretty gross so we're just going to go with it we've got the standard mixture stuff in the tank we've got the tank slope towards the outlet I've got the sewer hose connected to my clean-out here at the house and we're going to time it and so here here goes nothing and fire in the hole and she's off the funny thing is it smells like peanut butter and now we've just slowed down to a trickle so let's take a look and see what's in the tank so altogether that took about a minute and here's what we've got in the tank as you can see all the big stuff made it out and especially the stuff that was floating but there's just this sludge that remains in the bottom of the tank a little bit more towards the top I expected to see a lot of stuff down here in this area but there's really not a lot there it's mostly left high and dry back over here so now I'm just going to clean it out and then we'll try it again with the sewer solution so I've refilled the tank with the standard mixture of disgusting stuff and I'm ready to test the sewer solution now the sewer solution uses a high-pressure jet of water it turns down like that you sort of break up the waste and pump it through a flexible 1 inch hose now according to Volterra you can actually use this to pump up to a hundred feet using PVC pipe or up three feet vertically and you really couldn't do that with a three inch hose but I'm not going to test those today what we're really interested in is how much residue this is going to leave in the tank now they do say that in order to pump uphill or long distances you need to have water pressure of at least 25 psi I'm not going to test those but I still want to make sure I've got adequate water pressure so we're going to do is we're going to hook up my Watts water pressure meter and see what kind of pressure we've got well according to this we've got about a hundred and eighteen psi which should be more than adequate to get the job done and that's at the end of a 75 foot hose so we're going to go ahead and test got the backflow preventer hooked up this hose is always leaked got that hooked into the sewer solution at the nozzle pointed down we're going to turn it on so we get some water flowing there we go now I don't know if you can see there's a jet of water it's running down the hose so with that here we go oh I need to be able to be ready to time it go now the end here is where you're going to see stuff happening you can see stuff getting sucked into the sewer solution and pump down although rather obviously it's not emptying as quickly as a standard 3 inch hose so we're about 40 seconds into this and it's maybe a third of the way done and as you can see there's a lot of stuff still up top I'm wondering how that's going to get in there you can see the side okay so it's been about two and a half minutes and we're going to call that good for now so let's have a look there's a quite a bit more residue in the tank and some things that we're floating in the tanks before didn't quite make it out right I expected to see a lot more stuff up in this area again but there's really not there's quite a bit more residue left in the tank than there was with the three inch hose although there's not much sticking to the sides of the tank which I might have expected okay so we've got a little bit more stuff left in the tank especially the larger floating stuff with the sewer solution than we did with the three inch hose but there's a an extra step you can do with the sewer solution to actually flush out your tank and I'm going to show that next but first if you're in front of me in line at the dump station don't do this because I'm going to get really annoyed with you and it's going to take a while and I won't be the only one get annoyed with you but you can flush the tank with the sewer solution I'm going to do that they do plainly admit that the effectiveness of the tank flushing is going to depend on your plumbing configuration and right here we've got pretty much the ideal setup for that it's just a straight shot right back into the tank so I'm going to basically just turn the nozzle here so that it's pointing back up the tank turn the water back on and under the time how long it takes to fill this 20 gallon tank and go well alright well that's that's pretty effective yikes so yeah after getting doused with fake big sewage I'm going to put a lid on it kind of like that now we're going to flush the tank and go as you can see that's doing a pretty good job of fleshing out the tank now one thing you're going to want to keep in mind when you're using this to flush your tank is you're going to want to have someone inside monitoring your tank levels to make sure you don't over fill the tank if your plumbing configuration was a little different than what we've got here it might be that the water got in a lot faster than it got out and you might wind up over filling the tank they weren't against this in the instructions so just something to keep an eye on we're going to let this go another couple minutes and then flushing it that's about five minutes of flushing so now we're going to go and set it back to dump all right so I'm going to call that done so let's have a look we've got actually when all is said and done we've got quite a bit less stuff in the tank than we did with the with the standard dump hose that wasn't the case when we just dumped it but by the time we ran a flush it's quite a bit cleaner so it's the next day I've had a chance to think about it to look over some of the footage and to draw some conclusions about what we saw and the first conclusion I drew is holy cow is my water pressure really 120 psi I didn't believe it um so I went and took the same water pressure meter and at the same time of day retested it and it came out again to 120 psi so then I still didn't believe it I took another water pressure meter that was actually hooked up to our pressure regulator and hooked it up as well and they moved into andum so yes I really do have 120 psi worth of water pressure and my next call as soon as I'm done here is to a plumber uh so conclusions on the sewer solution I guess the first one is as expected it takes longer to empty the tank with the sewer solution than it does with a standard 3 inch hose it took 1 minute thereabouts with the three inch hose with the sewer solution it took two-and-a-half minutes that's not unusual to smaller hose I think we'd all expect that now I want to show you some pictures of what the inside of the tank look like and the first one we're going to look at is this one here or I haven't get the tank with the 3 inch hose so what you can see is that a lot of material that sank to the bottom of the tank tended to get left behind floating material got sucked right out of there so the next picture I'm going to show you is one of the bottom of the tank after using the sewer solution but just dumping and there's maybe the same amount of tank sludge left in the bottom but you can also see that some of the stuff that was floating got left behind didn't get sucked out and then the next picture I'm going to show you is a picture of the bottom of the tank after using the sewer solution and flushing and obviously here there's no comparison at all this is far and away cleaner than any of the other pictures so we've got that um something else that I found out that I didn't expect had to do with the sides of the tank and I'm going to show you some pictures so you'll see what I mean so this first picture is one of the sides of the tank after dumping with the three inch hose and you can see I've got this greasy pink film slime all over the sides of the tank now I'm going to show you a picture of after just dumping not flushing but just dumping with the sewer solution and the sides of the tank here are actually much much cleaner this is the opposite of what I expected I really expected there would be stuff left sticking to the sides of the tank when using the sewer solution and that didn't happen at all um so you can draw your own conclusions you know based on what you saw but here's sort of the bottom line for me um we move frequently we boondock a lot without hook ups you know and I tend to find myself sort of dumping and running it public dump stations and in those situations I really can't see myself using the sewer solution very much because you need a solid source of water and you need the time in order to dump it and then to flush out the tanks to get really the kind of result you're going to want so maybe while we're on the road I'm really not seeing us using the sewer solution very much but if you're the kind of RV or who find yourself at you know full-service hookups and you've got the time and the water pressure and exclusive use of a sewer connection to yourself absolutely by all means go for it use the sewer solution you're going to get a fabulous rinse and clean out of that tank um and I guess the third thing is even though I don't see us using the sewer solution on the road because we have a class-b right so I can't take two different ways to dump the tank but I act absolutely do see us using the sewer solution once we get home and I've got my insanely high 120 psi worth of water pressure and my sewer clean-out to use to dump the tank I'm going to get it fabulously clean and I'm going to know that the RV is ready to go the next time we head out on an adventure so that's sort of it for for now if you've got any questions or comments on what you saw please leave them on our website and I'm going to put a link at the end of the video so you can get there and I'll try to get back to you the other thing is if I really want these experiments to get better over time so if you've got suggestions on how I can improve them please leave me those - I'm all ears and I guess the last thing is if you've got something you want to see me test in the black tank simulator let me know that - because I've got lady peanut butter in cornmeal that that's all for now bye look ma I'm making poop on the Internet you always knew I do good", "lVXaYodWR1I": "today I want to make a review about Turkish grinder here is our grinder it's completely made in Turkey completely metal and it's 4.2 inches and it can greens almost everything pepper white pepper black pepper there is no plastic no any other metal and first of all I want to dis assemble this grinder to show you all the tails so for the beginning we should open the top screen over here then handle and the down screen to open down screen you should open the bowl at first and push here then okay now with this assemble all the parts and this is the mechanism the blades metal blades also inside of it so the parts are body plates tongue screams handle and also bowl so you can use it also without model you can directly grind it to your meal or you use the bowl then you can put your spices to your meal here we assemble again so easy I am putting the screw again then handle then top screen and also I want to show you something more about this calendar again you see this screen it arranges the size of your grid so if you type it's really hard it makes the spices fine if you open it a little bit it makes it course so first I will make it course and maybe medium level you right close now I will drink some pepper for you you actually blacked out the course now I felt it I closed as I told you before you can close or open I will open it because I want to show you directly how this grinder is useful and really fast you can see it's medium-sized it's not so close not so fine it's really good and let's arrange the top screw to make it finer here as I showed you before I'm typing the screen and closing it again and putting some Perkins flight applicants again no it's like a dust", "iT5QX9rWTFQ": "[Music] hi guys this is the black and decker 8 cup food processor it is a 450 watt motor stainless steel chopping blade and a reversible slicing and shredding disc it's easy to use with just two buttons on and off and pulse the machine won't start until you lock the lid in place we'll make a coleslaw to show you how the shredding side of the blade does and slice some cucumbers we'll also make a fresh tomato salsa to show you how the chopping blade works we're gonna slice the cucumber using the slicing blade first we put the shaft in slicing blade goes on top then we put the cover on we don't lock the cover the machine's not going to start as you saw when I locked the cover the Machine unexpectedly turned on I didn't know that the machine was on the off and pulse our one button they should actually be two separate buttons and there's no indicator or light to tell me that if the machine is on or off this cucumber is slim and will fit into the feeder hole my second cucumber is a little bit fatter around the edge and gets stuck in the tube so I had to cut it in half ok I'm a little afraid to use this machine but I'm gonna brave it and slice this cucumber okay let's see how well this sliced it did a decent job you can see their slice pretty thinly so I've reversed this disc and now it's on the shredding side the tube will fit about three medium carrots so you see the carrots are pretty nicely shredded so I cut the cabbage into about 1 inch thick slices because that's what's going to fit into the feed tube so let's shred the cabbage so you can see on top of the blade there's big pieces of cabbage if you keep pulsing it might chop it into smaller pieces but there's just way too many big pieces right there the cabbage inside the bowl is it's shredded pretty decently so we're gonna make a fresh salsa using the chopping blade I've cut the plum tomatoes in half I've got 3 plum tomatoes squeeze a little lemon juice in here just one chili and I've chopped an onion into big chunks I'm gonna put the feet pusher in because I don't want the sauce at a jump all over me and we're gonna pause the salsa after a couple of pulses it did a decent job of making the salsa we liked the size of the Black and Decker the eighth cup work Bowl holds a good amount of vegetables and the whole unit is compact and lightweight at about six pounds and you could leave it on your countertop this is probably one of the shortest chords we've seen so it's inconvenient and as you heard the machine was very noisy we don't like the buttons because the user can't tell when the machine is offer on the Black & Decker does an average job of slicing shredding and chopping if you're willing to live with the flaws for under $40 it's not a bad Buy", "wlTv2odV0bU": "I'm not sure other than Amazon or like maybe your local smoke shop where you can pick this up it's like I said they're not they don't have a website I haven't found them on histogram like I looked all over before this videos [Music] hey what's going on everybody my name's Craig aka snoop kitty cat drizzle but a lot of people just call me cliff and on this channel we smoke we talk about we broads and just kind of chill that sounds like something you'd be into hit that subscribe button is right around this area right now and in today's episode we're talking about grinders specifically my favorite grinder that I use for like blunts it's good for bowls and bongs - you're not going probably unusual for joints honestly with joints you want to get that kind of finer grind but we'll get into all that [ __ ] in a [ __ ] second what am i doing let's get a slow-mo light up in this [ __ ] I rolled up a nice long Duchy [ __ ] time honestly but last video were talking about like the whole history Philadelphia really kind of getting into my nostalgia and [ __ ] from back in the day and like this is what I grew up along I'm like when I started smoking it was all about [ __ ] Dutchess and Phillies I don't even think they [ __ ] make Phillies anymore but Dutch time it's [ __ ] spark cheers [ __ ] [Music] all right so I was down at my local smoke shop like years ago right and I was in the market for a binder I already had one but honestly you know how like when you roll like blunts or smoke bombs or bonds honestly you don't want let your superfine grind wonder weave like that's really like more just for like papers and [ __ ] so burns even well like when you're smoking like a Dutch or a rat or anything like that you kind of want like a coarser grind and I'll show you what the [ __ ] I mean but I was there on a my little smoke shop and I saw this and I was like that's a pretty dope looking grinder it's my favorite [ __ ] color green by the homeys over at grinders and [ __ ] and it's pretty [ __ ] dude I tried to find them one line like they're not on Instagram they're not on like they want a [ __ ] website so you can pick them up on Amazon I kind of forgot how much they run for cuz I bought this so [ __ ] long ago but I cleaned it out and there's some very dope [ __ ] behind this [ __ ] grinder so basically I some grinders especially like if you get cheaper ones you notice like sometimes the teeth like in my other grinder that I use a lot this mr. garner kind of dirty sorry but it has like teeth on the inside right most grinders [ __ ] do you're probably used to this the groove grinder does not it actually just has these I cleaned it I can get real good for the [ __ ] video the group grinder actually has these grooves that are just like kinda [ __ ] sharp they're not like sharply they can't cut you or nothing like that but it literally just like kind of grinds your weed and it's just like magnets and [ __ ] but you won't like sure if you shake it hard enough you can get the pop top to pop off like it's held together with really good magnets it's got a nice [ __ ] chamber inside of it I haven't cleaned that part I'm sorry I mean I usually don't and then of course you got your Keith catcher at the bottom got a little bit Keith in there but it really does give you like a coarser grind which is like perfect for wraps and like bowls and [ __ ] like that because you know when you use like they really like fine grinder like this which is perfect for like and [ __ ] don't get me wrong I use the [ __ ] almost every [ __ ] day as you can see the [ __ ] paint has started coming off that [ __ ] even though this is a pretty high-end [ __ ] company I respect a better working ship the group rounders completely like metallic paint like it hasn't [ __ ] [ __ ] I use the [ __ ] on [ __ ] lot and like the paints number one the logos never come off the top it's always fade in great shape and it's super [ __ ] easy to clean as you can see and it's [ __ ] great because it does it leaves the we like a little bit [ __ ] chunkier which is like perfect when you're like rolling Duchess and [ __ ] like that I've already said this a bunch of times and I apologize I'm actually gonna like grind up a little bit of tree in this and then I'm gonna grind up a little bit of tree in this and I'll like show you the difference on the train itself be right back alright so I'm actually just gonna [ __ ] show you because I feel like that I'll be [ __ ] you so now you take some tree if I'm gonna pop that [ __ ] in there just like whatever you just those little cap one here which is [ __ ] doop because there's no [ __ ] TV and you just [ __ ] kind of grind that [ __ ] the [ __ ] to him it's like just like any other [ __ ] grinder obviously you use but this doesn't have teeth so it's super easy to get that [ __ ] like just right in there and looking like this right and once you're done these are weed is good like my tableview real quick alright as you can see like this is the tree that I used with the regular diner with this guy like the joint [ __ ] and this is the [ __ ] that I used with the groove and you see how it gets a little bit chunkier it's got like it's got like bigger pieces in that [ __ ] like I'm trying to tell you but let's get back into it alright there we go [ __ ] zoom going y'all a little bit let's get this light back over here it's like that's what I mean it leaves them a little trucker but that's what you want especially when you're rolling like Dutchess and [ __ ] cuz it makes that airflow better and it make sure it doesn't burn weird I said that but it does for some reason when you're some like Duchess or like backwoods and [ __ ] like that or raps like I've noticed personally if you like grind the wheat up like really finely sometimes that [ __ ] has like a tendency to boat or like it just like gets sometimes it gets like too tight like you could accidentally roll that [ __ ] like too tight and it's just like hard to it but like with the groove rider it leaves it like that perfect amount of [ __ ] chunkiness you know what I mean and I never really like back in the day when I first started smoking and not even like when I first started smoking but for like a good [ __ ] chunk of like my smoker life I've never even used grinders like at all for real like I always used to say God gave me grinders and they're right the [ __ ] here you know what I'm saying but when I got this like I retired my [ __ ] hands this thing [ __ ] saved my [ __ ] hands from smelling like [ __ ] tree and being sticky all the [ __ ] time even though it's not really a bad thing so yeah obviously this is gonna be a pretty quick video because I just wanted to show you all that [ __ ] cool burger I'm not sure other than Amazon or like maybe your local smoke shop where you can pick this up it's like I said they're not they don't have a website I haven't found them on Instagram like I looked all over like before this video started I got checked all over you can like fondling with you like hashtag grooved rynders but it's not them it's more just like pictures of groove rounders on Instagram and like very professional [ __ ] looking photos but I say for not having a [ __ ] company out there but um you guys enjoyed it I was enjoying being here I'm [ __ ] just showing what y'all showing you cool things and we got a couple big videos in the way I know we got like daily high club supposed to get here like any [ __ ] day now so we'll probably have that for you by Friday and I hope everyone's just like hit me up in the [ __ ] comments especially if you're new make sure you like share and especially if you're new if you're not new and you haven't subscribed make sure you [ __ ] do that [ __ ] I'll see y'all [ __ ] later hey what have you taken a few marijuana", "mkzB3G78zIk": "do this [Music] hey it's Evan with black rifle coffee we're gonna go through this snow-peak pour-over device we actually went through I don't know four iterations trying to name this so that that was the best thing that we came up with the Snow Peak pour-over device we know you guys are going to be getting out this summer we want to make sure that everybody has the knowledge that they need in order to get out and make the coffee that they want preferably black rifle coffee but anything but [ __ ] coffee that'll suffice so Snow Peak relatively lightweight its metal seems fairly substantial as far as your not gonna be able to break it it's lightweight you can slide it into your backpack your rucksack whatever that might be royal excuse me it's [ __ ] pale el mm so what are we talking about Snow Peak alright let's know peak pour over device relatively easy just slide it into a backpack lightweight throw it on your cup not not a lot to it you know I mean filters coffee condoms that's adwin everybody handsome handsome devil looks a lot like me that's why I like him around it's like looking into a mirror so standard paper filter throw it in there get I mean it sounds so cheesy when people like get 16 grams of black raffle coffee I don't know get 16 grams of good coffee our coffee is pretty good you should buy it but anything but garbage coffee 16 grams you can use your arrow screw your arrow press scooper run it through a hand grinder what do you think your grind needs to be medium medium so you got coarse over here on the right which there's absolutely no way that you'll know that then you got really fine over here which is like table salt so think about course is what's an actual size except of course of course yeah like big pepper flakes yeah a big pepper flakes and then you've got really fine like table salt land somewhere in the middle 16 grams of coffee throw it in here run hot water through it what's hot water so let's define hot water bring it to a boil let it sit for 10-15 seconds and then push it through something interesting about a pour over as you start center and never work the edges of your paper and the reason that you never work the edges of your paper is you don't want the water to saturate and then it to pour around the filter and into the cup you want the coffee to do that job so snow-peak pour over to vice is what we've named it seems like it's a pretty good device we'll try it out in the next couple days tell you guys what we really think that it's a pour over so at the end of the day it's just a lightweight foldable polar / great piece of gear [Music]", "rUdHTbgwCSM": "yes this is a grinder what's going on if you just now tuning in we pakalolo 500 joints how voice we've shown you guys the process I was gonna do about myself that I figure I just had some ups but there's a thing here doing it with me I read the name for the album Drive of the album's dropping this year it should come out I'm thinking March that's when I'm set to release it in March if everything goes right and that's what it's about but I always got the music done and I'm always working on new music I still think about my [ __ ] because I never stopped get busy finding big eyes brighter here and boom it really doesn't look like crazy for right at home there you go BAM industrial-sized yeah this uh nice ray and his customers good sub rows of eight run a STL what else nap time yes that's exactly what this is brother it's a big-ass [ __ ] grinder that's crazy because never my whole life on with you [ __ ] like this for real they would awesome bag right here with amazing bad [Music] without loose I see your wife - booties here now we better take it and without Paul Martinez or Paula or whatever your name is I love you said where we dig KK KK if you live in a state where is recreational or

want to see this weed powder Brazil Turkey back for the show bigger than Turkey goes BAM so the reason is like that is because you got a do nug at a time like this ain't no low the low ass [ __ ] you got a do nug at a time or it's gonna get caught so this is like it's like a zip maybe that's like a zip right um Jeff do you think I was it I think flip down I should smells crazy to sacks it's a lot

of y'all some you know I get up I'm just getting up well not really this man o'clock there this is this robot worst possibilities her today I've been smelling for sure and all that [Music] responsibilities take care of our business yeah whatever you businesses for the day you take care of that man for real do you do what you gotta do P money even if you don't slow you should just always know somebody who does slow cuz they balance your life out like you know that'll be a pot smoker but to be around somebody with that out live our life and we do we help a lot of people in just by being who we are ain't that right Eric which is record Oakley what's up guys really really high and listen to Jimi Hendrix and then start our day okay so oh man this is good yeah this could take a

so much we just grinded super like perfectly so backward smoker's sorry does not include job I wish people would stop smoking backwards anyway it's just as bad for you and says it's horrible I don't blame my buddy on cuz a lot of y'all are new smoker so you've been smoking weed for years that's not the [ __ ] all right so now I'm gonna dump all of this into here it's a box part right a little box

Brazil a popular party a silly I know what", "yfa9q-K4BK0": "hey Walter Sorel's back with more tips for the knife maker today a belt grinder buyer's guide welcome to my knife maker belt grinder buyer's guide now let me just say this right from the get-go I'm not going to tell you what kind of belt grinder to buy this isn't a Consumer Reports type of valuation where I'm going to show you a whole bunch of different belt grinders and say these are the features of this one and know my objective here is to give you a sense of the features that are found on grinders generally the various types of grinders out there and give you the tools for evaluating and making a decision about buying one on your own you know I haven't tried every kind of grinder ever made and I for sure don't own them all so I'm going to use the grinder that I use day in and day out as kind of a reference to give you a sense of what's out there but it's just a reference point it's an excellent grinder but it's not the be-all and end-all it's just a starting point for you to do your own evaluation so today I'm going to focus on two by 72-inch grinders because that's what most knife makers use perfect world every belt grinder is going to cost you know two dollars and have infinite functionality but we don't live in a perfect world so in reality there's a general correlation between how much you spend and what you get let me start by talking about function the prime use of belt grinders is to grind steel a belt grinder needs to be robust enough to grind bevels and to grind the general outlines of knives hopefully without going through millions of belts and hopefully in a reasonably short period of time secondarily of course there used to grind handles wood pins pretty much every other material in the shop as I said I'll be using my bait or b3 here as a reference but every grinder is not built exactly the same quick terminology point manufacturers generally these machines as Sanders rather than grinders abrasives industry professionals use the term grinder for devices which use abrasive wheels rather than belts okay whatever knife makers call this a belt grinder you call it what you want the first thing to note is that grinders are typically referred to by the size of the belts that they use as I said before the most common knife making grinders use two by 72 belts now the most common belt grinder question I always get is can I use a 1 by 4 T 2 or a 4 by 4 T or 6 by whatever the short answer is yes but there are a few serious knife makers who use large 3 by 79 inch grinders or even larger industrial grinders but by far the vast majority use 2 by 72 s and almost no pros use anything smaller than a 2 by 72 the reason is that smaller belts wear out very quickly smaller machines don't grind as efficiently or accurately and really wide belts 4 inch 6 inch whatever they tend to not be set up in ways that work all that effectively for knife makers so my first recommendation is this if you ABS ABS absolutely can't afford a 2 by 72 then go with something like a 1 by 42 but recognize that if you're serious about knife making you'll rapidly want to move on to something bigger and more powerful and that smaller grinder is going to end up sitting in the corner collecting dust all right let's break down the components of the grinder to give you a sense of what you need the first component of the grinder is the frame itself the function of the frame obviously is just to hold all the pieces in alignment so the grinder actually functions fair enough that's easy but anytime you're working with high speed rotating tools made for removing metal you have to deal with something called chatter that's the tendency of work pieces to vibrate against the cutting or grinding surfaces of the device chatter makes it harder to work accurately the more massive and the more rigid the frame of your grinder the better it will operate now some grinders like this bader use a heavy casting for the frame some use large steel plates that are welded or bolted together some use what are basically small arms or attachments sprouting directly off of motors all things being equal the more mass in the frame the longer it will last and the better everything will stay in alignment moreover more mass equals more accuracy and less chatter on a machine like the Baader I can really bomb into it and it stays solid as a rock when you're evaluating the overall quality of a grinder recognize that a good frame is a heavy frame the next component of the grinder is the motor the best grinders typically have motors and the one to one and a half to even two horse range occasionally even more than that my bader has one and a half horse Leeson I don't typically bog it down but I've seen guys who really lean into their machines and so they like even bigger motors even more important than the horsepower is the overall quality of the motor grinders exist in a really nasty gritty wet environment show me a knife maker with a super clean grinder and I'll show you a guy who doesn't make many knives you will never be sorry about buying the best motor you can afford super cheap Chinese motors will work fine for a while high quality motors from name manufacturers like Leeson and Baldor will work better and last longer shielded bearings gasketing capacitors and so on her best anything that keeps all that grip from getting into the guts of the motor the motor on this faders lasted fifteen years of fairly heavy use with zero maintenance and still works as well as it did the day I bought it I guarantee you a bargain-basement motor wouldn't have made it this far typically grinders either run at one speed or use variable speed controls my machine is a single speed type so I run it at full speed all the time there's a smaller power wheel that you can put on very laborious leaf that will slow down the belt speed but it's such a pain in the neck to put on it's just not worth it as you can see I had to replace the switch one time the switch cost me about thirty bucks if it had been a variable speed that I'd have to replace it would have cost a whole lot more money so variable speeds add complexity and cost but when you're first learning to grind it's really really nice to have variable speeds point is if you have the budget you'll probably be happy you got a variable speed control for me it's not mission-critical you might find it really handy let me jump in here to mention that today's video is sponsored by combat abrasives there are a family-owned American manufacturer offering a wide selection of belts now I've used many of their belts including ceramic aluminum oxide and zirconium the prices are good and their focus is specifically on the knife making community they're basically monomakh side belts come in at a good price point and lasts a lot longer than some of the inexpensive belts that I've used in the past another thing that I've really been excited about is their ceramic belts for roughing in the 40 60 and 120 grit range their performance is very competitive with the big manufacturers at about half the price so check out their online shop by clicking the link in the description all belt grinders have a power wheel which transmits power from the motor to the belt and at least one additional wheel which might be called an idler and sometimes a tracking skill now anything running a belt needs to have some kind of tracking device without one the belts will run out of true and fall off the machine basically you have a crown wheel and you have to have some way of changing the axis angle a little bit and that'll move the belt back and forth across the working surface now different machines use quite different locations for the tracking and some even use the power wheel itself if you're tracking wheel gets loose or doesn't run true you'll be hard-pressed to run your grinder at all all of these arrangements can work fine if they're well executed there's not really a better or worse way of doing it the main point I'd make about tracking parts is the more robustly built they are the better they'll work and the longer they'll last if you get a chance to evaluate a grinder in person test the tracking and make sure that the tracking works correctly okay let's turn to the business end of the Machine an important point in evaluating grinders is how versatile they are some designs such as Grizzlies knife grinder and burr Kings two wheel grinders use a contact wheel as a power wheel the advantage of this is simplicity which in turn translates to less expense the disadvantages are that you can't easily change contact wheels and you don't gain the increased mass that comes from a heavy frame other designs like my Bader have replaceable grinding attachments which slide through a yoke or collar I don't want to get too deep in the weeds here because to a large degree these attachment schemes are what distinguished the various types of machines so there are near infinite variations on these some like the Baader and kmg have arms that slide on and off others like the burr King have somewhat more complex assemblies I'm sure there are many other approaches that I haven't seen basically all these detachable gizmos increase the complexity of the machine which in turn increased cost the advantages though are numerous first comes the side benefit of the increased mass resulting from a bigger frame second machines with various attachments are only limited by the number of attachments you can slap on them one more point to look at is grinding tables and tool rests basically a tool rest or work rest is small and a table is big so the bigger the tool rest the more table e it is and the smaller a table it is the more tool resti it is if you're planning on using grinding jigs a bigger table is important otherwise a little tool rest D type table like this will work fine almost any grinder can be modified to add a big table if you want but if you know going into your purchase that you want to use a jig for grinding bevels you might as well start off with something that will work perfectly for you right out of the box so my general point here is once you narrow down your choices study the attachment choices and options very carefully the options that are most important to you may not be important to me if there's a specific type of grinding hollow grinding for instance that you intend to do make sure the grinder offers the right size contact wheels if you're not sure exactly what you're going to be doing make sure that you have both some kind of flat grinding and some kind of hollow grinding capabilities on whatever machines you're looking at so I may be throwing around some terms that are mysterious to you so let's drill down on this issue a little bit there are three basic ways of introducing belts metal the first and simplest is what's known as a contact wheel the second is known as a platen which is generally a flat surface and the third is known as slack belt grinding in which the belt is unsupported probably the most common use of the belt grinder is to grind flat bevels in a blade for this you need a flat platen this Vader has a detachable armed with a platen that's this flat surface here if you grind on a contact wheel you'll necessarily translate the radius of the wheel to the radius of the grind what that means in practice is that grinding on a contact wheel results in a hollow ground bevel now if your machine uses the power wheel as a grinding wheel which is the case with most two wheel models then you can only grind on whatever radius that power wheel is if the machine comes with an eight-inch contact wheel you're stuck with an eight-inch grinding radius forever and ever third there's slack Gulf grinding in this case the belt is unsupported allowing you to grind a soft convex radius when you're buying your machine if it has detachable arms make sure you budget for all the attachments you'll need I recommend buying the largest diameter contact wheel available a very small wheel in the one-inch range and an arm with a flat platen I also recommend buying some sort of table or tool rest [Music] [Applause] okay let's summarize now look we all have to live within our means and you know nobody's budgets infinite but my first point is this by as much machine as you can afford at the time that I've made this video the best machines cost you know two to four grand and that's just for the base machine that's a lot of money but that money will buy you more durable and powerful motors more rigidity more mass more flexibility so if it's a question of waiting a few months to save for a better machine you will not be sorry you did it so beyond that my recommendation if it's within your budget is to go for machines with multiple attachments you know some machines offer interchangeability but you have to go you know use a lot of tools and diddling around where others have simple slide in slide out kind of attachments anything that requires a lot of fussing you're probably not going to use it at all so you might as well not have it my Bator and many others you know have fairly similar similar designs on those you can change arms in about 30 seconds so I would recommend studying the attachments the options available you know table surface grinding attachments jigs whatever and the means by which they attach to the grinder variable speed you know I went through a period where I really wished I had it but now I suspect I probably not use it much at all so I'm confident enough on the machine that I don't really need to run it slow but when you're learning to grind it's really handy to be able to run it a little slower also some materials tend to burn and grain wood for instance so it's handy there so if you have the budget by all means go for it where to buy now most of these machines can be purchased from knife making supply places that you can find easily enough online but some of them can be bought directly from the manufacturer the price is usually about the same so to me kind of six of one half dozen of the other so another point on price by and large these are very durable long life machines it's not uncommon for people to buy a machine like this thinking they're going to use it and then you know a couple years later they realize it's been sitting in their shop gathering dust that doesn't mean that it's it's a bad machine it may be as good as the day that they purchased it and you may be able to get it for a good discount all right here's the good news you know there are lots of good grinders out there good manufacturers good designs so do your research camp out on the forums study the features get recommendations from people you trust Google is your friend the more that you know the better off you are buy a good grinder and you'll have an incredibly durable and versatile machine that will serve you well for years and years [Music] thanks for watching guys if you feel like you got something out of

Japanese swords thanks and see you soon [Music]", "oJRSkBSb5S8": "hey guys welcome back to welcome so today we're going to do a comprehensive safety video on the proper use of a right angle grinder stick around [Music] what you're watching right now is a video on how not to use an angle grinder correctly everything I'm doing right now it's completely wrong nothing about it is right I highly recommend that you don't attempt to do work like this at home or in the shop what I do recommend is you hit pause drop down in the comments section and list as many safety violations as you can find in the video once you're done hit resume play and we'll be right here waiting for you to show you how to use it correctly alright so the angle grinder is typically used in a lot of work applications especially involved with welding so you're gonna be cutting you're gonna be grinding you're gonna be polishing you're gonna be blending so I mean it's it's a big part of your arsenal as a welder or as a fitter as a helper you're gonna be using this quite a bit aside from your welding machine this is probably one of the the number one items are gonna have your toolbox and you're gonna use it quite a bit at work right 80 percent your works into preparation 20% of its gonna actually be the welding so this is where the preparation comes in before we get into grinding one thing you definitely want to make sure of is that you're doing it in a safe place you want to make sure that the work area that you're gonna be utilizing the grinder in is free of solvents you don't have any chemicals laying around all your cardboard trash woods been picked up I don't know if you guys know this or not but when you use a grinding wheel you project sparks that are in excess of 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit okay that's hot enough to burn your skin melt paper set chemicals on fire so do some general housekeeping make sure you know your co-workers are out of the way wherever you're gonna be directing your sparks make sure that area is clean free of debris and you're ready to have you know you got a nice safe work area that you know you're gonna build it to do all your cutting and grinding work in and you're not gonna cause injury to yourself or someone else so before we get into that let's go ahead and talk about some of the proper protective equipment that we want to consider when we're gonna be using the grinder you want to have eight-inch work boots you know preferably steel toe I like steel toe you can do composite but if your company requires it you know use that but just make sure you have some other boots next up you want to make sure you have like denim or wool jeans I prefer denim that's just my choice again cotton shirts you want to stay away from anything that's synthetic so in any synthetic fibers because like I said before 1800 degree sparks you're gonna catch yourself on fire you're gonna muck closed your gloves whatever so make sure whatever equipment you have on underneath the regular clothing is fire retardant so natural fibers versus synthetics so think wools denims duck all that good stuff khaki next you want to you know we're gonna dress for the actual application so I have a welding jacket or an fr clothes I prefer a welding jacket because if you have a regular t-shirt on it's not going to provide enough coverage we'll get into it a little bit further but grinding wheels can actually you know get sucked up in your clothing so if you do have a long t-shirt on you want to make sure you tuck that in I like balding jackets because they provide a little bit more protection if something was to go wrong or the grinder was to wrap itself up in your clothing welding jackets are thicker than your regular t-shirt so it's gonna be able to stop that tool a lot faster for some reason something happens cover up your head man cover that Graper yours right especially if you're doing overhead grinding you want to keep that covered keep the sparks out anytime you're dealing with a grinder or any other power tool that's gonna make a lot of noise you're gonna want to wear some sort of hearing protection not only that it's gonna block sparks from getting in your ears today I actually have a head set of headphones in made by ISO Tunes and they meet the requirements of OSHA and NIOSH so they can actually be used in the workplace as hearing protectors as well cameraman's gonna put a link down in the description if you're interested in checking them out obviously we're gonna use safety glasses should be using safety glasses for everything you do in the shop and then a pair of good quality leather gloves now if you're thinking you know I don't wear gloves because I don't want to get them caught up in the grinder we're gonna teach you how to use the grinder the correct way and when you use it the correct way you have two hands on the grinder at all times right so you can't get your gloves caught in the grinder if they're nowhere near the disc while it's spinning right the next thing in addition to your safety glasses you want to make sure that you have a good quality face shield okay these should be rated does the eighty-seven point one or the 87 Plus through ANSI I have a beard guard on this one because I have a beard and most people ask me how do I keep from getting too burnt up use this piece of leather right here to keep keep this thing in pristine condition so make sure you have a good quality face shield now depending on the work environment you're going to be in there's different types of face shields available so general shop work where I have well-ventilated area and on to worry about overhead hazards this is a good face shield right you can get one just like this you want something that's gonna protect your face you have to wear safety glasses in addition to this right in addition to your face shield you want to make sure you have safety glasses next up we have one for you've got a little working out in the field this is one with a hardhat attachment or a hardhat halo so you put that on boom right we're all safety it up what I've done on this is I've actually put a magnet on here with some double-stick tape so if you're out in the field you're doing some overhead grinding all that grinding dust should collect in this area because once you lift this flap up here all that dust can then fall into your face a small breeze will blow it right in your eyes the next thing you know you're on your way to the optometrist to get that stuff removed you know what they have to happen so little tip throw a magnet on there right it's a neodymium or a rare earth magnet so it'll collect any of those dust particles you know built up on there you can blow it off alright so the next one we have this is a pepper systems afternoon this is your death and speaking we're currently crews again and out the do to 39,000 feet folks keep backing into the play so these are great if you're working in you know confined spaces you don't have good ventilation or you're generating a lot of grinding fumes if you're working on exotic metals like stainless or aluminum or titanium you don't want to be breathing that stuff in if you have to grind a lot of galvanized off this is what I would recommend probably this would be my preference over respirator for obvious reasons but this one is a pure flow by gentex and it was sent to us from frame safety so go ahead check those guys out thanks for sending this to us so we could have a visual aid for the video and then show show you guys how to use this system but this actually goes over your head it has AF our Cape that goes around there to protect your neck beard all that stuff nice little drawstring on there so you can keep everything nice and close and then tuck that up out of the way obviously and then you have full access you can open this up talk to your coworkers it has a filtration system in the back so it's you're getting purified air brought in to your welding hood so you don't have to worry about things fogging up with this because it keeps your head it's nice and cool do some demonstrations with this a little bit later in the video so now that we know to keep our work area clean we know what we're supposed to wear let's go ahead and talk about the grinding setup alright so let's talk about the actual grinder that we're gonna use the first thing you want to do when you pick this up you want to know what type of grinder it is so this is a four and a half inch angle grinder so anything that I'm doing that's the appropriate size wheel that I need to be putting on here in addition to that I want to check the housing in the head make sure there's no cracks nothing's exposed all the fasteners on here nothing's loose nothing's out of the ordinary the arbor lock works I want to make sure that the trigger mechanism works obviously I'm unplugged right now so I'm gonna test that and make sure that that's not locked by what they call the the trigger lock or the suicide switch okay again we've got some pictures at the end of the video and I want to stick around and check that out because some people decided to use the suicide lock you'll see go check it out we also want to go through and check out the cord that's on here ok the cable make sure there's no Nick's cuts frays anything exposed wires you don't want any of that because if I plug this into the power source and I touch the cord it's electrically hot I'm gonna get zapped in addition you wanted this is a three prong cord you want to make sure all the prongs are there okay so one thing to note if you can't take this thing and and just like whip it like a bull whip and it land in the X electrical outlet don't yank it out from back here whenever you unplug it you want to make sure that you unplug it from the end of the cable and that's how you should plug it in that's how that grounding cable or that grounding lead gets pulled out right so a lot of a lot of grinders are missing that because people just yank them when they're done at the end of the day and that pops out so once I'm sure that this thing is serviceable what I want to do is I want to start putting it together now there's a handle that comes with your grinder okay this is one of the items along with the garden that gets thrown out soon as somebody opens the box they pull the grinder out they throw the handle away throw the guard away they put a disc on there and go to work right wrong don't do that take the handle and mount it to the grinder okay next up this is a four and a half inch grinder so I'm going to make sure that I put a four and a half inch guard on here I don't want to put a five inch or 6 inch make sure you put the appropriate size guard on there all right every guard is gonna mount a little bit different so make sure you consult your manual for the specific piece of equipment to you owned to make sure you're mounting the guard on there properly okay there also a lot of these I like these because they have little quick locks on them so I can actually rotate the guard to where I need it to be and it'll it'll lock in place okay a little push button back there I can move it around whether I'm cutting or grinding I can select the appropriate orientation for this guard okay now that the guard is in place the only thing left as far as the setup or the the ferrule or the bushing and the locking nut I'm gonna hold off on these because depending on the type of wheel that you're gonna use you're gonna use a different type of nut and you're going to use a different side of the nut so we're gonna go in we're going to cover that next so depending on the type of material you'll be working on whether it's aluminum stainless steel or carbon steel you're going to want to make sure you pick the appropriate disk so these disks are designed specifically for aluminum cutting and grinding you don't want to use these on steel because they're just not going to last as long likewise I don't want to use a steel disk on aluminum because it's gonna tear it up in addition the aluminum is gonna clog the pores on the outside of this grinding wheel in addition to that if you have an aluminum soaked wheel you start grinding on heavy rust you're gonna create something called thermate that are made it's very similar to thermite it's highly flammable so you don't want to cause that that condition in your shop next thing we want to consider is what size wheel are we going to use we pick the size wheel based on the size of the grinder that we're going to use even though I can put a six-inch guard on this grinder because they're interchangeable I don't want to put a six inch wheel on this grinder and that's because this wheel is rated for ten thousand two hundred rpms now this grinder is kicking out eleven thousand rpms [Applause] [Music] what would be in a more appropriate selection is to choose a six inch grinder for this six inch wheel now this is a very versatile grinder because this is capable running four and a half five inch and six inch wheels because it's rated for 9,000 rpms and the nine thousand rpms doesn't exceed any of the speeds that I can use for any one of these discs so this one's ten thousand two hundred this one's thirteen thousand three hundred all these wheels have a higher rpm rating then this grinder is actually capable of putting out so it's gonna max out at 9,000 rpms any one of these wheels on here is gonna be safe to use if I do switch to a 5 or a four inch wheel I want to make sure that I reduce the size of my guard so I'm gonna use a five inch wheel I want to put a 5 inch guard on here and take that six inch off same thing with a four and a half I would actually take this four and a half inch guard put it on here then I can use that four and a half inch wheel this is probably one of the better grinders you can get not specifically this brand but this type of grinder that's capable of running the three different types of wheels versus one grinder that can only run four and a half great thing about this is it's much smaller it's compact easier to use lightweight so I mean choose what's going to work best for your shop in your application once I figured out the type of the size of the wheel that I'm going to use the type material going to be working on I want to figure out what type of wheel I need to use based on purpose what's the task at hand what job am i doing so if I want to do some like stock removal I'm gonna use this wheel right here it's a quarter inch thick wheel and it's meant for stock removal heavy grinding and I'm gonna use this at that 30-degree angle I don't want to use it on the edge because it doesn't have any reinforcement in here what its gonna do is it's gonna road back it's gonna chip you're gonna get chunks out of there and then you're gonna compromise the integrity of the wheel and then it could potentially come apart on you during use same thing with this flapper wheel okay if I'm going to prep material polish it up blend it any of those things I can go ahead and select as the flapper disc now when I use this I want to make sure that I maintain that thirty degree angle notice there's really no abrasive out here there's no reinforcement I don't have any anything there that's going to protect the edge of this wheel it's not meant to be used that way I don't want to go in and try to clean out a groove weld with this it's meant for flat 230 degrees that's where I want to try to keep that as the range I want to keep it in when I'm using that I want to try to keep it about that angle right there when I'm going through the material now if I do want to use edge grinding a cut off wheel is simply going to be too thin right I have reinforcement on the outside but I have no reinforcement here so I don't want to use a cut off wheel as a grinding wheel okay I can use the edge but this is a little too thin so if I wanted to grind out a root pass or remove a weld I'm actually gonna switch out and I'm gonna get an 8-inch wheel and it tells me right on the wheel then I can use it at a 90 degree angle so I can go in and I can cut into the material this way but I can also dress it up so I can use this at a 45 degree angle or 0 0 to 45 this way because this wheel is designed to have reinforcement and abrasive material on the edge as well as on the face of the disc so this would be a good option for that likewise when I get into rust removal and I want to use a wire wheel this cup here is great for cleaning up the surface but it's gonna be horrible trying to get into a groove that's not what it's designed for so keep this as flat as you can against the material now if I do want to get into a groove or a tight corner this is what I'm going to use and this is the edge of the the wheel that I want to put against the material it's gonna clean up a lot better that way and it's not meant to run at that 30-degree angle or in the flat position ok it's gonna start falling apart these things are going to become off-centered once it becomes off-centered it's gonna be unbalanced and then it's a hazard ok so keep some of those things in mind whenever you're picking out a wheel make sure you are using the appropriate wheel for the task at hand and we're actually going to show you exactly how to use each one of these wheels a little bit further in the video once we figure out the type of disc that we're going to be using the type of material that we're going to be cutting or grinding on once we select that wheel we want to check the wheel for serviceability so one thing we want to look at is if any of the wheels have ever been wet left out in the rain automatically throw them in the trash right destroy them get rid of them all so anytime you have rust on it so if you have a wire wheel or you have any of these feral or the any locking nuts that go on there if any of us caked over with oxidization because it's been left out get rid of them okay it's just not worth the hassle it's not worth your safety go through the cutoff wheel make sure there's no Nick's dings scratches or grooves in there so here's a prime example so this one was probably left on a grinder the grinder fell off the table and it chipped the side of the wheel now this whole disk is compromised doesn't mean stick in the grinder and like cut it until that part wears out here's what could happen just get rid of it now what I used to typically do is if I'd find a wheel that was that was pretty bad messed up I would go ahead and just break it get rid of it now I've prevented the next user from coming up and using that same thing with a hard rock you can beat these up with a hammer throw them in the trash but this one again this has been dinged up it was used improperly or you know got damaged during shipping or it's fell off the table and excessive amount of times whatever exterior this edge has been compromised okay I don't want to use that okay go ahead and get rid of that one throw that let's crash this guy right here just talking about wheels you know continuing on I'm missing some pads on here something happened to this the camera guy mistook this for his for a sandwich for lunch and chewed on it I don't know what happened here but I'm not gonna put this on a grinder that's gonna run about 9,000 to 11,000 rpms and try to use that because the structural integrity of it has been compromised so get rid of it if you have any doubts whether it's gonna be a good wheel or not trash it okay you're gonna thank me for it later same thing with a wire wheel obviously this thing has seen better days okay I'm not going to throw this on a grinder this is going into the trash it's it's all kinds of jacked up things aren't spaced out correctly I've got damage to some of the the twisted ends go ahead and get rid of it it's not worth risking you know even if it's the last one you got your gang box you know run out and get another one you know radio the boss man tell me you need some other stuff don't use it guys okay get rid of this stuff it's gonna hurt you alright let's talk about mounting these wheels up so as you know there's different types of wheels available so what I have right here is called a type 27 and it's a quarter inch wheel then I have your regular flapper wheel this already has a mounted nut in here so I'm actually not going to need any hardware to mount this or the wire wheel because they both have the mounted nuts the cutoff wheel however is called a type 1 cutoff wheel you'll notice it's flush on both sides whereas the type 27 has a depressed Center the press meeting is very sad now but on a serious note it has this raised portion on the wheel whereas the type 1 is completely flat on both so because of that we're gonna have two different types of mounting that we're gonna do with this so let's go ahead and start off with a quarter inch wheel we're going to start off with our backing flange or ferrule and you'll notice that it has straight edges on two of the sides also you'll notice on the arbor I have two flat sides here I'm going to pair these up and put the flat sides together so that that wash or that ferrule locks into that Arbor next I'll place the wheel on top of it and make sure the wheel is sitting center of that ferrule and then I'm going to put the top nut on here now you'll notice on the top nut it has a edge that has a flare on it this is a raised edge right here this is the side that I'm going to put up against the wheel and I know that because it says quarter-inch wheel this side against wheel so I'm gonna flip it over and I'll screw it down that way this ensures that the wheel is locked in and as secure as it can be now I'm gonna go ahead and push the button on the back to lock the arbor in place and spin the wheel until it's locked you can follow this up with a grinder wrench that should come with your grinder you don't want to crank down on it just put a little bit of snug in there about a quarter turn and you should be good to go now to her and notice the wheel sits behind the guard sits on the inside that's where you want it we'll go ahead and do the reverse to take this apart or take this back off now let's go ahead and attempt to mount the wire wheel so because it has this nut already molded into it from the factory if I were to put this up against that ferrule you'll notice that the wire brush is slightly exposed outside the guard I don't want that that guard is supposed to protect me so what I'm gonna do very carefully cuz wire wheels bite I'm gonna take that ferrule off of the back now I can put that same wheel back on and notice it sets inside the guard I also have full thread engagement with that Arbor same thing with the zerk wheel we're gonna mount that without that ferrule on the back so these are pretty simple so if they have a nut on the back of them take the ferrule completely out of the system drop them in your pockets don't lose them now let's move on to the cutting wheel now because this is a type 1 wheel OSHA is now mandating that we should be using a type 1 guard which is enclosed on two sides as well as the type 1 nut now notice our type 1 ferrule notice this ferrule has much thicker than the ferrule we had been using see it's a lot thicker than the previous one that's going to offset that so that wheels not so close to the guard so what we're gonna do is we're gonna change the guard out first this one actually you have to swap this out with a screwdriver so I'm gonna loosen that nut or loosen that bolt spin the guard take that one off and then put the new guard on top once it's in place simply lock it down okay now this guards ready to go I'll then take the type 1 ferrule set it right on make sure it locks into place take the type 1 cutting wheel put it to the inside and then follow this back up with a nut now notice I'm going to use the opposite side of the nut this time this side is completely flushed it doesn't have that raised Center that I need to deal with so I'm going to put the flush side up against the wheel push the the button on the back again to lock the arbor in place follow that up with a wrench snug it up again don't put these on too tight rotate the guards in the position where I'm going to be doing all my cutting lock it in and I'm ready to do my cutting and now I'm protected if this disc does explode it's going to shield me on 2 different directions so I have less area where that that wheel can come apart and come at me also notice that the wheel is now sitting further in from the guard whereas before if I were to use that other that type 27 nut happy right close to that guard I don't want to be there I want to be further out so this type 1 guard and it's type 1 nut on the type 1 wheel allows everything to be pushed out more towards the center and this type one guard keeps everything in place and keeps me a lot safer than a typical twenty seven guard meant for a twenty seven wheel fun fact during the whole mounting demonstration the grinder was unplugged the whole time while I was swapping the wheels in and out you always want to make sure to unplug the grinder anytime you're swapping out the wheels one thing I used to do as an educator and I learned actually when I was in the field working if you take the wrench that's required to tighten that nut and loosen it and just zip tie it right to the end of the power cord right we're right where it gets plugged in it this forces the operator to unplug the device in order to be able to access the wrench and bring it up there make sure you put it on there pretty snug you know that way doesn't slide up and down the cord and you should be good to go so instructors try that if you guys are using the wrenches it also keeps them from losing the wrench so I mean you keep track of your wrenches and then they'll be able to swap those in and out without any problem and it'll always remind them unplug it before they do it alright thus far we've talked about cleaning up your work area making sure you get a safe place to work we talked about dressing the part okay so as you can see fully dressed and everything I need aside from my gloves face shield but don't have my grinder in my hands yet we've made we figured out the type of material we're gonna cut or we're gonna grind on figured out the best wheel for that application now we figured out how to mount it to to the grinder whether it's a type 1 or type 27 configuration we've talked about making sure that the wheels are serviceable in good condition inspection of the grinder all that good stuff so now we're going to put everything together and we're going to go ahead we're going to talk about technique and operating each different type of wheel that you might encounter so the first thing we're gonna do we're gonna start off with a cutting wheel now remember this wheel is designed to cut so it's going to be used on edge you do not want to use that to grind anything off I'm guilty of it myself I've done before I'm sure some of you have you cut something off and then you go to you know you just use the edge of that just to take the bar off don't do it ok get rid of that bad habit just get in the habit of switching the wheel over a lot of times if I'm doing a lot of fab work I'll have two or three different grinders set when each grinder has a specific task so I'll have a cut-off wheel on one zark wheel on another and a wire wheel on another if you don't have that luxury just take the opportunity to switch switch the disc back and forth it's not worth it quick story that's kind of relevant to cut off wheels Father's Day price seven years ago and I got a phone call my dad tried to cut a piece of chain had all the appropriate PPE on there had the guard in place it was a type 27 guard but the the nut that was supposed to secure the wheel on there wasn't the appropriate nut it actually had a conical shape to it so the wheel was on there he had just picked up the guard or the the grinder to cut a piece of chain fired it up let it hit the max rpms like you're supposed to went to cut the piece of chain the wheel came apart the disc broke into several pieces a couple of the pieces ended up into his abdomen one of them they actually had to go through his abdomen and intestines and pull it out of his spine it was so far back so these things are nothing to mess with so don't don't take the risk it's not worth it make sure it's serviceable put a guard on the grinder and wear the appropriate PPE okay it's not even not even a joke everybody says I can't get the guard and yeah I got it I have the guard on there but I can't get into certain applications the grinder just won't fit well at that point you're probably using the wrong tool you need to select the appropriate tool for the job I'll select appropriate abrasive for the task at hand and select the appropriate PPE right more you know guys all right so let's go ahead get into it we're going to go ahead and use the the cutoff wheel I'm going to cut a piece of channel here and we'll just kind of move through the different types of wheels and show you the exact techniques to operate them safe and efficiently okay guys before we get into this and start talking about each wheel individually there's something I want to note about all the wheels okay this is gonna apply across all the board whether it's a cutting wheel a flap disc a hard rock eighth inch hard rock wire wheel there's something you always want to pay attention to the first one obviously is going to be the speed make sure the wheel matches the rotation or is greater than the rotation of the tool that you're gonna be working with the next one we want to talk about is pressure I see so many times people are burning up grinders and burning up discs because they're you know they're really putting their weight into it going ham on it just relax okay let the tool do the work you want to put light pressure on there just enough get the job done the harder you push on the wheel the less work it's gonna do okay because what you're doing you're heating that abrasive up that at that point you're compromising the adhesive that they're put all that the aggregate and the abrasives in there you're you're compromising the integrity of that so just back it off a little bit relax we're just grinding here or you know cutting so don't force the wheel into it let the wheel do the work the next always pay attention to your angles a lot I'm going to list it on the the edge of the or the face of the disc you know it'll tell you if you're a little run in a ninety degree five degree 30 degree 45 pay attention because that's the way the wheel was designed to be used so make sure you pay attention to the angle the next one pay attention to your wear patterns you know we're gonna talk about different wear patterns on some of the wheels if the wheel is too small to be used or you know damaged or you know it's just kind of past it's expiration date meaning it's been used way too much or it was used improperly before you got a hold of it go ahead and switch the wheel out okay so before we go ahead to use the tool we're going to make sure it's in the off position okay if it has a trigger lock or mechanism where it's just on and off make sure it's in the off position before you plug it in okay so it's completely turned off I'm going to go ahead and plug it in if you don't do that here's what could happen all right so to use this wheel it's gonna spin in a clockwise direction from where I'm standing right now this little arrow right here tells me that arrow is gonna or the wheels gonna spin this way so what I'm gonna do is I will once both hands are safely on the grinder I'm gonna hit the power switch I'm gonna turn it on and I'm going to drag this down the material for the first part of the cut and what I want to do is I just want to continuously score that line out I don't want to try to push the grinder in there and cut like it's a skill saw on plywood I'm removing small amounts of stock each time I go through it you'll see it actually happens pretty quick but I'm just gonna keep running this back and forth in that groove I'll then transfer up here and continue that same motion and then I'll come over to the other side and and run that same same motion and cut this piece off so as I'm cutting with this wheel you kind of want to put an imaginary line through the center of it this is the good side of the wheel over here this is where I want to maintain and stay it's less likely to kick back and bite if I'm using this side of the wheel if I switch over this way because the wheels running in a clockwise motion if I get bound up this thing's gonna kick right back at me so I don't want to flip it upside down and use this side of the wheel okay your your right-hand side of the wheel I don't want to use that I always want to try to stay over here as you're looking at it to the left-hand side of that wheel that's gonna make things a lot safer if I do get a kickback it's gonna pull the grinder away from me so now I've rotated the guard this is still the left-hand side this is the side that I want to cut with I don't want to cut with this back this this side over here will flip the guard around here in a minute and I'll kind of show you what that looks like but again looking at it this is the left-hand side of the wheel as I'm cutting the sparks are gonna come back this way you can orient the guard to where the sparks you know they're coming down at the floor so you can kind of stay out of the way of the fire but because that that wheels right now it's running as you're looking at it it's gonna run in a counterclockwise fashion before when you looked at it this way it's running clockwise okay but now in this way it's gonna be running counterclockwise this because of the orientation the grinder as I'm cutting okay the sparks are coming back this way if for some reason the grinder binds up it's gonna pull the grinder out of my hands okay so I'd rather be away from the grinder if it catches then 40 if I flip everything over and cut with the other side of the wheel it's gonna kick back and come at me so now we're backwards this is the side of the wheel that you don't want to be cutting with as I cut the sparks are gonna go that way the wheel is gonna be trying to force itself back this way and if for some reason this wheel binds up it's gonna kick back at the operator now this is only a four and a half inch wheel but imagine if you've got a six seven or a nine inch cutting wheel on here okay it's gonna kick back and it's gonna possibly cut you so you want to make sure the sparks you can always orient the guard to where the sparks are hitting the floor you can stay out of the firing line so the sparks are coming back at you once this is turned the opposite way but this way we're here the sparks are gonna go that way if this thing binds up it's gonna kick back at me you want to avoid that now once I'm done what I want to do this is called the foot of the grinder every single grinder has one when I'm done with the grinder and I'm not using it I'm gonna set it on the table just like this that's what it's designed for see how it holds it nice and flat I'm going to wait until it that it completely stops before I set it down set it down on the material on the table everything's good you don't want to lay it down this way or on the wheel itself okay and I'll lay it down on the foot so that's a cut off wheel now we're gonna go ahead and move to a quarter inch hardrock anytime you guys are doing any grinding or cutting make sure that the piece that you're working on is is completely fixed or it's a fixed solid object stationary or clamped down if you're using the small parts put in a vise put in a clamp two hands should be on the grinder at all times you don't want to hold the piece of material with one hand and cut or grind with the other it's just not safe so we're gonna go ahead we're gonna clean this edge up here remember this disc right here it tells me at the top it's designed to be used at a 45 degree angle so we're gonna clean this edge up one thing to note is I can't use the backside of this wheel there's no reinforcement there's no abrasives in here so when we go over to the this piece of channel that we're working on here I'm gonna do this just for demonstrations is only so the the camera guy can kind of point that out you don't want to use the top of the wheel while you're trying to clean this stuff up you're actually going to rotate it the material the surface of material should always be on the on the front side of this wheel okay so I'm gonna go ahead swap this out we're gonna switch over to a piece of 3/8 plate and we're going to clean up some mill scale now depending on the type material you're gonna be grinding on and the type of wheel what you should do with any of the wheels you're gonna be working with is start and do a pull technique at first and then you can start getting in and going back and forth the reason is if you try to push this in there and it bites in it could cause the wheel to kick off and deflect you don't want to do that you could also chip the wheel so start off and drag the piece across kind of clean that up a little bit and then you'll have a good feel for how that material and that wheel are gonna interact with one another so as you can see on this I'm using a 45 degree work angle I want to try to maintain the integrity that wheel that's what it's designed for that's exactly how I want to use it try to maintain that 45-degree angle as you pull back your bodily he's kind of gonna get in that natural rhythm you know as you're pulling it back across and it's gonna keep you at that angle so try not to jack it up too high with your elbow or you know drop it too low just try to keep that nice 45 degree angle or if you have a thirty degree angle disc you know try to keep it in that area as well okay so one little pro tip whether you know you're using the grinder yourself or your students are or the people that are working for you the thickness of this wheel right this is a quarter inch wheel I should have about a quarter inch where line right here throughout the entire life of this disc same thing if I have an eighth inch disc it's gonna be an eighth inch where line that's gonna tell me that disc is being used correctly it's not being used on its edge that are maintaining that you know thirty to forty-five degree whatever is recommended on the disc but that where line should remain constant throughout the life of this wheel let's go ahead and move on to the flap wheel again we're gonna plugged it as we're switching wheels I'm gonna go ahead and push the button on the back here line that up screw this down all the way lock it in place and it doesn't you know there's you can't use a wrench on this side just snug it up pretty decent again I want to verify that the trigger locks not in place okay it's a paddle style trigger so that the triggers fully out I'm gonna go ahead and plug it in and then we'll go ahead and show you how to use this okay now with the flat four wheel I'm gonna go ahead and do the same thing I'm going to get the grinder up to the max RPMs and I'm gonna go ahead and pull across this material and we'll attempt to put a bevel on it this stuff's really good for material stock removal it's not so great on mill scale removal just because everything gets kind of glazed over but it's great for taking off corners deburring edges and blending welds removing welds these things work awesome but I'm just gonna do a drag technique on here get it going full rpm start here and then pull that first one just to see how it's gonna react with the material and then we can run back and forth and try and get a decent bevel on here as you can see with the flapper disc on there piece of steel we're really able to remove a lot of stock very quickly without compromising the wheel you making sure that we use it correctly nice and smooth and as you can see the disk is still in good shape now what I'd like to do is run the same test we're gonna switch over I'm going to take this disk off I'm going to put a brand new one on and we're gonna switch over and do a little bit of stainless alright so I went ahead and switched out the wheels this was the one I was using on regular carbon steel I put the same type of wheel same type of flapper wheel back on the grinder to do some stainless now in this situation just because it's for instructional purposes it's not gonna make a big difference I could have continued to use this one on stainless steel wouldn't been a big issue but I wanted to kind of make note of the fact that since I use this on steel this wheel is now saturated with iron now if I switch over and start grinding on stainless as many of you may know some of you may not once I start grinding the stainless I've now impregnated the stainless with the iron from the carbon steel once I get done with this piece it could oxidize so in order to eliminate that anytime you use a wheel that's meant for stainless steel and steel once you use it on steel market steel only when if it's only been used on stainless steel mark it on stainless steel use only that way you know you kind of remember which disk goes on what where you can use them so just try to avoid that ran into a situation where we were doing guardrails at Disney and one of the young apprentices used a wheel that already been used on steel we he polished up some stainless and stuff for us we've installed that in the field next thing you know a couple days later there's little impregnated iron spots in that piece of stainless steel we had to remove it cut the sections out and redo it so try to avoid impregnating your stainless steel with the iron from steel by not switching out your discs okay since I'm going to be working on stainless steel I'm gonna go ahead and put the the gentex papper system on and that's simply because my beard would interfere with a respirator anytime you're grinding or cutting or welding on stainless steel you should have at the source fume extraction a papper system with the appropriate filter or a respirator with the appropriate filter stainless steel contains hexavalent chromium which is potentially hazardous so you don't want to be breathing that stuff in if you can avoid it right use a papper system well-ventilated area at the few at the source fume extraction something to protect yourself from the dangers of working with stainless steel be at cutting grinding heating welding whatever the case may be alright so again we got a lot of stock removal the wheels still in good shape came out nice and clean use the papper system didn't have to worry about in just in a whole bunch of hexavalent chromium any of that stuff the the system work great you can't even smell this stuff when you're grinding on it so it's a pretty awesome system I wish I would have had one of those a lot sooner alright so now we're gonna go ahead and we're going to talk about some wire wheels alright so we have the wire wheel attached were plugged in everything's good to go I just want to make a special note that this is the the bead profile so this is actually going to be used upon edge so when I run this I'm gonna run on the edge I don't want to put this into a different configuration and run it at that thirty degree angle it's not designed to do that you're going to put too much pressure on these these twists right here and what that's going to do is deform the wheel wants you to form the wheel you're running out of high rpms you're gonna throw this thing off balance you don't want to do that so always operate this on the edge okay so I just throw a quick weld on top of this the purpose of this wire wheel they're great for slag removal if you got little bb's in there I've got a little bit of buckshot on here I'll be able to take all that stuff off with this wire wheel they're really great tool to have in your arsenal that make cleanup a lot easier if you have access to one of these versus a chip and hammer and a wire brush so that stuff comes off you know relatively easy it's very clean it's ready to go ahead and continue welding okay so this is the cup brush it's meant to be used in the flat position we're gonna go ahead and clean up an area right in here but this is what you want to use when you have to switch into a flat so don't go using the bead brush when what you're actually looking for is a cup brush this is for the surface not for grooves alright so as you can see between the area that we cleaned in the area that's not been cleaned there's a significant change in the area you know a lot cleaner all the oxides have been removed off the top of there the service rust these aren't the appropriate application for mill scale so if that's what you're looking for that's not what this brush is designed to do but if you have heavy oxidized pieces that would be the perfect tool to implement to get all that stuff cleaned up so you're ready to weld okay the last wheel that we're going to be using is the eighth inch hardrock okay and this wheels actually design as you can tell on the front here I can use that in the the 0 to 45 degree angle as well as 90 so what's that mean I can do an edge I can use this to clean up the edge but I can also turn it on its face and grind that way so this is kind of like a dual purpose wheel what I'm going to do with this I have a bad section of weld on here then I'm going to go ahead and take and remove that it's kind of what this specific wheel is designed for removing bad welds or removing a be cleaning up the route before you go ahead and do a hot pass so we're gonna go ahead clean some of this weld out go ahead and make that appropriate repair and then we'll go ahead and test the edge out on it as well okay so what I'd like to do here I'm going to clean off about a half inch of mill scale from the back I'm going to clean up this edge that's been flame cut and then we'll go ahead and put a land on there okay so we're able to get the mill scale cleaned off got the the bevel face where we had the the flame cut got all the carbon deposits cleaned off put a decent land on there and then cleaned up the backside she's ready to weld alright guys thanks for watching I hope you learned something this is gonna conclude this episode of grinder safety so stay tuned after I get done here because we have some special videos and content for you what we did is we actually pulled our users on Instagram or our followers and asked them hey if you've ever been injured by a grinder send us some photographs of the injury and you know tell us a little bit about what happened we just want to drive home the fact how important the PPE is using the right tool for their job and you know especially putting a guard on the grinder we probably had to over 200 submissions within about a day and a half and I would say 90% of them didn't use a guard so a guard could have eliminated or alleviated a lot of the problems that they ran into so hope you guys appreciated watching the the video and I without further ado grinder accidents [Music] [Music] hopefully you're still with us and now you understand the importance of using a guard face shield safety glasses appropriate tools for the right job I hope you guys learned something until next time make every well better than your last", "hFTWeAOXXuY": "[Music] once you have prepared all of the meat for grinding by removing all the fat sinew and gristle and cutting it into the small cubes that's required for the grinder we're ready to load the hopper you basically take all of your meats and put it into the hopper I purposely have not put any of the meat down into the chute of the hopper for grinding at this point in time because I have not turned on the grinder I am now going to turn on the grinder and I'm going to start feeding meat down the chute of the grinder as you will notice the meat is already starting to be ground and I haven't even used a stopper to force the meat through the chute into the grinder itself that's due to the technological advantage that we have by having the big bite auger if you continue to feed all of the meat down the chute of the grinder and you'll notice all the meat is coming out of the grinder on the coarse grind we have now completed our first grind using the coarse meat at this time we're ready to start the process of replacing a plate for our second and fine grind at this point in time some people like to season their meat so that when they grind it a second time the seasoning is better mixed in to the meat but that's really due to personal preference and can be mixed and added at a later point in time so now we take our fine plate we remove the collar pull out our course grinding plate replace it with the fine grinding plate put the collar back on and you're ready to start your second and final grind you will basically take the meat out of the meatlug place it in your hoppers feed the meat down through the throat and you will notice that it is coming out the head of the grinder and a fine grind that you'll use as a final bride I'm now going to start the second part of actually filling game bags during our second grind this is another accessory that L AM sells it's a two inch aluminum stuffing tube it's ideal to use during your second grind and to fill gang bags for storage of ground meat or ground beef or ground venison po m also sells wild game bags which John's going to come here and help me demonstrate because this is really a two-man job you slide the wild game bags over the collar of the stuffing tube and you slide it pretty much all the way up onto the stuff in tube because what will happen is when I turn on the grinder and the meat starts coming out you will start filling up the back of the stuffing tube first these are 1 pound wild game bags so we have the wild game bag on the stuffing tube and I'm now going to turn on the grinder and feed the meat through the chute into the grinder for our second grind and filling up the wild game bag we've now filled up our wild game bag we have a one-pound marker on the outside of the wild game bag you then twist throughout wild game bag you take our spring-loaded pliers seal it off and you're ready to put it in their freezer for storage [Music]", "AMue0p1Gjqo": "hi I'm Rick Nelson technical trainer here at Norton and today we'll talk about converting your right angle grinder from a type 27 guard to a type 1 cut-off wheel guard so sometimes you can be a little bit tricky to find so for the type 1 guard you'll have to do probably is go back to the manufacturer in either email or call just to figure out what the part number is to get it so in order to convert it and you unlock it it simply simply slides off there's a few teeth in there unlock the type 1 cut off guard put it on slide it to where you want it roughly and then lock it in place so with the type 27 wheel you're using the wheel like this and the guard is open on the bottom so if anything happens you're protected here and everything should come out this way with the type 1 you're using the wheel like this and with this guard the side is open so if that will were to break it could come out and hit you or somebody else walking by now we'll try to mount the wheel so the first thing you're going to do is use the two flanges that come from the manufacturer so the back flange usually is very specific to that particular grinder but the front flange doesn't really matter you still send you both with the grinder but the front one as long as the threads match up you should be good to go so if you look at the flanges up close you'll see that it has a little bit of a shoulder in there so when you mount the wheel on to the grinder it sticks up a little bit the front flange has a recess on one side and then the flange shoulder on the other so if you mount the two flange shoulders together and tighten it up your wheel doesn't get tightened so what you have to do is flip it over and put that shouldered side right in there with that recess and that will pinch your grinding the reason for the two shoulders would be when you put a thicker wheel on you put it there and then this one centers right over it it gives a little bit more support and it keeps that wheel centered so when we mount our type 1 cutoff wheel the backside of the flange actually is cut out to fit right on the back then it kind of locks into place so you'll know when it's on right put your grinding wheel on so it's sitting in the center and then you make sure that you have that recessed side facing down push the lock button for the spindle in tighten it up finger tight use your spanner wrench that comes with the grinder tighten it up and you're ready to go this wheel on this grinder would mount the same as this wheel on this grinder the only difference between these are that each manufacturer is very specific with their own type of guard and how it goes on so this particular one has like a thumb lock you just unlock it turn it to line up all the little keys and it comes off where this particular one has a key pattern in there that matches what's on the grinder and you push this button in and on the inside here there's a little key that unlocks and let you move it so when you place your guard on properly you should have your guard a little bit further out to make sure so if you were to grind like this if that wheel were to break and come up it could hit your fingers so typically you want to make sure it's set up so if anything were to happen your hand is covered by the guard and that would go for a type 1 or a type 27 guard it doesn't matter what you wanted and a good rule of thumb that I learned way back when I first started here was after you tighten everything up typically you want to spin the wheel just to make sure that it's not going to get caught on anything that it's rotating it's not running out it's spinning nice and smooth I know sometimes this information can be hard to find so hopefully this sheds some light on some of the trickier things that can happen with a right angle grinder for some of you DIY people out there so if you have any other questions feel free to leave them in the comments below", "ImtJfh34JKc": "hi I'm Steve from j\u00f3ska and I'm here to show you the new j\u00f3ska wax tripathi's the black stripper disc is made from silicon carbide impregnated nylon compared to some other stripping discs it has a much tighter web of nylon that contains more abrasive within the nylon making it a much more effective disc as the nylon wears down more abrasive is exposed so there is no clogging or loss of efficiency issues the product works extremely well on virtually all flat surfaces examples timber steel stainless steel and most other metals but do not use against sharp edges otherwise it will break up some ideal applications for the black strip it is cleaning welds removal of paint and removal of rust and graffiti plus much more now I'll show you how to fit the black stripper disc on to an angle grinder we have three sizes available 100 mil 115 mil and 127 milder ammeter in this example we're showing you the 127 mil which has a 22 mil bore place the stripper disc onto the bottom of the flange then with the top flange screw over the top once the top flange is fully fastened your stripper disc is now ready to go firstly I'll demonstrate the removal of paint on timber in this demonstration I'll show how to remove the powder coat from this piece of steel [Laughter] in this next example I'll demonstrate the removal of rust on this piece of steel as you can see from our demonstrations this product is very easy to use on a

I'll put a link in the description inside you go selection of washers instruction manual and the wheel 999 where I started by removing the three small stood to hold the side cover on the center ring just slopsink [Music] as there was no way to hold stop the wheel from spinning I've got agreed to take the other side off for a spanner on either side and then I'll tie now that the left side is right on Fred right side his left hand track but I can't tell much healing the plungers were really stuck to the grounding stone it seems straightforward enough the washers that come in the kit try one that fits the Shafter we grind it so in our case it will be them too I think and you get you two washers put one on either side of the wheel helps out and they're really sharp these wire wheels now grapple these plungers on the same way as it was on with the garnish stone while though it's going to allow a void for these Center washes to come out we could flip them over the perfect but then it rubs on the side of the casing so I've got this old flange I think is off a grinder or something I'm going to drill that out and put a flange on to the bench grinder first to build it out [Music] now going away with this front plunge idea you just weren't working I'm just going to go to the right size so I'll go note and I'm girl it out some use that as a as a spacer and I'm sorry it would have been a lot easier to go on facial washers after an extra note on ten to lock that one in so I can tighten that side up hoping that's all the size and we're talking with now so I'll can just knit that side we'd be in our left and a right under threat it's a bit awkward [Music] there it is back together it's wiped or little strands catching on the casing I think that's because it's a newer brush with yer do-it-yourself you're definitely going to need some washes or some sort of Packer because it's a slightly thinner diameter than the original grinding stone well on that's quite happy [Music] [Music] the reason I'm doing this my next video I've we're on assault with two knuckle chisels I want to see if I can put some life back into them thanks for watching and as always if you enjoy this video

major mods are major and it is major - yeah it's as told you yeah I'm actually sitting down and so it's taller than me right now so I want you to tell me about it sex okay so this is a this is a flat burr grinder no it is the biggest flapper that they that they make it's okay three millimeter burr set which is big okay the next size down is sixty four millimeter so it's a big jump from there it is made for high production so we it's spinning at about 1750 rpms 650 watt motor okay so it's made pretty much run all day mm-hm very very high volume very quick because it's 83 millimeter burrs the ability to dose out your shots it's it's under five seconds basically it's a very quick render from that standpoint okay it is 110 just like all the other grinders that we deal in as well other than that it's it's a Maserati embeds on the front it does come in an electronic version the type-a okay if you want it to go dosoo this you could in really pass there it's it's a typical mods we're grinding the adjustments still the same big old hopper up top as a four pound hopper okay that was a lot of coffee yeah our espresso okay and then we've got basically the timer switch over here timer switch over here so way this works is you know again as you could theoretically just go on but have you want got it so it doesn't just sit there running and running a money okay and it's dosing down into here or it's grinding down into here and I'm going to dose out um has a little lever can you sign enough you can see down there but it's spitting it out right through there it's gonna kind of hit right yeah that's forcing it down into here at which point it's a dosing chamber that's right it's out of there same thing each one of those little chambers when you fill them up is rough i seven to eight grams worth of espresso okay I mean you can see I've only ran it for a couple seconds there and look how much it's dosed out mm-hmm so we're an espresso grind right now when are we we're not at the very finest no we're not our very finest it can get finer than this but I mean even there you can just feel and you can even see ya there see it's like a baby yeah pumping yep so we are pretty consistent very consistent yeah and then as far as the range you have so this guy you have a certain range that you set it for so that you're not like going willy-nilly yeah yep it's got a couple things to protect that so of course it is stepless so I could just don't keep going and wide as I wanted to okay um if I can actually even which you can't really get down in here when we get we'll take this off in a second there's a little thing that's right inside there and then we'll actually stop it so it gives it a little bit of range okay um you know that way you don't go too crazy because again it's an espresso grinder we're not really going to wear you know someone's gonna walk in I need an espresso and then all of a sudden a French press yeah like they do want to keep it to a range cuz across a typical day you're gonna move it maybe that much how much sorry that much okay you know we're not talking it's it's what I just did right there we'll change that grind dramatically and that'll probably give you a three or four second differential your shot okay so when you're making these changes are all very small and that's why we restrict it so that way you don't walk in and somebody just went crazy spun it around you got it same thing as any other mother this whole thing actually screws out that way for wherever you want that way if you happen to be right there and it's sitting right there you wouldn't get to get your actual top off I think um so there's there's just little things like that if you look around there's one two three every couple inches or so there's another one to screw that in so you can just put that wherever you want it and now one thing I notice with this hopper versus like the super jolly and the other guys is this big black collar what is that um mainly it's because of how big this is okay this thing is just gigantic if you want to take this off you can't just lift it straight off so we've got a couple things to get it off you've got a little slider right there which is in and then you have to actually screw this up okay I screwed in see I just hold it in place I see um the other thing that's going to happen there I'll take this awesome probably like a small mess that's okay um there's a little sensor that's inside here is what so right now see how it's I just turn this on the timer on oh okay you see that so it's actually engaging and it won't grind without that in place this will push straight down into that little slot you see and then I'll actually let what got in if I pull this out nothing happens I can't protect the digits protect the digit um I always thought that maybe they locked it in so if you had some narrow dual customers come in they couldn't just like pull off your hopper oh yeah if anybody's ever had anyone running just steal or hopper and run away please write us hey we used to have our tip jar stolen all the time we had to chain it to the counter deep well you worked at a bad place no you did it so once we get down inside here it sits as you can see it's just your typical um mazo Kreindler so I'm gonna go ahead and vacuum this stuff out sell me a smoke a mess okay now we can actually see the whole chamber basically so from here we're just going to go ahead course side so we're going clockwise at this point okay those mixed up and so you're basically just I'm gonna go into the birds right now so this is corseting it up theoretically if I put coffee and there right now it would just be huge chunks coming out I mean probably even worse than a French press okay um but what we're doing right now is I'm just gonna try to take it out so I can show you how big these birds are so spin all the way around this comes off okay so that's a little bit different because some of the the like the supergiant stuff that's connected to the burr yep so this is still this is separate okay this one right here is actually right there look how big those things are yeah it's just massive and what's that white stuff that's just the lubricant then to make sure it's see like a move smoothly yeah this is stuff that you almost never see on a grinder anywhere this is brand-new yeah so we have all this little white lubricant that's gonna go away mainly it's you know it's when it's brand new it's right here we get stuff going on it this is going down on to it right there it's just to soften that blow I think um no one really has that okay so you see just I mean I wish I should have brought a sixty four millimeter burr set with me um because you get to see how much different is but that sixty four millimeter is gonna come to like right here it's pretty big one there my little tiny goblin hammer scale um and so this is how this is how we get so much volume okay so we're Wow and only this stuff down but yeah more surface or it means that can grind more at the same time okay you can still see it's the same general process if you can see a little chamber back there that's where it's throwing the coffee out so again all the way these all work flat for grinders the whole ideas were throwing the coffee it's all centrifugal force okay we have to get that coffee out it's not coming down via gravity anymore at that point mm-hmm so it's this little tiny chamber right there that it's gonna throw it through which is how we end up with coffee out here okay and then that's kind of guiding it to keep it from like flying out everywhere to keep it from spraying you can see especially when it gets really really fine it sprays out we want to keep it below there if we took this off I would just spray it to the top okay so this is high production environments where what what kind of a machine would you usually pair this with but this like the raid this is known with our big one so our Aurelius anything in the GB 5 or FB ad or strata from La Marzocco okay wrenchy leo class 9 got it generally speaking a lot of times you'll see this with two machines okay okay this is for very very high production as far as flapper grinders go you just don't get any bigger than this okay so why would you choose this over the Konya Rober conical z' well that's a great question I think I can test a lot the flapper got a lot of its preference okay once you really get into something like this versus a conical you're going to start getting into the you know which do which do you like better does this kind of core flapper work for you um I tend to feel flappers get a little bit more consistent as far as the production side goes okay correction espresso you can see this was very fast and very consistent yeah um if you're using blended espressos or anything like that flapper grinders typically are the way to go the higher rpm they're moving a little bit faster for you you know a lot of people like to use conical ones which is really the next step up from this especially when they get single origins yeah a big difference though this one's going to cost you about what seven hundred dollars less okay so I mean I can get two of these for the price of one Rover I see I mean so again if we're using a blended espresso we're just more production cafe working out 500 drinks a day the major is really much more cost effective it's going to give you the results you're looking for got it cool yes it does alright anything else you want to cover with the mozz our major um no really it's a great great great grinder it's it's quick it's consistent um and you know again really with with Maserati kinda can't go wrong it's a great brand cool alright thanks Brandon you", "Fh9FN3anjIY": "[Music]", "RR0z84XSRYw": "[Music] in this segment we're to go over the proper installation of the big bike grinder from LEM this insulation really pertains to the big bike rinder but it's really applicable to any of the grinders that we sell from LEM the first part that you need to assemble is the head you take this part and install it in the color of the grinder itself slides in just like that you tighten this nut right here so that this head does not come out and it's secure the next part that you put on is the hopper which goes down into the head and attaches to the handle of the grinder itself this plunger goes right in like that the next piece that you will use is our big bite auger make sure in big bites that we have this plastic retaining ring collar on the very end and it slides into the head of the grinder make sure it goes all the way in where this stem is just barely skipping out the very end of the head you then take the plate or the blade it's very important for this particular blade or plate to be installed the correct way otherwise the machine grinder will not grind properly you install the plate or the blade this way onto the stem of the auger you then take your coarse plate grinding plate right here and you'll place it on the inside most people when they grind they will grind twice once using the coarse plate and once using the fine plate if your customer wants to make hamburger that they specifically want to use for chili or spaghetti they may only make one grind using the coarse plate the coarse plate goes on very simply there is a groove right here that goes in the bottom for the plate to rest on once assembled properly inside the head of the grinder this is how all the component parts will look and then you take your collar and you place it on make sure it's tight so that completes the installation of the parts for the big buy grinder for more information go to lem products calm thank you [Music]", "xoAEclPuvLs": "hey everyone and welcome back to my channel welcome if you're new here my name is Arianna and a couple of weeks ago a company reach out to me they're called potent they D and me and they were like hey we have this legged product everyone get a try it's like you know very groundbreaking very different you know it'll change the way you grind Abid you feel me I was like wow that sounds really douchey I mean I would love to see one of your products so they sent me in and I didn't check the pricing until I really like went on the website and checked it out because when they D and me it didn't really have like a full like pricing for and yet and I saw that it was 200 [ __ ] dollars I know the average grinder for a high-end one is between like I would say 18 like 130 or 150 but this grinder is $200 I have the website up right here the websites are very cute very flashy it definitely pulled me in yeah this grater is $200 I want to know why it's $200 and if you want to find out soon let's start watching like let's let's watch the video like let's do this let's figure it out so I haven't tried this grinder out before I haven't even looked at it it came in this white box and it's pretty discreet it just had some you know cling wrap around it and it came in this box it looks like a pair of headphones almost so yeah super cute box I'm gonna bust it open because I want to know what this grinder is this is not an unboxing video I want to just open it up and see how it is oh this is sexy it's like this cylinder inside the box that's very cute definitely a cute touch for 200 bucks it looks like this is gonna be big as [ __ ] it feels really heavy so let's see they put my name on it how cute don't really care though it's not gonna sway me for if this grinder is [ __ ] or not it's really heavy like do you hear that it's heavy you could like bash someone's head in with this [ __ ] definitely could not take it to a concert or anything this is like heavy it definitely doesn't feel cheap which is good so they say that like the teeth in these are supposed to crush the air but not grind it engineered and modified for the perfect crushing the perfect grind every time or whatever the [ __ ] you know so I really want to know more about these teeth they're like ridges so I'm really enticed by that I guess this is where the weed goes what is inside of here oh just some stickers you know just some Oh a carrying case that's kind of cute and this is the bottom whoa it doesn't have a cave catcher whoa I wonder why they did that it's $200 and it doesn't have a Keith catcher it's not really a deal-breaker for me but I know it is for other people whoa okay interesting so the bottom is like on like a sexy plastic so that's cool but I guess what makes this grinder is this like little teeth and net setup and I'm guessing it what makes it $200 so I'm gonna put some weed in here I saw you could put up to 14 grams in here I don't know about all that but I am gonna put a decent amount of lead in this grinder so I threw some nuts in some baby nuts to be nice and I'm going to grind this up over to see what's going on okay so it feels good in my hand so I'll grind it up all the weed already and then let's see how it came out so this is how the weed looks when it's grinded up it looks like very fluffy um it definitely looks like it was crushed and not grinded I'm going to grind some weed up in my old grinder and compare real quick hold up I have a very normal everyday grinder that honestly is dining so I'm glad I got a new one these are the same strain here is my 20 dollar grinder and here is my $200 grinder $20 200 is there even a difference like no offense is there even a difference wait is it different it's a different so the $20 pile is like guess a bit finer what is finer actually and this one's kind of just very evenly ground okay so I definitely see a difference I'm gonna smoke because you know for a science girl and I'll hop right back in okay so I definitely noticed that it's a smoother head I know when it comes to grinding things that usually a joint or a blunt is better but I don't like joins in blunts and even though I'm hitting in my glass piece I can definitely notice a difference so I'm gonna keep smoking it for a moment and I'll get back to you okay I'm noticing a difference I definitely am I hit this piece like every single day and I notice a difference it feels kind of smoother hmm that's interesting I don't know if it's my brain playing tricks on me but it does feel very different I'm going to pack a bowl of my normal grinded wheat I'm gonna compare and contrast overall so far I like this grinder as I'm picking up the cheaper grinder weed I am noticing more of a difference it feels a bit sandy it feels like it was grinded and this feels like it was crushed so I'm getting it I'm getting it now let's smoke our chief grinder we Wow okay that was way harsher Wow what the [ __ ] wait wait this is like different oh this is different girl I'm usually pretty sceptic this website is beautiful for this product but it's very like tech growing you know we revolutionize the experience of like crushing your grant you know what it says you know what it says so I was like okay whatever but now I just hit from my old Grindr I'm kind of like really surprised Wow [Music] so overall is this grinder worth $200 I don't know if I'm sure only because there isn't a Keith catcher and I would love to know why that is because I see Keith around the rims of the container and I would love to know why there isn't like a final like net I don't know like I really really really really really would prefer that it has a thief compartment because that's going to be a big um a big issue with this overall I like this binder if I spent two hundred bucks on it I definitely would not be that mad about it I would definitely just keep it for an at-home grinder I would still need a second grinder for the go this is um too big and too expensive to be carrying around on my tote bag like this is huge I have like some big hands like this is a big [ __ ] grinder let me try you find a size my friends okay here's the top to a candle right I'm so high like a standard like Yankee Candle and here is this grinder that's not a good comparison oh my god hold up so here's my ol grinder here is my new grinder like that's crazy do you see that this grinder is [ __ ] huge you definitely cannot take it somewhere at least I wouldn't know this grinder is unfortunately very big and it doesn't have a keith's compartment but I do still like it so if I spend my own money on it I wouldn't be really all that mad if I got this for a gift I would be really [ __ ] excited this is a really good gift I like this finder this is my new

I'm the developer relations\nengineer for Blogger, and we're here this afternoon to talk about building\nprofessional web sites using Blogger as\nthe back-end infrastructure. So what are we gonna cover? Firstly,\nwhy you should use Blogger. Then we'll look at a couple\nof ways of doing so, and then finally,\nwe'll have Pat Coleman here do a live coding exercise showing you how\none of these approaches works in practice. So a question you might\nvalidly be asking-- why would I use Blogger as a back-end infrastructure for a web site\nthat I'm building to serve myself\nor for a client? So let's start with a-- a reason that kicks it\nfor me. Blogger is big, probably bigger\nthan you'd imagine. Here's some statistics to help\nyou get a feeling for that. We have 400 million active monthly read--uh, users-- readers. Um, up from 300 million actives\njust a year ago. Blogger is growing. We're a truly\ninternational platform. We're localized\nin 50 languages, and 75% of our traffic comes\nfrom outside the U.S. of A. And finally,\nthis is the statistic that does it for me-- our users are putting\ntheir thoughts, their dreams, their--their daily\nannotations into Blogger at a rate of 250,000\nnew words a minute. This means that Blogger\nis truly scalable. It's stable, and it's\nthe platform of choice for millions\nof people out there. I did mention that\nwe were stable, right? So what do I-- what do I base this on? Well, in a recent survey\nof, uh, all of the top\nblogging platforms, uh, our friends over at pingdom\nran a survey, and Blogger\nwas the only platform for the entire survey period to maintain 100% uptime. This means that we're stable. We're dependable,\nand you can use us for both yourself and for your clients'\nweb sites. Now walking back\nin history, I remember the first administration interface I handcrafted for my client, matching him up\nwith the web site I was creating for him. But, you know,\ntime moves on, and I learned that\nthere's more to it than just figuring out\nthe mental puzzle. There's--there's engineering. There's user interface concerns, and these days,\nI've come to understand that these things really matter. I'm showing off Blogger's\nnew admin interface that we're currently rolling out\nto our--our users. As you can probably see\nin the URL bar, this is draft. So if you are using Blogger, you'll start seeing this appear across all--\neveryone coming up. Now hopefully I've impressed you to try Blogger out, and you might be validly asking, \"Okay, how would I do that?\" Let's have a look\nat three ways. First thing, I'd look at\nBlogger's templating system. Then I'd show you what\nyou can do with JavaScript, and then finally, we'll have a look\nat the RESTful APIs. So firstly, templates-- Blogger's templates are solid.\nThey're stable. They've been with us\nfor quite some time. They're well engineered,\nwell bedded in. Let's have a look at one. This is actually some XML that's pulled out of\none of my--my blogs-- mouserants.blogspot.com-- slightly simplified, but let's--\nlet's walk through it and actually have a look\nat what's happening here. Firstly, we're using\nname spaces to demarcate where our-- the parts of our templating\nlanguage is. The B name space is used\nfor our conditionals and for our, um,\nmodularity, which you can see\non the screen here, and it's also used\nfor looping constructs. Next, we have\nan expression name space, which here is being used\nto calculate some style for div, and the third one is our data name space, which is used to pull data out of the underlying\ndata store. But what's all this doing? Well, if a user\nis on a mobile platform, as you can probably tell, this\nis serving out the blog header, serving out\nthe title of my blog and the description\nunderneath it. And if they're not\non a mobile platform, well, there's a nice little\nimage that goes behind that. As you can see, our templating language\ngives you the ability to totally, um, customize the look and feel of your blog. So once you've created that,\nyour next question is, \"Okay, I've got this template. How do I put it into Blogger?\" Well, again back\nto our swanky new U.I. There's a template tab\non the left, and what you'll see is this, and if you scroll down\nthe page-- the red box is not there\non the production. This is to draw\nyour attention to it. Okay, you can do\na couple of things here. You can download\nyour current template. This is useful if you're\nmaking some changes in the admin interface\nthat you're not sure if you're gonna like or not, so you can download it,\nplay around, and then step backwards, or as in the case here,\nwhere we've created a new one, turn around and upload it. Blogger will then validate\nwhat you've uploaded, and once it is happy\nwith that, it will refresh\nall your sites, and everything will be available\nin your new library. So next question is, what advantages come from\nusing templates? Well, our administration\ninterface deeply understands\nthe templating system. So, for example,\nwhat we're looking at here is a layout view of my blog without all the content in it. And what we can see\non the--the bottom left is where the content\nthat I enter through the admin interface\nwill appear, and it says\nthat's where it'll be, and on the right\nwe've got gadgets. So gadgets are things\nlike open-- OpenSocial gadgets, which you may know from places\nlike iGoogle, Orkut, or our Apps Marketplace. We also have widgets, which are using our ability for third party, um, companies to integrate with Blogger using the Blogger XML templating\nlanguage I showed you before. Another advantage--\nand, well, who here has had\nthat wonderful call-- you're deep into figuring out\na deep technical problem, you've been working on it\nfor like an hour, you've got it all loaded\ninto your head, and your client rings you up\nand goes, \"I'd really like\nthe line at the top to be in a different color,\nand, you know, a bit bigger,\" and you're just\nsitting there going, \"I really could have not done\nwith this phone call, because I just lost\nwhat I was thinking about\"? Well, we've got a wonderful\ntemplate editor, a template designer, which you can then\ntrain your customer into how to make things\ndifferent colors. What I'm showing here\nis changing my heading font to use the Google Fonts API\nimpact font. So you can have\nyour customers come to you with these wonderful problems,\nand you can go, \"Here you go.\nYou can do it yourself.\" saving you from losing\nall that context, so you can actually\nget some coding done. Okay. Time to look\nat approach number two. There's a couple of ways\nto use JavaScript with Blogger. First one, obviously, is putting JavaScript\nin the template you were crafting\nback in step one. The other way is we can render a completely new user interface using just HTML\nand JavaScript and CSS, and pulling the data from the data store using JavaScript. Okay, I'd like to show you\nsome examples of--of this sort of technique. What you can see here is that\nit's dynamically loading, and, boy, your machine's slow, Bro. We've got this-- this ability\nto dive into things, maybe--yes. I love demoing things live. What we're looking at here\nis the ability to have a blog,\nor any web site that isn't the traditional\nmain line of content with a sidebar. We've got navigability. We've got the ability\nto dive into things. Scroll down, and--that's right,\nwe've got a few tabs open. And here is exactly\nthe same content. Nothing's changed\non the back end. Totally different\nlook and feel. What I'm actually\nshowing off here is a feature that Blogger\nreleased fairly recently called Dynamic Views. But there's nothing\nactually stopping you guys from doing this, and we'll get to that\nin a second. Oops. I should probably go back\nto the presentation. Did I just close\nthe presentation? No. Okay, part number three-- using RESTful APIs\nwith Blogger. And here's where we get\nto announce something-- well, actually,\nannouncing a preview. What we're doing is we're releasing\na new API in the coming short term... um, that will allow you to pull in all the content\nthat we were seeing before using JavaScript, um, and we'll have,\nas you've probably seen in the other API talks\nwe've had on this track, we've got client libraries for Java, PHP, python.net, and I'm missing one--Ruby. So you'll be able to grab\nall the content that your users have put in\nusing the admin interface, pull it out,\nand re-render it in various different ways. So what can you do with this-- what parts of Blogger\ncan you get to? Well, you can get\nthe--the blog information, the actual posts, either\nin a list or individual format, comments, and the static pages. Static pages are usually\nused for things like, uh, \"about us,\" \"contact us,\" \"FAQs.\" This means that not only can you have your clients\nentering, say, constantly changing information, as blog posts, but you can also give them\nthe ability to edit content that would be so linked\nfrom the-- the top right of the page-- the--the--the stuff\nthat's always, uh, relevant. This means that you can give\nthe ability to your, um, your clients to change the look\nand feel of their site without needing\nto bother you constantly. So let's actually have a look at the APIs that we're giving. Firstly notice it's on HTTPs. All of the new APIs\nthat Google are doing are all over HTTPs. They're all also based on\ngoogleapis.com. The part that's different\nis Blogger v2 blogs and underneath. So this one is pulling back\na specific blog. So first line, \"kind,\" is constant--is in all\nof the data we're returning, tells you what\nyou're looking at. This means you can write\nsome generic code to pull this into whichever\nformat you prefer and basically switch off that. The next line is the primary key\nof the object you're looking at. The next one is,\nin this example, would be the blog title, and the next, the description would be effectively used\nas a subtitle. Then we've got \"created\"\nand \"updated\" as time since Epoch, uh, the link where it's actually\nhosted on BlogSpot, so on and so forth. Now under a specific blog, we can get all the posts\nin a paginated fashion. There are a list of them, [speaking indistinctly] because we can also get them\nindividually, and it's using\nexactly the same format. So again we've got \"kind,\" then we've got the primary I.D.\nof this post and the blog\nthat it's related to, and then we've got the name,\nwhich is the post title, and the actual content,\nwhich is the HTML that you've entered\nthrough our admin interface. And then we've got the author\nwho created it. Useful for things\nlike bylines. Now we've also got comments, available as a list,\nagain, same format. So here we've got \"kind,\"\nBlogger comment, we've got the primary key\nof the comment, the post that it's related to\nand the blog and what was actually said. And now static content, again, as a list,\nas individual pages. So now that I've walked\nyou through three ways of integrating with Blogger, it's probably time for\nthat live coding exercise, where Pat shows us\nhow it is done. Coleman: Thanks, Brett. Okay, so now Brett's\nwalked us through what sort of resources\nwe give you access to in this new updated Blogger API, um, so what\nI will be doing is taking sort of a scenario where we want to build, like, a small web site for a business, and we're storing their data\ninside Blogger, and then using these APIs--\none for each resource-- to grab that information\nback out and display it in a web client. Um, now just briefly, for this demo\nI'll be using GWT. Uh, for those who aren't\ntoo familiar with it or haven't used it before, um, how this works is\nI'll be writing Java code, which then gets compiled\ninto JavaScript, and then can be served up\nfrom a static HTML page, um, with CSS or whatever\nyou like applied to it. So the nice thing about this is you could easily, say,\nonce you finished it, [speaking indistinctly]\nwithin a day, and the overhead of actually\nserving up that HTML and JavaScript content\nis really, really low. And the way it will be\nstructured in this case is for every resource-- uh, Brett's already\nwalked you through what the model looks like\nfor that resource, so that's all the content\nthat's stored, um, for each bit of information\nthat you get back. What we then have\nis a presenter, so that's gonna be talking\nto our API, uh, making\nthe Asynchronous Fetches of this model information\nfor the data we want, and finally, the bit\nthat we're really interested in is the views, so how this, uh, common model information\ncan be presented inside a JavaScript client. Okay, so imagine this-- you've got a business\nthat's come to you, and they want a web presence. But, say, they've spent money\non advertising, or maybe they want\nto lower their overheads or even, um, cut the costs\nof all the products they've got, so you want to base it on a way that's\neasy to update, but also low overhead of maintenance of the site. And for this instance, uh, we're using Blogger to say, uh, the business\nthat we're running could be one where\nyou've got products overall, so each post that they make\nmatched to a product and vice versa. And then, uh,\nfor this example, say you've got a product that you have that\nis a special for a week, so the most recent post\nis the most recent product, and that's on special\nfor this week, and you want to grab that\ninformation and display it. But then, uh, it might\nalso be useful for customers to, on their site,\ngo back over the list of posts and examine what previous\ncontent you've got, or previous products\nyou've been selling, and maybe even what users have\nsaid about their experience either buying with you\nor using your products. So let's see if this works. Sorry, my thing was down\nlast time I checked it. So fingers crossed. Um... This should eventually load\nas the blog where we're storing the data. And just in case, I'll try and load it\nfrom a different area. Okay, and what\nwe will see here is just a normal\nBlogger looking blog. There we go. So as I said,\nimagine we've got-- we've got a business\nwhich is running their products through their blog,\nand in this case, uh, just for this example,\nwe've got a business who are selling vases. What they do is\nfor each product they create, um, they--\none of their authors, or one of the people\nin the business can go into\nthe Blogger admin API, create that post, hit publish,\nand it will appear on this blog. As you can see,\nthey've got a name. They've got a little\ndescription, but it's not really--\nit might not be stylized to what their product-- uh, what their company\nwants to look like. So it doesn't have\ntheir logo yet. We haven't customized\nthe template any further than the original. Okay, so what we want to do\nis now set up this client, uh, in GWT to grab this content and render it how we like. So what I'll do\nis I'll switch over to, uh, the GWT client. Make sure it's running. And what I've started off with is a really basic page. It's just all the overhead\nthat you need to, once the page loads,\nstart executing the JavaScript that you're coding up\nin your client. So for now, we've got\n[speaking indistinctly] but later we'll end up\ntalking to the API and populating this data. Right, so the first resource\nthat Brett was talking about was his blog resource. Uh, the model is exactly\nas shown before, so you've got the I.D.\nYou've got the name in HTML. Um, we support HTML\non descriptions as well, and you've got things like\npost count, which, in this case, could be used to say\nhow many products you've got. Um, you've got\nwhen it's updated, in case you want to, say,\ncache the results and not have to talk\nto the API all the time. And then to get\nthis information, we go to that base HTTPs\ngoogleapis.com/blogger/v2 for this version\nof our API, and then at the end of that,\nwe add /blogs, and then the blog I.D.\nof the blog that we're using to host all of our data. So that's the URL\nwe get this information from. Finally, the view that we're\ngonna use in this case, or, uh, in--we might just like\na splash landing page. So you'll have the logo\nof your business added. Um, you can also have\nthe name stylized and the description stylized, so we'll use those as our\ninitial page for the view. Okay, switching back\nto the client itself. Uh, I'll open up the view in the GWT code that-- I will be skipping\nover these, mostly. Um, it's sort of-- the views are defined by\nthis templating language, which looks like HTML,\nbut gives you-- and can be styled like HTML. It can have HTML elements\ninside it, but it also lets you\npoint out certain elements in your HTML where information will go. So it's not the easiest\nto understand, but for here, we've got,\nlike, the splash page. We've got a section of HTML\nfor our name, section of HTML\nfor our description, and an image for our logo. Um, what might be so easy is switching to the Java, which compiles\ndown to JavaScript, which then forms that view\nin our client. So what we do\nwhen we've got a blog, we take that model, we find the information\nthat we are interested in-- in this case,\nit's the HTML of the name and the HTML\nof the description-- and then we find the areas\nin the HTML that we want to add that--\nthose labels to and just set them outright. So what I will do is\nonce we make the API call, the model resource\nwill come back, and then we'll build the HTML\non the client. Okay, so finally,\nto get this all running, um, I probably should remove\nthe windowed alert and instead replace that with-- once the client loads, we add that overall view to the root of our HTML. So their whole page\nwill be filled with this initial\nlanding page. So I'll kick off a compile. And just to remember, um, all of this is run\nin JavaScript, apart from the initial,\nlike, serving of the HTML. So what will happen is\nwe'll get a skeleton of a page loaded up first, and then the API fetch will go and talk\nto the Blogger APIs. Um, it will do that through, uh, in the GWT library that does\nJSON PECLs for you. And then once that result\ncomes back, we'll fill out the parts\nof the HTML with the information\nthat we want from our model. Okay. So we'll run this. Now when I hit refresh,\nyou see the image loads, 'cause that's part\nof the framework. Uh, you get the page\nat the top, and then once the information\ncomes back, you get the name\nof the company-- um, here we've just added\na bit of web font styling-- and then the byline. So that's the information\nfrom a blog, but, say you've got\nregular customers, they'll probably know your logo\nand your name already, and this content might not\nchange very much, so what we really want\nto get in there is the product information\nfor everything that you have. So instead of doing it based off blog information, we now switch to using our model as being the posts. As before, you've got\nthe post model, which is the--the I.D.\nof the post, um, the name--\nso that's the HTML that the post is titled. Uh, you've got the HTML\ncontent of the post direct from the Blogger\nback ends. You've also got this nice thing,\nwhich is the author, which applies to anything\nwhich is authored inside the Blogger API,\nso it gives you the name, their profile picture,\nif they have one, their link to their profile, um, and then the number of comments on the post. So we do it this way\njust because the comments themselves\nhave different resources, so rather than serving\nthem up with, like, a large overhead on the posts, we give you the number\nof comments, and it's possible to form\nthe URL to fetch those later. But the URL for the posts\nis exactly as before, so because the post was\n[speaking indistinctly] in a blog, the start of the post\nURL is the same. You've got the Google APIs\nand then Blogger v2, uh, then followed by\n/blog/blog ID for the blog\nthat the posts live in. And then finally, we want\nto get one particular post of the product\nwhich is special this week. So there we add /posts\nand then /post ID for the I.D. of that post. We make that call, get back\nthe information from the APIs, and now we need a way\nto display this to the user. And just as before, we set up the HTML template with areas for where the name\nof the pa--uh, post goes. Same with here, where you can add an area where\nthe name of the author goes, in case, like, uh, different authors might publish\ndifferent types of product. And then finally,\nwe have an area where the HTML\nof each post goes, so that will be information\nabout the product, the pricing, how to buy it, um, all that information. As with before, we create a view\nto display our posts... and in this case,\nwe render the post similar to how we\nrendered the blog. We find where on the HTML page the post name goes. We format the name to say--\nin this case, we can link it\nto the original blog post, and then we push that\ninto the page. Same with the, uh,\nthe content of the post, and we just grab that\nstraight from the model, and similarly,\nwe now grab the author, and we get their name and put that\nwhere we want on the HTML. Uh, finally,\nin our overall view, how we'll display this page is rather than having\na splash landing with the one tab at the top,\nwe're gonna add a second tab, which is this week's,\nuh, special, uh, product. And so now we've got\na second tab for that. Um, as before--I'll just\nkick off this compile. Uh, that's all right,\nI just have to, once we grab that information,\npush it into the view, so that it updates\nonce the fetch comes back. Okay, so once we run this, it will have the same initial\nload as before, so that HTML framework\nof the page, but with new information. Um, it will then do the call\nto get the blog's name and the blog's description and put that into\nthe splash landing page. And then simultaneously,\nit will grab the most recent posts\ninformation and put that, uh, invisibly, into the second tab on the page. So here we go. We'll serve our client locally. I'll go to this.\nRefresh it. You get the same\nframe as before, but you can see\nthere's now, uh-- not too easily on this screen-- but there is a second tab\nat the top left here, um, with the special. So once you click on it,\nyou get today's special, which, uh, is grabbed straight from\nthe blog post HTML. We can style this however\nwe like on the client, so if your authors have gone in\nand not applied any stylings, then this--\nthe HTML that they published, will get whatever styling\nis from its parent. So say our business had\na particular font they liked, any post could be rendered\nin that font here. Similarly, you can add\ninformation around the outside\nof this post. So here we've added, like,\na \"buy now\" button, so that would then contact,\nin this case, our Google Checkout account, um, the user--the customer would\nthen go be able to send us a purchase request, and we could process that, uh, with however way we've got\nset up for our company. Okay, now a third type\nof resource that Brett was mentioning was these lists of posts. So in the new Google\ninfrastructure for APIs, the lists work nicely in that they sort of just wrap\nthe existing resources. So here our list of posts is just a list\nof these post models that we've already--\nknow how to load. We already have defined\na view for. So what we're doing\nfor this section is, uh, the model\nis effectively the same, the API call, instead of\nto a single I.D. Post, now we're doing it\nto the entire collection, um, which we can paginate\nif we--however we like. And so we do /posts, and that gives us, uh,\nquite literally, just a list of these\npost objects. And--sorry--as we expand\non this, we'll be able to add\nquery parameters. So you could say give me all\nposts that have a certain label, so maybe it's\n\"half-price\" label, or, uh, \"blue vase\" label, or whatever labels you're adding to help you categorize\nyour products. You'll be able\nto grab that category out of your\nproduct information. And then the nice thing\nwith the same model is that we can reuse\nthe same view. Uh, in this case,\nwe will have the product and then sort of navigation, so you can sort of\ntraverse through time to go--to delve\ninto past products. Now the code for this is very similar to before. So we've reused the views. Um, we've got a-- uh, one view for doing\nthe list of posts, but really that's just comprised\nof this single post view and navigation, um,\nplus some events, so you can click left or right\nto go back and forwards. Um, how we display this\non the main page is similar to how\nwe did before. Uh, rather than adding a tab\nto get the most recent deal, we can add a tab to get\nthe list of previous deals. And then once that API call\ncomes back, we take that list, uh, push it into the HTML, and then it will get rendered, uh, whenever\nthe fetch comes back. Okay, so the difference here is the initial landing page\nwill look the same, but there will be a third tab,\nwhich you probably, again, won't be able to see\nunder this black screen. Um, but yeah,\nso that information, once we fetch it from the API, will then be displayed\ninto our page, uh, and be able to be viewed\none page at a time. Okay, let's see if that\npicked it up. Probably not yet. Okay. So looking at the new client. Yep, you've got the same\nintroduction page as before, um, you've got the same\nsingle deal as before, but now we've added, like, a little stylized\nreflection here. You can navigate\nthrough previous deals. So these are the ones\nthat we've had. And as you can see\nfrom this page, that's exactly the content\nthat's come from the blog. Now one advantage\nthat you get from this is that if your--\nyour clients, or the people running\nthe business, say, they're visiting\ntheir own web site, and they see maybe\nthey had a-- there's a spelling incorrect\nin one of the products, or maybe the price\nthat it's been offered at, they want to adjust it slightly 'cause, say,\nit's really popular, what they can do is go to\nour Blogger editing-- uh, publishing U.I., so long as they've been added as an author\nor an admin of the blog, they can then go and correct\nout the content their selves, in either, uh,\nHTML editing mode or in our WYSIWYG, uh, NicEdit editing experience. Plus, as we're pushing out new features to this new U.I., so, for instance, now we're\nmaking it look slightly nicer, act faster, we could be adding\nfeatures to our editor-- that entire publishing\nexperience will be improved\nfor your clients, So they can add links. They could add videos, um, even custom JavaScript\ninside each product. Um, they could have\nan original template which each product\nis based off, and so they could then\npull in the image, uh, pull in\nthe short description, and then it would only take,\nsay, a few minutes to get one of these product\npages up and running. Okay, the final resource\nthat we haven't covered yet that I'll be using\nin this demo is displaying feedback about\neach of your products. So the resource\nwe're using here is the collection\nof comments, which, as before, is just a list of these comment model objects. So that includes, like,\nwhich products they are on, um, which blog they are on, which would be the same\nin this case, uh, their HTML content, and the person who wrote it. So we do support\nanonymous commenting, so it might not\nalways be there, if the comment\nwas made anonymously, but for most users, you'll get, like, their name, a profile picture\nif they have one, and things that let you display\nthe comment in a nice way. Uh, finally, to display it, we'll just add a section down at the bottom of each post. So because the comment data isn't available at first, we'll sort of start this out,\nuh, collapsed, if there are comments\non the post, and then once it's expanded, we can basically go off,\ndo that call. Once that data comes back, we can fill out all the comments that have been made\non that product. Okay, so translating this\ninto the code. Uh, for each post, we want to enable this little comment section\ndown at the bottom. That's what this, uh,\nbit of the template that I'm uncovering there is-- it's the section that will\nexpand out once you click on it. Hooking them up--\nthat up to the post itself, uh, firstly, we need to add\na bit of event logic to handle making the API call once you, uh, expand it out. But once that's done,\nwe'll get just a simple list of this comment\nmodel object back and push that into the HTML one after another. And for those who are curious, this is exactly what\nour comment model looks like. So, uh, because the way that\nGWT is written in Java, uh, you sort of need accesses into this JavaScript\nthat's returned, 'cause you can't easily, uh, use it just as JavaScript. Um, but in this case,\nwe have small wrappers that go across\neach of the attributes, so for our content\nin our comment, we just have this \"get content\"\nmodel--or, method. The one other nice thing\nabout this is for those who saw\nthe talk earlier today, um, part of the common\nAPIs infrastructure that we are launching\nthis API on is a discovery document, which tells you\nfor each resource you have exactly what these properties\nwill be. So you can think, for each\nof our model objects-- so here I've got like\nblog, comment, post-- all of that code can be\nautomatically generated for you. You don't even have to worry\nabout any of that, and it will give you typed\naccess to all of the values that you're pulling back\nfrom the blog. Okay, so once we've got\nthis comment data, um, we make no change\nto the overall view, because if you remember, this is only being added\nto the--each post, um, and so the initial view-- the initial load\nwill look very similar. You'll get the blog information,\nthe blog description, and because of the way\nthat we set it up here, uh, any post that doesn't-- or any product that doesn't\nhave any comments won't have that section\ndown at the bottom, but for the ones that we do, you'll get this new, uh,\nexpandable div. Okay, so I switch\nback to our client. You get the same\ninitial page. Uh, you get today's special. And as you can see, just--\nnow it does have comments. We'll navigate\nto this area, and for whichever pages\nhave comments-- remember, the comment data\nhasn't loaded yet, so even if it had\n50 comments, that wouldn't have slowed down\nour initial page load. But once we click it,\nwe'll go off to the API call to blog--Blogger API--sorry,\ngoogleapis.com/blogger/v2, and then /blog/blog ID, /post/post ID, and now /comments. Grab that information--\nthat comment data back, and then use it\nto fill out this HTML. So we expand it,\nwe get the comment, and there you go.\nThere's the comment data. Um, you can even add caching,\nso that every time you load it, uh, the comments\nare still there. And this is the same\nfor any post. So now we go off.\nThere's that comment data. And we can navigate through. So there you have it. It's like a small GWT app\nthat you can use to display, uh, for the use case\nof having a business which has, like,\na list of products and one that's on special, but you can imagine taking this and applying it to whatever\nblog you are interested in. So you could--if you had, uh, tolls for the views\nthat you have, you could easily run, say,\nthree different business blogs. Or in the case\nof the dynamic views, um, if you make it\ngeneral enough, you can, in fact,\napply that client view to whatever blog\nyou're interested in. So if I change the blog I.D.\nthat this is pointing at, um, to, say,\nmy own personal blog, I'd be able to read my blog\nin that format instead. Now as Brett said,\nwe haven't, uh, launched this API on the googleapis.com\nsite yet. Uh, the interesting thing\nabout today was opening a discussion to see what sort of information people would like on, uh, attached to each resource. So we have blogs.\nWe have posts and pages for the more static content,\num, plus comments, but we're still solidifying down what information\nwill be available. And similarly, for now,\nwe're concentrating more on, like, a read-only API, so as you have seen, we're fetching\ninformation from Blogger, um, and-- but we don't yet\nhave exposed ways to put content back in. Uh, but that's more of a matter\nof we're hoping the solidify the model objects first\nto really see what sort of visualizations\npeople want, whether it be for a business\nor for an overall blog. And then once that's settled, we can see at ways to be able to publish that new content from whatever visualization\nyou like. So you can imagine setting up, uh, your business\npublishing page, where you've got maybe\nfour forms-- uh, I'm sorry--\na form with, say, four fields like image, uh,\nmedium description, price, uh, longer description. You hit a button, publish that information\nto the Blogger API. That will get added\nto the overall blog, which has the--\nsay you have customers that use RSS readers, or use our new e-mail\nsubscription to the blog feature, they will get that information\nas soon as it's posted. But then additionally, if you have\none of these clients, you'll get that information\nas soon as it's there. Um, and so, say,\nwe had a new post-- once you load today's special, that will grab the most recent\npost from the blog, so you don't\nhave to worry about updating your overall\nbusiness web site. Okay, that's it from this demo. I'll throw you back over\nto Brett to close out. Morgan: Okay. [speaking indistinctly] Okay, so what did we\nshow you today? First off, I talked you through\nwhy you should use Blogger. Then we looked at three ways\nof using Blogger, including our new upcoming API, which we'll be getting out there\nreally soon now, and finally, we had\na live coding exercise. Um, if you've got some feedback, or you're twittering about us, please use those hash tags\nso we can all follow along, and I'd really love it if you'd\ngive me feedback at that URL. But it's now time for Q & A, so there's a couple of ways you can get hold of me. There's my e-mail address,\nbrettmorgan@google.com. Second part--\nI'm on Twitter, oh, my God, and finally, there's\na Google group that I run for people developing\non top of Blogger. But we've got some\nmicrophones in the room, so questions, please? man: Hi. Thanks for\nthe presentation. Um, uh, this new API, does this, uh, is this an additional API,\nor does it replace the old one? 'Cause, uh, I've been using\nthis whole kind of model for a couple of years now,\nI think. Um, so what does that--\nwhat happens to the old-- I think it's been a while\nsince, uh, I believe it's Google data... Morgan: The Google data APIs. man: And, um, what else? Uh, it's ATOM or RSS,\npretty much... Morgan: yep.\nman: if I remember right. So I'm assuming that this will have every... Morgan: Okay, so what's\nhappening here is Google data APIs are the solid--everyone\nknows how to use them. We've got them well tuned. They're--\nthey're in their platform. This is effectively\nour experimental area, where we're looking at-- Google data is all XML. It's kind of heavy.\nIt's kind of-- it's kind of nasty to use from\nJavaScript in a web browser. What we're trying to do here with all these data models\nand JSON is allow people to experiment,\nplay on the web browser or on the android phone\nor so on and so forth, be able to deal with their APIs\nin a light way that's, you know,\nbuzzword compliant, um, and talk with us and go, \"Okay, I've got this wonderful\nnew use case. How can you help me\nmake it a reality?\" so that's the discussion\nwe're looking to have here. man: okay, so it doesn't really\nreplace that whole thing? Morgan: No. Coleman: You'll still\nbe able to use that. Um, but as Brett was saying,\nthis is like a very lightweight approach.\nman: Yes. Coleman: So we do encourage\npeople to use this new system, especially as it will gain\nany advantages that are written into\nthe overall APIs infrastructure. So, like, all the server\nside libraries that are written for you, um, you'll be able to use them all\nwith this new API. Morgan: Yep.\nman: Thank you. Morgan: So basically\nto cover it back, the new API structure\nis a Google-wide thing. We have got new API libraries\ncoming out, client libraries coming out,\nso on and so forth. So if you're developing\nsomething new--yeah. man: Um, two questions...\nMorgan: yes. man: Where do you want\nthe feedback for the API? Not for the presentation--\nMorgan: Oh, for the API, you can either talk\nwith me directly, or take one of those\nthree methods. Probably the bottom one's\na really good one, 'cause that way\nyou can have a discussion with the other users who are\nalso developing atop Blogger. Coleman: Mm-hmm.\nman: Um, and conceptually, I've done client work before, and a lot of clients\nlike to think of having a CMS to manage their content...\nMorgan: Yeah. man: is that the kind\nof paradigm here? Is that what you're thinking?\nMorgan: Blogger is a CMS. man: Right.\nMorgan: It's a very light one, but, yes, it is a CMS. man: So is it--\nis there any way to, um, to--to structure the content\nin the CMS, um, beyond what a blog post is? You know, you've got your title,\nyour content, your comments. Morgan: At this point, no.\nman: All right. Okay, thanks.\nGood presentation. Morgan: Thank you, Jonah. Any other questions? Or are we all\nrushing to the bar? I think we're done.\nThank you very much. Coleman: Thank you.", "NtB4cQxAYxU": "whether you're preparing your wild game or just grinding fresh cuts of meat into burger or sausage the folks at lem have the best grinders to turn your cuts of meat into delicious fare for the whole family specifically the big bite grinders series from LEM will take your meat processing to a whole new level featuring professional-grade top of the line components big bite grinders provide you with the same quality and power as a professional-grade grinder at a consumer-grade price even better LEM is introducing a new and improved big bite grinder series in five different sizes the original big bites grind 30 to 50 percent faster than other grinders but the new and improved series will give you a premium grind and literally half the time updates include a new rifled head design and an offset larger diameter throat plus an enhanced motor for quieter performance the second grind and stuffing is now easier and faster than before the big bite in the name comes from this extra wide gap in the auger this gap lets the auger take an extra big bite of meat into the grinding chamber faster than other grinders the benefit you grind larger cuts of meat faster without stomping and without clogging up the machine big bite grinders range from a quarter horsepower up to 1.5 horsepower and will grind from four pounds up to 17 pounds of meat per minute the key to this speed is the powerful motor it is permanently internally lubricated and low maintenance and is wrapped in an attractive stainless steel housing a built-in circuit breaker ensures safe operation the larger meat pan and feed throat allow you to keep running longer without reloading meat into the pan a food-grade plastic stopper is included but rarely needed but when you do it will keep your fingers clear the dangerous parts we use the big bite grinders from LEM for all of our game processing but they're also great for making sausages like these bratwursts each big bite grinder comes with three different sizes of food grade plastic stuffing tubes a sausage stuffing plate as well as a coarse and fine grind plates are also standard equipment with your grinder when you are done big bite grinders easily disassembled for easy cleanup with just soap and water they can also be gently lubricated with LEM s food grade silicone spray to keep them running and looking

fit the new disc somebody recently commented and said that the column that's to get the pin wrench in it to undo the knot because of the debt of the actual disc that they were using so you can get some of these now that are thick and that does make it difficult to get to the actual not to undo it but you can do it easily using your hum as long as you are wearing a good quality glove all you need to do is press in the spindle lock and lock the disc and then all you need to do is turn it in an antique clockwise direction in some instances you do need to get some momentum by striking it with the palm of your hand like so punches on that it will then loosen you can then remove the disc when it comes to me fitting the desk you can simply place it in position take the not spin that all the way down then all you need to do is all that with your thumb and gently turn the disc and the nuts and that will actually lock it in position when you actually use that now it'll actually tight it up as it spins so there's not a chance at all of that coming loose and let you don't tighten it up properly in the first place so it is a very handy tip but it's something that you shouldn't really do you should always use the pin wrench but if you are of a stock and you do need to get it off all you need to do is give it a strike like so and that will then undo it the only time you love difficult to doing it is when you use a thin selecting disc like that or a cutting disc if you try and do it via disc like that you will actually break the disc that doesn't matter so much if you removing the old one and you're throwing it away but these discs are that thin that they are easily broke so if you do strike that you're definitely going to break it sometimes what you can do with discs when they're not borne down is you can actually press in the spindle lock you can simply get all of it and just turn it in an anti-clockwise direction and that will undo it if the nut is really tight and you can do you may have to strike it but it is going to break the disk you would then have to discard it once you put a new one on again all you need to do is nip it up tight like sore just give it a turn and that will actually turn it off once that starts alternating it will actually tighten up the disk so this is something that you really shouldn't do but you can do in emergencies it's important when you do it that you do have a good permit gloves on if you try doing this would be bare hand there's a good chance that you're going to injure yourself so you do need a good quality pair of

And today,\nwe're going to be talking about the Black Pepper, or the 'Pepper of\nCommerce' or the culinary pepper. And the botanical name of the pepper is Piper nigrum, and it is a endemic species,\nand native to South India, in the lowlands, or humid and hot\ntropics. And this is a potted plant that we have,\nshowing you the fruit, green fruit, here; then this is\nthe ripening fruit. This is cutting taken from our mother plant, but this\nactually shows you the initiation of the flowers. So, they come\nout as a small stem, like this. Flowers form along the buds, and then as\nthe fruit matures, it changes to these round, green corns, and eventually, as you\ncan see here, it turns red. And it is at this point that the\npeppercorn can be picked, and dried for use. The pepper, or Piper nigrum, makes a great container plant for moderate-light areas, east to west\nwindows; where they can be grown on the windowsill, and preferring temperatures above 60\ndegrees. So, one of the issues that growers or gardeners find with the pepper\nis that they have, on the backsides of their leaves, these small little beads that form, and we can see here, up on these leaves there's these black spots. This is a question that we get\ncontinuously, thinking that it's an insect and actually\nit's not it's part of the plant. There's an exudate of sugar; a little\nbead of sugar that forms on the backsides of the leaves, and over time turns black. The sooty molds,\nor opportunistic molds, attack and feed on it. It creates no harm\nto the plant at all. Another thing about the pepper, is that is\nyear-round fruiting. So, we do have flowers and fruit coming,\nand so there's an endless supply of peppercorns that one can harvest off of\nthem. Generally, in the Northeast, we have cooler temperatures and shorter\ndays so things do slow down a bit, but we can pretty much count on the\npepper being in fruit and in flower year-round\nfor us. And they are a vine; they don't climb and tangle over things\nbut they do climb up things. And, their culture can be either allowed to grow in a basket, where they may hang down, but then you have to deal with the vine tangling up -- or, they can be staked, and an example of that is a stake, here, which is kind of pulling the plant together. As in all\nplants, their is a need for fertilization, and\npeppers are what we could consider a low to moderate feeder. We generally would recommend fertilization of a balanced\nfertilizer. That would be a soluble salt that you mix\nwith water, or a granular organic, which is top-dressed; just sprinkled on the top of the soil once a month, maybe in a dilute form every two weeks during the growing season. They can have\ntoo much, so one needs to be cautious about that, and as a rule of thumb, if they have higher light, they need more,\nand the temperatures are warm. If they have lower light, then it needs\nto be reduced; and as we go into the winter months, make sure that you reduce\nor restrict the fertilizer so that they don't burn from it. Peppers are resilient plants to grow, and we have produced them now for a\nnumber of years. And they do have a few issues, in terms\nof their culture, if we violate some of their needs of watering, fertilization, and temperature. One\nwould be root diseases, which they have susceptibility to under cool, wet conditions. And as you can\nsee, this plant is being grown in a clay pot. They are plants that prefer a little bit\non the dry side; and also, a container like this, allow\nthe plant to really fill it out before you re-pot it. So, that drying down-- that period of\ndryness between waterings-- is what's going to maintain a healthy root system\nfor you. The other thing is that they do have\nsome susceptibility to insects. We'd consider them a low insect\nattracting plant. One of the main ones that we see on\nit, from time to time, and we don't see it very often, is mealy bug can get on them. They really have no problem with spider mites, or thrips, or aphids, and\nmany the other insects that affect container plants. So, thank you for watching this video and try a pepper. Its probably one of the easier fruiting plants you can grow in the windowsill.", "8hCWbhtONgI": "[Music] grinder reviewed presents the five best spice grinder let's get started with the list starting

we have to look at today so if you want that fresh ground coffee for you know making a better cup but you're on a budget we got a couple of lower cost grinders here both from crops these are crops models we have the GX 6000 and the gbx2 now what makes it grinder a little less expensive well a couple things number one the burst size we're going to take this off so you can have a look at these birds a little bit of a brighter size matter well you know and I'm slightly more expensive grinder you're going to get a conical burr as opposed to the flat ceramic steer that we're going to see in just a second so that is a flat ceramic bird you can see it's rather small now if you're using a blade grinder believe me this is way better than a blade grinder okay because this doesn't hack your coffee up into bits with nice this actually grinds the coffe so there's the internal burr the gbx2 over here it's going to have a very stiff well pretty much exactly the same burr here although much easier to get out also you know what a grinder of this type you're going to find that I'm sure that got that back in there it will grind with these you're going to find a lot more plastic now the crops actually do have a little bit of metal on them both of these grinders have adjustments they dial in the number of cups that you want to grind for now that's all going to be very relative and actually on this grind I don't like it because you can't see it and I think the majority of people you're just going to start grinding and then stop when you have enough um same thing over here I do like this one actually a little bit better because it's on the front so you can actually see what you're doing here then a start button here but listen to that that bird is just flying okay and one thing with coffee when you grind it very very fast with a very small bird it's going to heat up the coffee and it's going to evaporate some of the flavors out of there by heating it up so one thing to keep in mind I mean you're still going to benefit from freshly ground coffee but you get a little more benefit if you you know we're spend a little bit more on a grinder look if you're on a budget grind size adjustment on the DV x2 is on the side here you have eighteen grind settings on both grind setting adjustment over here is what you'd find for them to get this back in here and quite a process to get a pepper screw that in yeah a lot of threads there so almost there we go okay so you can see the little arrow here and then you have some beans that get bigger as you go around so you're just around here fine up to course okay this one has a power button as well so you turn the power on decide how many cups you want to grind for again this can be kind of relative and then press the start button and again those birds are spinning very very fast which isn't necessarily a good thing as we talked about right you lose some of that flavor in a row yeah but only hit the button there so grinds container going to grind into this right here the six thousand and I run the two it's like this okay so let's put some beans in them and see what they're like when they're grinding now these are fresh out of the box a lot of times people tell you you know gotta grind a little bit of coffee through a grinder to get break it in a little bit you won't see a huge difference it's not completely necessary especially if you're doing drip and I would only use these I would use these for espresso - all these types of grinders this is drip and pour over and that kind of thing yeah so let's go we'll go all the way course with this one I'm turning it on first I'll stop that there we take a look at this oh there's our grind you know I can actually feel just a little bit of warmth from it I didn't grind a lot you know it looks like a lot of uneven particle sizes there yeah you're gonna find that you know when you get up into Corsa range as you will get some unevenness here you know if you spent a little bit more on a grinder you'd get more consistency in the particle so I so something to keep in mind if you're doing like press and you don't want a lot of fines and you're in your coffee and we should have what setting did you have that on the courses we were yeah we were on the courses here you know what let's just see just for fun what it will do with the finest setting here lid back on take it all the way to the finest now this what stop automatically effort mom just gonna stop it on its own here now see we go for fun so yeah I mean we're getting close to like an espresso find this hmm I'd wanted a lot finer for espresso so again but you wouldn't use this grinder first rest so anyways so so there's that I keep on hitting that button alright so let's go all the way course with this one we got our beans and yet in this one you know out of the two I actually like this one that are they they are very close in price these two grinders why do you like this one better you know just because it's not it's it's smaller it's got the same burger the same power and I like to control up front rather than on the side mm-hmm so I can actually see it so there's our coarse grind okay not actually extra coarse quite often it's really not very different come the courses grind on the other cups grinder let's go all the way fine see you I'll have a little bit left over always there this one seems to be a little finer you know so okay but I think you're you know you're going to be fine with either if you're if you're grinding for you know get rid of them and that stuff that so again that is the crops GX 6000 and the crops gvx to these are budget grinders again when want to use in first press oh but up in the drip ranges they they can might fit somebody's budget alright great they're both available whole latte love calm I'm mark thanks for watching hey why not subscribe now for easy free access to more videos on everything coffee brought to you by whole latte love calm", "d4bhhGKpmxM": "but YouTube my name's Jeff and I'm the vigil guy I've been sent these wood cutting angle grinder blade by the company that makes them they wanted me to test it and share my thoughts as the angle grinder is probably my favorite tool I was happy to give it a girl straight away you can see on the packaging that this blade describes itself as a speed cutter and believe me it is it's not an abrasive blade which is typical for a grinder it's a cutting blade but interestingly it only has three teeth now you might think this is a bad thing especially if you're used to see in circular saw blades well as someone who's been daft enough to experiment with sword blades in angle grinders I can tell you that three teeth is actually a good thing it reduces the possibility of kickback that feeling that the work is trying to attack you when installing the blade it's important to match the rotation of the blade with your grinder so check for those telltale errors here you can see me cut in a flaw old wooden chair the blade is very fast and there's absolutely no kickback at all I expected to feel some but the cutting action was swift and smooth leaving me feeling fully in control if you want to get through material quickly this blade is certainly for you the combination of angle grinder power and the wealth or temp design of the blade makes cutting absolutely effortless there's no feeling of work on the tool the blade or the user [Music] [Music] here on making a wolf rebate a channel about an inch deep in this eight by two bit of timber again it's very easy I'm not being very tidy and I could take more time but if I'm being honest I'm just interested in proving I can hack a wire section nice and quickly glutes would have been helpful as I can feel the Deborah striking my knuckles but as my mom always used to say where there's no sense there's no feeling this blade is certainly a lot quicker than a chisel it's a tough little blade with just the most gentle touch it's possible to carve or bite large sections of these I'm not a sculptor but I can imagine anyone working with wood would appreciate the speed that this play can cook through the material the jiggling action of my hand is made by the way and not the blade bouncing now here you can see me turning a bowl shaped guard for a friend it's two thicknesses of MDF glued together and spawning my drill press again this is completely effortless I'm being careful to get with the rotation of the drill press but there's no kickback and this blade is shipped in a lot of material very quickly [Music] I know what you're thinking now that's dog ruff right well hang on a second the blades done its job but just let me apply it it'll be the sandpaper [Music] doesn't look too bad now does it he arrived flip work over in the drill press and I'm attempting to carve away a little material in truth this is made trickier by having the cameras out close again the Biddle's sandpaper is needed to finish the job off and when you see the finished work you can see just how much material was removed and genuinely it was just the blade in the sandpaper the plate is good for all sorts of woods and can be used to cook plasterboard aerated concrete blocks and plastics I understand I'll be honest I haven't tested everything but I can't really see any reason why it wouldn't manage so what are my thoughts I like it I really do it's great for fast cutting and fast carving it requires only the most gentle of touches and it's effortless in news there's no kickback and you feel safe and in control whilst using it I suspect being an angle grinder that's always going to be some carrot but it's very effective and let's be honest a lot of the time cutting away the bulk of the material is the long winded element of any job and this blade massively reduces the time involved I've been lucky enough to be given this blade to review it but it's reasonably priced and available online this certainly isn't a paid endorsement if I could be bought for the price of this blade my opinion will he be worth hearing but it is an honest preview I'm pleased to have this blade in my toolbox if I ever find myself needing another I will buy one if you favor using an angle grinder and want to speed things along a little bit you might want to do the same and I think we can call that a finished video I hope you enjoyed this review guys and if you did please like it if you've got any questions about this product drop me a line as always I promise to be completely honest with my answers please subscribe if you haven't already done so and look out for my other videos on my youtube channel so that's it for now guys thanks for watching you", "qu4YdlKdzBY": "hey everyone Digital David here today in this video I'm gonna be unboxing and reviewing the Pete me dog nail grinder they did send me this product review but any opinion expressed in this video is strictly my own that being said if you're interested in this product a link to it will be in my video description below please go ahead check it out and do your shopping from there while you're at it check out some of the other Pete me products I've reviewed on my channel as well you can see how this one comes packaged to you in a nice and simple retail box a couple of specs about this product it's for small medium and large size pets it's low vibration and noise it's rechargeable via USB and it has a diamond bit now let's go ahead let's open it up and look at the package contents here all the package contents first up we have your user guide and manual complete with charts and diagrams showing you how to setup and operate the grinder next you can see we have your USB type 8 a micro USB charging cable followed by a grinding wheel tip right here then we have the grinder itself so you can see we have our control switch right here so it's currently off we can turn it on a medium speed and on high speed right there we have their logo and branding at the bottom on this side you can see we have our micro USB charging port here it is from the backside it has nice built-in indents for easy grip and handling we can remove the protective cover and cap to reveal the rest of the grinder so we can see at the top we have our grinding wheel under this black piece of plastic that we can twist off if we want to have everything exposed for larger size pets or we can keep it on and use it just like you see right here it's very easy to change out the tip ends just pull it out you can see the hole now and select whichever one you want to put back in just by gently pushing it back into place it takes around 2 hours to fully charge the grinder and you'll get around 18 hours of use before you need to recharge now let's go ahead and let's try it out you can see we got our pets right here in the nails that we need to trim when you're using the trimmer don't forget you have multiple areas that you can use to grind down the nails you have this opening right here for smaller pets you have the top opening as well for medium-sized pets and you can remove the black cap for large size pets and more flexibility and grinding down their nail just be careful while you're grinding it down not to go down too far and you can start at the medium setting if you want first for your pet to be comfortable and then you can move to the fastest highest setting as well but as you can see it's really quiet and it has minimal vibrations so it's really easy to start using it to grind down your pets nails so after spending time using the electric nail trimmer on my dog Doug I gotta say it really is simple and easy to use and it really is super quiet my dog Doug was not on edge any more than he usually is when I trim his nails so that's really nice your pet shouldn't be afraid of this nail trimmer I found that most of the time I was using it with the black cap removed that was just my own personal preference but it's nice that you have those three settings depending on what you're comfortable with and in the end I'd like to see an even faster speed setting to grind off more of the nail my dog Doug has really long nails right now so it would take me forever to use this to trim them all but for any sort of light maintenance on your pet if you consistently get in the habit of using this it really does a good job and trims them off and you don't have to worry about going too far on your pet and hurting them or anything along those lines so I really like how simple and convenient this nail trimmer is well that concludes our video thank you so much for watching don't forget the product link will be in our video description below please go ahead check it out and do your shopping

my name is Craig aka white rice but a lot of people just call me flip and on this channel we smoke we talk about we products and just kind of show if that sounds like something you'd be into hit that subscribe button it's like right here somewhere and in today's video we're going to talk about a one hundred and seventy five [ __ ] dollar grinder that I have it's [ __ ] dope but before we do anything a stuff this little raw ninety eight special I've got my amazing taco source lighter he's so beautiful so I think we hit a little slow-mo action in before we start talking about anything Cheers [Music] okay okay that was better than I expected it's a bit so I know everyone's [ __ ] anxious so I'm not gonna [ __ ] delay anything this is the [ __ ] Kubis the Cubist is [ __ ] dope because there's no screws in it so you don't have to screw or anything on or off it's completely held together magnetically it's also waterproof so if this thing falls in water or anything like that your butt is good to go and I have tested it it is [ __ ] waterproof and it's [ __ ] dope it has these [ __ ] gaskets all around everywhere that it opens to keep it nice and waterproof and the reason mine cost so much is because I customized the top with my signature logo just [ __ ] fly and I got a custom inscription on the bottom with my name so no one can [ __ ] steal it but it's also [ __ ] dope couple dope features like I said it's all put together magnetically it has this like magnetic locking system so these are held together by magnets here it also has a really deep chamber so you put a lot of [ __ ] blood in there also since months custom I can pick any colors I want so I got it this gold inside basket and the basket is also removable so if you don't like to catch Keith you can just take that out and just put it all back together like that and now you don't have a Keith catcher I think that's [ __ ] cool I do like Keith so I keep that in there like that and it all fits [ __ ] together something else I like about this is it doesn't actually look like a [ __ ] grinder it's kind of square I'll put a shot up cuz you can like kind of lean it on its side and it's kind of cool so I'll put like a shot up right here of that so it's like you can really put this like on your desk and no one really know what really is I don't think also it's completely smell proof since it's airtight so if you got bud in here and you got this like the office or some [ __ ] you really don't gotta worry because no one's gonna be able to smell nothing because it's completely air [ __ ] proof you can get these honestly I think as low as like a buck ten a hundred ten not like a dollar time but sometimes they go on sale you know for like 90 I got mine on sale for like one sixty four because I got the customer graven on the top is it worth 110 dollars it's worth 110 dollars if you just want to stun on people stun on your friends and [ __ ] and they also have like some really cool like limited edition ones like there's like a Halloween one I'll put that up it's like a pumpkin and [ __ ] it's [ __ ] dope and you can get them with ash trees in the top like if you didn't want to logo here or if you didn't want to leave this blank right here they have like ashtrays you can get it cost a little bit extra money or you can get an ashtray in the top did you want an ashtray also the fact the fact that it's like [ __ ] airtight makes it really good because I don't know about any of you guys but for me cuz I don't want to [ __ ] up like where the keith goes or like how much Keef I have so I never really clean my life my bottom pieces out so what I did since its waterproofing it worked perfectly well I just like took the top half of this off like this and I laid it upside down when I cleaned it for the video and I just poured I just poured [ __ ] a [ __ ] that should be called rubbing alcohol thank you I just like pour rubbing alcohol like right down through these holes until it filled up until I could like see the water coming up through the holes a little bit and I just let it sit there for like a couple hours and then dumped all the water out and like kind of went around it and cleaned it all out and [ __ ] and it worked [ __ ] perfectly which is [ __ ] dope and that is my $175 cuba's grinder they're [ __ ] dope and I think I'm actually gonna do like a more in-depth like detailed review on this once the studio is back up and running because the studio currently still looks like this so that's not [ __ ] good that's never gonna work but so I do want to do like another video of it like when the studio's back put together when the damage is all fixed just because you know it looks nicer down there than it does out here I mean it's nice to do videos outside and once a while but I don't know it's kind of getting old don't forget to do all that [ __ ] normal youtubers tell you to do at the end of their videos like comment share and subscribe they're all really big especially since we're still really new and I'll see you guys next time face the Cubist's alright so sorry the Cubist's probably too far what have you taken a few marijuana", "UMp-IF6uPkk": "I'm challenging someone who I think you may know Someone that I know can almost cook anything on the planet someone who really knows these beef Wellington's all of you, please welcome the amazing Me! That's right today. I'll show you how to make the most amazing shrimp scampi in literary ten minutes Let's have 10 minutes on the clock. You guys ready? Let's go Now the first thing you need, of course you get that water boiling, 90% of this battle is all about the prep Okay, so shrimp scampi. I'm gonna start off with a shallot I'll chop that don't go fine dice. Just slice it. Okay, again a lot quicker. So slice it in half Okay, if you slice it too thin it's gonna burn so just slice the nice slices Shallots beautifully done. I like the shallots over the onion the shallots make it a little bit sweeter and more importantly it's a lot easier to digest Slice the onions don't get too fancy. Okay from there little splash of olive oil now Water's boiling, splash of oil in, splash the oil in. I actually like this with a little bit of heat in there Okay, so I got some chili flakes, I'm going to finish it with some fresh basil Once the oil is up to temp shallots in, now caramelize those shallots Lightly season them okay? A bit of salt and pepper I don't worry if they don't break down easily by the time they're cooked they'll start breaking down now from there A little drizzle of olive oil, okay,? Get that turning in, break down the shallots now when you're cooking and You're up against it time wise, trust me start using techniques rather than chopping everything So I've got this microplane that we use obviously - to grate parmesan, lemon take a nice clove of garlic. Okay, and literally grate that Over those shallots the garlic disintegrates so much quicker. Okay, you get right down to the wire and look underneath there It's beautiful. It's sort of almost purees the garlic for you. And then from there take a little knife Take that all in there. So tap it And literally get that really nice Caramelization on that garlic and those wonderful shallots now once you've browned off the shallots Okay from there Literally turn up the heat, get that really nice and hot now start off too hot and you'll burn those shallots Okay Check in on the time Now a little touch of chili flake. Okay chili flakes in there Lightly sprinkle, those chili flakes. You can always add more heat but you can't take it away. So be smart with that and then Get your tomatoes, I want a little bit of acidity in this dish. And again, I'm going to just cut these tomatoes in half Okay, and what's that gonna do? It's gonna blister in the pan but more importantly it's gonna give it that really nice sweetness Three or four little cherry tomatoes, okay? That's where the acidity comes in, open them up And you'll hear them sort of almost start to blister and roast. Now, as the 'matoes start to break down Okay, my shallots are caramelizing, the garlic has disintegrated beautifully Break those down and then from there, I'm going to deglaze the pan Basically, I'm gonna sort of clean the pan out with a little tablespoon of white wine White wine goes in Turn up the gas Break that down. Now look what's happening, the tomatoes are disintegrating, the shallots Are super caramelized, that garlic's disappeared, chili flakes giving it the heat And then from there a tablespoon of stock: vegetable stock, chicken stock Or even fish stock in don't flood it, okay Try to create a really nice sauce. You don't start cooking your pasta until that is absolutely ready. Okay Now once that's on and it starts to sort of reduce down Literally back on How long we got? Um... 7 minutes Oh my lord, I'll go for a run Get your pan on Keep that boil rolling for your pasta. Get your pan on nicely. Now. Look at that It's reduced down to a syrup. This is where it goes even more fragrant. Take your basil Get your largest leaf, your small leaves on the outside Okay and from there The nice thing about that, get your large leaf Okay, get the small leaves, tuck them inside the large leaf and roll it like a beautiful big cigar Okay? Hold it nice and tight let the knife do the work and Literally chiffonade that basil, now, here's where it goes up a notch, okay? That's beautiful caramelizing down there. Okay? Nice! Basil goes on So we're halfway, just under five minutes to go. Capers: a little bit of the acid and saltiness there But look, that's the sauce. That's Where the magic is right there, so we're halfway Now take your shrimp. Okay? lightly season the shrimp salt and pepper seasoned nicely salt pepper Okay, get them really nicely seasoned They only take literally 90 seconds to cook, 90 seconds for the pasta, 90 seconds for the shrimp. Okay. My pan is nice and hot Teaspoon of olive oil in there, in with the pasta and look I want color on those shrimp, they go in Beautiful Shrimp are in Don't overseer these shrimp. Okay? They turn dry So the nice thing now is that shrimp are on, sauce is ready. Take your capellini in to your water okay, in That starts to boil up, take it, twist it round and it literally cooks in 90 seconds, turn up the gas, turn that around and you'll see that coming together, beautifully Time please how long left? Ahh... Just under 4 minutes. Once that shrimp are colored, look, take them off the gas, turn them around Okay, look at the color on there. Beautiful, really beautiful. Pasta's boiling Watch olive oil on top, beautifully done. Take that zest of lemon. And I want to literally Zest my lemon over there Look at that. We're just under three minutes to go Pasta's cooking nicely. I using a capellini, okay? So it's super thin and really quick to cook I haven't overfilled the pan with water. Sometimes you put too much water in the pan. You lose the capellini. So keep the water to a minimum shrimp Beautifully rested I'm going to put them in to my sauce. There, just like that Bring that back up to temp Now look The less water you've got in that pasta The quicker it cooks, okay? And from there, take that out, check Still nice and firm. So literally another 30 seconds in there Sometimes when you fill up a pan with water you put your capellini in and you lose it all so I like the small pan Half full of water and so the pasta cooks quicker, but you don't lose anything Shrimp resting back inside the shallots and the blistered tomatoes and look So just under two minutes to go, capellini literally is... you go through it with your fingers It's cooked colander in back over out Draining under the pan. I like putting the capellini back into the pan and then literally mixing that around Glazing it with oil. 60 seconds to go now shrimp, capellini I'm gonna mix that shrimp with my capellini Beautifully done In, not too much pasta Remember the hero is the shrimp and then look I'm mixing this all up now. Beautifully done, I'm gonna twist that round I'm going to sit the pasta and beautifully in the center of the plate and then garnish that in my shrimp Now, I want all those shallots and all that beautiful sauce And look, how do I finish that? for dinner Honestly Parmesan over the top Right at the last minute and then finally, just a nice pinch Of zest and then very quickly The lemon and fresh lemon and there you have the most amazing shrimp capellini done in 10 minutes Do not forget to subscribe to my amazing Youtube channel and good luck!

I\u2019m Mark from eReplacementParts.com.\nIn this video I am going to show you how to replace the upper spindle bearing on a Makita\ngrinder. The upper spindle bearing is one of two bearings on your Grinder\u2019s spindle.\nLike any bearing, eventually it will wear out. Signs that a bearing is going bad will\nbe squeaking or squealing sounds coming from the tool; excessive heat in the gearbox area; or sometimes, the shaft will actually come loose and you will be able to move it side-to-side. Replacing the bearing is easy to do. And I\u2019m going to do is show you how.\nUpper spindle bearings, as well as many other parts, can be found on our website. Let's get started. I'll begin by removing the side-handle and\nthe guard. The gearbox housing is held in place with four screws. I\u2019ll go ahead and remove those. Now I can remove the spindle assembly by removing the four screws that secure it to the housing. Now I\u2019ll remove the upper spindle bearing. To do that, I use a bearing separator. I place the separator\naround the bearing and then I tighten up the nuts on the separator. Just finger tight is\nfine. Now I\u2019ll place the bearing separator, with the spindle assembly attached, over my vice. I have opened the jaws so the spindle assembly will just fit between them. Now I can use a punch and a hammer to remove the bearing. Now I can install the upper shaft\nbearing. I\u2019ll place it onto the end of the spindle, and, using a socket that has a diameter the same as the inner-race diameter on the bearing... ...I\u2019ll place the socket on the race\nand tap it in place with the hammer. Now I\u2019ll install the spindle assembly back onto the gearbox housing. And I'll secure it with the screws. There is an O-ring on the spindle\nassembly, so I want to seat the screws evenly as that O-ring slides into place. So I am\njust going to work my way around the housing tightening each screw a little at a time. I\u2019ll reinstall the gear housing assembly to the motor assembly... ...and secure it with the four screws. Then I\u2019ll finish up by installing the guard... ...and the side-handle. And that\u2019s how you replace the upper spindle\nbearing on a Makita grinder.

The armature is the main component of your grinder's motor. It consists of the wire windings,\nthe commutator, the cooling fan and two bearings. There are several common problems or failures\nwith armatures, one of which would be burnt windings. When the windings overheat and get\nburnt, it's not uncommon to see burning on the wires themselves or the insulation around\nthe wires. A worn or damaged commutator is another common problem. Oftentimes, the commutator bar or more than\none bar will break away from the commutator. The cooling fan could be easily damaged if\na piece of metal or other debris gets into the grinder. It's not uncommon to have several of the cooling fins or even all of the cooling fins torn away from the fan. If this occurs,\nthe motor won't properly cool, and it will quickly overheat and cause damage to the windings.\nAnd of course, any bearing will wear over time and need to be replaced. Replacing the armature assembly is easy to\ndo and I'm going to show you how. Armatures, as well as many other parts, can be found\non our website. Let's get started. I'll begin by removing the side handle and\nthe guard. The gearbox housing is held in place with four screws. I'll go ahead and remove those. Now I can remove the rear\nhousing. It's held in place with a single screw. Now I will move the brush springs to\nthe side of the brush holder. This removes the tension from the brushes so they are not\npressing against the armature. I will do this on both sides. With the tension removed from the brushes,\nnow I can go ahead and remove the armature assembly. Now I will remove the drive gear.\nIt's secured with a nut. Now I will remove the front armature bearing and the gear housing\ncover from the armature. To do that, I will place the cover in the open jaws on my vise.\nThen using a rubber mallet, I will tap the armature shaft away from the bearing. Now I can install the gear housing cover assembly\nback onto the armature. I\u2019ll seat the bearing back on to the armature shaft using a socket\nthat has a diameter the same as the diameter on the inner-bearing race. Now I can reinstall\nthe drive gear and secure it with the nut. Now I can install the armature assembly back\ninto the grinder. I\u2019ll reinstall the gear housing assembly to the motor assembly and\nsecure it with the four screws. Now reposition the brush spring back over the brush. Now\nI will slide the rear cover back over the motor housing and secure it with the screw.\nAnd I\u2019ll finish up by installing the guard and the side handle.

like to show you how to replace disc or blade in an angle grinder this is pretty easy especially if you've got tool like this usually when you buy when you buy angle grinder this is in the set but sometimes you can you might loss it so anyway I show you how to do it with this tool or without basically usually on the other side you've got a small lock button which you have to press otherwise the discs still spinning so you press this button now this is locked so you take in this key and you push it to the right then remove this nut remove this disc this obviously stay where it is all the time keep this button locked can you put in your disc on and back back and you have to tight it to the opposite way now you can release the lock and that's it another way when you lose this key or you don't know where it is you can use the locking pliers just the biggest problem is to untie this nut so do the same lock this button then use the pliers tight it as much as possible and do it like this [Music]", "yeXli6AkXzI": "hey folks at scale from Seattle coffee gear and we have Jamie from DeLonghi from New Jersey early New Jersey yeah and he's here to give us the lowdown and on the dynamic ax this is the latest and the greatest of their super automatic machines on the market and what this machine does that the others don't iced coffee iced coffee yep but let's talk about all the features of course absolutely yep absolutely so yeah it is it is touted as the it's the only fully automatic with it's called true brew over ice but it's iced coffee it's espresso over ice hot espresso over ice but it's very similar to a lot of our other fully automatic machines so we have our integrated bean hopper with our 13 grind settings that you can do how much does it hold ten and a half ounces of beans a lot of right there grinders are right on top so obviously as you are brewing your espresso and you're using certain beans if you're getting under or over extraction you can adjust that while it's grinding and a bypass slot so if you're doing pre ground espresso or decaf only one scoop don't don't fill it we've had people fill the chute right to the top you know and it holds quite a bit and they're like why didn't it work I mean it does say max one but be sure to be sure that is bypassing the grinder and you could do your decaf espresso or flavored espresso whatever what not exactly fun on top and then we have our control panel over here so all the warning lights are over here if you need to replace your water or it's time to descale or empty out the waste bin you have your strength icon right over here so it says just touch goes from one to five so from or right and you can write to go right to the end and then you have your little scoop and it comes to the scoop right and it comes with the scoop yeah it comes with scoop it comes with a little cleaning brush it also comes with a little descaling solutions for you [Music] right there you can adjust that and then you've got your espresso and your lungo yeah and you can double each of those so if you just want to do you just go to three for now so you can do a double or regular size double the volume in the cup double the volume yet for the espresso and lungo sizes we're gonna do what does it do different to make it over ice so it's that's a very good question because is it just the same thing with an over ice button no so it does have a longer grinding time so it does grind for a little bit longer so you get a higher dosage for the liquid you've already got going on exactly exactly it's hard it also does a longer pre-infusion oh so it helps to pre infuse longer so you get that concentrated espresso coming out yeah and it also does a longer extraction so you get a longer espresso over your ice and by the time it's done you've got delicious iced coffee you know behind the scenes here here's your drip tray and all the stuff that you know comes apart for cleaning all dishwasher safe all dishwasher safe certainly want to do that especially liquid and water etc with the grinds water tank 60 ounces yeah which is nice and it also kind I forgot to say that dynamic also comes with a water filter so charcoal water filter that you can pop right into there DeLonghi was one of the first companies that had the water tank coming out of the front yeah and now they're all copying you pretty much yeah they're trying its convenience that's for sure I always push it all the way back and you don't have to worry and the brewer unit brewing in it it's behind the scenes it can only be removed when the unit is off but it's accessible from the side so that about once a month usually I'll do that I'll just rinse it under warm water you don't have to move any of the parts on the brewing in it don't move anything don't take lubricant and and and other things that keep that moving nice and smooth there we go close that up but is removable which is really nice yeah everything's front loading which is really great and this machine is not huge no it's another thing I like about it it's very compact this is your simulated drip style or low pressure coffee so if somebody comes over and says I want just a cup of joe just to traditional cup of coffee that's found in some of our other models so like the Magnificat cappuccino smart has that so you can do it drip style coffee lower pressure and then steam push that to steam and it was pannarello gonna move that over herself I'll probably tip it this all comes apart for cleaning when you get done you can take this over to the sink and clean it yep absolutely which is important yeah caked on milk oh do you not want that no so it's very easy to use hot water or steam here to do that as well depending on if you push the steam button it's gonna come up to temperature for steam and when you open this you're gonna get steam correct exactly exactly it's a single heating system on here so you know price points a little bit different than some of our other machines that may have tool and but this one does have Singh which is fine in terms of the feature set yeah which is great it still doesn't take long it only takes 40 seconds to heat up from off yeah so it's very quick to eat up so anything else before we jump right into the iced it's pretty much it's we talked about bean hopper the water this is just the rinsing button so if you just want to rinse it rinse it through it will automatically rinse when it turns off automatically so all these icons up here you can get into it'll tell you if it's out of water in fact there we go this is a general warning means 20-year doors or your drip tray is not in place something like that this is empty your waste bin your waste bin and then there's a descale one once you start you can't stop yeah just don't push it unless you really need to do and do descale the machine because that's probably the the number one thing that people don't do is they just it's like an oil change number two the other thing that they do don't get into a really oily beam with these machines it's just not good for the grinders you can't take it apart and clean it yeah medium roast let's press off yeah and there's lots of choices out there any more than so much better that's my oh this medium yeah this is blue beard dinero's we like it so it's a medium roast there's so many medium roast beans out there start with medium I'm gonna go from there but again it's 20s medium it's not oily it's still flavorful if you go darker you're actually losing a lot of those flavors I'll show you what you see that is not oily oily beans are very very shiny so it's good call sir what you want to look for and you can't always see it you got to either ask the roaster or take a look-see at it yeah before this ice melts let's have some iced coffee so gals gonna put it underneath and you know what I'm gonna have you do them and have you do this you're gonna go to the five strength that's just my recommendation and then hit over ice good there you go so have it on five just because you want to have that the most flavorful coffee robust now we have milk here to put in it yes I would do half and half really that's just how we're okay you could you could I mean you aren't putting cold coffee called milk in so you can do if I wouldn't steam half an F but no no just pouring it in that's how I drink absolutely I'm gonna drink so look at that a cup of joe just a little bit half an F yeah so you can see the the coffee and the espresso going into the glass it's absolutely delicious you see it's a longer extraction so you're gonna get that that glass filled not all the way yeah that's it so that's the default quantity you can customize it so you can program each of these buttons you were actually touting that earlier when we were discussing it that you can program the buttons yes and some of the other DeLonghi machines they didn't have programmable you couldn't program except for the my brew yeah had one button but now let's go see this in action so this is this is so great so you can put it with a little bit of cold milk okay so just a little bit again it's all all personalized some people just do just just have your iced coffee with just black which is totally fine you can taste everything in there but there you go and then add more ice if you want whatever you want your drink is it it's yours go for it I know what it tastes like oh yeah very close yeah even with the milk right what do you mean even with it now you like it what the heck it's good no it's very good it was very good it's delicious it's very creamy it's it's you're not losing the coffee flavor that's putting a coffee flavor there yep it's very good so we were gonna make a cappuccino or a latte so obviously you know how so we can shoulder Falls yeah espressos espresso just like on any of our other machines so we'll go right towards some of those espresso based beverages I'll be right back all right well go get well we got some milk there but we gotta go get something to put it in yeah okay good be right back all right so we got the goods we've got the milk we've got a clean glass we're gonna do a will do a cappuccino so you can see how to use the manual frothing on here okay all right so let's just do just for now we'll just do a level three and we'll do a double shot of espresso it's quiet too relatively quiet for relatively minor so I love this machine because you can do so many things on it it's very dynamic how to throw in the dad joke there of course womp womp no tomatoes please yeah no tomatoes no they don't know where to find you they know where to find me right exactly yeah so there we go got our espresso cascading through it looks really good it does a really good espresso fresh David's the king that's what coffee if you don't have fresh coffee you're not gonna get the crema oh it's great that's perfect all right so hit that steam alright thermometer letting you know that it's heating up right now this isn't a traditional steamed line so it does make it a lot easier to froth your milk yeah it's a pannarello pannarello has two little holes at the bottom so that the air can go through and you get that as much technique exactly all right so we're gonna submerge that underneath open up the steam valve so I'm gonna do a cappuccino so I'll pull it out a little bit get a little bit extra air in there so you can already see the bubbles but those will start to right now this is manual so I'll just I'll have my hand underneath and when it gets too hot to touch stop this demon it's a plan looking good I'm not doing anything either so you can see just putting it here just hold it looks good so far the boss is gonna say why weren't you doing something right all right that's getting pretty hot so stop that all right great thing is is that since this is a sleeve it won't take on as much as what you may experience on other machines see so yeah just wipes off yeah all right different kind of machine this is a push-button machine gives you a convenience factor people like all right now the consistency is pretty good for a latte so see what I can do I have a good one now so let's see look at that it's the famous circle yeah but look at you got this out here this out here to take a flower a little bit does you have to use your imagination when you froth milk especially when you're but I mean look at that I mean it looks really good that's a creamy creamy cappuccino yep no all right you've got your iced coffee that's right all right let's see creamy I can tell that's really really good that's really good it's smooth its creamy perfect frothing and there we go so uh we've done iced coffee so that's that's that headlining feature though so the chamber over ice it's not found on any other machine and this comes off for you guys to clean it by the way take this over to the sink Yesi milk take it over the sink and give it a good one so yeah it's all clean than what comes apart too so if you want to you don't have to take that part apart and maintenance on these machines is really good I mean it's just like any other fully automatic but no the brewing unit can come out which is nice yeah do your descaling just escale take the brew unit out and let's just shut off down into a lower position exactly so uh can we discussed everything right we well we know about espresso but you got to enjoy the iced coffee yeah it's pretty good yeah Gale proves it's good I'm so far I miss at least today the weather's nice no late September and in beautiful Seattle yeah Linwood so and being from Jersey it's our weather is a little bit more dynamic I had to throw that in again Shh all right well thanks a lot for coming over hey my pleasure here this guy flew all the way across the country just to see us and talk it's been a pleasure machines and yeah we enjoyed it we're drinking coffee yeah I'm even better cheers Cheers [Music] you", "Vfgf6nTNAYM": "Today we\u2019re going to show you how to grind\nconcrete floors. Why is it important to grind concrete floors? Well, if you\u2019ve got a superficial\ncontaminant on the top of concrete, like thinset, paint, or God knows what else, you need to\nremove that before you can put your new flooring. So we\u2019re going to share what tools make\nthis much easier and safer. We\u2019re also going to go onto a mistake that we made that we\ndon\u2019t want you to make on your project. The first thing that you need is a really\ngreat HepaVac. This is the Fein HepaVac, and there\u2019s a reason why we really like it.\nThe cool thing about this HepaVac is the fact that it has an outlet. You can plug in your\npower tool\u2014in this case an angle grinder\u2014and then turn the power setting to the outlet,\nthe little logo right here. What that does is it turns on the HepaVac when you turn on\nyour power tool. It almost goes without saying, but if you\u2019re going to grind concrete floors,\nyou need an angle grinder. This is Fein\u2019s WSG 7. It\u2019s a 4 \u00bd-inch angle grinder. But\nthis isn\u2019t the most important tool that you need. Arguably, this is the most important\nfacet of grinding concrete. It is a dust shroud. This is Fein\u2019s surface grinding shroud,\nand you can use this for grinders up to 6 inches, and you can also use it up to wheels\nup to 5 inches, which brings me to the next tool that you need.\nThis is the thinset removal bit. This is a grinding wheel, specifically for removing\nthinset\u2014you guessed it. And you can use it to also remove paint and any other superficial\ncontaminant on top of your concrete. When you combine a HepaVac, a grinder, the\nthinest removal bit, and the surface shroud, these four components make grinding concrete\nmuch safer and faster. But that\u2019s not the end of the story.\nAdmittedly, sometimes we forget our personal safety equipment, but whenever you\u2019re grinding\nconcrete floors, you don\u2019t want to do that. So make sure you got some safety glasses,\nhearing protection\u2014I like these guys; they\u2019re like, I don\u2019t know, $8; you can find them\non Amazon\u2014and then our personal favorite piece of protective equipment, is the Sundstrom\nsilica dust respirator. Probably the best $50 you\u2019ll spend on a respirator. This is\ngreat, and you can use this to grind down concrete, tile. Anything with silica in it,\nthis is going to prevent that silica from getting into your lungs. So make sure you\nget one of these. In this bathroom, we had two specific problems\nwith the concrete floor. Number one, we did have some paint overspray along the perimeter\nof the floor. It\u2019s never good especially if you\u2019re going to be bonding a self-leveler\nto the concrete, like we had to do in this example. Second, we did have a little bit\nof joint compound here and there. Not typically a big problem, but you definitely want to\nget all of it off of the surface of the floor because it\u2019s going to be a bond breaker.\nNow, if you\u2019re removing ceramic or porcelain tile from concrete, chances are high that\nyou\u2019re going to have thinset residue on the top of the floor. So you need to remove\nthat. This is a great method. This method will also work if you have a little bit of\nresidue if you have like a vinyl tile on the surface of the concrete.\nNow, the first thing that you need to do is remove all the dust and any contaminants that\nare just resting on the top of the floor. Secondly, you\u2019re going to want to install\nthe dust shroud onto your grinder. Now, the cool thing with this one is it will work with\na variety of different grinders. So if you\u2019ve got DeWalt, Makita, Milwaukee, this dust shroud\nwill work with all of those grinders. This dust guard comes with a metal connector. The\nconnector is right here. There are three screws that hold it onto the shroud. You can see\nit from the top as well. Basically, if this connector doesn\u2019t work with your grinder,\nyou can swap it out for one that does work. You\u2019ll have to remove the guard from the\ngrinder, and then this slides into place. Sometimes it can be a pain in the butt, so\nyou just have to loosen the screws to get it in place. As you can see, that\u2019s how\nit fits onto the grinder. All you need to do is tighten these screws right here. There\nare only two screws on the front. And then finally, you want to install your thinset\nremoval bit into the grinder. This thinset removal bit simply just twists onto the spindle\nof the grinder, and that\u2019s it. There are some additional features about this\nHepaVac, which make it great. First, the power cord. Super long. So if you need to have the\nHepaVac somewhere and it\u2019s not anywhere close to an outlet, not a big deal. The other\ncool feature which we like a lot is the length of the hose. And this allows you to keep the\nHepaVac out of the room, especially a bathroom when you\u2019re grinding a floor or you\u2019re\ncutting tiles. We started this project in the corner of our\nbathroom. We had the thinset removal bit facing downward and then turn the angle grinder on\nthe full power and engaged the bit into the surface of the concrete. There were no issues\nwhatsoever removing the paint overspray or the joint compound. And as you can see here,\nthe nice thing with this surface guard is it\u2019ll fit tight up against the wall, door\ncasings, or adjacent flooring. We were really impressed with the dust removal\ncapacity of not only the dust shroud but the HepaVac. It\u2019s awesome. We highly recommend\nthis setup if you don\u2019t currently have one. So make sure you check it out.\nNow, there are two mistakes that we made. We don\u2019t want you to make those.\nNumber one: when you\u2019re grinding the surface of concrete, you\u2019re going to have some residual\ndust that remains on the surface. When you see that residual dust, vacuum it up so that\nyou\u2019re not hitting it with the thinset removal bit. When you hit it with the thinset removal\nbit, you\u2019re going to send a little plume of dust up in the air, and that\u2019s never\ngood. So, tip number one is always remove any residual concrete dust that remains on\nthe surface of the floor. Tip number two: if you feel your angle grinder\ngetting hot, allow it to cool down for a minute or two. In this case, we were kind of on a\ntight schedule, and we kept going to remove all of the paint off of our floor and any\nof that joint compound. Unfortunately, the angle grinder actually caught on fire, which\nwe didn\u2019t anticipate, and that\u2019s what you see here. It\u2019s not actually dust, but\nit\u2019s smoke from the angle grinder motor. That totally stinks. So don\u2019t make that\nmistake. If you feel the angle grinder getting hot, just stop and allow it to cool down.\nIf you have any questions, let us know down in the comments. We\u2019re happy to help out\nwith tool suggestions. If you\u2019ve got your own tool suggestion, let us now as well.\nThanks for watching, and we\u2019ll see you in the next tutorial.", "WKjHRHbOSSo": "Black & Decker new ideas in kitchen science the

I'm using a little bit of black tint because I love the look of black epoxy in a dark table like this one this is a slow setting epoxy which is what you want to use in applications like this it seeps in and all the bubbles rise out but you haven't poured it in the large void what you're gonna want to do is hit it with some map gas or a butane torch that will release the bubbles from the surface and just pay attention to it for the next few hours as bubbles will rise just hit those with the torch and they will pop you're then gonna flip the slab back over you're gonna begin sanding down all of the hardened epoxy after you remove the tape you're gonna start out with an 80 grit or an aggressive grit on either a Festool rotecks or a belt sander I highly suggest using something that is an aggressive sander for this part what you're gonna notice is there will be some voids holes and bubbles things that came up in the drying process you're gonna fill those with a quick setting epoxy using the same die as you did in the in on the slow setting epoxy you'll apply this from the top and smooth it out with either a squeegee or a brush holding the sander flat start to flatten out all of the epoxy that you filled from the backside you'll do the same thing for any bubbles that are rise in the slow setting epoxy and this is also a good time to apply the same epoxy to all of the bug holes cracks and crevices that may be in the live edge aspect of the table as well as parts of the table that you didn't notice from the beginning flip that epoxy hardened completely and then begin your sanding process starting with 80 grit on an aggressive sander once again Festool Rotex or a belt sander would be my suggestions you're gonna start at one end going across the grain and then work your way down to the other flattening the surface and keeping the sander nice and flat then step up to 120 grit and repeat the same process after that I move on to my 90 or smaller-diameter Rotech sander and sand all of the live edge one time to get the sapwood to pop you're then gonna go back with 120 grit by hand and break all of the edges and sand the live edge or sapwood one more time I'll move on to the top once again with 120 grit on a random orbit sander I take a pencil and Mark the whole top this helps me know how far I've gone as well as the timing of my sanding you only want to go one second per inch per recommendations from the Wood Whisperer himself Marc Spagnuolo after sanding is complete you want to wipe the whole surface down with the tack cloth this will give you a nice clean surface to begin to apply the finish the product I prefer to finish all of my hardwood slab surfaces with nowadays is called rubio monocoat if you're interested I have a link down below this is not a sponsored build I just love this product it saves you a ton of time and it goes on silky smooth and they very very easy to use has very low VOCs as well which is great during the winter time because you don't have to spray indoors hence why I love it for these type of projects I like to use hand applied finishes on my slabs regardless helps me to keep streaks from getting into the finish as well as getting all the crevices in the live edge itself it's a 15 minute working time with this finish so I tend to work from the center to one side after about 5 to 10 minutes I will rub that out with a clean cloth on the top then move to the other side of the table and then after that move on to the live edge where I will apply that with a rag by hand like I said super fast and efficient way to finish a live edge slab I know a lot of people are doing very similar things in their process hence why I wanted to share it with you guys so you could get better and faster at what you're doing if you're using a different technique I'd love to hear about it leave a comment down below and tell me how you're finishing your live edge slabs if you want to see a more detailed write-up of this project head on over to John Maliki calm I got a link down below I'll have some more beauty shots of this beautiful project as well as more of a step-by-step walkthrough for you to follow along with if you're interested in something like this follow me on Instagram as well if you want to see what's going on day to day I've been working on this for a couple weeks and everyone was getting behind-the-scenes looks at what was happening if you want to follow along there there's a link down below to there as well I've also got hoodies and shirts available to you guys if you want to check those out get one of these sweet ones like this zip up that I've been wearing a lot of my content recently super comfortable very happy with these links down below to those as well so thank you guys one more time for tuning in go punch your next project in the face and I'll see you on the next video [Music]", "Dy7jTMHIBtg": "with a great review from the people at osgen they sent me over all their smell proof bags like their whole line there's four of them here we're gonna go over all of them i'm gonna start off with this like kind of clutch purse looking one first this thing's like 11 by eight inches 11 across eight up and down it's got these nice little buttons that you can pop open and then inside here is this nice little zipper section uh once you get inside there this is like really strong velcro that you now gotta get through and then there's like plenty of room in there for like any type of like products or anything you might want to store as you can see there's like little compartments in here you can even put like you know your extra bits and bobs in and stuff like that and something real cool once you do put like you know your product in there when you zip it up if you check this out um this is gonna be like pretty hard to see on camera i think but there's like a little loop between the zippers so you can actually like put a little lock in there to keep your stuff like perfectly safe and i'm pretty sure this one runs for about 18 so not a lot i also feel like this is like the most discreet out of all the bags especially if you get this like your girlfriend or significant other like if a girl is walking down the street with this i'm just gonna think this is like a clutch purse of some sort i'm not gonna know the difference i would never know that there's actually like a whole bunch of like carbon technology keeping the smell of some really good stuff inside this bag now i'm gonna move on to the next one a while ago i got my friend an osh chin bag for christmas i actually got her this one and uh she absolutely loves it it's got this great locking system in here so you can take the ends of the zippers and actually put them in here and you can set your own lock combination and when you open this thing up which is awesome i love the uh it's got this like padding kind of stuff around the zipper so like keep it smell proof and stuff when you open this up you got like this whole little top section where you can keep stuff in there it's got right here where you can put like you know packs of papers or something like that then you flip it over and then these are actually removable so if you don't want these in there you can pop those out and then you can just have like a big section or you can like put them in however you want to kind of section this area off they say you wanted to just go across like that so you could have two sections or something like that and this whole middle section is also removable so if you just like wanted one big carrying case like that you could do that and that's pretty cool pretty sure the dimensions on this are like about eight and a half inches tall five and a half inches wide and about four and a half inches thick so you can hold like a good amount of stuff in this i mean maybe not as much as this one because this is like a whole big pouch you could probably fit a ton of stuff in here honestly and i think this one runs for about 28 28 bucks so pretty good deal for a small proof bag moving on to the next bag this is probably one of my personal favorites of their bags i like this one the most it has this great little like outside pocket meshed up it's got the same zipper technology and carbon technology to keep it smell-proof as the other bags do it's got the same zipper locking combination you can set your own obviously when you open this one up this is why it's my favorite all right this one has like a zipper section right here so you can unzip it and like make sure all the stuff that you keep in there stays in there just like the other one that we just went over it also has a flat thing this also comes out it also has the sectioning off at the bottom they also are removable so you can kind of make it however you want and this one actually has like a little pocket in this middle section i like that a lot this one's about the same price as this one maybe even a little less expensive i think this one's like 40 cents less weird but true i think this one's about 27.99 this one's like 27.59 but this one is my favorite i like this one the most a little bit different on the sizes this one's about nine and a half inches up about six inches wide and about three and a half inches deep where this one's four and a half inches deep and a little bit shorter in all the other directions so i mean you can fit a ton of stuff in this too and obviously still smell proof the last bag they have is like the king of all kings like if you can get this one this is where you should be this one's like a 40 bag but it comes with a ton of little like bits and extras it's got that same zipper locking technology the same lock combination that you can set yourself it's got a front pocket that isn't mesh i do like that a lot and i like the logo they use for this one a lot too that's a really cool logo you open this one up and just like the other ones it has the top thing no zipper on this one though so it's got the the top thing here it's got the middle thing with the pouch and obviously it's removable this one actually comes with some pretty cool stuff though this one comes with this cool little like kind of space looking grinder i like that a lot it's a four piece grinder works really well and uh it has a flower catcher i guess you would call it at the bottom so you got that you got your screen in there and it also comes with this little scraper tool which is perfect for scraping the bottom of your grinder it also comes with like a couple of these smell-proof bags which is really cool these like really nice big smell-proof bags that you like double smell proof basically because it's already in a small proof container this one also came with some of those same bags i forgot to mention that it also comes with this nice little container this like uv all black container to keep your product fresh it's got a good amount of room in there so you can fit like plenty you know definitely enough to take out with you and just like all the others this one actually comes with like three things to section off so if you wanted to take them all apart you could also take all these out and of course this one as well and make it just like one gigantic bag and i think this one runs for about forty dollars so i mean overall pretty good deal because you're also getting a grinder and you're getting those bags and you're getting a storage thing so i mean obviously this is also a very great deal i hope you guys enjoyed my review the oz chin bags i'll see you guys next time peace bye", "j5E3OXYk33E": "hey guys Chris from hockey tutorial here and today in this video we're gonna be taking a look at maintaining and also sharpening black colored or DLC coated steel now more than ever you're seeing a lot of players switching over to skate blades or runners that aren't your conventional silver there's a lot of different manufacturers out there that specifically make skate runners and there is a massive difference between them and the traditional runners that you find on some hockey skates now something that I've come across now more than any other time is a lot of questions and comments on the types of Steel that are available the two questions that we receive the most on Instagram Facebook and also on YouTube are either a mix of the traditional steel versus the colored steel the colored Steel's just a paint job it's just a gimmick that's number one and the second one is from a few unlucky people that live in parts of the world where their ice rinks or even some stores are refusing to sharpen colored steel the reason for that is because they're scared of damaging the steel so they've basically just said that they're not going to be touching any types of this kinds of steel and in this video I wanted to clear up some of the reasons why that really shouldn't happen because it isn't that big of a deal to be able to sharpen and maintain now coming to the first one when people say that colored steel or steel that's very very reflective and very very shiny is just a cosmetical change it has no performance benefits that isn't exactly true when you have black steel if its proper black steel the blade has essentially gone through a oxidization process now what that does it's number one responsible for that black coating on top of the blade it improves the blades ability to be able to withstand just general wear and tear and it has numerous benefits like making the steel stronger improving your edge life so when you get your skates sharpened the blade is able to maintain its edge like for much much longer depending on I guess you could say the finish or how refined the manufacturer of this black steel has taken the process you also get other benefits such as increased bite on the ice but I guess the key point here is to keep in mind that there are different levels of how far these runners have been you could say refined by the manufacturer that's making them now of course if you want to see video where I go into much more detail about the differences between these types of steel I'll link it above and also down below in the video description there's a big difference between them and a while back I created a video where I went through all of the differences between these types of Steel and helped you to identify which ones you should account for and which ones you might want to consider using because it really does make a big difference so the players thats a colored steel is just a gimmick it's really important to note that different manufacturers will take the refining process of their skate blades and runners to different levels you have some manufacturers that solely create steel like massive blade and step steel who in my opinion creates some of the best quality runners that you can get now comparing them to your skate manufacturers runners it's important to mention that although the runners is a very critical element for the skate blade skate manufacturers aren't going to be able to put in as much time detail and I guess you could say refinement into the runners that they create when you compare them to companies like massive blade or step steel who are easily some of the two favorites that you find everywhere it's very easy to look at a company like step steel and recognize that what they're producing is not a gimmick if you look at their black blades it's not just a black coating or a black paint job their blades look chrome the amount of refinement and engineering that goes into creating a runner of this quality is unbelievable and it's one of the reasons why so many NHL players are using step steel to date colored Steel's not a gimmick it's really important to note that there are different grades and different levels of refinement that different manufacturers take to be able to produce colored or black steel and some of them do it a lot better than others now the points on maintaining colored steel in terms of your day-to-day maintenance all you really need to do is when you take your skates off I'd always recommend putting some sort of cover over the skate blades that's just to ensure that when they're inside your hockey bag your runners aren't knocking against each other they're not locking against things inside your bag that they shouldn't be I know personally on a couple of occasions when I've not put skate covers over my blades I've put them into my bag when I get home and I take out my bag to air out my equipment and let it dry I hope some of you guys are doing that I find my runners sitting on top of say a set of keys or some loose change that's not the kind of thing that you want your runners to come into contact with so just putting a cover over them will make a massive difference now when we look at the point of how to sharpen coloured steel black steel or DLC coated steel there isn't a crazy science behind it whether using an automated sharpener like the spa over here or your rink or hockey store is using a traditional sharpener that needs to be done manually the only consideration that needs to be made when you're sharpening colored steel black steel dlc steel is after you finish the sharpening process which has done the exact same way the main thing that you don't want to do is use a ceramic stone or a stone hone to run down the sides of the runners that's where the problem occurs if your runners have proper dlc coating which is diamond like coating or they are I guess you could say proper black steel you don't need to do this the whole point is that the grade of steel that's used to construct these runners and also the hardness of the steel the finish of the steel is refined to such a degree that effectively it doesn't need to be honed down with something as harsh as a stone or a ceramic hone what you can do if you really do want to do this is use a leather hone to run down the sides of the runners not a stone one or not a ceramic one because all you'll be doing by using a material so hard like ceramic is effectively scraping or shaving the dlc coating or the black coating off of the side of the runners that's where the issue occurs because then all of those performance benefits are essentially pointless because you're removing the surface or the finish that creates them so if you're watching this video from somewhere where your ice rink rement sharp and black steel dlc steel colored steel all you need to do is just share this video with them and show them all they need to do if it's real dlc steel real black steel is simply use a leather hone down the sides of it or nothing at all very often I'll sharpen my runners with this machine right here and I won't hold them down I wouldn't rub in anything down the side of them because the quality of runners that I'm using doesn't require that to be done so hopefully this is a video that you can share with anyone that has any misconceptions about colored steel black steel dlc steel if there's not some crazy trick to being able to sharpen them it's just making sure that you don't run that ceramic or stone hone down the sides and for you as players making sure that you cover the runners when you're not using them just to ensure that you maintain that edge life and you maintain that coating and maintain the performance but make sure that you share this video with anyone that needs to watch it and if you have any questions about colored steel dlc steel black coated

"7Ase0GXjx4w": "in a previous video on metal grinding wheels we tested quite a few different brands and the word brand actually did pretty good ken the warrior brand continue its winning streak today when you task the metal cutoff wheels there been a lot of requests to test these so let's get the testing underway and see which one of these products is the best the only way to get accurate testing results is to take humans out of the testing process as much as possible the way this test setup works is this cry just attacks this arm that moves freely up and down which is in a perfect vertical position this will allow the blade to get a straight up-and-down cut because if the blade is that angle it's gonna bite is it cutting through the metal slowing down the blade and causing unnecessary wear I won't be touching this during the test all I'm gonna do is plug this device in stand back let it cut through the steel and then I'll unplug it when the test is over so several things going to be looking for how much blade do we use how long does it take to cut through the steel does the blade shatter and does the blade have the advertised with obviously a wider blade is going to take longer to cut through the steel and put a lot more work on the grinder we've got approximately 3.1 pounds of downward force where the blade would contacting the metal we're gonna see how fast each one these blades can cut through a piece of steel that's a half-inch wide and three inches tall and see how much material loss it experiences Harper frays advertises 1/16 of an inch looks like it's 1/16 of an inch point zero six to five [Applause] [Music] the warrior wheel which is the Harbor Freight brand started off at four point five four inches and is down to four point zero five inches so it used up 41 percent of the cutting wheel to make just one cut the warrior wheel also lost seven grams of material which seems like a lot hopefully we'll see better results out of the DeWalt wheel next do want blade is advertised as being point zero four five the actual width of the blade point zero seven zero [Music] [Music] so whether warrior which is made by Harbor Freight lost seven grams the DeWalt only lost two grams the DeWalt wheel started off at four point five three inches and is down to four point four two inches so it only used up 10% of the cutting wheel compared to the warrior the DeWalt is a thicker cutting wheel which cuts much slower but lasts longer let's see how the DeWalt stacks up against the Milwaukee cutting wheel Milwaukee's advertise being point zero four five point zero five eight [Music] so the Milwaukee is a very fast cutting wheel compared to the warrior and the DeWalt wheels but it seems to have worn down very quickly it started off at 33 grams and lost 5 grams the wheel started off at 4.5 4 inches and is now down to 4.18 so used up 31 percent of the cutting wheel which is a lot more than the DeWalt and almost as much as the warrior I'm really surprised the Milwaukee wore down so quickly maybe it's because it's a really thin cutting wheel let's test it against another thin cutting wheel the makita to see if it wears down as quickly makitas advertises three sixty four point zero five two [Music] [Music] so the makita wheel started off at 29 grams is now down to 27 grams so it only lost two grams the wheels start off at four point five three inches it is now down to four point four inches that's not bad at all it cut faster than the Milwaukee and it only used up 12.5% of the wheel while the Milwaukee used up 31% of the wheel this is the best wheel we've tested so far however we still need to compete it against the Diablo the Diablos advertised as point zero four zero point zero four five five [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so the Diablo is the fastest cutting wheel we've tested so far even faster than the makita the Diablo lost two grams of material you started off at four point six two inches and is now down to four point three eight inches so it used up 15% of the cutting wheel which is a little bit more aware than the makita and the DeWalt but it sure does make a fast and smooth cut so the big question is can the diamond wheel cut as fast as the wheels we've tested Linux metal max is designed obviously for cutting metal it's supposed to deliver a thousand plus cuts and most importantly it's supposed to last 30 times longer than regular wheels the lengths blade is point zero five five [Music] [Music] so that lenez cuts extremely slow compared the competition the wheel may last thirty times longer but it also takes 8 to 10 times longer to make a cut the wheel showed virtually nowhere and there wasn't any noticeable loss in material [Music] [Music] [Music] well as we saw today a bracelet wheels that cut fast and last usually cost a lot more but the payback is usually in dividends when you factor in labor cost and time saved hey I don't mind spending a bit more money for a good wheel as long as it's not one that's gonna burn up real fast because in the end you're gonna spend a lot of time changing out the cutting wheel and it's not going to cut too fast either wasting a lot of time now the DeWalt blade did a terrific job in terms of lasting but it was the slowest cutting wheel we tested it is also a very wide wheel so I guess it does make sense and the type of material being used is a factor as well if you're taking into account time as well as cost it's hard to argue that the makita isn't the best wheel because that thing cuts fast and it also lasted quite a long time that lettuce is definitely going to outlast all these wheels but that's in a different class of its own now with that said it cuts extremely slow but if you're cutting on really thin material that might be the way to go because that wheel will last a long time and you're not gonna spend any time changing it out anyway I look forward to reading your video ideas for the future I have a lot of fun doing these projects please keep the ideas coming and I'll keep making videos", "v_4dMq-XUl8": "these days more and more of us want to know exactly what goes into our food and the best way to do that is to make

"hey what's up YouTube nation thanks for checking out our channel today so I love my Gretel really really love my Gretel but one of the things that was kind of always in the back of my mind was how clean is the actual grilling surface after you wipe it down with paper towels so I developed a I guess a slightly different technique something that I used to do at a place when we worked and had a griddle made a lot of steak and cheeses at the end of the night this is how we would clean it so I figured I put together a video share it with anyone who has a griddle or any new griddle owners who are questioning how do I clean this thing so check it out start by using your scraper to scrape any physical residue left on the griddle all crumbs oil everything push down hard get a good scrape for any new griddle owners you see griddle guys on YouTube using what looks like a putty knife or a paint scraper that's a food-grade paint spray I'm sorry a food-grade scraper it's not the same thing as going to Home Depot or Lowe's and buying one you can do that if you want but it's gonna discolor quickly those are not meant for cooking so I'll put a link in the description to the scraper that were that I'm using you can get it on Amazon it's pretty cheap it's like 6 bucks or something like that so the griddle right now is on low temperature after you scrape it use a paper towel with a pickup or several paper towels if you have a group if you're it alone you're gonna see use a ton of paper towels but um use a paper towel to wipe up any grease oil that's left on it I typically fold it flip wipe flip it over wipe with the other side so you're gonna do that several times and then you're gonna move on to using water ok so now I can't stress this enough for this next step the griddle has to be on low heat do not have it on medium high the reason for that is you're gonna be pushing and you can see steaming hot sometimes boiling water across the griddle using this if you have this on high you do and will you run the risk but you will very likely burn your hand or get a steam burn when you try to move the water across the griddle what you want is water just under a boil right out of boil by that steaming so what we're doing here is you you get the hot water on the griddle and while it's hot you work it up and down and across the griddle that's gonna sanitize everything because the water is basically boiling it's also gonna pull any residual oil that's left on the griddle burn oil off the oil will float in the water as you draw it across the griddle and pull it into your grease trough just be careful if you go too fast you're gonna end up burning your fingers if you pull it towards your briefs trough too quickly it's gonna jump over the briefs trough and get on your shorts or blamed on your sneakers so what I'm doing here is I'm working that hot hot water into the corners where the griddle surface meets the side wall pull it out of there it's picked off any debris that's stuck in there you draw it across pull it into your drew straw so if anybody's wondering where all these paper towels are going that's off-camera I would recommend you to do this on your griddle grab a pot a pan anything put it off to the side use it as a trash bag I mean you use so many paper towels so sandy the next step is to use a cotton towel to really scrub the griddle surface so hit it again with water let the water get nice and steamy you want to get the towel fully wet over the process of scrubbing this down and this is really gonna remove everything and anything that's left on the griddle it does a much better job than paper towels so once you get the first side dirty just flip it over use the second side keep wiping you can carefully grab the towel and open it back up and refold it to get back to a clean spot on the towel and keep wiping this is gonna ruin your towel I mean that the towel is going to be stained what we do is we buy a pack of I think twenty four of these off of Amazon for like 20 bucks so it's less than a dollar a towel we'll put a link in the description you can order some these that stack of towels that you order specific to the griddle nobody's going to be using it you're not handing it out in the kitchen if you don't want to wash it with the rest of your towels just fill a sink with you know hot soapy water rinse them out wring them out let them dry and use them again we've been using the same towels for over a year now and they're still fine so the last step in this process take the hot towel and clean the sidewalls on the griddle remember you know we all use that to push the food against and then pick it up off the griddle so you don't want a lot of spent or in the oil sitting up there on those sidewalls and getting on the food you're cooking the final step is to put a thin coating of oil to seal the griddle so it doesn't rust I know I have some rust in the corners the bottom left-hand of the screen I'm due for a reasoning of Micra - I haven't done it in a while that'll be another video but I use an extra light olive oil just put a thin strip down the middle rub it all around the griddle I like to keep it really thin so I'll do a coating with the paper towel like this I'll flip it over and rub it down again and that's it you're al you're ready for your next cook I should mention if you do end up buying the cotton towels wash them and dry them three times before you use them on the griddle if you take them out of the package and try and use them on the griddle they're gonna deposit a ton of lint so wash and dry them three times before you use them so well thanks for joining us like subscribe we'll keep putting videos up take it easy", "e518LrMSr_4": "This is my favorite low-tech on board ! Let me present you the Black Soldier Fly ! The larvae of this fly can eat any organic waste with a very high efficiency and turn it into a very valuable ressource We have been in Malaysia to meet Emilie who is a world expert. At the Low-tech Lab, we travel the world to find the best low-tech ! Inventions that are useful, sustainable and accessible to all. For us, the use of the Black Soldier Fly is amazing because it's an insect that can convert almost any type of organic waste Into an insect meal that we will use in animal feeding: for chicken, pig, fish, etc. And in a compost that will also be reused in agriculture Here when we receive 1 ton of organic waste we turn it into 200 kg of larvae and into 200kg of compost Thanks to these flies we will collect eggs. With about 1 kg of eggs in 15 days, we get about 5 tons of larvae which is the equivalent of an elephant ! We are contributing to sustainable farming like that reusing waste to produce insect biomass and compost so to produce value I find it very exciting ! I'll show you how to raise Black Soldier Fly at a small scale Put your organic waste into this box They can eat any waste that is not to dry We even give the larvae our dry toilets. When they have eaten enough They will turn into pupae climb this ramp and fall into the tray Once a week, you harvest 90% of the larvae to feed the animals It's full of lipids and proteins You put the rest in the aviary They will become flies reproduce themselves and lay their eggs into this cardboard Babies will hatch, and jump into the food. In a big waterproof box, build a ramp with some waterproof wood. This will let the larvae get out of the wet subtrate when they will be ready to pupate. On this ramp, add 2 barriers, to guide the larvae to the box where they will fall and could be collected. Build a cover for the box. If the larvae don't have enough food, they will try to get out by any small interstice. Build an aviary for the adult flies. The top of the aviary can be covered by a plastic sheet to protect the eggs from the rain if the aviary is placed outside. Cover the rest of the aviary with mosquito net and build a door to access the inside and collect the cardboard where the flies will have lay their eggs. Use 3 small boxes. In the first one, add a damp cloth where flies can drink On the second, place the pieces of cardboard where the flies can lay their eggs In the third tank, add the dry substrate with the fly pupae. One third of our garbage is organic waste. We use a lot a energy to make them disapear This little quiet fly, is a ready-made technology, free of cost, and highly efficient Everybody should use it !                    ", "FinRqCocwGE": "[GUNFIRE] SUROOSH ALVI: We're\nhere in Lahore, Pakistan, in the old city. I'm here visiting family. It's been about three years\nsince I was in the country. And in that time, the country\nhas gone through insane amounts of change-- truly full of deep\ncontradictions. On the one hand, you've got this\nprogressive side of the population. They're organizing\nfashion weeks. They're partying. And you've got this liberal\nmedia explosion happening in this country. And they're operating uncensored\nby the government. On the other side, you\ngot the Taliban. They've been infiltrating the\nentire country, attacking police stations and government\nbuildings in a recent wave of violence. It's now escalated into a\nfull-fledged battle with the Pakistani Army fighting the\nTaliban in the tribal areas near the Afghan border. We travelled to this area three\nyears ago when we wanted to visit a massive illegal arms\nmarket believed to be a source of weapons\nfor the Taliban. It's been called the most\ndangerous place in the world and is now basically closed\noutside of the journalists. So I asked my mom to\ncall her buddy. He is the chief secretary of\nthe Northwest Frontier Province of Pakistan. With his help, we got our\nown private militia. And they made sure we wouldn't\nget kidnapped or killed. SUROOSH ALVI: Naeem, who is\nour host, is part of the Afridi tribe. He is born and raised there,\nnow works as a protocol officer for the government. He put them together for us. He got us through, dealt with a\nhuge amount of bureaucracy, and got the militia\nto cover us as we went through the market. Is this loaded? NAEEM AFRIDI: Yes, this is\nloaded, but they're locked. SUROOSH ALVI: They locked it. Where's the lock? SUROOSH ALVI: It's the most\nhistoric pass in the history of the world. The Aryans came through. The Mongols came through. The British Army came through\nand got destroyed-- special place. SUROOSH ALVI: Thanks, buddy. [PARADE MUSIC] SUROOSH ALVI: He's the founder\nof the heroin trade. SUROOSH ALVI: The concept? SUROOSH ALVI: Of what? SUROOSH ALVI: It's a very\nspecial Italian hat. NAEEM AFRIDI: I will\ntry my best to-- SUROOSH ALVI: Oh god. No. After Khyber, we went\ninto Darra. That's where the\narms market is. So when you were explaining to\nthe officials what we wanted to do, the old man started\nlaughing when you said we wanted to shoot guns and\nmaybe buy some guns. I think he liked that idea. SUROOSH ALVI: He liked\nthat idea. SUROOSH ALVI: He was laughed. SUROOSH ALVI: This is definitely\nthe largest illegal arms market in the world. There is another one\nin Pakistan. It's not quite as big. And the story is that during\nthe '80s, the Soviet-Afghan war was happening. All the scrap metal from all the\nbroken-down tanks and guns they would find, they would\nbring it back over and then replicate the firearms. SUROOSH ALVI: So in the whole\ntown, they're making 1,000 guns a day here. And they've been doing\nthat for 70 years. That's a lot of guns. So this guy is making\n9-millimeter pistols with his bare hands. The guy who's making\nit is deaf. It's a Mauser but says\n\"Made as China by Norinco.\" [GRUNTING] SUROOSH ALVI: This\nis the cartridge. He has no tongue. 3,050 rupees? We're hearing lots of guns\nbeing shot around us. And they're just checking to\nmake sure that the guns work. They're doing it\nwith live ammo. What I'm wondering is, they\nshoot it up in the air, where do the bullets fall? SUROOSH ALVI: It's time\nwe go gun shopping. This is an Italian machine. This is like a Kalashnikov? MALE SPEAKER: Kalakov. SUROOSH ALVI: Kalakov. It says it's a Muzzelite. I think we can do some\ndamage with this. The original Khyber rifle-- so in 1857, the British gave the\nAfghanis 10,000 of these. I don't even know how\nto cock this thing. Where do you put\nthe bullet in? [INTERPOSING VOICES] SUROOSH ALVI: The musket? The musket is where\nyou put it in. MALE SPEAKER: Nazi gun. German. SUROOSH ALVI: Germany. World War II, Nazi gun-- pure evil in my hand. MALE SPEAKER: Suroosh,\nnow we are going into the shooting area. Yes? Let's go. SUROOSH ALVI: Bullet. So we were wondering, were\nthey following me? MALE SPEAKER: They're not\ngoing far from us. SUROOSH ALVI: If not, I'm\ngoing to keep it. NAEEM AFRIDI: Yes, keep it. SUROOSH ALVI: You got\nto be kidding. This is the shooting area? We just had lunch downstairs. NAEEM AFRIDI: Yes. SUROOSH ALVI: All right. Let's do this. I'm shooting the enemies\nin the hills. I've never done this before. It's a Kalashnikov. And we're kind of nervous. I see my target. [GUNFIRE] EDDY MORETTI:\n[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [GUNFIRE] SUROOSH ALVI: America thought\nthat by sending in troops to Afghanistan and the Pakistani\nArmy into the tribal areas, they'd to be able to squash\nthe Taliban uprising. They were wrong. The people we saw\nlive in caves. They work in insane\nconditions. They have no tongues. They make guns with\ntheir bare hands. We're done. We succeeded our mission. We came to Darra. And we bought guns. We shot them. We saw how it all happens. If you come here, you got to\nmake sure you look the part. And you've got to have\na guy like Naeem to make it all happen. SUROOSH ALVI: And\none last thing-- NAEEM AFRIDI: Goodbye\nto the gun. SUROOSH ALVI: --Pakistan\nZindabad. Three years ago, when we filmed\nin Darra, after we left, the government basically\nshut it down. They shut it down to outsiders\nand journalists because the Pakistani Army was in there\nfighting the Taliban. And right now, between the\nPakistani Army and the US troops on the border, the\nTaliban inside the tribal areas, it's essentially\na powder keg that's ready to blow. The military expert that we\nknow, he described the situation as the wickedest\nproblem you could possibly imagine.
