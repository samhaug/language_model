{"vAd2MnnDEn4": "hey guys welcome back to our channel if you're new here I am Judith and today's video I am going to be eating a hundred milligram edible for you guys I did get this on 4/20 and I am barely going to eat it with you guys just because I don't know it's been in the fridge it's been getting cold and I thought why not do it today today is my day off so your grocery and yeah so I'm gonna consume this a hundred milligram edible for you guys and see what it does to me I am a huge smoker so I don't know if it would hit me as much but honestly it probably will because edibles hit different than smoking like honestly honestly if you eat edibles they will hit like major but yeah so I'm gonna eat this for you guys hopefully I don't feel like I'm dying and then from there who knows this video will probably be a short vlog and yeah I'm just gonna go about my day on an edible and see the effects of what happens so let me set the camera for you guys and then open this oh so I am in my little sister's room I am at my mom's house and yeah there's nowhere else I'd rather take a hundred milligram edible than my mom's because if I freaked out which I probably won't but if I freaked out my sisters are here and my mom is here and everybody is here so if your girl feels like she's dying everybody is here hominy yeah yeah so let me set this camera up for you guys and then let's do it okay you guys I'm so mad at myself because I literally broke the freaking edible and I didn't want to do that I wanted to show you guys exactly what it looked like and your girl is just not paying attention if you guys have ever tried these let me know in the comments down below and what you guys thought about them so I've tried these before they were good and let's do this again so here we go I'm gonna break this seal for you guys know it's childproof it's childproof you guys it doesn't even have a little cut for you to follow do you have scissors money so you legit might need a knife or some scissors to open the packaging which is always good that's like an a-plus because if you have kids or you have little adults around you don't want them to easily access these things because yeah Oh Jax is sad he's crying outside right now but I don't want him inside because he's just gonna he's just gonna bark and do odd things possible but he's sad because jenna so just dipped or she went somewhere I'm not sure but okay so I went ahead and cut it open I'm sorry my nails are a little rough right now one is really bitten your girl has been super anxious and nervous and if you know me you just have a lot of anxiety sometimes and believe it or not I get and I get anxiety attacks and it's just a struggle you guys so if you guys know what they feel like or you guys are also going through the same thing I hope that you guys are doing everything possible to just stay calm and everything is gonna be fine you guys I always try to remind myself that but anyways it smells so good these are dark mint chocolate bars and they legit smell like dark mint chocolate they really do you guys let me push them it to the front they literally broke it in there I am so upset with myself but they still looks so good okay let's do it I'm gonna eat the whole bar you guys so let's do this they are look look at how they're packaging for their chocolate is like go ahead and hold that for you guys look at that it literally tells you the milligram of each little bar that is crazy I don't even remember eating the other one and I don't remember being this excited about having the milligrams on the bar I don't know I guess yes yes if you guys how do you say it um if you guys are dosing or how would you say I money you just oh yeah mone is smart she okay so if you are micro dosing and you are a big believer or a big person who does micro seeing these are exactly what you need but let's do this image it tastes like dark chocolate man mm sorry 20 milligrams yeah 820 milligrams right there let's go ahead and eat oh my god I'm such an idiot you guys and you guys are not telling me so apparently it doesn't give you the milligrams on here I just assumed that they did but no it doesn't it actually says THC on the bar d\u00f6 oh my god I'm either dumb or I'm blind you guys I'm so dumb but it does say THC on them on the packaging and lets you know that each bar is 10 milligrams so I just assumed that that's what it was on that's what was written on the bar but you know what it's still cool it still lets you know how many milligrams each little bar is and honestly dude the reason why I like these is because ok 30 more milligrams and then it's 50 milligrams total and you can't argue with that [Applause] and I got this one this one didn't break yeah so this one didn't break you guys and 15 milligrams for this little bit is yes yes I love edibles that are tiny but they pack so much like a little brownie that's 100 milligrams like thighs the best because you don't have to eat as much like it legit gets to the point it's not like you have to eat 50 cupcakes to get 100 milligrams like no I love that they high dose these things so that you can eat less of it but get more of a punch like those are my favorite edibles look 20 more milligrams what is that now 70 milligrams oh my god I'm freaking myself out honey you're gonna be here with me okay my sister said if I feel like I'm dying she's gonna be here with me you're gonna remind me that I'm not dying she was gonna remind me I'm not dying guys honestly I can always have I can always be having a bad day but once I get on camera for you guys and I talk to you guys I just make a difference I do feel better I do feel the best I could be sometimes but yeah like I really like being here with you guys you guys motivate me of course I do want to do big things when I'm older I hope you guys stay to see what the [ __ ] that J and J twins are gonna do in the future my sister has a boyfriend and they're hella cute you guys so shout out to all the couples out there especially my sister's relationship because he is so nice you guys like so next so nice oh hi there any more milligrams and that's gonna be a total of 100 milligrams you guys so recently hmm yeah I would buy these again mm-hmm yes mm-hmm so recently I took half a tab with Hubert he took the pool tab you guys I don't know I don't know people could do the most and still survive but me knowing I'm gonna take a full time I know that it's gonna be full-blown everything like everything I'm gonna see God I'm gonna see [ __ ] mythological things everything so I took half a tab right you guys I swear I couldn't stop laughing like I was trying I was trying so hard to keep it together because like I wouldn't look at Hubert and I was just like in my mind it was so funny like to even look at him was so funny like I didn't know I didn't know why looking at him was so funny and while I was doing that I was applying to new things so that I can get my life together and go find better things so I was on my laptop like the laptop looked cool whatever but then I started to realize oh my god oh my god it's hitting like my half tab is hitting and that's why I only take half a tab Jax our guard dog our long-haired dachshund or jealous long-haired dachshund even after the tab was over and we woke up the next morning I even asked him I was I asked him how his tab fell and if he felt it and he said smack - smack but yeah I am my my half tops max I didn't think it was going through because I've never had great oh my god looks so young with short hair so I never like I never really have good experiences with papertabs usually jalisa gets us gel tabs and those are the ones that really really like always boom like and these paper tabs one time we took them and they just it didn't work out so yeah lesson learned gels are my favorite my point is don't be afraid to microdose don't ever feel like you have to eat the whole edible or take the whole tab like no I even take quarter tabs and I feel good I feel like I could take a quarter tab and go throughout my day or take a quarter tab and drink and have a good time so everything is possible you guys don't hurt yourselves but I will come back check up with you guys and see when this hits so I'll make sure to time this for you guys let me check and you're gonna wash my hands because I do not want to lick my fingers so it is currently 138 I will come back whenever these shit's hit which will be in like 30 minutes hopefully or maybe an hour who knows no one ever knows um yeah and I'll check up with you guys and see you later my dude shoutout to jealous because she is hooking it up with some boiling crab but yes but yes okay so it's been like 45 minutes okay you guys so it's 229 now and oh my gosh that's so weird why is it doing that anyways so it's 2:30 you guys and I am pretty faded I don't know what that means that's so weird oh it's doing it's like something the camera can see but not us okay guys so the edibles definitely hit you guys I was watching a really good movie right now called private life it's called private life and I was crying you guys I can't stop oh my gosh this edible is definitely hitting I was watching this movie called private life and if you haven't watched it you guys need to watch this movie like the movie is so it's real and I like that so yeah the edibles this is like 45 minutes after or 15 minutes after so like about an hour it took me to really get the feeling like I am super faded right now you guys like I'm just like deeply in movies right now if you guys want something that's gonna hit you guys should definitely get some wounds and if you like the mint flavor with chocolate this is definitely that so yeah thanks

where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking a look at another thing from canna candies there our first lollipop the grape medicated lollipop hundred milligrams of THC as rated by SC labs which is always great to get that little reminder that has been officially rated and it does have the THC as promised in there thanks the good folks at SC labs as I said this is my first lollipop not my first candy I've had hard candies from Canada candies before and in the grand scheme or scope of candies they're not bad I still wouldn't necessarily that wouldn't be my first choice for edibles I'd still stick with the confectionaries as always but the kind of candies are far from the worst types of candies so the lollipop I think cost me seven bucks at my dispensary which is a pretty affordable for a 100 milligram edible so let's just go ahead and open up and give it a and give it a taste here this is the first time you've ever tuned in two weeks the way our reviews work is I'm gonna eat this lollipop and then I will come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I am feeling because that is the most important part of the edible review not necessarily so much how it tastes so here we go we've got our big gourmet lollipop purpley black give it a lick how many to get to the center one to our you know things yep it tastes like a great bali pop without a lot of flavor and just a hint of weed exactly what I thought it was gonna be not great not terrible pretty much what you think it's gonna be as well think of a mild flavored grape lollipop with a bit of an earthy aftertaste except not as bad as sounding as that and that's what it's gonna taste like but guys without how hey how's this gonna make me feel for that you're gonna have to stay tuned and I will see you guys in two hours I'll be back right here to let you know how I'm feelin thank you so much for watching see you guys soon peace hi guys my dog squid here and I are back to talk to you about panic and ease Medicaid and lollipops the hundred milligram great flavor here I and I'm I'm kind of hi about what I would expect for a hundred milligram at all not a lot of red in the old I boss but again it's only 100 milligrams and I'm feeling about what I would think for that maybe a little bit lower probably just because it's a candy and those don't tend to hit me as hard as the confectionaries um but I don't I'm not dissatisfied with it it's again right in the sort of wheelhouse of what I was expecting didn't taste terrible I'm moderately high and for a candy it's it's one that I can recommend and it's pretty cheap bet like I said I think it cost me seven bucks so it's affordable it doesn't taste terrible and it got me pretty it got me a little high so it's what I was looking for what I was about what I was expecting if you're in the mood for a lower dose edible or if you're a new smoker and you want something a little bit higher dose that you can sort of media it out over time maybe give the lollipops a chance especially these ones from can of candies I can verify I and SC labs can verify you know they'll it will it will get you high and it doesn't taste too bad so that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds guys I really appreciate you tuning in as always we we'll see you on the next review and thank you so much for watching peace okay hello and thank you so much for watching weeds if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment below and I'll be more than happy to try to find the product to review it again thanks for watching and we'll check you guys out on the next video", "BzQ9i6EeCZQ": "all right so boom this is the official Twain 20 guy on how to safely consume weed edibles or any year for that matter because this is time that's advice you know I'm saying so I find that consuming edibles I eating it it's a lot more natural and has a less health risks than smoking anything you smoke and inhale into your lungs as the potential to affect your breathing cars in such as bronchitis and just overall get lungs see lungs other basic necessity of life right but at the point to note that not all edibles are created equal and being knowledgeable of the dosage level that you take is crucial in order for you to actually enjoy and have a good experience rather than be one of those people on YouTube that gives a story time about their worst experience of marijuana [Music] three hours later welcome back to no song edutainment yall already know what's going on subscribe to channel cuz I'm a fun guy I'm a cool guy I go through my day pretty normal like I'm a normal guy I'm a swell guy I'm a nice enough guy I'm a cool kind of guy I'm a pretty groovy guy I call this honest entertain you make you laugh but most importantly educate you on a variety of subjects that make you learn something they can apply it to your own personal personal life so mister my research the general consensus I see for a serving one serving of an edible is about 10 milligrams but not all will be dispensaries created equal like I said before some of them serve a bit more some of them aren't as precise and having each in each serving wrap individually so depending on where you get it from one serving we have a bit more THC than you might expect usually if it does have more THC than the 10 milligrams like limit it should have this image or however you wherever you see this image on the box right there but in the meantime products with too much THC must have these warning labels so I've told you why edibles are better than smoking or vaping me but how and what do you do to actually enjoy it safe so I got about five different steps for you to follow if you listen to me if you listen to me just listen to me you will enjoy your edible experience simple because I know it all I just played so most places require or from what I've seen research most states and my keys most provinces in Canada require a limit of ten milligrams of THC in a serving of edible but my suggestion Prasad is to tone it down a bit more and actually do five milligrams as your basic reduction to an edible cookie gummy bears or whatever so number one is important to read the packaging carefully so that you don't overdose or not overdose you can't really overdose on wheat but you can definitely take too much this easy there go anybody take a tab hallucinate you finished our trip the trip but chill out I got a heartbeat I can't feel [ __ ] so no longer do you have to play Russian roulette with your dosage amounts there's now a legal dosage of ten milligrams as your basic level of attaboy experience but if it isn't made at home then in that case be extra careful with how much you're taking in a given set or given serving size so especially if you're new to cannabis or you don't take it regularly it's important to dip your toe in the water a little bit before you dive in headfirst rather than taking the recommended ten milligrams take instead to five milligrams and then wait another two to three hours before you take another serving size just so that you are easing yourself into the whole edible experience and you can actually enjoy the high rather than you know some of the other stories I've seen on YouTube and even if you are a veteran cannabis user you should also implement my foot dosing which is start with five milligrams or even you start with the ten milligrams wait two or three hours and then add another one why should you do this because it gently stimulates the body's cannon but receptors which results in an increased high or increased mood productivity creativity without the sudden high effect that you might get if you were to just like consumer all I was in fact Oh Oh cookies very important to me I mean I love to me but they mean much more to me Tommy so the high is a bit more noticeable noticeable and more enjoyable like is you're kind of like on a roller coaster type of thing rather than already being at the top right so you're gently taking yourself to that peak or a high rather than just as soon as you get to the rides everyday at the top which is not ideal so again five milligrams as your basic level especially if you're a beginner and then every two or three hours just gradually take another serving size just so that you can safely and enjoyably each edible our number two is important to consider your tolerance having a low THC tolerance makes you susceptible to negative side effects of taking too much weed or taking too much THC such as paranoia anxiety and dizziness definitely without a doubt it's better to have an underwhelming experience than an overwhelming experience where you are shaking your you panicking whatever it is it's better to be disappointed than to be on the other spectrum if I'm gonna say okay do what you want you an adult but take heed take heed all right one word is good enough for the wise so he was so it's your first time trying a screen or not well since you interacted with marijuana in general don't try and keep up with the veteran smoker so don't try keep up with the rest of the crew just go at your own pace because there's it's not a race I see alright I got this off like that got the sauce little ketchup those sauce little ketchup thank you keep up with them because people that consume meet regularly already need a higher dosage to get their desired high effect and this is why I say it's important to take weed tolerance breaks the tolerance breaks for weed are important because it allows you to get higher for a longer period of time so your high or not it won't be like twenty minutes it'd be like two plus hours or so and you can get high on a small amount of weed which results in savings yeah I put it all together see it and trying to save y'all money I'm looking out for you looking out for your pockets so take means haulin sprigs periodically so that you can continue to not need a higher dosage and that your high can also last for a longer period of time simple so number three it just be patient like I said be patient with the THC and how it how long it takes to affect you depending on your metabolism and your body fat it can take anywhere from 30 minutes to two or maybe even a few hours so these snacks are not like your regular snacks at the grocery store or the corniche story these aren't regular snacks that you can - to eat as you're watching a Netflix videos or Netflix shows or movies whatever it is take heed to the serving size and be patient for 330 minutes any for 30 minutes to two hours if you feel the pips this is the moment you feel the effect is when you can like perhaps take another one but even at that let it right out for a bit on number four you want to be mindful of your stomach's contents so the more food you have in your system the longer it will take for weed to get metabolized in your bloodstream and take effect however in empty stomach I lost with the edibles to activate Kruger so just keep it just keep that in mind when and if you are eating edible did you eat already because if you didn't it'll take effect quicker and if you haven't eaten already before it then start with half a dose or what you usually take or what you want to take just so that you know just you can slow yourself in micro dosing same as the same thing micro dosing is the wave don't just jump in and if you drank alcohol beforehand alcohol can increase the THC blood concentration in your system so it's important to use caution if you're mixing alcohol with edibles and number five just this is more of like the nurture you know they say nature is the nature this is more of an immature type of thing it just be mindful of the environment like are you around people that you or as you care about you want people that care about you right and are you comfortable around these people so if you're taking a larger dose for the first time or long much more it's better take it at your home with your loved one or parent or francica with it your brother sibling romantic partner whatever it is just be around if you're taking a larger dose for the first time or just in general you are taking a new strain it's best to be around people that you actually are familiar with and you actually care about just to that part of for you to experience some type of anxiety or panic attack or just seeing a familiar face will keep you a bit more grounded if you did end up eating so much but again the more experience you have the more likely you are to be comfortable the easier it is for you to be comfortable in different situations or different environments but yeah so my kudos take it easy five milligrams or as your basis for anything for the most part and then just gradually increase your high once you start feeling the effects and its best it's always better to have an underwhelming experience then an overwhelming experience londo and take these five steps into consideration you will have a very enjoyable read hi and again have other videos above or edibles from marijuana lay the topics in the description pink ominous video and we showed with an addiction to read if you like you're smoking too much or you feel like it's no longer serving you I will hold mini course mini program that dancing walk you through steps you need to take to detox appropriately and to replace your weed habit with something more beneficial or

please want to commend you thank you not this one", "FI73gfwO1Lk": "[Music] another video today is gonna be a very different type of video as I've never done one of these before so I'm gonna try this out hopefully everything works out the way I have it in my head so let's get right into the video guys without further ado today is going to be actually a edible review so I'm not personally me myself I'm not a huge edible fan just because of how long the effects last how long they take to come on and a bunch of other factors just doesn't really make me a fan of it me personally when I like to use cannabis I like to know when I'm gonna be high for how long I'm gonna be high and you know I can plan my day around that with edibles it's kind of like once you take the edible and once it's in full effect you're kind of just basically useless as a person that's how you know heavy the effects are for metals for me personally I mean I'm speaking from my point of view everyone has a different tolerance everyone has different experiences so that's why I don't eat or use edibles that much but today's review is going to be hopefully you guys can see that on camera they're one of these shatter bars and this one is 250 milligrams of THC hopefully you guys can read that information hopefully it's focused hopefully the camera is focusing but yeah so this is a vegan shatter bar because that's the only one they had left so I just bought that one this one's two hundred and fifty milligrams of THC ten point four milligrams per square so when you open this up I'll show you guys it it's divided into little squares this one is sugar-free dark choc this one is an indica so they actually have a sativa and an indica bar I'm not sure how that affects I might have to try this a tea go on and see the difference but I've actually tried this one before and I know how it affects me so I roughly know what's gonna happen after I eat this but yeah this one is purple kush and there is 24 pieces in this bar so hopefully you guys can see that hopefully you guys can read that but yeah without further ado I'll just read like the ingredients here unsweetened chocolate sweetener cocoa butter soy lecithin natural vanilla flavor and yeah that's basically it it gives you the nutritional value here on the back it says that there is a lab test result so for the THC percentage it is 60 7.5% the THC a is zero point zero eighty percent THC V is a hunt one point twenty percent the CBN is zero point four hundred and fifty percent the CBD is zero point one thirty five percent the CBC is one point sixteen percent and the CBG is one point ninety two percent so I'll show you guys that there it's just on the back hopefully you guys can see that oh yeah let's get right into this review I'm gonna open this bad boy up show you guys what we're dealing in here and as I'm opening this up and showing you guys a lot of people might not be familiar with edibles or how they work and how they affect you I'll give you a brief rundown on how they work basically so what you have to do in order to make edibles is you have to use obviously cannabis or cannabis derived product like shatter I believe actually that's what they use to make these is they actually use shatter from purple kush or whatever it is to make the bar so you'd have to use shatter hash Keef something with a lot of cannabinoids in it obviously and what you have to do is decarboxylate the cannabis product whatever you're using the bud you know how shatter or whatever you're gonna be using you have to decarboxylate it now I'm not very knowledgeable when it comes to the actual science and how this stuff works but if you are interested just type in deep decarboxylation on google and it will give you a description on what it is exactly doing it has something to do with removing a carbon atom from the molecules or something along those lines I don't want to butcher the sign so I'm not gonna try and explain it but so basically you have to decarboxylate your cannabis make the edibles and what happens is it's it's different than smoking in the sense of when you smoke cannabis the witch is your smoking the THC the CBD and all the cannabinoids obviously so the THC which is known as Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol is present in the plant so when you smoke that the Delta 9 THC or Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol gets absorbed into the lungs then it goes into your bloodstream and then it gets processed that way and when you smoke obviously the effects come on immediately after the thing with edibles is once you eat the Delta 9 THC when your body starts to obviously break down the food and process it and digest it it turns that Delta 9 THC into 11 hydroxy THC or 11 hydroxy tetrahydrocannabinol so if you didn't know that it actually turns THC into a totally different compound which is why edibles lasts so long and is why like their effects are very very potent so I just want to give you guys that little bit of information if you weren't aware of that and yeah I'll show you guys the bar so this is like the little wrapping that it kind of comes in here I guess that's like their little logo or whatever whatever that means I don't even know what it says but yeah so and here she is there is the chocolate bar that we're dealing with so each square is ten point four milligrams of THC the entire bar is 250 milligrams of THC so now I was thinking about this before the video but I'll just say it to you guys as well I wasn't sure if I wanted to take the entire bar or if I wanted to eat half of it I mean it wouldn't really be an edible review if you only ate half because then you're not really getting the full effects so I'm just gonna leave this camera recording I'm gonna start eating this chocolate bar and I will report back in about an hour and hour and a half and I will tell you guys how I'm feeling how the effects are how actually I'm gonna start eating it now and I'll tell you how it tastes as well just cuz just kind of giving you an overall review of the product itself because some edibles taste like complete [ __ ] but then the effects are amazing and then some people make like really gourmet edibles that taste amazing and also the effects are there as well so I'm gonna try it now or shut up so there's one little square I know it's chocolate you kind of technically should be sucking on it and letting it melt in your mouth but I'm impatient it's actually a really good holy [ __ ] for being a vegan chocolate bar Wow I know I'm not really a big sweets person I'm not really a big chocolate person either but this tastes really good I mean it you can taste the slight cannabis taste in the background but overall this is like wow really surprised really good job what does the company euphoria extractions really really good job definitely a really good tasting chocolate bar so alright guys so without further ado I'm gonna finish this chocolate bar and I will report back in about an hour an hour and a half and give you guys the effects and how I'm feeling so enjoy the rest of the video guys peace [Music] so so far so good I mean I'll give you a little bit of information so I got the Edible from a local dispensary here in Toronto and it was about I think $26 for that chocolate bar kind of pricey I mean you have to pay taxes and whatnot which is whatever I mean you got to do what you got to do right the government has to get a cut always so yeah two hundred and fifty milligrams bar $26 I mean the chocolate bar itself tasted amazing tasted like a regular like dark chocolate bar really good taste you could taste the cannabis like on the back end and yeah that's all I can really say is if right now really good experience so far and like I said I'll come back in an hour now in half and let you guys know how I'm feeling so hopefully you guys have been enjoying this video I know it's a little bit different than what I normally post but I know there are edible users out there I know people might want to see these types of videos so I said why not make this video right oh yeah like I said I will see you guys soon and enjoy the rest of the video peace guys hey what up guys I'm back and we're gonna talk about the effects and how I'm feeling after taking that edible that I was talking about earlier so it's been about an hour an hour and a half no I don't even know I haven't even checked the time but I know it's for sure it's been an hour so I'm feeling pretty much the full effects already and holy [ __ ] it is definitely some phone stuff it's just a typical indica high I mean you're just couch locked you're sedated your pain with a lot of pain relieving properties a lot of body effects relaxation no depression no anxiety and yeah you're just having munchies you feel tired you could definitely fall asleep no problem but it is definitely some pown stuff and it will definitely last a long time so that is also a plus if you're looking for long lasting effects for like medical patients as well so yeah I mean that's basically all I can really say about it it isn't edible it's not like it really has like a taste or like you know any other smells and stuff like that it's basically just a chocolate bar so my overall rating I guess for this edible out of five I would definitely say it's a high quality edible I would give it a solid four to five and definitely recommend it if you live in Toronto and you're looking for edibles like that's definitely a good company to go with I would say so yeah that's been an edible review by I'm always blazing the 250 milligram euphoria extractions vegan chocolate bar so I hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did drop a like comment subscribe if you're new and yeah we'll see you guys in the next video B so guys", "GshuNm0rvkM": "what's up i'm with my buddy connor here and he is going to eat 500 milligrams of thc not only is it thc but it's delta 8 thc which is

those taste like real gummy worms though that [ __ ] well no they are real gummies yeah but normally like if you infuse like a cookie with thc and you can still see guy should be [ __ ] up it will be worth it though dude perhaps you're doing that i mean it's not like it's not like you know i mean you don't have to work tomorrow right he's underplaying it dude yeah i'm unemployed baby you're good

look at those eyes right there that's what those edibles do after one hour that's 500 milligrams of delta 8 thc um edibles man they're frying me already hell yeah it's been what are you expecting in the next 30 minutes sleeping probably so we'll see if we get any more of this are they sativa indica or what just distilling distillate oh so [ __ ] blacks is that what that is i guess you could call it delta 8 wax i mean wax is desolate um i guess but there's different methods of extracting it like co2 and bho and i guess the consistency determines what you call it but it's just distal it's just super thick and sticky and uh basically the gummies just regular gummies and they actually spray it with the actual thc oil oh wow so you're when you eat the gummies you're literally eating the straight oil on the actual gum that's insane i don't think i heard like a word you said because i'm just [ __ ] just going in and out of my eyes oh okay [Laughter] you feel [ __ ] up oh [ __ ] i can't

hope you enjoyed the video hit that like hit the like", "iwMgD51_zEk": "first off I just want to give a little disclaimer saying that I do not condone the use of any legal or illegal mind-altering substances the contents of this video are created purely for education it's inevitable that there will be people who consume these substances therefore it is extremely important to educate people on the effects and how to properly use them so edible pot is a lot different than smoking it it's more potent it's processed in the body differently and the effects lasts longer the difference with edibles is that the active ingredient the chemical that gets you high THC is processed in the liver before the user experiences any effects the original THC from the edible is converted in the liver into a more potent metabolite 11 hydroxy THC it's estimated that this compound is about four to five times more psycho active than normal THC and because the edible has to go through a portion of the digestive process before effects can be felt it can take 30 minutes - as long as two hours before a user feels any effects because of this people who don't feel any effects after an hour so might want to reduce only to have the entire thing hit them like a train all at once an hour later so my advice just wait it out it may take a while but it will come on and unlike smoking cannabis in which the effects last about two hours and gradually drop off after a quick climax right after inhalation edible pot takes its time before it reaches its peak in effect and this peak lasts longer typically the effects of edibles lasts four to eight hours when it comes to the effects there are certainly similarities between smokeable and edible weed but there are some properties that appear to only occur strictly on edibles there are two main reasons someone would want to consume an edible the first is for medical benefits such as aiding symptom relief of stress or anxiety or to help one sleep and the second is simply just for recreational purposes just to have a high and have a time aside from these two reasons there are actually a few people in the psychedelic community who use edibles and very high doses in a similar way to what one would use LSD or magic mushrooms for but we'll touch on that aspect at the end of the video so now we are going to get into what you can expect to feel from the different doses of weed edibles but firstly it's important to know that tolerance is everything tolerance plays a huge role in your experience and if you're an everyday pot smoker you'll likely have to take a much larger dose of an edible that someone who has no tolerance to THC in order to feel the same effect so take the following effects of doses I give with a grain of salt as this is just generally what you can expect to feel when you take this particular dose so first off we have the micro dose and this ranges anywhere from one milligram to about 2.5 milligrams of THC it's unlikely you'll experience any active effects from this dose but it is possible for people who are hypersensitive to the effects of THC this dose is more just for purposes such as mild relief of pain stress anxiety etc people who Micro's THC edibles might also report increased creativity and focus the effects of this dose are pretty passive you likely won't feel any different fundamentally this can be somewhat compared to people who micro doze LSD and magic mushrooms who do so for similar purposes next we have the low dose which ranges from two point five milligrams to about 15 milligrams and the two ends of the spectrum can be very different especially for people with low tolerance to th see someone consuming the edible for medicinal purposes will experience stronger symptom relief and this dose can also be used for people who have trouble sleeping you may begin to feel a sense of euphoria and that classic high feeling where coordination is slightly impaired and overall perception is altered but if this dose the high is unlikely to be overwhelming and because of this this may be a good dose to try for a first-timer in my own experience there isn't a significant difference between this dose and edible in your average smoking weed high the medium dose ranges from 15 to 30 milligrams someone with a decent THC tolerance still may not be feeling heavy effects here but for many vistas can make them pretty high it's at those dose that people may start to feel negative effects such as anxiety and paranoia you might ask if people use weed for relief of anxiety stress then how could this dose bring on anxiety and stress well THC has biphasic effects which means the substance can have opposite effects in different doses anxiety can be reduced in lower doses but can actually be stronger in higher doses so if you're taking edibles for symptom relief it is important to be aware of these biphasic effects the drug in half coordination and perception will likely be altered at this dose that agree to which it is altered will likely depend on your tolerance some people might start to get the classic red eyes from being high maybe some people experience close eye visuals for me personally I tend to have a close eye visual on low to medium dose weed that looks kind of like this let me know if you have experienced the same type of visual in the comments the high dose ranges from 30 to 50 milligrams this dose will likely bring a significant high even to someone with tolerance and for someone with low tolerance this can bring an extreme high their coordination will definitely be impaired somewhat you might feel a strong euphoria maybe you'll feel very laughy some people's mouths get very dry and get cottonmouth this is due to THC mimicking a naturally occurring chemical called an and amide which binds to cannabinoid receptors in our saliva glands which causes saliva production to decrease you might also get the classic munchies and just want to absolutely binge eat it's important to remember that the effects of THC impacts everyone differently so no two people's high will be exactly the same and you likely will only experience some of the effects I listed not all the very high dose ranges from 50 to 100 milligrams I would say it's more likely than not that you will probably experience some negative effects at this dose but the high may become so intense you may feel uncomfortable or overwhelmed people often experience a rapid heart rate panic nausea in headaches at this dose so definitely don't venture into this realm if you don't know what you're doing for someone with an extremely high tolerance this dose might not be too heavy but for the average person this will likely be overwhelming there are still medicinal benefits at this dose but is only used for people who really need it as this dose is sometimes using cancer patients to boost appetite and is also used for people with certain inflammatory disorders personally any dose at this range or above just completely puts me on my ass the come-up is nice for me as I feel very laughy energetic and social but once the effects really start peaking I honestly begin to struggle to stay awake and wish to do nothing else but to find a cozy place to lie down and fall asleep this may have been due to the strain though as THC isn't the only psychoactive chemical we it's just the most prominent CBD is the chemical that aids with sleep and this chemical also plays a role in the overall effects of the weed and the amount of CBD in the strain will most definitely impact your experience and finally the extremely high dose is going to be anything above 100 milligrams I've heard of some edibles having 250 milligrams some having 500 and even some containing as much as a thousand milligrams obviously the effects will get significantly higher as those increases a 100 milligram edible might not be incredibly strong for someone with a very high tolerance but certainly 500 milligrams is going to put anybody on their ass be very careful of consuming edibles this powerful as there will certainly be negative effects due to the intensity it's in these very high doses that have experienced visuals reminiscent of a psychedelic trip on say LSD the visual might be something kind of like this and speaking of psychedelics there's many people who report having psychedelic like trips from high doses of weed edibles the world-famous Joe Rogan likes to discuss edible pot as along the same lines as psychedelics such as LSD psilocybin mushrooms and DMT saying that edible pot can take you down the rabbit hole there's a comment I found from someone on reddit that I thought described as similarity of the psychedelic feeling on high-dose edibles perfectly not long ago I did a hundred milligrams of THC edibles and had zero tolerance on my couch my eyes closed and no music it was awesome and the peak was over three hours I swam through the psychedelic mind a tunnel with many doors and behind each door was a memory of mine I went through them and had Total Recall I could recall past memories memories of being born my first laugh before thinking and the experience that my first thought as an infant the pure thrill of thinking now the effects of THC in the brain is nowhere close to resembling that of a psychedelic classical psychedelics interact directly with the 5-htt to a receptor in the brain and cannabis does not do this from doing research it seems to be that weed edibles tend to resemble psychedelics more often for people who have already had experiences with psychedelics in the past it's likely more often that this psychedelic feeling is also associated with strains with higher THC levels and lower CBD levels as CBDs antipsychotic effects will likely lessen the psychedelic effect but if you find yourself feeling like you're in the middle of an intense psychedelic trip I'll say what I've always said before let the experience consume you surrender to the substance let your mind flow freely and try not to attach yourself to these thoughts just simply observe don't make any attachments so that's about it for this video hopefully you have a better idea on what you can expect to feel by the different doses of weed edibles if you're new start low THC affects everyone slightly differently so see how you react to the substance stay safe consume responsibly and you'll be fine if you seek to support my work on a deeper level consider joining the patreon I run a book club on there where we read one book a month about topics we go over on this channel if that interests you definitely consider joining as always guys have a great day and peace [Music]", "y-UlV_CJ-NA": "i feel like i might be high like i really can't tell if i'm it's like for a little [Music] hey and i know you guys are like sick and tired of me disappearing for months on end i legit have been gone for a month even after i said i was going to start recording again i've just ultimately realized like at least for me and my life and my health i i just have to do things when i want to do them and i've learned that in my relationships my friendships like you got to let people go when you want to not when it's good for them and put out good things you know when you have the energy to do so so i am finally feeling like i have the energy to record again and i figured why not give you guys something fun obviously this video is going to be about me trying edibles for the very first time but backstory i have never smoked before i've never smoked i've never legit done any drug ever like nothing ever every time i mentioned to somebody that i haven't smoked before they're like why like i'm 26 years old never smoked before you know nugs not drugs kids nugs not drugs i've always been interested in trying edibles or um shrooms weird enough i actually just watched a documentary i think called psychedelic on netflix i'm not sure what the documentary is called but i have just always been interested and i guess an easier high where you can just eat something and experience it i genuinely think this is probably going to be the first and last time but i mean who knows like sorry mom i know you're probably watching this it's so funny because everybody including my mom including my dad literally everybody i know has smoked before everybody has done something before i literally have done nothing so i figured why not make my first experience memorable and share it with you guys so the big sour patch kids are the highest milligram that i got it's 150 milligrams i don't even know how milligrams work i don't even know like how much wheat is what i remember getting weed for a guy that i know a couple years ago and literally i got it wrong and he ended up like losing money i guess because i got the wrong amount and i was like i don't know how this works like i legit have never done drugs so yeah this is 150 milligrams whatever that means thing that i got was the red velvet chips ahoy honestly this i got just because i was like this sounds delicious like i've never tried red velvet chips ahoy and they're soft and i was like oh like it's gonna be good so i got that that's 175 milligrams last thing that i got were hot cheetos and these are 75 milligrams two um again i don't know how much milligram is what i just know that i was like i'm gonna get the things that i would actually eat this ain't going lowest the highest but he said cookies then cheetos then the gummies um and he said you're a virgin my [ __ ] is rockin um and then he said don't eat all of anything and then he said i'd love to come check on you he actually asked me about a boyfriend i spent 60 dollars um i can put the prices of each thing up on the screen like right here um but it wasn't crazy expensive been around wheat my whole life i just have chose not to um so i know what weed smells like wow okay yeah the gummies definitely have the highest amount [Music] okay i'm hoping somewhere between 30 minutes and an hour something happens i don't even know what high feels like so i don't know if i'm even gonna notice but we'll see so i'm doing this much one cookie oh i'm gonna do two cookies so i guess two cookies i mean i definitely i definitely think if these were on the counter i wouldn't notice that there was wheat in it i mean it's definitely like it tastes like a cookie i'm kind of like noticed doing this much of the other cookie all right i'm cozy guys i'm over here thinking i'm like my mom's probably gonna be more mad about me eating on her couch than she is about me doing drugs all right hot cheetos i really just want to taste these i'm really not gonna eat a lot of these i think that much don't feel like that's enough what if i end up like i didn't take enough and then like i don't even notice y'all i don't taste it at all but these are good like i honestly haven't had hot cheetos in a minute because i don't really eat chips like that like when i eventually do want chips i do end up getting hot cheetos but i really don't eat chips like that so these just taste good i don't think maybe because they're hot you taste it a lot less had you not told me not to eat all of these i probably would have eaten the entire bag of these hot cheetos okay [Music] i haven't had hot cheetos in a minute y'all these are good and lastly the big sour patch kids i think i'm gonna do three he said don't eat all of anything but he said i could have a few so i'm thinking three they're like this size you see that they're like this size this tastes good they don't have a wee taste at all honestly i don't feel like any of these really have wheat taste like i know it's in here so i'm looking for it but i legit feel like if you just said it on the counter you would not like pay attention to it guys this is going to be so good just for the simple fact that i don't eat things like this like i really don't eat candy like that i really don't eat chips like that i really like you know my weight gain my weight eating came from food honey i'm like one of those people that be like oh i want a midnight snack but i want some ribs it won't be no like simple snack all right last one yo this one looks like two in one this last sour patch so i did three sour patch about a little palm full of hot cheetos and two cookies so i'm gonna check back with you guys i'm also actually video chat my friend so hopefully it doesn't get again when i'm on my conversation but we're gonna see so wish me luck i'm gonna see you guys in a minute so it has been 30 minutes so right now it is 206 i took the edibles whatever at 1 35 so we're 30 minutes in and i don't feel anything the one thing though that my best friend i actually told my best friend i was doing this video right before nicki if you're watching this hello she just um messaged me on instagram and she was like girl don't take more like less

keep checking in with you guys every 30 minutes and see if i feel higher um i don't know if it's gonna work for me i just feel like when you haven't smoked before maybe like my body's like especially because i'm one of those like whatever i really don't care about being high and feeling this and escaping the world i'm like i love my life i love my job i love everything that's going on with me and my life the disrespect on video chat but whatever so anyway um yeah i just feel like when i'm a person that like doesn't i guess care about it or really believe in it or want it to work i'm like i wonder if it's just not gonna work for me because my body's just i mean i've legit just been watching tv and on video chat so again we'll check back in all right so [Music] i originally told you guys i was going to um check back in at 2 30 5 2 35 all right so it's 4 42 right now and i'm like i feel like i might be high like i really can't tell if i'm it's like for a little bit of a second like everything nothing's funny nothing's funny okay anyway what i was saying is i said i was getting checked back in at 2 35 it's 2 42 and i just can't stop laughing because i was on um i was on video chat and um i was eating this mango and a fly was in the kitchen on the floor and it literally like jumped like a frog and it kind of threw me all off guard but um since that happened it's just been like everything's funny i don't know how to describe it other than like get so lovey it's so weird because like i think i might be high but i can't i keep saying that i'm not high so i can't okay no it's like i can't get anything out like what the heck okay it's weird because like i'm i'm here and i recognize like what's going on but i don't know why everything's like funny okay everything just got really funny and i'm freaked out because i have to legit drive to get my mom so my mom's at um i dropped her off this morning and i have to go get her and i'm like i don't know like i don't know it came on in a matter of like 15 minutes because when i definitely looked at the clock and i was like oh there's eight minutes until i have to tell them if i'm feeling high or not and um then everything got funny and i was like oh shoot like legit that hit me really fast i didn't even know if i was still recording or not okay the feeling of high i don't know like i legit walked upstairs to get my charger and then i couldn't focus and i felt my brain was like not focusing um but yeah the most thing that i noticed the most the thing that i noticed the most was just that my heart i've been able to feel my heart like like my heart um i can feel it like i can feel my heart through my body the main thing that i feel like i just i'm talking a lot more and i feel like my thought process is just like this all over the place i don't know i don't know why that's like a feeling people would want to get because like while i'm feeling this right now i feel like i'm right now i'm on an even mindset i'm understanding i'm recording youtube video and then i need to stop talking because i'm on video chat and this is supposed to be like a short explanation and i just can't stop talking but i recognize that this is what i'm doing right now like i'm i am doing this right now but um i'm just gonna check back in with you like but i just don't know if i like this feeling like i am acknowledging that i'm recording this i'm acknowledging that it's for a reason but my brain is just like going on everything but um yeah so i'm going to check back in in about 30 minutes we'll see i've been recording for five minutes i feel like that's a really long time it's a really long time um so my next check in i'm gonna make it try and try make it short and sweet and yeah talk to y'all in a little bit hey guys right now it is 3 51 and i definitely feel like i have experienced the high i guess i didn't think that it'd feel like this i don't know like genuinely i felt like the entire time all i've felt like is actually i'm gonna look at myself just because it's helping me focus a little bit more looking at something um but i feel like i didn't expect it to feel like this i i just felt like i kept saying things that were so honest and i was like oh like i should start you know being quiet and it just was not i would not stop talking so yeah everything um was cool it just i guess this is just not how i experienced or thought i was gonna be experiencing it it's just really weird i don't i actually don't like it and i don't know why people get high like i would not want this feeling again i don't know i guess i thought like high like when i see people they're like chill you know sit back and share whatever like they feel good or like i guess some people get high and get like hype but i just feel like i feel so outside my body and like uncomfortable and like i just felt like i kept on saying things that i didn't want to say for the past hour which had been eating talking on the phone and then i got off the phone everything was funny a minute ago like i did not i guess that's when i noticed that i was high as like my brain just doesn't feel like it's fully functioning how it should function right now um and then all of a sudden it got really sad like five minutes ago like i don't know it's just like a sad feeling but i don't know if i'm sad because i'm like i really wish i didn't do this like like that might be why like i'm kind of sad about that like i was having a conversation with somebody and not able to understand like what was going on i mean i get it like we were having a conversation but like some of the conversation i just felt like i don't know like i was definitely talking and saying things that were like overly truthful and my mouth was moving but i'm like shut up like stop talking right now um and that's not a good feeling like when you're when you're aware that you're not coherent enough for the conversation you're having i feel like that's i mean that's i don't understand why people would want to feel that maybe just feel outside your head i don't know if like your person who doesn't really think much then maybe getting high will make you think more but i feel like i think a lot and i'm very focused normally so to feel very not focused and scatterbrained and looking at everything that you know pops up um i don't know like that feeling i don't know i guess that's why i've never done anything like this or done anything like drug related it's because i feel like if there's no reason for you to be doing it then don't do it like if you're watching this video even though like i'm recording it to show an experience don't think it's cool or like this is fire like this is not i don't know i guess it was like a funny video idea but i also wish that i didn't even do it like i don't know i just feel really sad i feel like i feel like that sadness is just me like realizing that i just shouldn't have shouldn't have done this um but yeah so it is three three it's 3 56 so um i thought i was going to check in at 3 35 i think last time but um i think i'm going to check back in around 4 35 like 4 30 or 5-ish just see i mean how i'm feeling then ultimately like it's really weird because all i'm thinking is how long is this going to last like i don't know i just don't get why people do this like i mean i have definitely um i guess they say that you should do it with someone for somebody to babysit you i was on video chat i mean no one's in my house right now but um i was on video chat but i just felt like i don't know i don't i don't i don't know i felt like once i got off the phone it was when i noticed um i don't know more aware of things like the way things felt in my body and i don't know i just don't like this i don't like it i feel like looking at myself in the viewfinder is helping me focus but i feel like i don't know my brain is definitely just like why did i do this that's why you don't do drugs kids it's honestly not even the hype that people made it this isn't like a good feeling like being high it's like i like being calm and coherent and you know not feeling outside my body and i guess a lot of people do it to get outside like if they're not happy or they want to feel a boost of probably serotonin and serotonin that's um in your body that like releases you to be happy um i don't know like this doesn't feel like that it just feels like a little bit like i'm outside my body and i'm um not myself and i actually really enjoy being naughty in my my daily life so um i don't know i wondered like if edibles like the high that you get is like different from when you smoke i don't ever plan on smoking like i don't know if you've ever been to the bodies exhibit we have it in atlanta um but you can see what a lung looks like healthy and what it looks like when it's been um smoked through and i just don't want it in my lungs like i smoke before but i'm like i would i even stopped doing that because it made me feel light-headed um but yeah i don't get why somebody would want to be high i ended up taking off my lashes and stuff because it like legit felt like they were 200 pounds like they were irritating on the eye and then i like ate this mango and put water all over my face and then wiped to where the inside of my shirt i'm sure has like brown from my makeup and i was like oh shoot i have makeup on but yeah it's four o'clock i'm gonna check back in around five let's see if i'm still high hopefully this doesn't last too much longer because i don't like the feeling and i want it to be over with but um yeah we're gonna check back in an hour and see how i feel i might take a nap just so i can like maybe sleep it off i'm hoping maybe i can drink it through maybe the food just has to like get out of my body but i don't know guys i don't know but i just want it to wear off already i laid down for about an hour i did not um i didn't go to sleep but i laid down for about an hour i couldn't like my mind was still racing but i feel a lot better just laying down um i can feel it coming down really weird experience i feel like i'm like a little hot and i'm talking with lisp which is i don't know but yeah that was my first time doing any kind of thing it is now time for me to go pick up my mom i just feel tired now um but yeah weird experience don't do drugs kids i feel like now knowing the experience i would never do it again so i thought that my last snippet video i guess was going to be my last video but i'm actually feeling a lot better right now it is the 7 50. so just now at 7 50 i'm finally feeling better and like myself and like my brain is clear i went to go grab my mom and i was honestly like really hungry i mean while i was high on the edibles i ate two mangoes two apples um a baked potato um what else a coke um i feel like i have something else oh and this like um shrimp and broccoli like stir-fry or whatever with some ginger sauce like oh and a bowl of frosted flakes so i don't know like i thought that you only got hungry when you were high on like smoking i didn't know you actually got like high off edibles and still wanted to eat stuff i never knew that was a thing but yeah i ate a lot while i was um highly edible before i got to my mom i did go ahead and stop at taco bell and i did guys i was trying to go ahead and make that like a laxative because i figured if it's an edible it's something that's in your stomach and it needs to get out of your system so tmi got it handled and since that happened i now feel a lot better um when i went to go pick up my mom we've been sharing a car for the past like a week or so um until she gets her car next week but excuse me um i literally when i pulled up to her i hopped in the passenger seat like mom's like why didn't you get out the car to like get in the passenger seat like i just need to get in the passenger seat so pretty much i um let her drive and just kind of like drove away and um go ride over here i just went ahead and went to sleep so i feel a lot better i didn't really go to sleep but it was more like relaxing closing my eyes and like now that it's out of my system i feel like i feel a lot better um i did not like the feeling guys i don't know how people do it like i know people who do edibles all the time people smoke all the time like i don't know if that's the feeling you get but i did not enjoy it i don't like feeling outside of myself i like to be clear-headed um so to feel like i was drugged like that's what i mean it felt like that um it wasn't a good feeling i was like i don't want to experience this again i literally remember um on the way over here all i was thinking was yo i need to like get rid of these like i need to flush them on toilet give it to a friend something like they have to go not flush them down totally but you know get rid of them um likely i'm gonna give them to a friend rather than throw it away because it was sixty dollars but i am just not interested i'm not interested in getting any more trying different flavors like i just did not like the experience um i felt like my brain was really clouded and heavy and it was almost like i'm kind of atd so i feel like every time when i'm thinking my thoughts go everywhere anyway but i can still organize them like i'm used to it enough that it's like i can organize thoughts in my brain but when i was high on the edibles it was almost like i could not control my brain hopping on a trillion different things and i was on video chat and i felt like i was saying things that were like brutally honest and i'm like yo why is this happening right now like it was like my mouth was moving saying things like shut up shut up so yeah i didn't really like that feeling i don't like not feeling in control and i definitely did not feel in control while i was high on the edibles um they tasted good we're going off taste i'd say 10 out of 10 they were all really really good but i'm just really thinking about experience i don't know if it's how you're supposed to feel but i just remember feeling really disoriented and my thoughts were not coming up straight in my brain as well as the fact that um i was just really confused and would not stop saying things i'm just like be quiet and then directly after that i got really sad um and disappointed in myself that i did it how long does high last night like it peaks at two to three hours so i was like i think i'm peeking so i literally was with my eyes closed but i was paying attention to everything like the fan um how it felt up against my skin i felt like i was um breathing extra heavy i don't know i just was not it was not comfortable and i just was not happy but i am glad that i experienced it i'm glad i experienced it alone i don't know if that was good or bad thing but yeah we're never doing that again hopefully you guys enjoyed it and give this video a thumbs up for me and my experience and yeah that's gonna be it for today i just love you bye", "H-KD67mwVC0": "so what does 500 milligrams of THC feel like well I can tell you that it doesn't feel good it kind of feels like this okay so it's a little over two weeks ago that I was given ten drops of cannabis oil and the dosage was played down to me and I wasn't sure exactly how many milligrams I was taking it was said that it was diluted and very weak and I was given ten drops and I have never ever taken anything cannabis related in my life so obviously it's gonna hit me harder I wasn't planning to take it I thought the worst that can happen is I'm gonna be extremely relaxed and calm and I haven't really done a lot of research into THC and cannabis oil and the effects on what it does to you so I took the ten drops under my tongue kept it there had a bit of a bitter taste didn't taste much else and then afterwards found out that there was 500 milligrams of THC in those 10 drops so I didn't know if 500 milligrams was a lot or not because I've never really put much research into the actual effects and what the dose is is law when I read online that 500 is extremely high and I was seeing a lot of people there are regular cannabis oil users or THC users I saw how it affected them I thought to myself well I'm either gonna feel weird and go through like a sleepy zombie State or I'm just gonna feel okay so an hour went by I felt okay and I decided to leave the house because I actually forgot that I taken it I carried on swimming and we were doing a whole bunch of things as I was leaving my skin was so hot like it suddenly felt like in that split second I was fine doesn't feel anything in the next second it just hit me and my skin felt so hot like there was a con air blowing on me and it honestly felt like heat a so I went up to it and I faltered and when I put my hand closed it felt like cold air but as I stood back that that air blowing on my skin for that I was on fire I literally felt like I couldn't handle the heat the next thing that happened is just almost like the wall closing in and like tunnel vision and it was just black everywhere except right in front of my eyes and it felt like like like falling or furutaka like you at the top and as you drop it's like that whoop kind of feeling like everything closing in your stomach jumping and I was horrible I felt like whoa something's not right and then I remembered I took ten drops of cannabis oil and I thought to myself okay maybe it's bringing on some anxiety because I've suffered with anxiety attacks and I managed to calm myself down over the years and control it it just got worse and worse and worse my heart rate shot up so high that it I could feel it jumping on my chest now thought okay it's definitely anxiety but my heart the way my heart was going and felt completely different to anxiety so on my very very bad anxiety attacks where I've got rushed to the ER I had a heart rate of 140 beats a minute now if you think about it to put it in perspective your resting heart rate is about 60 beats a minute it can range between 60 to 100 but usually your resting heart rate is about 67 so 140 is for me if I'm boxing or if I am on a treadmill and I'm running or on the elliptical machine or skipping doing those intense things your heart rate is about at 140 so now I imagine being at a resting heart rate and suddenly shoot up to 140 where it feels like you're running on a treadmill and you're out of breath like you you're running that fast but you're not so your breathing doesn't match your heart rate your brain doesn't match your body's activity and everything's just out of synch so that's classic anxiety symptoms I thought to myself I just gotta calm down so much my heart rate shot up to a hundred and seventy two beats a minute now that's the highest I've ever seen it even when I've exercised and when I used to do MMA training my heart rate ever used to go to 172 I think 165 was the max I've ever seen my heart rate I felt like my heart couldn't take it I had this burning sensation through my chest like almost like when the letter s it is building up in your body and you're training hard and you feel like your muscle cannot take the weight if you lifting a little bit too heavy feels like I'm also gonna take I had that same kind of burning feeling in my chest and my heart was racing so fast on top of that I had this funny feeling like it was it was just like my heart couldn't cope with a the beats per minute and I lay on the bed I got managed to get to the bed and I was struggling to speak because my heart was going so crazy that I couldn't get the words out like I was freaking out inside and I was told with it that's the weird thing I didn't feel the effects of the THC besides those physical responses like I was I was going through all of this but in my mind I'm like just relax it's anxiety and even though my heart was that fast I'm like you're just gonna freak yourself out more and I was talking to myself to calm myself down using my diaphragm to breathe and slow my heart rate slow my breathing control everything but it just got worse and worse and worse when I checked my heart rates again and weights up to 180 and it wasn't like a panic attack where it stays high for long and then oops it just stayed constantly a tip from 180 dip down to 172 to 165 and it didn't go below 165 it was between 165 and 172 for about seven hours so even though the HC is considered safe there are extreme cases where there are complications so if your heart rate stays too high for too long you can have a heart attack my blood pressure was extremely high eventually we call the paramedics because I didn't feel like I was gonna make it now I've seen lots of stories of people taking too much and especially if it's their first time they think that they're gonna die and they have anxiety and freaked out I've been through so much anxiety over the years and has so many anxiety attacks where I was rushed to hospital and this fall so different my mind was still there like I was still thinking everything and I honestly felt like I was I was blacking out and my heart was going way too fast and my heart couldn't take it they called the paramedics the paramedics came my heart rate was still extremely high my oxygen saturation was so low because I wasn't breathing properly I was trying to control my breathing so much that I eventually slowed my breathing down so much that I stopped breathing basically they had to stand over me and told me to take deep breaths because I basically lost respiration and I wasn't getting enough oxygen in my body so I made a conscious effort to suck in air but I struggled so much to breathe it's almost like a disconnected feeling and I have read that so that you could become disconnected but you don't know where you are I knew exactly what was happening around me I could feel every single thing I could feel muscles in my face I could feel the inside of my ears I could feel all my muscles I could feel everything it's scary because then you start feeling so lame almost like I couldn't really move much then I would try shake myself like just like the little jerks and jumps to like wake myself up because I could feel like I was slipping away - I don't know passing out or blacking out and the funny thing is in that clip where you see me laying on the bed there my blood pressure was so high it was 190 over a hundred ten I think somewhere there and I thought I had glasses on I'd fought like you know when you put glasses on they're a little bit too tight and you can feel the bands on behind your ears I could feel that and because my blood pressure was so high my veins were so tight there I didn't have two losses on it was just those veins and the whole time I thought I had glasses on because of that feeling my blood pressure was extremely high my heart rate was way too fast and that's lost him for seven hours it's the last longer but off those first seven hours those were the worst so having a heart rate go that fast for that long it can be dangerous and having a blood pressure that high and if it rose higher along with that heart rate is extremely dangerous you could have a stroke you can have a heart attack it's very easy so even though it is a natural compound and there are no reported deaths from cannabis the complications or ever stating and I've never felt that scary in my life through all the anxiety attacks that I had and everything that I've been through with thoracic outlet syndrome that feeling right there was the scariest feeling I've ever had when I had anxiety I used to think that I was gonna die and eventually you know you're not gonna die even though you feel like it with us I just I couldn't control it obviously I take it such a high dose that my mind was only focusing on negative things as much as I was trying to stay positive and talk myself through it and the paramedics actually brought the stretcher they wanted to take me to hospital if my blood patient didn't go down and they stayed with me for a quite a while because I saw such tunnel vision and my blood pressure was so high I think I just like to zoned in I honestly thought that they took so many hours to get there and it felt like it was nighttime reading where in the clip you can see I'm laying there as it's fall early evening I think there was 10 past 6 or so so I was really like out of it I doesn't feel good at all my whole family around me none of them had ever seen me look that bad I didn't see myself making it out of it my heart was feeling so strained it was about three days after that that I still felt like I couldn't do anything because just getting off the bed walking around the house I felt like my heart was pumping so hard like it like it was overused then drained from the day before so it was just like the next week I had no energy I had left so much energy I wasn't myself at all I doesn't feel good I had the worst headache and obviously such a high dosage was way too high for my body to handle and I had no tolerance to it and it wasn't something that I've ever wanted to try or thought to try so it was a stupid decision to even want to try it and that's why I just got to be careful with what you take sometimes doctors will prescribe you medicines and things and they just don't work with your body they react differently and your experiences can be totally different to somebody else so you everyone can be laughing and having a great time and then you are freaking out and having the worst time and just now you get a complication and like I honestly thought that I wasn't gonna make it and it was an exaggeration because when I look back at the footage that I have the way I look in the video freaked out and not looking good at all my heart rate I got felt that and I can still feel that I can think about it and feel that scared feeling that I felt and it wasn't just because I was having some weird experience from the THC it was just it was pure anxiety and pure fear and yeah it's not something that I enjoyed at all I know I should have researched first it was one of us things that happen so fast that you make a stupid decision and it can affect you it was one of those kind of things because I love to research everything down to a tee before I take it when I had my thoracic outlet syndrome when I was on tremor doll I took like three tremor dolls and I threw the Box away because of all the first of all the way it made me feel I fall I couldn't feel like myself didn't take my pain away and all the side effects so I threw it away and cured myself naturally and this was just one of those things where it wasn't planned at all and just happened like in that split second I was like okay let me just take ten drops I mean what 10 drops gonna be and ya had the scariest 7 hours of my life fortunately I came right I eventually managed to stand after seven hours I managed to get up stand I felt horrible and weird and zoned out but I felt a little bit more relieved that I felt like myself I felt like it just slowed down enough to a point where I felt I felt okay and I could I could go home so yeah that's my experience it's a horrible experience now I know there's I've really got so many messages from people all over saying it took too much and if you want the right those who just message me or if you want proper CBD oil with no THC I'm not interested in any of those things I'm not interested in any of those kind of questions telling me that I took way too much because I know it took way too much for myself but this was just something I thought I'd share because there are so many websites that you read and and obviously it's promoted as a safe thing to take and obviously if it's measured properly and in the right dosages then it can be safe and it can be useful for many things but if you're just taking it and you don't have any knowledge about it and you're taking too much like I did it can be scary and it can be dangerous and just now you're taking a higher dose and your body can't handle it and you end up having a heart attack or stroke or something that could have been avoided because you don't know enough so I hope my experience can just hope somebody make the right decision and not just take some research first I have been struggling to train I've been back to training maybe once or twice but because I've been so busy at work I haven't like got myself back into training and making videos on regular basis so I'll get back to making all my podcast series that I was trying to work on before all of this happened I hope this can help somebody and at least make them think before they try something I'll see you guys soon", "eufPBD-K5yY": "so real quick just wanted to go over the street value versus dispensary value of some of these edibles here these edibles they are selling for about forty five dollars in the dispensary over by the Cape forty five dollars for 100 milligrams street value you can get them for about ten to fifteen dollars sometimes up to twenty definitely less than forty I've seen these go for as much as twenty as low as ten hundred milligrams there's a lot of them to a pack this one only has one left but there's a lot of these to the pack usually about fifteen not that strong the watermelon blasts over here the sour watermelons they're about 100 milligrams as well same thing ten to 12 ten to twenty bucks sometimes maybe a little more there's only about ten of these in a pack same thing missing a little bit when we bought ten of these in a pack and yeah street value of ten to twenty five ten to twenty what elbow but these are much want I don't know that are stronger two of these will have you feeling alright one if you're drinking if you don't do this stuff often I'll have you feeling good and then the CBD CBD can take you now from the THC high you can also help reduce anxiety and these things here I got from the amazing porn store down the street twenty five dollars for this pack he they're 100 milligrams it was five frogs in here 20 bucks twenty for whatever after-tax 22 I don't know 20 bucks 100 milligrams twenty bucks is cheapest ten bucks for one hundred milligrams as well you can pick these up almost anywhere Amazon that Bethany on your gas station pretty much anyway same price or similar pricing fifteen to twenty five so all around not a bad product what if you're going to dispensary for this expect the payable forty-five

"hey everyone i'm Shereen from mypaynecenter.com\u00a0\nthe cbd headquarters hey today i want to try our\u00a0\u00a0 new delta 8 gummies with you guys i want to tell\u00a0\nyou how i feel when i eat them what they taste\u00a0\u00a0 like and all that good stuff i'll even walk\u00a0\nthrough what is delta 8. i do have a prior\u00a0\u00a0 video that i made that goes through what is delta\u00a0\neight so you can watch that if you don't wanna\u00a0\u00a0 hear about what the gummy bears are like but you\u00a0\nwanna go straight into the what is delta eight so\u00a0\u00a0 right now on our site we carry delta eight in two\u00a0\ndifferent flavors we've got a few other flavors on\u00a0\u00a0 the way but for right now we've got two flavors\u00a0\non the site we've got a berry white which is an\u00a0\u00a0 indica indica is really good at night for sleep\u00a0\nbut it's got all the same benefits as the sativa\u00a0\u00a0 which is really good in the daytime because it\u00a0\ndoesn't make you as drowsy the sativa comes in\u00a0\u00a0 an orange crush flavor and the indica comes\u00a0\nin a very white flavor they're both delicious\u00a0\u00a0 the whole container has 30 gummy bears in it\u00a0\nthere's 750 milligrams in each container so each\u00a0\u00a0 gummy has about 25 milligrams of delta eight\u00a0\nin it so these are the two we carry right now\u00a0\u00a0 we also have these little sample packs so if you\u00a0\ndo order anything from mypaynecenter.com and you\u00a0\u00a0 want to try delta8 but maybe you're not willing to\u00a0\nmake the commitment right now to a whole bottle of\u00a0\u00a0 delta 8 just let us know in the notes section\u00a0\nhey i want to try a delta eight sample can i\u00a0\u00a0 get a sample and we will send you a sample so\u00a0\ntoday i'm going to take a sample of the indica\u00a0\u00a0 the barry white um because about 9 30 almost 9 45\u00a0\nhere at night and i'm probably gonna try to go to\u00a0\u00a0 bed by eleven eleven thirty so this should kick\u00a0\nin way before then and we're gonna have a great\u00a0\u00a0 night's sleep so i'm gonna take this now and\u00a0\nthen i'll walk you through what is delta eight\u00a0\u00a0 okay so here we go so it's just like\u00a0\nthis okay so i'm gonna eat it it's chewy it's pretty sweet too a little sour but\u00a0\nit's like a mixture it's like a sour bear i should also note the delta eight can\u00a0\nshow up on a drug test because there is\u00a0\u00a0 thc in it not the thc that's in the\u00a0\ndelta eight like there's delta a\u00a0\u00a0 thc and then there's delta nine thc and\u00a0\ni'm going to tell you the difference so i will say the gummy bear was sweet and sour it\u00a0\nwas a good taste you could taste the berry in it\u00a0\u00a0 there is like a slight aftertaste to it like a\u00a0\num like a bitter aftertaste to it so it's not\u00a0\u00a0 as smooth as a cbd gummy where you can't taste\u00a0\nany cbd in it you definitely can taste in the\u00a0\u00a0 aftertaste that there is something in this but\u00a0\nit's not gross or overpowering or overwhelming\u00a0\u00a0 but just be aware that there is an aftertaste\u00a0\nokay so we're gonna let that seep through my body\u00a0\u00a0 it is actually 9 54 right now so we can keep\u00a0\ntime on how long it takes for this gummy bear\u00a0\u00a0 to really take impact on me so what is delta eight\u00a0\nokay so i'm gonna i'm gonna make it really simple\u00a0\u00a0 there's delta eight which is\u00a0\nwhat we're talking about today\u00a0\u00a0 and then there's weed and in weed there's thc\u00a0\nand that thc makes you high paranoid stone\u00a0\u00a0 increases your anxiety whatever it does to you\u00a0\nmay make your mouth dry it may make you hungry all\u00a0\u00a0 that stuff that that's weed thc also called delta\u00a0\n9 thc okay this is delta 8 thc the difference\u00a0\u00a0 is a carbon bond and that's what makes the what\u00a0\nmakes them different now they both have the same\u00a0\u00a0 properties to them in the sense of what they can\u00a0\ndo for you they have the same benefits per se\u00a0\u00a0 so just like when you smoke weed to relax to lower\u00a0\nyour anxiety lower your stress chill out calm down\u00a0\u00a0 maybe use it for pain relief anxiety relief\u00a0\nsleep maybe usually for nausea maybe use it\u00a0\u00a0 as an appetite stimulant delta eight will do all\u00a0\nof that for you as well but delta eight will not\u00a0\u00a0 make you high stoned increase your anxiety make\u00a0\nyou paranoid make your mouth dry but this is\u00a0\u00a0 legal and you can buy it without either a medical\u00a0\nmarijuana id or for buying it from a dealer behind\u00a0\u00a0 the garbage can or i don't know i don't know how\u00a0\npeople buy drugs these days i'm really not sure\u00a0\u00a0 um but this is legal because it comes from a hemp\u00a0\nplant so it is legal under the farm bill of 2018.\u00a0\u00a0 i should also note though that this does have\u00a0\ndelta 9 or weed thc in it less than 0.3 percent\u00a0\u00a0 because if it's more than 0.3 it's not legal\u00a0\nanymore in the united states but if it's less\u00a0\u00a0 than point three percent it is legal however\u00a0\nthat means it will show up on your drug test\u00a0\u00a0 so be careful if you are going to have these\u00a0\nokay so i'm just gonna let it sink in um and\u00a0\u00a0 i'll just keep reporting out to you guys as i go\u00a0\nthrough my process here okay y'all i had to go\u00a0\u00a0 lay down because then it started to hit me and\u00a0\ni was like oh my god so how do i feel it is now 10 36 so it's been what is that 40 minutes yeah\u00a0\nit's been 40 minutes since i took the gummy\u00a0\u00a0 um i've been watching tik tok videos\u00a0\nso probably not the best thing to do\u00a0\u00a0 if you're trying to go to sleep but uh\u00a0\ni feel relaxed i feel calm i am feeling\u00a0\u00a0 drowsy like i can feel my eyelids getting heavy\u00a0\num they started watering for a hot minute too i feel kind of like heavy if that makes\u00a0\nsense like i'm lying down and i just feel\u00a0\u00a0 heavy not fat heavy though i don't\u00a0\nknow what's going on over here but like\u00a0\u00a0 just you know like when you're sleeping and\u00a0\nyou're just dead weight yeah i feel like i'm\u00a0\u00a0 already like a dead weight like i think my body\u00a0\nis already sleeping and it's like shut up now\u00a0\u00a0 and turn this off and go to bed so i'm gonna do\u00a0\nthat i'm gonna go to sleep and then i'll report\u00a0\u00a0 back to you guys tomorrow morning how i slept and\u00a0\nhow i feel until then good night good morning so\u00a0\u00a0 i slept great uh i went to bed around i think it\u00a0\nwas like 10 30 when i stopped talking to you guys\u00a0\u00a0 i was feeling sleepy at that point i wouldn't\u00a0\nsay i felt high or stoned or euphoric but i\u00a0\u00a0 definitely felt something and i've been trying to\u00a0\nthink of the word to use to explain it but like\u00a0\u00a0 nothing was spinning nothing was dizzy but i\u00a0\ncould feel a shift in my body but it wasn't like\u00a0\u00a0 a bad shift but i knew something was happening\u00a0\nbut it wasn't like concerning or anything but\u00a0\u00a0 i just want to let you guys know that so that\u00a0\nyou don't feel that i didn't tell you that if\u00a0\u00a0 you do start to feel that it was totally normal\u00a0\num fell into a really deep sleep like i could\u00a0\u00a0 tell i was in a deep sleep according to this my\u00a0\nscore was a 95 out of 100 which was great sleep\u00a0\u00a0 um i i did i did notice that i was in such a deep\u00a0\nsleep that i usually have to wake up in the middle\u00a0\u00a0 of the night to pee um for those of you under\u00a0\n30 and don't know what that feels like enjoy it\u00a0\u00a0 because the minute you turn 30 um like at least\u00a0\nfor me when i turn 30 and now i wake up to pee\u00a0\u00a0 in the middle of the night and i had i struggled\u00a0\na little bit trying to get up because i was in\u00a0\u00a0 such a deep sleep i couldn't wake myself up to\u00a0\ngo and do that like it was like it was a fight\u00a0\u00a0 you know what i mean like my bladder was like let\u00a0\nme out and my resume my body was like no we're\u00a0\u00a0 not going anywhere so there was that and then in\u00a0\nthe morning um even at 8 am i probably could have\u00a0\u00a0 slept more um that would have given me nine hours\u00a0\nof sleep and i could have slept more but the other\u00a0\u00a0 good thing about this is like when i woke up and i\u00a0\ngot myself to wake up because of my alarm clock i\u00a0\u00a0 didn't feel groggy so like i used to take advil pm\u00a0\nand if i woke up before it was time to wake up i\u00a0\u00a0 would feel groggy i just shook this off like so i\u00a0\nam uh excited about these i think these are great\u00a0\u00a0 i'm gonna definitely use them on the weekends um\u00a0\ndefinitely do not use these before you're driving\u00a0\u00a0 a vehicle or if you have to wake up early like say\u00a0\nyou only get five six seven hours of sleep stay\u00a0\u00a0 away from these but these are like my new favorite\u00a0\nthing i cannot wait for the weekend to try one\u00a0\u00a0 of these i will be back with a daytime video on\u00a0\nthe orange crush since it's a sativa it's really\u00a0\u00a0 good for the daytime so i will be back with this\u00a0\nreview but for then i will talk to you guys later", "MxPBmxnLivM": "[Music] two wheats the marijuana animal review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and today we are talking about krispity krunch II no I'm just joshing with you we're not talking about Peter Barnes but I'm on camera one because they're good too because they're high in fat and three because we're actually reviewing a hundred million gummy bears what's correct we are reviewing the ED of your 100 milligram Getti gummy bears today looking at in another this is another in this series if that appeared that we're going to be reviewing smaller dose to the last time we took these if history is going to repeat them itself these will taste awful and won't get me that high I'm hoping against hope that both of those things aren't true but there are no guarantees so the peanut butter minims just that just bad to help me get some of this as the best part of this th e so that's why I'm eating news those are gonna taste so much better than these I have a feeling alright let's open it up here oh man I thought last time this packaging was easy to open but now it's not looking so good balls all right I'm gonna have to grow grab some scissors technical difficulties back that's a negative anytime you have to go for the scissors she'd never have to do that finally finally let's give it a sniff oh man Oh smells like gummy bears with weed here we go that is awful oh and it gets worse it's got that harsh aftertaste oh oh they're so bad oh why would you do this to yourself and get gummies guys why why candies and goes-- why I don't understand it I really don't but I'm willing to keep doing it for you guys just because you seem to like them I I I'm not sure I get it so the head of pure 100 milligram gummies guys I'm going to finish these bad boys off not looking forward to it and I will see you in two hours to let you know how they are feeling and let's hope against hope one last time that they are the exception to the rule and I am coming to you blazed in two hours but not too optimistic see you two hours peace it has been two hours since I had the head of your gummy bears 100 milligrams and nothing really I can't say nothing I little high it's sort of as equivalent if I had maybe smoked a small bowl recently so on about in line with what I thought not a good value proposition at ten dollars not at all they tasted awful tasted really really bad and I'm not very high there isn't really a lot to say about the etta pure gummy bears and then they taste terrible and they really don't get you that high I have a few more and appears to review and I hope things turn around for them and again I want to I do want to say that I think these are more potent than like the infused creations that I've had so take that as you will but you know just gummies and candies just don't do it for me they may do it for you edibles you know can everybody experiences them a little bit differently maybe they just don't seem to work but I'm willing to give ed up here a fair shake in the future reviews guys and I hope you will too should you stick around for future reviews and thank you so much for watching this episode we'll catch you on a future one peace hello and thank you so much for watching weeds

review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary uh and on today's review I've got the spatula the wheat sworn spatula and the trusty jar of Nutella that means that we are reviewing something that does not have fat in it because THC and fat go hand-in-hand so we're reviewing today we are taking our third look I've reviewed two of these this type excuse-me of edible and past Oh or I guess you would call it an ingestible cuz it's not necessarily edible per se so we are taking a look at th C capsules medicinal softgels today this is our look at the pro canna THC plus hundred milligrams 250 milligrams soft gels as i said i've reviewed two caps in the past both of those were 300 milligrams one was pretty good the the if it was delta-9 yes the delta nine capsules were good I enjoyed them they were a little expensive I believe they cost thirty bucks for the 300 milligrams and then there was also I think it was the gold caps which were also 300 milligrams which were 50 bucks I believe and they were completely terrible they didn't do anything at all to me so I've got a hundred milligrams this time so less than the others but this was a more affordable price I guess linearly it's the same price as the delta nine as it was ten bucks for the two of the hundred milligram pack so you know it's the technically the same price but certainly a lot better price wise than the gold caps pretty simple little packaging here just a cardboard box with some you know directions there on the back advising that we consult a doctor before taking pro kanna don't know why doctor is capitalized there let's go and open up see what these look like uh-oh they are weirdly shaped so here we go here is one of the capsules right here in this little package they're ugly little capsule first let's do a little bit of the good old and Nutella my favorite part of all fat-free reviews is getting a nice scoopful a Nutella yum yum yum yum yum yum who doesn't love Nutella heartless folks that's him okay so that should hopefully be enough back for now and let's go ahead and plunk this in forgot to bring my handy trusty Arnold Palmer tea with me so I'm just gonna have to dry chuckle I swallow that's the word for it so let's do it three two one down the hatch got one more here three two one down the hatch okay well so I've had both the pillows now that's 100 milligrams of THC or so they say now in my body with the requisite amount of fat to help activate it now all we're gonna do is our for me I'm gonna wait two hours for you guys through the magic of editing it'll be just a couple of seconds and I'll let you know how these pro can uh THC caps are hitting in just about two hours so thanks for watching guys and I'll see you in just a bit peace [Music] alright guys I am back it has been two hours for me since I had the pro canna THC soft gels and let's do a little ocular test Whitis [ __ ] snow I don't know I want to let me say this right off the bat I want to love THC capsules I love the idea of them I love something that's discreet easy to take doesn't have any calories with it way of ingesting THC but these suck these didn't do anything for me I I mean it's I don't feel high at all nothing so in terms of what I have tried these are down there with gold caps they're not as good as the delta-9 obviously those got me at least you know somewhat high this is just a real [ __ ] product I don't know if it's on me oh and this time I also try it with fats I had had people in the bat before asked me like well maybe you need to try it with fat which I should have done anyways tried it with fat and still no result um I feel like I could you know if I was if I was a gymnast I feel like I could perform gymnastics if I was a mathematician I feel like I could perform some differential equations but I'm just a stupid idiot and I still feel like I can function as a stupid idiot even after two hours on the THC plus from poke pro canna man again guys I cannot articulate enough I would love for these to be the magic bullet you know an easy discreet portable way of getting THC with into your body that isn't either smoking vaping or having to consume something with a lot of sugar and calories I keep hoping for it I I don't think I'll be going back to pro kanna next time I have to review but I think I'm gonna keep trying to find that magic capsule out there to see if any of them work I'll do a couple more maybe maybe they're just not for me maybe there's something about mean that they just I just doesn't work as an ingestion method I would love to hear from you guys if you know any good capsule brands or if they work well for you please let me know leave a comment below or send me an email at wheats at wheats reviews.com and let me know what you think about these capsules because I'm trying to find a great one I'm hoping to find something that you know I can take with me to the airport something I can you know take with me into a concert you know that's not going to draw any attention to itself but so far of the three I've taken this I don't know if it's necessary worse than gold caps but it's not definitely not any better so far if you definitely want capsules stick with the Delta nine they're still not great they're still not my favorite way to ingest THC but definitely skip out on the procane a total dud of a product look at the [ __ ] back there that is the category that it's in and I am now just rambling so with that guys I am going to sign off from this review and that is going to do it for pro canna here on wheats thank you so much for watching guys and we will see you on our next review peace", "F7pphiwz_LE": "[Music] hi there buds let's talk about my outfit really fast i bought this cardigan when i was like incredibly stoned asos was having like a semi-annual type sale and a lot of [ __ ] was parents and i saw this and there was like a video of a model wearing it was a nice tall guy and he kept swaying his arms and it looked so neat and i was like oh that's fashion like i need that and then i bought it and it came in and i was like what the hell was i thinking like how much did i smoke before i decided this was something that i needed in my [ __ ] life because now i'm highly embarrassed i've had this sitting in my closet for at least a year it's even got fringe like all the way around i've had this just like sitting there and i'm like what the hell like when am i ever gonna wear this and so i was like you know what i'm just gonna have to i'm just gonna have to make myself wear it so today i was like oh i want something new to wear something spicy so this is what came out you guys i'm not gonna lie though as ugly as it is i do have an amazing time waving my arms around in it and watching all the things just move like it has such great movement like this would be something great to go dancing or something i don't know i kind of i kind of enjoy it but anyways i hope you guys are all having a great day today i have something new that i've never tried before i saw this at the dispensary it's weed bubble gum i'm like you guys know i'm a sucker for anything new at the dispensary that's an edible i'm like i've never tried weed gum before and that sounds amazing this is bubble gum flavored by a company called joy gum it has 10 milligrams of thc per serving and there's 10 pieces so 100 milligrams of thc and i thought we would try it out i mean hopefully it tastes good hopefully the effects are really long-lasting i love the idea of using a gum as an edible because you can just sit there and chew on it like all day long maybe have like a gradual release of thc all day that's what i'm hoping for i've not smoked today so i can get a full feel of how this gum is going to affect me so i'm ready to dive in let's get into this [Music] open it up pretty easy just to peel off packaging [Music] it smells like straight up bubbles like [Music] there's no other wheaties at all you cannot tell that this is infused at all it just smells like bubbles it actually smells like really good bubble gum like almost like um i'm trying to think of the name of it the one that comes in the tape fruit by the foot oh it was at this moment that he knew he [ __ ] up oh my god my grandpa used to buy this for me when i was little and i used to just have pockets full of candy and the bubble tape bubba take i don't remember what it was called the tape like gum somebody out there knows exactly what the [ __ ] i'm talking about and i probably will be able to just google a picture and put it right here what i'm talking about but that's what this smells like anyways [Music] oh my god it has their logo on the go hope that focuses it says joy gum right there that's cute and on the back of that it has a little thc emblem just to show you that it's weedy all right i'm excited about this like they're super cute they smell good so we'll see we're gonna just do one first just for a little taste test and then i'm gonna chew this entire package all in one sitting because you guys know i like to i like to go boss to the walls cheers oh my god [Music] the taste is so familiar it reminds me of chicklets that gum in the 90s that was like it came in the yellow package and they were super duper tiny that's what this tastes like if i try really really really hard i can kind of take some weaniness but like you really have to focus on it overall first impressions the gum tastes incredibly good i'm gonna go ahead and put another piece in and another pretty soon if this is actually effective this will be a really cool way of getting some and with it being 10 milligrams it's like not too much for each piece you could easily just have like a piece of gum before you go to work and then be in like a little bit of a better mood than you normally would be without being like super stoned or repaired i like that but i like that they give you 10 pieces in a pack so that if you are like me and you want to chew like 100 milligrams of thc you can i wonder if it'll blow bubbles like i wonder if it's like a bubble gum let's see i don't ever think this is bubblegum but i'm gonna try again [Music] the texture of this gum is like one of those gums that kind of melts in your mouth it becomes really really really soft because all gums get soft obviously but you know how some gums are like they damn near feel like they're gonna disappear in your mouth that's how this one feels it's very very thin i don't mind that at all all right i mean i'm at 30 milligrams i mean it's only been like what like i've probably been recording like five minutes but i'm not afraid of 100 milligrams at all like i feel like that's not going to be bad for me so [Music] that's the rest of the gum [Music] i'm so sorry if this smacking loses about my god i feel like i'm spitting i'm really surprised about extreme this much come because it's like a lot i'm not gonna lie though it's pleasure like it tastes so [ __ ] good i'll be honest with you guys i don't feel anything yet like nothing yet nothing oh my god i'm gonna knock that over don't feel nothing yet but normally it takes edibles about 20 minutes for me to really build something oh my god like talking with those i'm going to do my heart maybe i fit in my cheek while i talk normally it takes about 20 minutes for like an edible to affect me so i guess i'm gonna sit here and shoot my gum circle the web a little bit probably get on my phone and um i'll give you guys a status update on how i feel after chewing 100 milligrams of thc [Music] [Music] all right it's been about 10 minutes and i already feel it like i definitely feel a little something my body feels relaxed i'm starting to feel relaxed like my mood is starting to feel relaxed i feel like this is gonna be a good one you guys like i'm really excited because i i don't feel like i normally feel effects like this quickly or this strongly i would say that i feel the same level as i did after drinking that whole 10 milligram soda already right now so [Music] i'll be back in like another probably 20 minutes 30 minutes and we'll see how it is [Music] i also noticed on the package that's zero calories so there's that and it's made in aurora colorado so it's like a locally made thing which is me [Music] edibles i feel like sometimes make me out of breath or maybe it's just all this to me regardless i'm out of breath then i'll be back [Music] i'm gonna be honest you guys i feel sick like i feel queasy i feel dizzy this isn't good like it doesn't feel good like i feel dizzy like i don't feel good at all and i feel like i'm sweating a little bit but i don't want to take off my cute little tassels because these are so much fun but like i don't i don't know i i don't know i don't know [Music] i don't know i don't like it like it's just like i don't know like i seriously feel like the room is spinning and i don't like that and i feel hot like i almost feel like i'm gonna get sick like i'm gonna get like like i'm gonna throw up or something but i know i'm not going to throw up like i didn't eat anything and like i'm in my mouth like i'm not gonna throw up i'm not gonna lie [Music] i'm just gonna tell myself this too shall pass and do few breathing exercises [Music] we're just going to power through this and see how it is in another 20 minutes or so [Music] also you guys i'm feeling a lot better like 100 better i don't feel dizzy at all i will say i do kind of feel like i don't know it's not shortness of breath it's almost like do you guys know when you get super stoned and you feel like something's almost sitting on your chest that's how i feel right [Music] now [Music] so it's like it's not like the best feeling in the world but like overall i'm gonna say like it's not bad so far like not horrible we had a little moment we breathed through that now we're in the little chest weirdness feeling but i'm starting to feel the like mental effects like i'm starting to feel strong a little bit which is kind of nice because i feel like edibles like they kind of go weird for me like some of them will affect me and only my body like i'll feel tingly all over like whatever and then some will affect me mentally and when they affect me mentally they affect me mentally like like really slowly so i'm starting to feel those effects a little bit like i feel a little spacey very relaxed still don't focus on my breathing just because it's so weird how when you get stoned you really focus on your breathing and then you're like i don't know particularly when you get that feeling and i know other stoners out there comment below if you've ever had that feeling because i know i know other people and i have it now i do feel tingly in my arms too my arms feel really deeply all right i'll be back probably in another 20 minutes or so again for another update i don't even know how long i'm going to update this because i think i'm going to shoot this stuff all [ __ ] day long because i want to say it was 15 there's no price on here but i thought i think it was fifteen dollars and if that's okay fifteen dollars for a full day all day so i hope that it lasts the full day and i'll see you guys around for whenever the next update is i'll be sure to let you guys know how long it's been i thought right now i would say probably i'll be back in another like 40 minutes or so but i don't know once you start to get to this level of your stone that's not the word that i was trying to go for once you get to this level of your high i feel like things get unpredictable like you tend to do things and you sometimes don't and it's just you know what i mean so i'll be back when i'm back and i'll let you know how long it's been [Music] it looks so much further down [Music] i work so much better as bubble gum after you really chew it for like a good hour or so because then it gets even softer and it works so much better bubbles anyways now we'll be back in like 20 minutes [Music] i feel like i should just fly off with these i'm like i looked at the mess i was like getting off here and i was like i want my transition would just be like and then when i come back i can just fly [Music] back what would you call this look you guys like what the hell would you call this for some reason it gives me like very mariachi vibes but it's like i don't know why i think it's because it kind of reminds me of a pinata i feel like i look like a pinata like i seriously feel like i could be on dancing with the stars with this outfit like what was i thinking i'm back it is now about 4 p.m i've been chewing on this gum all day long i haven't even taken it out for a break like i've some water with it but that's about it i will say the flavor of the gum it's like the flavor of a gum that's lost its flavor if that makes sense like it has that like mmm there used to be flavor here but there's not anymore and it tastes kind of like blend that's how it tastes right now the gum definitely shrinks over time i don't know if i'm just like accidentally swallowing it or something but like it definitely felt like a huge wada gum in my mouth before now feels like just like a slightly oversized piece of gum [Music] it does blow bubbles better now now to the effects i will say that i think that it's still effective like i still feel slightly stoned right now [Music] i don't feel like this was a frame frame i do feel like it was at first like within the first like hour it was really really really strong after like the first hour and a half like two hours kind of like a little bit so like i still feel like if i like chew on it a lot and actually like focus on chewing it i do feel like a little bit like i do get a little bit of like a revamp of the high like i do think that this is to in order to get the effects you do have to like sit there and chew and chew and chew and chew and chew because if you just let sit in your mouth i don't feel like it does as much for some reason would i buy this again yes would i use it all in one setting no because i felt like that wasn't necessary i feel like i probably would have gotten a lot better of an experience off of this with using half of it and i probably would have felt probably the same i would i mean like that's just my guess i feel like this was a little overkill for what it is particularly because like the effects don't last long like or like longer i mean they do a little bit because it's a gum and you have to chew it to get the thc to come out it is like an extended release in that aspect but that thc actually goes pretty fast i feel like like i feel like you get 70 of the effects of it probably within the first two hours and then after that you're just getting like a little twin to look the last thirty percent i'm definitely gonna chew it through bedtime but i don't expect any different results if i do have any different results i'll definitely check in and let you guys know but overall i would say i recommend it um for 15 you can split this up in probably like three or four different um sessions and that would make it like a little bit more affordable and not so expensive because for a one-time treat 15 is a lot but i'll definitely try this again i wonder if they have different flavors i would be interested in a mint um the bubble gum like it just loses its flavor and then it just kind of is like and i feel like with minty gums when they lose their flavor it's not as bad if you know what i mean um anyways thank you guys so much for watching this video if you like it give it a thumbs up leave a comment down below let me know if you've ever tried joy gum if you've seen this in your dispensary if you're gonna try it now let me know because am i the only person who just gets enticed by all the little things in the dispensary i literally feel like a kid in a cannabis candy store every time i go in there and there's like something new and i'm like anyways thank you guys so much for watching and i'll see you guys around for whatever shiny activity or video i come up with for next time and hopefully i'll be in a better outfit than this or if this is your definition of good then hopefully i keep this bar hi thank you so much for watching bye guys", "JqhDejT6d5M": "I'm not really an edible person but I have to tell you whatever they put in this thing they've done a good job I [Music] bought a couple of quarters at a dispensary the other day and they offered you know a freebie and so I decided to go with the edible that they were offering and it happened to be a kirova Saturday morning cookie sample and took it home tried it out and I got to tell you I really really like this brand I really like this I mean I'm not familiar with edibles you might have a particular brand you like I came across these and whatever they're putting inside this thing I got to tell you it works really well for me I think these things are awesome you might have other brands that you particularly care for but I highly highly recommend you try the kirova I am not affiliated with them in any ways and just you know came across them at random and I really really like this cookie plus it's only 150 milligrams so I would maybe recommend to kind of start with these if you're just getting into edibles as far as dosing goes it's a good idea to start small now like I said this is 150 milligrams and you know other cookies and other things in other bars and other products they have you know 250 500 I've seen it even a thousand milligrams which is for me is it's too much you know I can't quite do that type of a thing but this packaging here says that it's got 15 servings per package so if you do the math it's like 10 milligrams per serving so if you're able to divide the cookie up as evenly as possible you can kind of figure out your dosage from there and I would probably you know I would say start with 20 milligrams these things can you know come across you anywhere from 10 minutes to you know 45 minutes to an hour depending on your metabolism and kind of like what's going on with your body and stuff like that so I always like to pass along the information which is kind of the thing with edibles because you know dosing is such a it's such a gray area definitely be careful with this don't eat a whole one for the first time if you're just starting out because you probably would have not such a great experience and you might not you know you might not come back to pick up some more this is about the size of a dose that I would do probably if you're just starting out I might do something around that size but since I've tried this a few times I'm adding this much more but I would try about that much in size even if you're a beginner start with twenty milligrams you know and see see where you go give yourself a little bit of time wait for about half an hour or so and see how you're feeling you know if you go on to maybe an hour hour and a half and you're still you know you're feeling good but maybe you want to feel a little bit better maybe try another ten twenty milligrams and then just call it good and see where you end up there some people will just you know eat something go I don't feel anything and eat some more I don't feel anything and all of a sudden they're just they're just blitzed it's the first time for them that would be that would be a shame because they wouldn't receive the benefits of the Saturday morning cookie so you know if you're just starting out that's what I would recommend for you to do dosing wise hopefully you found the information in this video useful if you did please comment like and subscribe I'm Enzo truffle with bud symbol calm and

cheer hey guys guys like this see you guys next time", "gbRXOTVk2Gc": "hey guys i want to introduce you guys to our uh brand new product which are delta eight um 50 milligrams per gummy uh edibles these are some delta eight gummies that we just brought out um they're assorted fruit flavors right now you can get a in a thousand milligrams so 20 in a pack or if you've never tried um delta 8 and you want to try it but you don't want to buy a whole bunch this is a nice little 250 milligram sample pack you get five gummies in there um so far all of our feedback on the gummies has been pretty positive uh flavor-wise they taste almost like candy um and just to give you an idea i went here into our little company stash so you can kind of see the size of them and they're uh definitely got some sugar on them and uh they're they're really fairly tasty for a delta eight gummy you'll find a lot of them are a little bit bitter um these don't tend to be they're made from a really high grade delta 8 distillate that's infused into them if you're new to gummies be careful because edibles tend to be a little bit uh different than smoking so if you take a gummy it can take a good 30 minutes on the low side to 90 minutes on the high side until you get the full effects uh just so be aware of that so you don't overload and take too much so and the other thing with your uh delta eight products is if you're experienced with edibles from a marijuana perspective basically uh the the delta eight is like half the potency so you know if you're used to taking a 10 milligram uh thc9 gummy then you need a 20 of these and so on so you know you're used to taking 20 milligrams and you need 40 milligrams so we came up with these 50s they're they're potent they're they're strong um but you can easily just cut one in half and uh and get half the dosage all right if you have any questions um any comments um we're always here to help as well as listen to your feedback uh get in touch with us at the website and we'll talk to you soon you", "gCMn2ECpP_4": "back my god I am now gonna be mad at me yeah I'm already high I be edible like I bought a root a whole day from me and I'm gonna have

"[Music] hello everyone and welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's episode we are not going to be reviewing a product instead we're going to be talking about news news and very sad news at that and that is that the edible Bonanza the edible crazy wonderful Wild West market in California is coming to an end as we know it January 1st I believe of 2018 the new regulations go into effect for both medicinal and recreational weed in the state of California and one of those major major changes coming to to the marijuana industry at large is headed headed straight for the edible industry in a really really really devastating way so what is changing one one thing makes sense and that's no more edibles that are shaped like kids candy that makes sense to me nothing you know no gummy shaped things no cartoon shaped things nothing with a cartoon mascot that'll make sense that all that all makes perfect sense to me and I'm totally ok with that but the far more devastating in the far more far-reaching consequences are gonna come in from the limits of THC henceforth each package each product can only be a hundred milligrams in total and can only have 10 milligrams of THC per serving so let me let's let's let's put that in perspective that means that you could only have a brownie can't even be a hundred milligrams it has to be cut up into ten squares of ten milligrams each and the whole thing can only be a hundred milligrams how they're gonna price these things I have no idea if they're going to be commensurate with the prices we see for 100 milligram edibles now or if they're just going to be more expensive what this does to the folks who really need those high you know folks with high high tolerances you know focuses with cancer diabetes terminal illnesses that rely on these high potency edibles for their pain and killing needs I don't know what they're gonna do it's again it's a it's a crippling blow to patients and it's equipping Bluett I assume to the industry they're gonna have to completely change the way that they operate here in California no company that I know of operates in that mode right now everybody has much more higher potency edibles and they're not divided into ten milligram parts in any way shape or form I'm just trying to think of the production and logistics work that's gonna have to go into these companies to change up their products and their formulas something like a kiva like how are they gonna break down their 180 milligrams chocalate bar and I take it back I have seen one company that's already seems to be on their way to figuring that out and that is kirova if you go to their website you can see where they now have many cookies and 100 milligram packages I assume they are coming out with this products just in preparation for the regulations but what everybody else is going to do that don't have the resources of say a you know a Korova to to shift like that to to completely change their production line the way they do everything III got to assume that's going to put them in a you know in dire financial straits so it's gonna be a big big change come January 1st and I still actually have lots and lots of questions about this so I don't know if first off everything I've read and I will provide links below I'll provide links in the description to everything I've read including the actual if I can find it the actual statute itself but right now I've seen on High Times and on Leafly and a couple other places summaries of the new regulations that are going to affect and these are definitely happening but I cannot find clear evidence on whether or not this is also going to affect medical market whether or not this is only going to affect for the recreational market or whether this is pan market and it's going to both recreational and and medicinal so I don't know I don't know if it takes what happens to all the old stock come January first if everything has to be tossed out or if there's a grace period i I have I have tons of questions left and if you are say a dispensary owner who is in the know if you're somebody who has any kind of knowledge of the cannabis law in California please hit me up I would love to talk to you on the show so we can clarify some of these laws you can email me at you can it mean weeks a tweets reviews.com or weeks reviews at gmail.com you can hit me up on twitter or facebook please get in touch with me again if you have any additional knowledge on this I would love to get in contact with you I feel terribly terribly for all of the patients that are gonna have to completely change their sort of regimen for for edibles I know a lot of patients already have their favorite edible that they you know dose themselves have everything perfectly set up to help them get you know escape their pain huh I'm I'm I'm bummed out myself um I'm not sure what what we're gonna do here a tweets we'll figure it out we'll still be reviewing edibles for sure and I'm sorry I've been away a lot recently been very busy but rest assured new reviews will be coming but as to what we're going to do January 1st we'll continue to review edibles but it's gonna have to be a change for us as well here at wheats so again guys just to reiterate come the beginning of the year the edible market that we know and love in California is going to a revocable II and in my opinion a revocable change for the worse come January 1st it's it's it's it's not going to be the this sort of great place that it was before I mean I of course it had problems the edible market like all markets had problems but I think these these new regulations are are an atrocity frankly and I hope I hope this state will we'll see the error of their ways rather quickly and and things can get back to normal but just wanted to give you guys a heads up and again if you know anybody or if you yourself know any of these laws anymore please hit me up I would love to talk to you and we can get this further clarified so guys that's going to do it for this episode here on wheats sorry for the bummer of the

I've reviewed from them 100 250 and 500 although the 500s are definitely too strong for me to do in one go but I've done it before watch the video yeah so I'm super excited about this as I said I love love lemon bars too so I'm really looking forward to this one let's a look at the back of the box here I've already opened it up just a little bit to make this a little bit easier on me as we've got our back of the package here 440 calories for the whole thing the pure experience and lemon bar says on the front here delicious sugar cookie crust layered with lemon filling topped with vanilla icing and finished with refreshing lemon zest sounds awesome let's go ahead and get right into it here just a second and here we go here is the lemon bar a handsome product if I've ever seen one there's the sugar cookie crust the lemon filling and that baller-ass looking vanilla icing it's big it's very big much bigger than I thought it was going to be it weighs quite a bit it feels quite heavy let's go ahead and give it a bite there's a quality lemon bar mmm good crust get billing good icing no real cannabis taste what to me to speak up at all almost completely devoid of cannabis taste just a good lemon bar um all right guys well I'm gonna enjoy polishing this off and I will see you in two hours or actually I'll see you guys in just a couple of seconds but I'll be back in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling thanks for watching Wheaton I'll see you in just a bit peace hi guys it's been Oh actually a little bit longer than two hours I must confess I accidentally took a nap in between this review which might have tested the power of the product of the Kanak Oh a lemon bar 100 milligram that I felt it necessary to take a nap in between the the review there I enjoyed the product quite a bit I loved how it tasted absolutely left how it tasted and it got me up to like a solid six half maybe from a hundred milligram at a bull which is just I mean it's just ridiculous it's incredible as all kind of coat products seem to be I love them all this is definitely no exception for me I love love love the lemon bar 100 milligrams even at 100 milligrams it got me really really high so I'm completely pleased with it oh I believe it cost me ten bucks at my dispensary so an utterly affordable edible as well if you see one at a dispensary and you like the lemon bars do not hesitate to grab one you will certainly be happy you did that is again the Kanak Oh lemon bar 100 milligrams thank you so much for watching wheats guys and we will check you out on the next review

big fan of weed I never been like I don't support it but I'm not if my friends do I'm not gonna be like hey go back up no if you smoke weed in the you smoke weed that's on you boo you know what you want it's a free country not really free because we got rules so it's not a free country you know what I'm saying anyway the point is you guys I went to San Francisco a week a week or two ago and you know what I didn't eat all day the whole day cuz I was like you know what as soon as I get that I'm gonna get some Cali foods in San Francisco food because the food over there is a lot better than over here in Arizona and you know I made a mistake I ate a chocolate I thought it was regularly dagesh megator chocolate and I ate it and I was like yo this [ __ ] disgusting I kept chewing it and I'm just thinking about this is a nasty chocolate for my life you know what before I eat that chocolate I should have read what it was what brand it was or anything but you know how you sit down you eat something you read the wrapper you read the ingredients you read small print so I sat down finish that chocolate top the chocolate more than half of the chocolate and then I read at the top small print 100 milligrams of cannabis and I said oh sure like I didn't think it would affect me because I didn't think anything of it like literally I forgot even took it and whatever I continued the rest of my night yeah anyways so it literally took an hour and a half for it to hit me I was we went to in and out I remember my friend was talking to me and we just ordered so my friend was telling me something and literally I was just staring and I literally forgot whatever they said and I was like wait what and they told me again and I felt like I was like staring like I was staring but I wasn't like I couldn't listen I couldn't focus and I was like oh shoot and literally dazed off I looked out into the sheet and I saw the cars like moving so slowly everything felt so slow and like I felt like it was just spinning I turned around off oh my gosh I started freaking it was like the most trapeze feeling in the world I was panicking I was like oh my god I don't know I couldn't control what I was doing I have anxiety I have panic attacks I can't panic attacks a lot so imagine being panic attack Plus on a panic having an attack from what I ate so I think we pulled up and I was like yo I need to throw up I remember running to the bathroom trying to make myself throw up I don't like this feeling I was just throwing up and throwing up and I didn't have anything in my system the high ghoul you need to eat and I was like I could I couldn't eat like everything to me tasted so disgusting and I just remember we ended up back at the hotel and my friend she kept saying yo like here takes take some of the shake take take a bite and I could in like it just disgusted me I just kept pacing back and forth back and forth I canna do I want to go home take me to the hospital I was tripping I was tripping bad when I'm telling you I was tripping bad nobody could calm me down I was just walking up scared oh my gosh I felt probably I was probably being annoying on this leave but I I just I didn't know what to do I do I'm not used to weed edibles and I heard edibles mess you up more so my friends like what do you want like come come sit on the couch watch movie so she put on a movie and I just kept getting how they do it I can't be sitting on one spot like I just kept thinking so much stuff say all right go for a walk I went for a walk I felt like I went for like the longest well I felt like I was walking for two hours I remember coming back to the hotel and it was only 13 15 minutes I was sweating from the walk that I thought I took four hours and then she's I do just lay down just calm down and I said all right so I would lay down to the lights off but I just kept hearing noise and if I heard a noise I would just focus on that one noise and then imma go you know what I can't see if I can't sleep I kept throwing up should I do it eat eat eat and I couldn't and they just suck my Chi I couldn't I don't know I don't know how to explain the feeling like everything was going so slow I felt like my mouth was like I couldn't feel like maybe I was like slapping myself and I couldn't feel the slap I pinched myself I can't feel anything and it made me so depressed like I seriously started crying as I remember crying and then literally it was just a routine lay down get up go I would go out of the room come back in the room throw up and then I'll say whatever I just started drinking a lot a lot of water cuz I think I'll just flush it out of my system nothing nothing and it was already like two three hours later and I dude it's not going away I want to go home she's like dude we can't waste our Cisco and I was hitting up my cut like I was like I wanna stand in my cousin's house I was just scared I didn't hear anybody up the whole night and I remember sending my location to every person I knew cuz you're gonna go out of state make sure you let everybody know where you have this in case you never know you never know and then finally I think I'm gonna insert you know here's an insert clip you can't really hear cause she had music but [Music] I know I look lost lost and scared but I finally fell asleep I remember I laid down I put Christian music on I fell a little piece I ate this edible at 12 or 11:30 and I didn't sleep until 5:00 5:30 in the morning I woke up two hours later we went out to the store and I was like you know what I feel better we went out to the store and thirty minutes into walking around I felt dizzy again and I was like bro like I feel I felt like I did yesterday she's like no you're just overthinking it and I was again she's probably right nope I don't remember coming back to the hotel I remember getting it at the hotel I don't remember how I got to the hotel but we got to the hotel we made breakfast and then I felt good again and then we made Charlie cook home well we made pancakes I forgot what else with me and I only took two bites of the egg and I think I had some strawberries but I just I didn't have an appetite I remember dazing off and then I went to go lay down cuz I was like maybe I just need to sleep it off I still feel it but no one believed me I was like bro I feel like she's like knowledge just your head that's okay I remember I got ready I felt I think I fell asleep oh man I just remembered hopping on it uber and then we went to this one place it was like I think in San Jose I don't know it was called and we would not to eat and I was good like I'll say all right it's fresh air cuz it was really fresh at that time and we were eating and then I felt dizzy again she's like dude why you keep white why are you dazing off I don't know I was like I still I feel dizzy she's like dude just stop thinking about it how the [ __ ] this one was supposed to stop thinking about something when you feel something I know what I felt and I know what I was feeling I know nothing crazy I remember just everything going so slow like the food service is going slow the conversation I don't remember the conversations I had it was just like it was just a blur like I literally felt like I didn't even go to San Francisco I didn't even go out of state because I felt like everything to me was a blur it still is a blur I don't know I've never been blacked out drunk but I literally felt like if I would have got really drunk passed out and be like hey what happened and then I and I had mood swings like I kept getting mad I kept getting sad I kept getting happy and then we got back to the hotel an hour later and then I tried sleeping it off the next morning I felt okay I felt good we went to the we went out to eat again and as soon as the food arrives ice tastes off again and I was like I didn't even I didn't even tell my friend anything at this point because then she was gonna be like it's just your imagination and then I remember getting to the airport and she was looking for a book and I just started feeling dizzy again I was like I'm either really tired or it's still in my system and I don't know what the heck is going on with me fell asleep waiting for the airplane on answer exactly right now and then we got on the airplane and I fell asleep because you know what I just want to sleep it off I don't even want to feel this no more I was like by the time I get back home in Phoenix it's gonna be good I got off felt good for like two hours I just started flipping out I loved it was because of the airplane the way it went up down I don't know I was just tripping out like you know what I'm gonna go for a run ayran I ran well in my imagination I don't even know cuz what around the park I ran all the way to the next street I ran back and then I was like oh good now for like five minutes and I was like like I still felt so panicked and I didn't want to say anything I don't want to tell my mom cuz I was like she probably thought I took this on perfect I did not take this on purpose you guys and finally I was like the next day I was like alright I'm sleeping up I couldn't even sleep that night I woke up and now whole day I felt dizzy and I remember just being like I take me to the hospital like I can't eat I can't drink everything I eat I throw up and then we went to the hospital I told the lady what happened I I told my mom what happened I thought my mom was gonna be mad I was like why I want you to think this with me and the lady told me you know what you didn't eat the whole day your body's not used to it and your system everybody system is different so they literally had to put an IV in me I think that was ID I don't know she said she was hydrating me because of everything that I was throwing up that couldn't eat I couldn't drink and I was in the hospital for like a good minute and then the whole week like it was the worst week of my life I am NOT a weak [ __ ] but then it takes a lot for me to go to the hospital because you know I passed out and I was like that's the only reason was because I've never passed out in my life and I did and I was like something's wrong with my body that's why I went in there and the whole week all I could drink with liquids I drink it was sweat Oh everyone it's called in English I drink water my mom kept making food but I couldn't eat it because I have an appetite I was sleeping for hours I didn't want to stand up because I felt like I'd fall back down I didn't talk to anybody I didn't reply to anybody I didn't want to deal with anybody I felt like it did put me in a depression because I've never felt like that and I just be crying crying looks like I'm gonna stay like this all my life and I just I'm gonna over think of you guys so it was up until Friday where my mom said you know what you need to go outside you need to go walk you need to eat something because it's not gonna go away if you don't eat okay when walked around Walmart I felt dizzy I need to go back in the car not didn't come back out after that the next day like it was going away I had to be wearing my glasses because I felt like that's all he's gonna help me focus I didn't want to wear them too much because I don't want my eyes to adjust wearing them all day and I only wear them for like reading or driving and then finally it was until Sunday were actually like I felt good I went out to eat I ate the first meal I had in the whole week and I love food so that week I dropped I literally dropped 10 pounds a whole week because it was just like nothing but butt naked juices and water oh and a medicine sweat oh and then like ashes [ __ ] you guys I I guess everybody has a story of like when it's the first time it's a trip but the fact that I tripped out for a whole week and weekend like that tripped me out and even the doctor was like you know it's still in your system Erik I'm saying though it's not your system it was still in my system like it was still processing it the fact that I didn't eat the whole night the day I took it was the fact why it lasted so long and I just don't want like I Drive in sometimes you know when you're driving the strong smell of weed hits you I literally like how like I don't want it's no [ __ ] just like when you get drunk and then the liquor that next day that same liquor you like I don't want to smell it honestly a weed isn't for me edibles isn't for me it's not for mice if you do it and prepare to be tripped up everybody everybody's bodies different mine just happened to not process the whole thing in a whole week billing high for a whole week and dizzy and traumatize is not a good feeling so I was gone for that's not a record last week but you guys you know I'm not making it up either I'll post all the pic like that I posted I pictures everything receipts just just don't do drugs Oh", "aSO-ZBoJ0DQ": "I am gonna be eating one of these very excited these are like hair on that there's these are CBD gummies and I already opened it says here it's a full spectrum organic cannabidiol l-theanine Piper myth this something or others some other thing that I can't pronounce and some other thing that I can't pronounce no THC and no marijuana but my body hurts I don't want to get high so let's try this what's in here oranges in a red so this orange one also tiny look at it can you see it mmm Harel serving size one gummy ten milligrams per gummy let's see how I feel later hello everyone so it's been a little while since I took the gummy and maybe I would say like 20 or 30 minutes but I am like super tired right now and I think it's only 8 10 p.m. and it's too early to go asleep but I think that I'm gonna brush my teeth anyway because just in case I fall asleep I don't wanna like fall asleep without brushing my teeth because that's just weird and gross but I'm gonna try to stay awake for a little bit longer but I don't think that I will be and I will be super upset if like I go to bed soon and then wake up at like 4:00 in the morning or something but tired alright so that was pretty much it for this video thank you for watching and I will see you guys later", "agLIlV_RBrU": "hey there so i wanted to do another video again i got so many messages from people interested in these cannabis drinks like i knew that that was a market i knew people are interested in that but a lot of people messaged me so i just wanted to do some more videos and content on that and last night actually i was messaging these folks that work at tonic i was just messaging them through instagram they were so nice and one of them was telling me like that they have different ratios of thc and cbd so if i wanted a more cbd focused one to be like for the daytime they have that you know all kinds of stuff different flavors so along that i wanted to post another drink from them um this one is much much stronger so this is the tonic beverage that i got at the dispensary and this one's a hundred milligrams whereas the one i had yesterday was 25 milligrams cbd 25 milligrams thc so literally five times stronger so for me like knowing this information knowing that this is a hundred milligrams i just know right off the bat that i can't drink this whole thing in one sitting or one day to be honest um so what i've got here is it's really nice that if you can see there's like little demarcations to tell you okay if you want just a little bit this is how much you should take and it's like got lines to mark it and a little see-through strip so you can see you know where you're at so that was incredibly smart because i was like all right well i can just measure out how much i do want you know so i had 25 milligrams right here and i just poured that into a cup and really really like this so this one is a mango pineapple flavor there's no cbd in it so it's a little more psychoactive and personally like i like the more light milligrams of of thc because yesterday was a really nice experience for me i had that one tonic seltzer and then the rest of the night i drank regular sparkling water like perrier bubbly you know other things so that was like my night but if i had this i would want to make sure that i hydrated a lot lot more because it's like pretty concentrated you know like like you need some water to get that feeling good one thing that can happen with cannabis beverages and i've seen this happen is people will drink only this right they think it's an actual beverage like i'll just drink this this is almost like medicine you know it's like a flavorful nice way to drink it but you need like an actual drink an actual beverage so consider that and i tell people that with gummies too like yeah it's great to have gummies but buy yourself some just regular gummies and eat those too like don't eat gummies that are infused with cannabis is like a main snack like that's not their point but that's just my opinion so again if you buy this super super good but hydrate yourself um this i believe was 25 milligrams or i'm sorry 25 at the dispensary so 100 milligrams for 25 bucks so i would definitely buy this there's no taste of cannabis it tasted like uh like mango popsicle juice if that's a good description um so i was really surprised by that like whoever makes this and formulates this it has come a long way since the ones that i had like many years ago like on our honeymoon my husband and i went to colorado and had different you know drinks there and things like that and they did taste a little cannabis but this was also back in 2017 so things have really come a long way since then but yeah if you're interested check this place out it's tonic they're made by a company pts progressive treatment solutions and this one right here is called their pure thc infused beverage all right hope you have a good day bye my youtube channel is sponsored by the wonderful

welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary today's review is a bit of a classic which means edibles and today we are taking a look at spacejam cannabis infused sour gummy space drops and their handmade vegan cannabis treats so the box here is about all the information you want to see on it we've got lab tested results right there made then batch number all that good stuff and at the front we've got our milligram each eight point seven to perserve per serving for eighty seven point seven two milligrams total it was advertised as a hundred milligram edible but it looks like it only has eighty seven point seven two milligrams of THC oh this is a gummy of some kind but I'm not really sure exactly what they are sour gummy space drops let's find out together guys elevate your being with Space Jam okay so here we go inmate oh [ __ ] [ __ ] there are little drops just in a thing that looks just like this some paper Hana in there there's not much to it there as you can see the drops are in there let's give them a taste it was a pretty sour definitely definitely some cannabis taste to it gummies usually do not too bad it's better factious sour flavor and this sort of sugary salary crystals you can see there do a very good job of masking this THC I like the flavors quite a bit um it's pretty good they're a little chewy a little sour but all things considered this is a pretty fine tasting little gummy edible maybe it's the fact that it's made with premium ice hash water hash whatever the hell that is so guys I'm about to go see a movie this new one with Melissa McCarthy that doesn't look like a Melissa McCarthy movie as soon as that movie's over with and don't worry guys with all our reviews I'm gonna finish all ten of these drops gonna go see this movie gonna come out about two hours or so let you know what I think of the movie and more importantly what I think of these space jims cannabis infused sour gummy space drops I think I got all those nouns and adjectives there alright guys I will see in about two hours thanks for watching weeks and I'll see you in just a bit [Music] [Applause] [Music] welcome back to weeds guys it has been two hours since I whoa no that's a lie it has been actually closer to four hours since I've had a space gem cannabis infused sour gummy space drops uh I finished up my movie and the title of that by the way was can you ever forgive me with Melissa McCarthy true story weird movie but what you're really here for space gems they're pretty good guys I actually really like the taste of them for gummies they tasted pretty good uh they have an excellent sour sort of snap that really matched the cannabis flavor and then most importantly they got me pretty high um this isn't the top tier gummy brand out there right now this isn't like Plus which is truly amazing but this does proclaim to have a little bit less milligram \u00e4j-- however and I neglected to mention in the first half it is actually a little bit more expensive this time uh this one cost me 20 something dollars whereas the Plus usually run about 15 pre-tax so this was a little bit more expensive for a little bit less of a high and I actually really like the way the Plus tastes as well so my recommendation to you is if your dispensary has both plus gummies and space gem try with the bullet stick with the plus but if you're looking for something a little different and this is the only gummy they've got I'd still recommend space gems again it's got a great flavor not a lot to eat not so much of a fan of the packaging as they almost all spilled out on me but they are a little pricey and they're not gonna get you quite as high I don't think it's the plus but still pretty good so before I bounce with you guys today I actually want to share with you a little cherry on top a little something and not weed related that you can enjoy throughout your week and this week I actually want to share with you the camera I'm using I picked up a GoPro Hero 7 black I've been using it to shoots in these videos finally got a better microphone on it and I love it it's great it's actually worked really well just as a little point and shoot camera for me for shooting reats videos and it's the hyperlapse stuff there are the hyper smoothing whatever they call it has been fantastic I've loved shooting some montages with it really cool really like the GoPro Hero 7 black and very strangely I was as I was deciding to do this as an endorsement billboard right up there so you know maybe that's what they were asking me to do I don't know all right guys well that's gonna do it for this cherry on top that's the GoPro Hero 7 black and that's gonna do it for this review the space gem handmade vegan and cannabis treats thank you so much for watching guys and we will see you on the next review peace", "qqK060xvpIg": "[Music] hi there guys so good it's really good to see you welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary we help you make sense of all those millions of seeming products at your dispensary all those bags with all those candies and gummies and cookies and cakes and whatever and drinks how do you know which ones to spend your hard-earned money on which ones did you avoid that's what weeds is here for that's what we're here for and today we're gonna let you know if it appears 100 milligram Rocky Widow is worth your money I don't believe it's going to be this little guy cost me ten dollars for one hundred milligram edible and I think I'm going to wish I spent my money elsewhere the rocky rope again is 100 milligrams from a tap here I've reviewed several that appears before found them to be lacking too severely lacking so I hope this one is just simply lacking and up here I found it to be bad on the really bad to be on the taste dimension for most of their products they taste they have that really astringent app weed aftertaste that it's really bitter and acidic kind of taste so I hope this would taste better because it's basically just a nerds rope I think it looks like the Nerds should hopefully mask the flavor of the gummy on the inside also I don't know I guess the gummy is the only part where the THC actually is and the Nerds on the outside don't have any or doesn't contain THC so you can see it here at standard-issue nerds rope up should they call it the rocky road so I'm going to eat the whole thing in front of you guys here I'm gonna come back to you guys in two hours to let you know if this is actually worth your hard earned money um alright so without any further ado I'm gonna shut up stick this in my mouth hole here we go and there comes the weed taste and that comes stronger I was about to say oh it didn't taste so bad the Nerds are kind of like a cool cruel prank they mask the original flavor I go oh it's sweet and tasty and then you get into the jellied rope and then then comes that after flavor but it is not as bad as some of the other gummies that I've had like their standard gummy bears are way worse way worse tasting so this one for gummy is not bad I can totally get through this one all right you guys get the idea I think I lied when I said I was gonna eat the whole thing in front of you because it's gonna take longer I thought chewy but I won't finish it and I will come after you guys in two hours - what - no that this ed up your rocky rope and I'll finish this little nerves at the bottom - it's worth your money so thank you so much for watching weights guys we'll see you in two hours at pure I'm sorry just not what $10 I'm not high at all 100 milligrams of THC supposedly I have one more at appeared to review and I think that will be my last foray into and a pure in not there any worse than any other like your infused creations or voodoo sours I don't I don't think that they're necessarily and worse they might even be slightly better in terms of taste and consistency well I think voodoo tastes better but maybe in potency consistency in potency but who knows gummies just do not work for me why and and be though your mileage may vary you may gummies gummies may work for you animals manifest themselves weird ways and different people but they are not for me and I would not recommend them to anybody they don't taste good they don't get you high or they don't taste good to me they don't get me high and I just don't find anything pleasurable about them so I'll do my one last at a peer review that I've got and then I am going to say that we have reviewed enough and appear to know that ah that they are not for me and probably shouldn't be for you either okay guys that's gonna do it for this episode and this review here on wheats thank you so much for watching sorry to blast that appear so much here but again it's just done I can't help it it's you know if I'm not high I'm not high thank you so much for watching guys we'll check you

I went to the observatory in LA and I was up there for like 2 3 hours and they did not even kick in I had my moon rock art and I think after like 2 hours that I waited to see if they kicked in I just started hitting on the moon rock art and I got me it got me high as hell but these they didn't do anything for 15 bucks I bought these at a dispensary in Compton and yeah these are not worth it at all

show where we help you guys make sense of your dispensary and on today's episode we are taking a look at a brand new product from a brand new company when we've never looked at before that is premium Cali dreams candy company they're a hundred and twenty milligram THC medical cannabis lozenge although I don't think it's a lozenge at all I think it is a caramel apple pop with 120 milligrams of THC big fan of the caramel apple pops it's a weird combination but the apple flavored lollipop with caramel on the outside it's great never had one with Whedon before especially one without 120 milligrams I picked this up for I believe 13 bucks at my dispensary although it was on a going out of we're no longer selling these soon to be illegal edible special for 50% off so I got it pretty cheap I'm excited to try it I always like different kinds of edibles and a caramel apple blowing pop sounds pretty good so for 13 bucks 120 milligrams is pretty good for that price especially for something that's not just a brownie or cookies something a little different like a lollipop like the packaging from the outside pretty basic stuff but uh but nice enough as is let's go ahead and shut up now and open it up and see what this bad boy tastes like and if this is the first time you're tuning into wheats the way our reviews work is I'm gonna eat some number of this product well probably not gonna eat close to the whole thing because it's a big lollipop but I'm gonna eat some of it let you know do a taste test let you know how it tastes how it smells all that good stuff then I'll finish it off and for the most important part I'll come back in two hours to actually let you know how I am feeling guys because that is the most important part of the edible review how you feel not so much how it tastes alright so here is the pop here it's kind of smushed into this little container it's seems like it's gonna be hard to get out but let's give it a go okay came right out nothing to worry about so there it is there's the caramel apple what is this called again Cali dreams medical cannabis lozenge 120 milligrams handsome looking product give it a lick it's not bad no real cannabis taste can't detect any cannabis taste while just looking through it here I don't have the cojones to just bite straight into this but the taste at least so far pretty good if if it changes if there's something with a lollipop that's wrong or if the caramel eventually gets a weedy taste I'll be sure to let you know in the to our follow up but for now I quite like the taste of this one and like the funky style so guys I'm going to finish this off and then I will be back with you in two hours or for you just a couple of seconds to let you know how I'm feeling thanks for watching wheat see you soon [Music] welcome back guys it's been two hours here are the fruits of my labor the demolished remains of the Cali dreams 120 milligrams of THC caramel apple pop although that's what I'm calling it they call it a medical cannabis lozenge which it is not I liked it it's uh it's gotta be pretty high not not outrageously high not it's not super crazy effective it's not as good as a equivalently a good you know cookie or brownie it's not as good as like a hundred and fifty milligram Korova for example but I do like things that are a little bit different and I think this one's a little bit different it tasted good pretty much the whole way through the lollipop had a little bit of a Candace cannabis flavor but nothing too bad it was totally totally fine then at and you know was far from making me gag I said that's not the best descriptor but yeah it was pretty tasty the caramel was good I liked it it was a good way of getting THC and if you can find it 50% off like I did it's a hell of a deal at 13 bucks I still think it's not a bad price it is something that unlike a cookie or a brownie or rice krispies treat or whatever else you can't really split it being a lollipop so that might be you know something to strike against and you're gonna be taking this whole thing by yourself and you can't really save it for later either you can't really have half of it otherwise you just have a sticky mess so it's something you've got to commit to if that's you know what you're looking for for me it's a it's a middling endorsement for the Cali dreams hundred and twenty milligrams you see the dispensary near you and you're looking for something a little different a little outside the mold give it a try I think you'll be happy you did thanks so much for watching wheats guys that's going to do it for this review I appreciate you watching as always and we will see you on a later review peace", "1zZV8VnNShI": "okay fellow youtubers this is DM Blair wolf and today's video is gonna be on this tiny little green lollipop well I was at the Harrisburg East Mall yesterday and a friend of mine Ted owns the supplemental store east coast supplements in there and he got these they're called chronic Tandy what it is is it's got ten milligrams of CBD and it has o G cush terpenes in it so it's an all-around wellness candy okay but as small as it is in this little city CBD it has in it I think it might be more geared towards like little kids maybe for like seizures or or a DD or even just wellness in some way because ten milligrams isn't a lot for an adult I would think cuz I personally need it probably the whole case of pops to be okay because I think it comes with like twenty or so in a case so I would probably need two or three hundred milligrams of this stuff but we're gonna open it up we're gonna try it out and see what it tastes like and see if we can get any you wouldn't get any wellness out of it okay so just give me a moment I'll rip this sucker open and we'll see what's in it cheers pop first off Wow I smells like an OG plant rate right allogram holy moly doesn't seem to be any low chunkies or anything yet so I guess it's just straight candy that's like flavor right off that's like you stuck the whole plant right in your mouth holy moly [Music] it tastes good yeah yeah I think it tastes great there's definitely terpenes in it you can taste them right off the candy itself has room it was sort of a like a sweet flavor to it I don't know if it's my imagination but I feel something well I was gonna get to that I actually even though it's only 10 milligrams I definitely feel calmer and that was just a little lick that I did well or someone who doesn't ingest or take CBD in a lot the sights a little bit could probably be you know you'll probably be beneficial do you like calming or making you are relaxed be another thing like your kids run around the house bouncing off the walls like a Gibbon throwing Legos everywhere you've been one of these little pops be like your kid you know son daughter child have a lollipop it's definitely appeasing in flavor I mean like the more I eat it the more I want to eat it I mean totally is when I was a kid I probably just want to ask for another that like definitely is like peanuts chronic candy is that it definitely has a a sense of appeal in its flavor okay like I can say that like if I were to take like marijuana or so forth and put it in my mouth I would be like this definitely has flavor and I could say that when you do it if you don't continuously lick it it goes away like I felt something but now because I ain't continuously doing it yeah it's not doing anything anymore yeah you probably have to ingest a whole pot like it's supposed to be one dose but one does for who wonder what type of people would benefit from this like I said like maybe like people with seizures because CBD supposed to be great for seizures and focusing concentrating relaxation just watch them move like children it's a pop yeah ten milligrams I feel it but I don't think it'll last long not for me cuz I'm you know kids like fifth my size it'd probably be like hey I'm ready to watch Sesame Street hey bring on the spongebob I'm ready for cartoons is it snack time yet so let's go through our daily thing here first we'll say that one one two five one being and five being presentation what it looks like what definitely looks appealing ain't a person in the world unlike a pop so due to four and a half it was a little bit bigger around maybe a five because then it'd be more appealing flavor would it taste like right off the bat man it's like you put the whole plant in your mouth so I give this sucker a five color I'm not so big on the color could have been yellow like a lemon maybe put some kind of flavor in it just not just strength terpenes in the CBD but you definitely know it's in there effectiveness I feel it I don't feel it like like when I used like the flowery products like the CBD blunt or the bubble bag hash and that's a BAM in your face you're you know I'm medicated this is just an underlining feeling that definitely is calming and medically it's good so those three things combined and the price is nice um I was giving this one for free to try it but if I remember correctly on the box here were like two bucks apiece I think I think there was like 10 or 20 in the box and he had like two or three more boxes you could just maybe buy a whole box for 20 bucks or something it's probably gonna be a big deal especially for since I work here at that new Nannan it's [ __ ] stressful working in there sometimes cuz there's definitely a cultural gap so being able to calm down and being able to focus yeah I'm sterile these are your mouth at work no probably never know I know so if you have any questions or comments if you've tried these before or you know a different flavor or a different company or a place where you can Vicki's wholesale or even ones that are stronger 20 I think a 50 milligram one of these would definitely be more adult in a in a in a dose cuz I know when you buy just like the hemp bombs those pills are like three pills for 60 milligrams total you take all three of them pills you know you took them so if you have any questions or comments please feel free to leave them down below thumbs up like subscribe comment comment comment meanwhile while you're commenting I'm gonna finish this lollipop so till next time guys have a great calming relaxing medicated day", "bz4_El9ZDFI": "hello guys welcome back to reviews fit in this

"I've got a fancy plate so you know what that means it's time for a new mini episode of wheats the marijuana review show where we review edibles and help you make sense of your dispensary showing you which animals are worth your hard-earned dollars today we're looking at a new brand TK over edibles there are 200 milligram Bharani they proclaim it to be an award winner but don't tell us what award day one say award-winning best edible right there on the package no ingredients and no nutrition information very small brownie square tiny little thing very basic packaging so TKOs and they call it that because they sing it's going to knock me out but TV sends for technical so that is a very boring looking square ass browning smells like weed has a pretty high we'd smell or a pretty potent D weed smell I'm not optimistic to tell you the truth this nothing about the screams this is gonna be a good one it smells bad looks funky it's kind of hard but I'm willing to the doubt and it was affordable this was seven dollars at my dispensary for a what they say is a 200 milligram edibles so we shall see but let's give a taste no wait okay not good not good aroma yuck it's no koruba salted caramel or brownie but in this case guys looks we're not to see them it looks it tastes as bad as it looked there's a lot like weed there's a pretty great flavor very dry kind of stale taste in people it's not very big so yeah okay pepin back up here I have got to polish this off which is something I'm not looking forward to once I polish this bad boy off that's customary with our weeks many reviews I will come back to you guys in two hours and let you know how we're feeling and let's cross our fingers that work feeling pretty good because otherwise man I go in through some nasty food for no reason okay well with that I will see you guys in two hours and wish me luck I hope hope his ropes see you then hi guys I am back it has been 2 hours since I had the TK hoe edibles award-winner brownie and I gotta say it has been a pleasant surprise pleasant surprise it tasted pretty awful admittedly and while not quite a TKO it still packs a pretty good punch for a 200 milligram edible I'm pretty high right now I was not expecting this so maybe the awful taste was due to its onion advertised potency potent delicious every time is their catchphrase I can tell you at least one of those is true and at least one of those is false the third one I don't know so with that being said if you see a TKO edibles brownie in the dispensary near you it's affordable this cost me seven bucks and as long as you are not particular about taste as long as you are okay with the foul tasting edible give it a shot it's a potent edible for a fair price but if you're really really conscious about a flavor that's gonna be a hard pass so that's it for this review of weeks we will check you guys out on the next episode and thank you so much for watching", "qM8h87Cx_AY": "[Music] what's up guys I'm so about 7:10 and today I'm back with another video today's video is gonna be a edible mukbang and I thought the perfect way to start out an edible mukbang it's with the drinks so I actually have one for Skye and one for myself I'm gonna take the blue Rhys and I'm gonna pour her up the Tigers blood she's like upstairs chilling and she had somebody go like scroll up a blonde you know I'm gonna just start eating all my edibles but just thought I'd introduce these syrups because they don't have a label they just have the flavor on them I got them from a really nice guy the other day he runs a company I think it's called like power nap or something I actually have to get the the name of their company I just know they're not too big online and they're not too big on like anything so he was one of me to try the serum so I think this is a really cool looking syrup so far it doesn't look too liquidy but we'll see when we pour it out I just thought I'd say it like you know before everybody's like what kind of soup is that okay I don't know but looks fire so we're gonna try it out don't want so in senior you okay but take two on that sky look we just came downstairs to like make some food or whatever and like hot that she's seen that whole freaking thing but it's all good blue raspberry here we go for a random guy this guy knows how to [ __ ] package something what the [ __ ] it's childproof possible so far that looks fire at the bottom you can't really see it's so blue we can but you can't just looks thick oh I'm scared to open this back up I can feel it like carbonating a [ __ ] and when I open this back up it's gonna explode I promise you that it's just making me nervous you got to take it slow I don't really use that much I'll use like you know there's a 4 ounce bottle can you see it I'm gonna pour them up I need to stop getting so excited with this [ __ ] I'm gonna pour the whole bottle in here though I'm gonna put all of it in when I can fit it in it's gonna be some of the best stuff I've had so far because every single syrup so far you could taste like a really thick thing or like you taste like weed in your mouth this is really good it's actually really really good I like it a lot how much is left in here literally 1 ounce exactly is left whoa is he getting I didn't wake up you're supposed to mix that up man that wasn't a bad taste I just didn't like that looks like one of those like lava lamps when he makes it around cause it's so syrupy it's like real I think I don't know if they made this way additionally I don't think he made this with dissolute man cuz like that I've had this bottle for a while and usually when you make series of dis wit it like looks like a ring around like the whole bottle like wherever its it's if it's like filled up to here it'll leave a bottle like a ring around the bottle of dishw it like right where it sits like this this didn't do that and it's not mixing like dis will it would normally dissolute would sit at the top of the bottle this is actually really cool I don't know what he made it with I need to find that guy now I need to go find sky and give her hers we should look far I just go upstairs and I'll say I should have put this [ __ ] over some ice he's amazing I mixed up skies by the way where's yours and she already started drinking her rosary these were up the stairs yeah quench your thirst I like that one [ __ ] you I got a bag of goodies here I'm gonna start off with yes actually no this is so heavy on my stomach I actually just ate some pizza so I don't know why I decided to do this after I just ate I don't know but all right so you know what let's start off with something light I got these myths they're Kiva petra minced for petra means compliments of Kiva confections this says they're two point five milligrams each and there's four in here so two points like two two four six a there's like ten milligrams what a minute to use [ __ ] it smells like toothpaste eat them all video because I'm not really a fan of mint but it's interesting that was interesting here's my decrepit bag of goodies and I hold us all the magic in here so I have some three heads company sharks these are gummy sharks 50 milligrams each so there's 500 total in the bag that means it's par like what like 10/10 in there or something I float there's more than ten it looks like a lot more than 10 so prime more than 500 milligrams are there this is also for three heads it says sugar-free butterflies 50 milligrams each so 500 total in the bag sugar-free butterflies that actually really intrigued me what do these taste like sugar free gummies do get a say they smell like ganja's oh man I taste like weed dude knocking on front these look dirty but that's the weed on it I'm gonna eat them all don't try one whips by eight two three four five six there was turning the bags they do it kind of dirty those are that oil oh wow no way I want to like it mm-hmm it's so we dude it's such a weed these are chewy yep I'd really joke yeah sure you just felt like all those amounts to serve us anymore I should go you could live I got two of green ones in a pink very nice I'm sure ate them separately shoot they've different flavors I don't know I feel like at this point they all seems like you don't chew in the butterflies [Music] don't run with these don't really taste like we I can see the weed all over the bag they're good right these I feel like these like don't taste like as much weed but I thought they're gonna get me more [ __ ] up I feel like the other ones were sugar-free and that's why it looks so dirty like the weed because if I didn't have much to stick to like though like the weed and stuff but this has so much sugar just like the we can stick to it all over it everywhere there's like the sneaky ones [ __ ] you up it seems so good like real candy smack you these are really really like the texture is more slimy hip the truth is even more well this is so fun there's 500 milligrams in this bag there's 500 milligrams and the other bag that's Kathryn milligrams but I gave Scott - so it's like 900 milligrams I've adjusted damn near 900 milligrams almost in to edibles are gonna get so sick from eating yours candy this is why I just smoke weed guys you don't get sick through smoking blogs Louis tobacco makes you feel sick then you probably get some type of nausea I got one mo up there's really we all over my bed last baby shark and now I have well okay now I have excuse me the nerds from boss-lady products these are medicated nurse um I'm not too sure how many milligrams I want to say like 500 milligrams 300 to 500 milligram I know it's like somewhere in the hundreds it's not like in a thousand anything but these are these it's child to man oh okay oh good thing I'm gonna dull I see them these are the I think the cherry ones the wild cherry or just regular cherry it's from infinite extracts it's like a gummy it says 150 milligrams THC a space domain hmm gelatin sugar corn syrup citric acid citric acid [ __ ] me up guys just so you know I'm not really supposed to eat a lot of citric acid by doing anyway malic acid coconut oil THC doctor who's like five ingredients I'm not allergic to anything in case you guys are read the ingredients some edibles don't have ingredients though this one does so I thought it was important to read it it doesn't have a flavor but I could smell it great album even those I feels like I'm biting into human skin I'm biting through a an arm like a stomach a shovel there mmm but tastes like a tongue mmm green apple tongue these are the truth after I'm done like with most of these nerds I can move on to the baked goods I just don't want to like be eating a [ __ ] brownie and then switch over to the lyrics that's kind of gross I think the stuff that makes this edible is the white stuff on it mmm this is this buff I try with a myth you like minty and sweet that's the one I already ate [Music] Wonderman milligrams are having my mouth spa that's all half a minute - nurse posh lady makes all types of different like flavors of Denver's she does like like over 10 flavors I think like a lot of different flavors an infinite extracts they have like I only seen two different flavors of these gummies but they're really really good I actually think who's gonna be as good as it was if they're the three heads company they have amazing edibles I think no matter what gummy you get it's always gonna be bomb but they have tons they have watermelon ones and they have like a million different baked goods doing like they make them so oh no all these edibles are pretty official actually I had our own edible bacon and that was from blazing edibles but I took a bite of it and like I don't even know what happened to it and then I also had but yeah I also had um some what it was a corn bread and like I don't know it was like a like a banana bread type thing and that was from be healthy and that was another edible that was fire because I got to build mighty little bread loaves and then it came with like this this like churned like whipped edible butter it was so good but I actually kept it in my bag by accident and it went bad so I didn't get to like eat those on camera I had a lot more edibles than this just edibles you know they're perishable and a lot of mine perished you can't hurt my teeth they have like cavities I got filled those hurt I asked on popcorn this is from Cali dope corn Cali pop Kelly dope corn I'm not too sure exactly but I know like their Instagram is pretty lit these have all these different popcorns in shape I've been dying to try this you could tell if I've had it for a while sitting in the Sun because it got all like buttery all over the packaging ship but this is what's Mac dude edible popcorn this whole entire bag is like 800 milligrams or something like it see it's like a lot of milligrams for some [ __ ] popcorn I just sit in the movie theater just eating this [ __ ] [ __ ] up there's a graham cracker in here yeah these mints are fire I don't even think I want to throw the mitts right now like I want to save some of those for like a good day when I'm where I'm going to talk to some official people and I've got a meat in my mouth like any breast was good what kind of mitten is that it's a Kiva Pecha two point five milligrams so last time I had these popcorns it's like their flavor didn't [ __ ] and I have like these yellow ones and those were like banana so I'm guessing that there's like a strawberry blueberry digging happening here these aren't yellow these are like a tan so I wouldn't be surprised if they're not just regular popcorns and there's like some type of weird flavor but it always smacks yep with some type of weird flavor the blue one is I don't know I don't know what any of these are I don't know what the flavors are with a [ __ ] bomb let's play how fast can I eat the whole bag [Music] I

dispensary and as I said we are talking the fine folks at t KO one of their hundred milligrams today the peanut butter and jelly crispy that's right the peanut butter and jelly crispy from TKO we've reviewed a variety of products from TKO and I think on the whole they're pretty good I've liked them all pretty much they all seem to be as potent as advertised and they usually taste at the bare minimum okay and sometimes even verging on good so I'm not actually sure what makes it a peanut butter and jelly crispy what what the jelly part is or the peanut butter in this don't know but looking forward to try it sounds good to me it sounds like flavorful and good it's a pretty affordable edible only cost me seven bucks in my dispensary as the packaging sort of indicates it's an affordable edible but in this case or than the previous TKO edibles does not mean it's they skimp out on the potency just means that you've got some less than fancy packaging which it's fine with me as long as you know they if they're saving that are passing the savings on to you that's great so let's go ahead and open this up and give you a little taste test then I'll finish it off and I will come back to you guys in two hours or two hours from me just a couple seconds from you guys just to let you know how I'm feeling so here we go open it up there you can smell the peanut butter smell to it for sure it smells a lot like peanut butter let's give it a taste mm I don't know how they do it there is a peanut butter and jelly taste to it what peanut better than jelly but there's definitely that fruity jelly sort of taste to it as well it's good I like it quite a bit this might be my second favorite tasting one behind the s'mores which I had but this one's pretty good I like the cereal like rice krispie treats and this one is not bad so guys I'm gonna finish this off and then I will come back to you in two hours to actually let you know how it's feeling and for you it'll just be right after this break thanks for watching wheats and I'll see you soon peace hungry YUM got me some munchies um welcome back sweets guys sorry about that it's been two hours since I had the TKO 100 milligram peanut butter and jelly krispies and I gotta say I like it a lot I'm gonna solid five five and a half somewhere like that which is a pretty good value for a seven dollar edible I'm about as high as I you know I'm happy with where I'm with my high and not really wish it was any higher I really like the taste of it too one of the better tasting TKOs just all around a good product for another winner from TKO certainly one of my favorites from them and a surprising potency from just a hundred milligram edible so if you see this one out of the dispensary near you and you're okay with the lower dose edibles do not hesitate to grab the peanut butter and jelly krispies I don't think you'll be upset that you did and guys I'm gonna eat some more of this food I'm really looking forward to that and I will see you on the next review thanks for watching peace", "7X3v4QQBOpg": "all right welcome to pushes unboxing I don't really do reviews if you leave comments on all the products that would be

thank you guys bye", "EI2FrKdifbk": "[Music] we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review I've got a fresh look at that ooh that is pretty to look at a fresh jar of Nutella and pancakes love Nutella if you didn't know a fresh jar to tell us and that means we are gonna be reviewing some gummies that's right guys we're back with more gummies I always know I'm telling you to be wary of gummies I'm weary of gummies and I'm wary of these gummies so this was a 500 milligrams worth of gummies don't worry I'm not eating all 500 milligrams today we're just gonna do a test to see if there any potent whatsoever I picked these up for 30 bucks at my dispensary so a very good deal if these are in fact 500 milligrams worth of gummies I doubt that that is gonna be the case this is the canna MX brand taste innovation only the finest quality there are 50 gummy bears in here in total with 10 milligrams per gummy bear so we are going to do 20 in total for 200 milligrams and we're gonna do our review on 200 milligrams of the canon mix in total canna MX canna mix I'm gonna go with canna mix is how you say that it's spelled canna MX all one word unless so again 30 bucks for 500 milligram gummy edible is a great deal if in fact it works but there are a lot of red flags chiefly the price you get what you pay for when it comes to edibles second the packaging this isn't cheap easy to make packaging it's just a sticker on a ziplock bag always a bad sign to we're almost always a bad sign I've had a couple of good things come in cheap packaging like this but not a lot um and just the fact they're gummies that's also usually a bad sign I have bad luck with gummies there are a lot of people unscrupulous folks out there making gummies that aren't worth they're a damn and I'm hoping that isn't gonna be the kids that can of MX we're gonna give him a totally fair shot so I have Nutella just to uh turley completely boost my of getting any kind of tolerance she's taking a little bit of extra fat with the gummies just to help process that THC so here we go let's open them up give the taste test the smell test all that fun stuff so you can see the gummies in there they look like pretty plain gummies they don't have any coating on them they don't have anything additional on them it smells both intensely fruity and intensely cannabis ewwww so here we go nothing on the outside they're not sticky or anything like that I'm just gonna grossly dip it right in Nutella get some fat going here there we go mm hmm well I didn't really taste any cannabis but that might be because I've got the Nutella on it but Wow okay a little bit of cannabis taste on that one okay let's just try one clean here there's a slight cannabis taste to them but really these are on the less cannabis II and of gummy taste that I for gummies or less cannabis II tasting gummies that I've had also a bad sign this is not gross tasting like the etta pure infused creations which I find really hard to stomach although I don't find those to be any good whatsoever so I'm hoping that doesn't mean that these are gonna be bad but we'll have to find out so I've eaten four already I'm gonna do sixteen more and I will see you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling because that's the most important part of the edible review you don't really care about how these can be Bears tastes you want to know if Kanna MX is something you should be buying in the future so guys I'll see you in two hours to let you know for sure thanks for watching wheats and I'll see you soon peace [Music] welcome back to weeds guys it has been two hours since I had the canna mx-5s quality 500 milligram gummies I only had 200 milligrams of them but there's not 200 milligrams of THC in there i am i high at all i'm like a - maybe somewhere in there don't feel pleasantly stoned I feel like I had to join an hour ago yeah [ __ ] Ken MX and their gummy bears it's a load of [ __ ] these aren't potent at all another crappy gummy and another crappy gummy company all the telltale signs were there that she priced the sticker the she packaging oh and all kin of MX no do not spend your money on these guys if you see them stay far far away I do have some of their chocolate bars to review maybe they'll be good I have seen where chocolate bars are still good and the gummy brands are bad where when people have both like um we get a flavor ex their chocolate isn't bad but their gummies are terrible so we'll see but as right now just pass on the gummy bears don't waste your money and [ __ ] these guys for you know where's the lab tested result where's the nutrition information where's all that good stuff it's not here because they don't want you to know because it's just gummy bears they bought off the shelf and infused maybe some cannabis in there possibly who knows maybe I'm just high because I smoked like two hours ago and that's what I'm still feeling not feeling anything most boy I this is like our sixth dud review in a row or something maybe we've had a string up they might not all come out in the order of duds in a row but I have reviewed a bunch of doodoo back to back to back I am really looking for a diamond in the rough a pleasant surprise I was hoping Kevin MX was it gonna be it I gave him a fair shot but definitely do not gonna be the gummy bears from them so final conclusion if you see Kanna mx4 now avoid everything I'll review their chocolate if their chocolates good I'll be sure to let you know we'll assess them fairly but for right now there's no reason to buy any of their products because if they're gonna rip you off with this it's more than likely they're gonna rip you off with other things so sorry to be a bummer guys I really wish we could have had something more fun for you but at least we know not to mix it up with Kanna MX or something so guys thank you so much for watching this review I appreciate you watching as always and we will see on the next review peace", "bssGLDvoBT8": "[Music] in two weeks the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary I've got my trusty spatula and my trusty thing in Nutella why do I have these you might be asking if you have not tuned into one of these before it means I am reviewing gummies and the reason I have this Nutella is so that I can have a little bit of fact before I eat these gummies I find that having a little bit of fat in your system before consuming gummies enhances the high of that gumming so let's just take a little lick of Nutella here the best part about any edible review because who doesn't love just some freaking Nutella all right that should be that should do it for my fats now what kind of gummy are we reviewing we are reviewing lol edibles candy I have actually had a couple people asked me to review this I reviewed one lol edible product in the past that I did not like very much the Elwha edibles flamin hot cheetos this here is a candy it is blueberries our belts Meghnath be gorilla glue glue hybrid so you can see on the back they've got a plea to add them on social media they've got a missing lot ID batch number and best before date not on there so we don't know if we're gonna be doing okay says do not mix with alcohol first time I've ever seen that I don't exactly know why you shouldn't mix the two other than you don't like getting crunked but uh who cares I am really hoping this lol edibles redeems not only lol edibles which he's a really dumb name I mean it's just a colossal II stupid name I'm hoping it not only redeems them but also gummies in general if you've never really seen weeks before I have never been a huge fan of gummies or candies I finally get you less high than the confectionery edibles but maybe this will be the one that turns it around we shall see alright so let's open this up here these blueberries sour ropes alright that is a strong weed odor very strong you will smell that from a distance away as I think so be careful opening this somewhere in a closed area where you don't want people smoking weed because that has a very strong weed odor as do these ropes themselves these look a lot like the Buddhist hours which I've had in the past and reviewed hmm there's a considerable weed taste to them not overwhelming the sourness definitely helps not as sour as the Buddhist hours but still pretty sour with a stronger weed flavor so hopefully that means they're more potent than the the Voodoo sours Oh sure if I mention this this is a 300 milligram animal should should be pretty potent but then again gummies your mileage right back again fairly strong we taste but the sourness really helps them overcoming with it all right guys so I'm gonna finish these here off-camera I'm not gonna bore you to death eating you all these things here in front of you and I will be back in two hours to let you know how we're feeling because as always that is the most important part of any edible review all right guys please please please wish me luck let's hope these are better than our gummies in the past and ll WA edibles in the past and I will see you guys in two hours to let you know the results thank you so much for watching weights we'll see you soon peace guys I am happy to report that while not perfect and while not my first choice in any of the categories lol edibles the candy blue ropes blue berry ropes blue gummi ropes are are a nice little revelation they are not the most powerful 300 milligram edible I've ever had they're not the most tasty gummy I've ever had but I would say they are probably my new favorite gummy I am I do feel quite high not as high as I would be on a 300 mm gram confectionery edible like say akarova for example but that's a comparing you know something with like the best of the best I guess it's substantially better than their flamin hot cheeto knockoff that I had a while ago so you know it might be a combination of lowered expectations I was also a little tired going to this review so that might also be contributing to like my feelings of being high but overall I'm I'm I'm pleasantly surprised I know I used that phrase a lot but this was a welcome surprise I I had two strikes going against it one being lol edibles which I had a bad experience with and being a gummy which I've mostly found to be disappointing and I found it to be okay so that's you know that's good that's good I would not probably buy this again but if you are a fan of gummy edibles or if you really like sour gummies this is certainly better than the Voodoo candies I've had which are 375 milligram anibal's you might want to go and pick this up but for me it's it's a nice little surprise so thank you so much for watching weeks guys that's my dog walking in and we will check you out on the next review peace hello and thank you so much for watching wheats if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment below and I'll be more than happy to try to find the product to review it again thanks for watching and we'll check you guys out on the next video", "4P2-eqMOeT8": "[Music] welcome to week skies the marijuana review show and I'm the one with the cavalier lis throwing around these scissors and I've got scissors in my hand not because I'm reviewing scissors I'm sure that there probably is a market out there for somebody who wants to review scissors no I've got scissors because I'm here to open a tough package one that I knew I'm gonna have trouble with but one that I am excited for because it is my one of my favorite kinds of edibles and that is the chocolate bar ooh the Sun is making that very difficult to see bad son bad bad son la familia it's the product of Los Angeles the mint flavor I read all the Spanish in English oh it looks like there's like four years of Spanish paid off so this is the la familia de la I almost said that terribly mint to flavor 200 milligrams of THC really that is quite obnoxious how that shows up they're very thin curtains I have um very simple packaging on this it's just like a little aluminum wrapper on this green kind of iridescent packaging you can feel not much to it again just like a sticker on an aluminum packaging it does have nutrition facts and ingredients on the back which is great but no lab test results so this is came from a black market or gray market dispensary in California because we all we all know all legal edibles are now 100 milligram edibles topped and they have to be ten servings or more this is an old-school 200 don't give a [ __ ] how many servings so let's go ahead and cut open the top here take a look at this chocolate bar give it a taste and if you've never tuned in before and if you have tuna before you must really [ __ ] hate here this by now but if you haven't the way of the reviews work here on weeds is I'm gonna eat a little bit of this here in front of you not necessarily the whole thing because I don't want to bore you to death but rest assured I'll eat this whole thing and then after I finish it I will come back to you guys in another two hours write us about when you'd be peaking to let you know how the product is actually hitting because that's what you're really in it for that's what you really care about is you know is it really gonna make you is it really gonna work not so much how it tastes okay Wow a very basic looking chocolate bar here totally basic it doesn't even have like an imprint with their logo on it or anything it is just what 12 squares of or twelve rectangles of chocolate I'm not gonna break it off into single rectangles let's just give it bite on three it smells like no I don't really detect a cannabis odor to it definitely a mint odor I'm a fan of mint chocolate I know there are a lot of mint chocolate haters out there I don't understand that but teach their own okay that's pretty good chocolate I'm decent quality chocolate for sure the mint flavor is not overwhelming I've definitely had some mint chocolates that are way more minty flavor more of a hint of mint here which is nice really no cannabis tasting I can't really detect much of any no hmm well what I hope that means is the chocolate is excessively masking the flavor of the cannabis and not that there's not 200 milligrams of THC in there mmm I never got to mention I picked this up on at the dispensary that I mentioned for $17 I believe which is two dollars more than they charge for a two hundred and thirty sixty milligram delta-9 which are excellent so high expectations for the la familia mint 200 milligrams here well guys I'm gonna eat another nine squares of this and then I will be back to you as I said in two hours let you know how it's hitting thanks for watching weights guys see in just a bit peace [Music] it's two hours later hi guys welcome back uh it has been 2 hours since I had the la familia and that still does not show up very well on this camera and I apologize for that there's a little bit of a better angle and the familiar the family that la familia is together families together is my review the end no my more elaborate view is it's pretty good it's not the most potent chocolate bar I've ever had chocolate bars are usually I believe the strongest and best vector for THC this one doesn't feel like a - like a kiva equivalent to me certainly not not even close really but it's still pretty good I'm at about a 6 right now some somewhere in that range so it's not you know terrible I've had 200 milligram edibles that are way worse and it didn't it tasted pretty good there's really no cannabis taste so you know on the whole I it's not the best you know there are certainly better chocolate bars out there I still would even probably recommend one of the new Kiva 100 milligrams over this la familia 200 milligram but if it's although your dispensary has and you like the chocolate bars this one's got a good taste it'll still do the job it's just probably not honest about that 200 milligrams would be my guess so if you have no other options and you like chocolate grab it otherwise go with one of the better brands pick up a kiva pick up a default say even probably a chill that one doesn't taste as good but I think it's more potent so stick with the bit the bit better brands if you can otherwise la familia is not a bad alternative and that is gonna do it for this review and before I go I'm gonna give you a very quick cherry on top guys just a soup quick little cherry on top something just so delightful and hairy I'll get you out of here real quick and that is cursing swearing profanity I mean I've been profanity since before my teenage years [ __ ] I [ __ ] love cursing it's the [ __ ] [ __ ] damn [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] it's great um if you if you don't curse a lot you should curse more if you don't curse at all what the [ __ ] is wrong with you cursing is the best the science is on my side you know they say that people who curse are more intelligent they're more honest they're more empathetic I've read that they actually have bigger dongs and that they're also better lovers to that I most of those are things that I've read so uh curse say [ __ ] a lot you'll like it la familia it's not that shitty thank you for sticking around to the end of this cherry on top thank you for sticking tuned to the end of this review appreciated Alice always guys it's been a [ __ ] blast see on the next week's peace", "qfdpEsrfu84": "[Music] give me a w w give me an e e give me an e e give me an A hey give me a t t give me an S s what does that spell wait sweet sweets hello everyone welcome to we it's the marijuana review show or we hope you guys make sense of your in dispensary classic classic review today we are taking a look at an edible and a brand I already know that I love quite a bit that is we are taking a look at our freshly legal review of Kiva Kiva their new 100 milligram a THC ginger dark chocolate bar with a hundred milligrams of CBD as well as you guys probably know if you tuned in often I'm not much of a CBD guy um but I am a THC guy so this one's a little bit more expensive than the standard Kiva because of the addition of the THC everything that cost me 25 bucks at night dispensary in Long Beach plus taxes so it's quite expensive but I hope it's going to taste as good as all other Eva products are and even most importantly I hope it's going to be as potent as Kiva has been now you can see the crazy packaging and has to go through this Kim in a sealed bag with a childproof seal and then this itself is in a childproof bag sealed and you always have to figure out how to open these and I can never figure out how to open them because I am NOT a smart person it's some point so we're gonna try to figure this out together you do this and that and then you pull away and then you say [ __ ] it and you get scissors that's how that's actually how it works you try what it says on the back and then used to get scissors and then surprise surprise on the inside is the exact same thing with all the pertinent information on it as well it's got lab tested results nutrition information all the good good stuff you want to see on it and that great Kiva minimalist card word packaging I really like their packaging design I'm outside of this unnecessary bag it's minimalist its well-designed and it does the job so I'm excited about this I like ginger like chocolate I'd loved every kiba flavor I've ever had and they've all got me a very very high so let's see if the tradition continues and here we go can't really smell anything just yet each piece contains five milligrams of THC so I guess this is gonna be twenty little squares or rectangles in there and there we are there are our 20 rectangles with some little design on it and oh it smells a lot like ginger that is a heavy ginger scent let's give it a taste it's like a symphony in my mouth and the conductor is weed it's good guys don't know matter that's what much else to tell you um except if you don't like ginger you are not gonna like this because this is heavy on the ginger flavor I happen to be pretty a fan ginger so I enjoyed this the chocolate itself is great quality there is a slight cannabis taste to it nothing overpowering nothing that's gonna make you throw up but if you hate the taste of cannabis maybe avoid but for me please punch mmm okay well I've been in there sixteen rectangles to get through but don't worry I'll finish off all of these and then once I finish off the last one I will come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling okay it'll probably be closer to three because I'm on my way to go see bad times at the El Royale is that the name the new Drew Goddard movie the guy did cabin in the woods excited about that so I'll cut you guys after the movie and I'll let you know how this kiba there are a lot of pieces of packaging here key the ginger dark chocolate bar is hitting thanks for watching weeds guys and I'll see you in just a bit and welcome back to weeds it has been about two hours 45 minutes and change since I last seen you guys and I come back to you surprisingly conflicted about the kiva ginger dark chocolate bar if you will look at my eyes they will tell you I am quite high and I do feel very relaxed very at ease very peaceful however I don't want to say I feel high per se I feel just sort of more easygoing and more relaxed and I might be confusing this I might this might just be a total placebo a factor I've sort of gotten into my own head and the confirmation bias type thing um I have heard however that's for some people CBD counter affects the psychoactive properties of THC and this can make you feel the CBD sort of effects and you know the more relaxing effects of THC as well but not this sort of more whoa man kind of high aspects and I think that might be what happened to me here ah for some people that's gonna be great that is going to be a jackpot that's gonna be exactly what they want for me it's not what I was looking for I was really hoping for more of a the classic head-high experience especially seeing the movie I just got out of Drew Goddard bad times at Hotel at the El Royale something like that I can't remember all those nouns so I was hoping to be really high for that movie because Drew Goddard likes to spend some crazy yarns and said I was just really chilled out and and you know I was a little disappointed unfortunately this is not gonna be the Kiva for me however I am NOT gonna give it a disapproval or I'm not gonna give it the thumbs down because I think for this a certain customer one who perforce prefers the more gist chilled out relaxed style of weed might really love this for me however it's just not exactly what I was looking for not what I was hoping for but that is not Kiva's fault I I knew that that was a possibility going in so just wanted to give you guys that heads-up that the CBD seems to be pretty effective in here so if you love CBD and THC maybe give this one a shot if you are like me and like the sort of Moorhead high this sort of more psychedelic sort of side of I wanna you'll want to stick with the traditional Kiva's which I have no problem recommending wholeheartedly so this one is a little bit mixed for me unfortunately but again that is not not an endorsement or not telling you to avoid it so I'm going to before I bounce here though guys I want to share with you a little cherry on top something that I do not have mixed feelings over and that is another Drew Goddard movie because I did have some similarly mixed feelings to this key lebar about bad times at hotel Royale something elroy out whatever the name of the movie is but his second movie I think cabin in the woods from 2012 is a fantastic movie I'm sure you've probably seen it and I'm sure somebody if you haven't has spoiled it for you but if not check it out it is an utter utter riot one of the most inventive movies and years just an absolute blast love that movie two thumbs up for Drew Goddard cabin in the woods one thumb up one kind of half cocked for the hotel Royale and about the sort of same for that keepa bar I think that sort of sums it all up I'm still pretty high just not the same high I wanted to be and that's gonna do it for real this time thank you so much for watching weeds guys and we will see you guys on the next review peace", "xFYJ4nSvDB0": "[Music] you show where we help you make sense of your dispensary today I'm sorry for our video and audio quality I'm just using the old iPhone 7 plus

today on wheats we are talking about tek oh there's snickerdoodle 160 milligrams cookie today oops got it upside down there so you can see our cookie 160 milligrams and it's a shitty little packaging I've had one gko product in the past and I actually quite liked it it was there brownie today we are gonna try there snickerdoodle cookie it's a little less potent in there brownie had 160 instead of the 200 of the brownie but I'm still looking forward to it because I'm a snickerdoodle fan and the one tki oh I had it was pretty good so let's go ahead and open it up give it a taste if this is the first time you guys have ever tuned in to wheats the way our reviews work is I'm going to eat this cookie or maybe all of it in front of you just don't want to bore you to death and then I'll come back to you guys in about two hours to let you know how I'm feeling because that's actually the most important part of any edible review alright so here's the snickerdoodle it smells a little bit like we know a lot like cinnamon and let's give her a taste stay still a little bit of a weed taste to it not too bad um mostly it just tastes like a snail very stale not very good snickerdoodle cookie so about what you'd expect from marijuana edible and about what I expect from TKO because I remember the brownie not tasting so quite so good but having the more important part it was quite potent so sorry for talking with my mouth full see you guys in two hours welcome back to week 2 boy it's been two hours since I had bt k o 160 milligrams snickerdoodle cookie and um quite a bit uh not in love with it but I do like it um it's an affordable cookie I think it cost me eight bucks so really on the cheap end for 160 milligrams Emmel and right in the average range for being high in the 160 milligram and of all I mean it's not a kirova or it's not like a bang bar it's not outrageously good but for that price uh it gets me where I want to be at a at the right price so no complaints there it did not taste great I am a fan of the snickerdoodle cookie so I was a little disappointed in and how bad this tasted I mean it's not disgusting you're not gonna have to gag it down it's just kind of stale kind of dry not the best tasting cookie but you know it is what it is and again it is a really affordable so you sort of get what you pay for in that regard but I do recommend it I do recommend the TK OH snickerdoodle cookie just like their branding I had in the past it is a pleasant little surprise I think I like the brownie a little bit more than the cookie but you know that's about a toss up there so again the TKO 160 milligrams snickerdoodle cookie if you see at a dispensary near you and you're looking for something a little bit cheaper don't hesitate to grab one well guys that's gonna do it for this review here on weeks I appreciate you watching as always and we will see you on the next review peace well [ __ ] that was awful I'm sorry that's pathetic hello and thank you so much for watching weeds if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment below and I'll be more than happy to try to find the product to review it again thanks for watching and we'll check you guys out on the next video", "UirMWx9OdK8": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of that crazy crazy confusing place you call your dispensary today we are taking a look at one of those especially confusing what exactly are we talking about here kind of products that your dispensary may carry and what exactly kind of product is that well it's none other than other than tincture i guess what we're calling tincture in this day and age um and what we can also just call um emblematic of all of this sort of inconsistencies in uh weed policies especially when it comes to um dosage requirements so uh and how is that true well we are taking a look at an 800 milligram tincture that stretches the very definition of what tincture is and that is the five star extracts flavored tincture taste of peach oral uh tincture product again 800 milligrams of thc so what why am i so dubious it's not that i'm dubious of the 800 milligrams i'm um they have their lab testing results on this little confusingly curled up sticker here and you know shows the amount of thc in there i just bring this up because this isn't tincture by any traditional definition uh this is the exact same stuff that they were selling years ago when there was no limit on a thc in products and they called it syrup which was an allusion to the codeine sort of cough syrup that people used to drink i guess the idea was that it would get you so high it would be like coding i don't know i think but it shows you kind of how far off we are the mark here this is that exams exact same stuff which is now no longer able to be sold because the only thing you can sell over 100 milligrams is tincture so their notion or what they decided to do was not so much rewrite or create a new product but just simply rebrand existing stuff and i'm not saying that i actually don't know if they existed then or not but i've seen a lot of these syrup companies doing this cannabis is another one and i love them um but it i'm not blaming them i'm not saying it's anything wrong with them i'm just saying the laws are so stupid and screwy that way that you get weird stuff like um candy flavored syrup being called tincture which is nominally at least supposed to be medicinal um and uh this is again just like pink snow cone syrup except it will almost certainly taste gross now they do uh back when they used to sell this kind of stuff before they had you i think the consumption idea was you would take it like a syrup you'd mix it in with maybe soda or something here they really do suggest you take it like a tincture which i don't know if that sound is coming through it is just as thick as cough syrup so uh that seems kind of odious to me to have this much under your tongue of that thick goopy liquid but you know maybe we'll try it both ways and see uh so for an 800 milligram thc tincture i believe this was 60 bucks which is um more expensive than say your breeze uh kind of tinctures but kind of maybe in the range of some select those kind of levels so it's not the cheapest tincture out there either um uh it comes with this fancy and by fancy i mean the least fancy thing you've ever seen this little syringe for dosing which again thick thick syrup um so yeah not the cheapest um i've seen these five star extracts all over southern california especially in the long beach area and they usually come pretty highly recommended from folks as well uh and like all of our wheats reviews the way we're going to do this i know this is 800 milligrams i'm not going to do all 800 milligrams of this uh thing my guess is that it's gonna be quite gross um i uh when we do our tinctures the way i do all our edible reviews here on wheats is we do 100 milligrams because that's generally the size that you're going to buy in most edibles um and that's what we use as a baseline to review things off of so i will try to get as close to 101 8 of this bottle as possible really should have brought some scissors live and learn um i think i was able to just kind of pull it down yep there we go that smells like uh cheap gas station peach rings and weed lovely uh so yes as i said uh about 100 milligrams and then after i do all 100 milligrams it'll probably take me about i'm usually go over about an hour to do the whole thing i'll come back about two hours after that point let you know if this stuff is worth the hassle and the expense um my initial instinct is gonna be there are a lot of other tinctures out there that are cheaper and smaller so this one has some strikes against it already but we shall see you know maybe the thickness of the syrup something something yata cannabinoid receptors binding gabanoids done i don't know what i'm saying what i am now saying is wish me luck oh yes um our dosing uh instructions here on the back say that boy everything about this is just so cheaply uh or so rush put together 2.2 milliliters from here is 10 milligrams of thc our syringe is 3 milliliters um so you guys can do that conversion at home that's what roughly 13 milligrams ish in three milliliters uh in a full syringe which would be what how many of those in totality oh 13 times seven yeah like seven of those uh well no eight right yeah eight of these oh boy eight full ones of these that's gonna be fun well there's our oh my god okay they want me to put this all under my tongue that is ridiculous guys oh jesus okay well we'll try it um i'm guessing i'm gonna reserve taking this like normal syrup here we go oh [ __ ] um oh my god wow that is oh that's so bitter that is so insanely bitter wow wow oh my god oh that's um that is up there for most disgusting holy [ __ ] yuckers i've had to do that is nasty man at least i mean try to keep that all under your tongue as soon as it hits those taste buds ugh it is i mean it it tastes like cough syrup just straight up cough syrup ugh six more to go um i'm not going to be doing all of these sublingually i might try to do one more right here sublingually for you guys and then the remaining five i'm just gonna probably pour into a glass because and mix it with something this is just too much to bear [ __ ] okay oh [Music] oh oh holy christ disgusting oh it's still coming up oh jesus whoo well this is what i'm definitely suffering for you guys [ __ ] i hate this wow so what five six more six more of those for me everybody and just what um i'm gonna try to do these as uh over the next oh it might take me longer than an hour to get through all of these lovely little sons of guns but trust me i will and two hours after i get the last one of these hello buddy how are you doing the last after i get the last one these nasty sons of [ __ ] down i'll come right back here let you guys know if this is in any way worth all of the the uh rather prodigious amount of grotesqueness you have to stand ugh so far got a lot working against it sorry about the uh so much bitching um but you know we're just trying to be honest here and i will see you guys uh you know three three and a half hours pray for me see you soon [Music] welcome back to wheats guys it has been about three and a half hours or so since i first said hello to you um in about 90 minutes since my last dropper under the tongue of this five star extracts the taste of peach as you can see or maybe our camera i'll show you the level is down to about 1 8 down as we're doing only 100 milligrams and uh this is gonna be a fun little end of this review because not very often anymore do i get sort of conflicted feelings about things it's pretty binary at this point this is good this isn't good buy this don't buy this like you know it's there aren't so many shades of gray but here um i i there's some yeah some interesting things um first and foremost does it work hell yes uh this is the 100 milligrams i did which was a [ __ ] lot um of liquid uh hit very hard i have no complaints in that department this is among the strongest tincture i have done um it is yeah the i don't know what the formulation is here but wow uh very very very um uh positive when it comes to your uh getting your your actual high off the product 100 milligrams this did the trick and then some um but there are other things about it that are that may make me say like well maybe not you maybe not want to invest in this and um we'll go back to the price again briefly it's more expensive than some other tinctures uh for theoretically less thc but i'm gonna guess that this is gonna i mean with as strong as that hundred milligrams that first one was um it's gonna feel very much as if it had the full thousand milligrams or more uh in comparison to other sort of equivalently strong tinctures out there um so yeah again price theoretically it's more expensive but it feels quite a bit stronger in some regards um the other big downside is how much you have to do for especially for tinctures so i brought a comparison here i'm working on this review of this breeze um cbd thc one to one spray um and this thing has a thousand milligrams of combined thc cbd and i've reviewed one that has a thousand milligrams of just pure thc so this is oh it's half a fluid ounce it's not even oh my god okay that uh changes things again this is a half a fluid ounce 0.5 fluid ounces um and it has a thousand milligrams of cannabinoids in it this is six fluid ounces and has 800 um uh milligrams of thc in it and that is crazy um i thought this originally was one ounce it's not it's half an ounce so i have to change my calculation thankfully just gotta double it um that makes this right here 15 times literally 15 times stronger per volume than the syrup and the syrup is revolting it never got easier to go down um i did take it sublingually every time i did not end up mixing it i just decided to stay consistent but it is truly gross i am very much looking forward to doing the rest of this bottle because it's it's a really pleasant high but [ __ ] is it nasty um it way worse than i mean i feel like such a prima donna now with these um these are nothing compared to this so it's real gross real strong and you have to do a [ __ ] ton of it but it is real strong and it will get the job done you just gotta kind of suffer through it um and you know uh kind of hard to say whether or not it's uh you know that that is ultimately gonna come down to you those factors whether it's worth it or not um if i want a uh a really powerful high this may be something i go to in the future but if i'm looking for something more casual something that i don't want to just have to put on a clothespin over my nose and just gack down probably stay away um and before i go guys normally i like to save the cherry on top so a little something extras a little just extra recommendation that's not weed related um i usually like to save those for our favorite you know overwhelming two thumbs up style reviews however today let's give you one that i'm a little conflicted about not conflicted about the actual thing but conflicted about oh man it'll just make you uh feel uh conflicted in your soul uh and that is what a terrible segue by the way um i was trying to think of like oh [ __ ] i want to recommend this book what's a transition don't do it while you're high on five-star extracts try to think of one beforehand anyways the uh book is called oh my god why did i not look up the title exactly as hot as it is called um ah yes the book is called evicted poverty and prophet in the american city by matthew desmond uh released in 2016. uh i just finished it earlier today uh it was the pulitzer prize or a pulitzer prize winner uh for nonfiction in 2016. and uh dessert absolutely deserves it it is a book that won't make you feel very good it is a book that will uh continue to you know make you realize oh boy we've been kind of living in a collective delusion for a while but hey no better time to burst that bubble than in the middle of a pandemic so give evicted poverty and profit in in the american city a chance it it's as good as everybody has ever told you that it is if anybody has ever told you about it um but again if you're not looking for something that's going to thoroughly depress you to your core avoid uh and that's the conflict and because we were conflicted about our five star extracts the taste of peach super strong but also you got to do a lot of it and it tastes like rotting ass so thumbs up for evicted poverty and profit in the uh american city thumbs sideways for how it makes you feel and thumb sideways for the taste of ass boy this has gone long you can see how strong it is when i ramble it's because i'm high thanks so much for watching guys be sure to stay high but of course even more importantly stay healthy my friends it's crazy out there and in the meantime oh i already said stay high and stay healthy [ __ ] do those things and i'll see on the next review goodbye", "X1U2wEtzooE": "hello everyone we are back with another episode of weeks today we are going to be looking at the MILF and cookies brand [ __ ] brownie 375 milligrams of THC so first and foremost we've got the name noth and cookies which is on I guess it's a play on milk and cookies but mom I'd like to [ __ ] and cookies makes very little sense to me anyways uh 375 milligrams as I said the [ __ ] brownie it's got some shitty packaging just a plastic wrapper oh this isn't edible that does not require refrigeration unlike different companies but let's open it up and take a look and try fight alright so here we go here is the [ __ ] brownie not much of a weed smell very very very very small hint of cannabis uh it looks like a brownie cookie hybrid with some Oreo like bits in there and some chocolate chips again this is our [ __ ] 375 milligrams brownie from cookies I bought this from eleven dollars from a dispensary in Orange County this I think again is on the low end of how much you could find this for I'm guessing this probably normal it's runs about fifteen bucks and most dispensaries so yeah without further ado let's give it a buy here see how it tastes well it's not bad um very little wheat flavor on the Sun but not anywhere near the best brownie I've ever had in my life it's a little dry the Oreo bits taste suspiciously like hydrops they still make eyebrows I don't know but it's not bad it's not bad you're not gonna gag eating this one for sure um but the most important thing as always is how this makes us feel and as always guys I'm gonna finish this here and I will check back within you with you guys in 30 minutes one hour and two hours and let you know how we're feeling so I'll check back with you guys then thanks for watching weeds hi guys welcome back we are I'm checking in with you here at the half hour mark for the experiment with our milk and cookies [ __ ] bratty I went ahead and uh dusting off that bad boy again not the best tasting brownie in the world if you hate the taste of marijuana it'll be fine for you because it doesn't really have much of a weed taste but but yeah it's it's not a good brand as a brownie uh ingredients nothing too strange in here lots of you know we got some partially hydrogenated soybean or condensed cottonseed oil not a big deal okay so half an hour and most important question how am I feeling this is this was a 375 milligram and which is pretty potent edible half an hour and I'm feeling a little bit as expected won't be feeling 100% strength just yet but there's a nice little mind hike coming on nothing quite in the body yet but a placid peaceful hiya so far I'm looking forward to seeing how this will feel in another half hour when I'll check back with you guys the hour mark so let you know how this brownie is feel and then thanks so much hi guys I'm back it's been an hour since I had that milk and cookies [ __ ] brownie thinkin warm not sure why it's called a [ __ ] brownie I don't know if that's really a name for a brownie cookie hybrid thing um you might be wondering why I've got this rice krispies treat with me that's because I want to eat it and you might be wondering why I would want to eat a giant rice krispies treat after eating that entire giant brownie that's a great question and the reason is because I ate that entire brownie and it makes me want to eat rice krispies treats now not a very good feels pretty good this has been one hour mark catch you guys in another hour this time I won't have one of these ciao ciao now that's what I call milligrams 375 mm in fact milk and cookies [ __ ] brownie it doesn't taste very good but it'll do the trick I give it four SOI lectins out of five canola and or palm oils that's next time PostScript I think at the one hour mark while also I think I forgot that the last mark was two hours I forgot to mention that the last time I talked to you I was two hours the time before that the one hour mark I promised you I wouldn't habit of miss left but I do and I just want to apologize for that catch you next time on weeds just a word of warning guys always follow the directions on the package never take a dose higher than what the package or the person who sold it to you recommends unless you know your tolerance unless you have an incredibly tolerant high tolerance or you've tried the animal before never try a higher dose than it recommends if you liked this video please feel free to subscribe and if there are a procs you would like me to try in the future please just leave a comment below and we'll be sure to review it on a future episode of wheats thanks for watching we'll catch you guys next time", "JmPIAQmsX6A": "[Music] a drink for the first time dozers we are looking at dozers cannabis infused strawberry lemon-aid comes up consumption advice on the back we're gonna ignore all of that comes with some nutrition facts as well but you're always handy to serving size 120 calories so there are 240 calories in this 16 fluid ounce bottle so this dozer has 100 milligrams of THC serve shake well serve ice-cold just came out of the fridge looking forward to it first time trying to drink on wheats so let's see both how it tastes and how it makes us feel and like with all our wheats mini-reviews what we do is we take the entire product down it and then I come back to you guys in two hours I'll let you know how we're feeling so not further ado let's open this bad boy up shake well again just in case give it a taste that's pretty good there is a strong marijuana taste to it however Dusty's like lemonade but the after room the more I sit here the more it tastes like marijuana there's a strong there I want to have to taste but the initial flavor is quite good but it does linger still lingering but it's not gonna unless you test the taste of weed edibles now this is gonna be just fine but yeah so the dozers gee strawberry lemon-aid cannabis infused tastes a little bit like weed tastes okay but the most important thing as we all know is how it makes you feel and so I'm going to jail this bad boy drink the rest of this off and come back to you guys in two hours and let you know thanks so much for watching we'll see you soon hi guys we are back here on weeks it's been two hours since I have consumed this drink down this bottle of dozers strawberry lemonade I'm not sure why there's a G on it it says dozers on the back but yet there's a drink the G and a strawberry and eliminate I don't know dozer I I'm not a hundred percent sure it's actually even called juicers to be honest but I would not recommend it so don't concern yourself with what the name is the more I drink of it the worse it started it tastes it started it tastes less like strawberry lemonade weed and urine mixed together and two hours later I don't really feel very high at all which is especially disappointing because my tolerance has been a little bit lower recently because I'm just getting back from vacation so I just wanted to let you know if you see dozers or this random G and a dispensary near you hard pass no thang I'm looking forward to reviewing some more drinks in the future to see if my mind changes but right now wheats would not recommend you spend your money on drinks thank you so much for watching guys and we'll catch you on the next video", "IIqB1wlfboE": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today i'm going to be showing you guys how to infuse any type of candy that you buy from the store well at least any candy that has a sugar coating on it for example um we're going to be using sour patch kids and sour patch kids watermelons but any other type of candies that have that sugar type coating will work i've also done this with just like generic gummies that you get from the bulk section or anything yeah anything like that will work and this is what they will look like so essentially they will look exactly like they did in the bag and this is what a lot of the time people are selling so like they put them i don't know what they have like there's a different name for it but the logo and everything looks very similar to this and you're you're buying these and they look exactly the same as a store block gummy and the reason why is because it is a store-bought gummy and it's just been um sprayed or um in this case dropped on um tincture um this method is not going to get you exact dosing so please don't do this with intentions to be um like having a perfect dose because it's not really possible to do that but you can get it pretty close but for most people who are just using these for themselves like i am it doesn't really matter in the end so yeah let me show you guys how to make these and i just want to say a huge thank you i just hit 10 000 subscribers this weekend that was absolutely amazing it is my birthday in a couple of days and i feel like that was kind of like an early birthday present to me if you haven't subscribed already please do now i would appreciate it so much here's what you're gonna need some store-bought candy um the sour kind with the sugar on the outside some tincture and a syringe okay so we're just gonna start by getting our surface ready i'm just using a baking sheet with some wax paper you could use parchment paper a plate whatever it doesn't matter and then i'm taking my candy that i have here um i chose sour patch kids the kids and then the watermelons but you can use any candy that has a sugar coating on it it doesn't need to be a sour sugar or not sour it doesn't matter as long as it has that um sugary coating so i've done this before and just gone to like bulk barn and just chose whatever candies i like um you need to have that sour sugar on the outside because that is what is absorbing the tincture so yeah once i have the candies i want to infuse i just lay them out on my baking sheet and then here is my tincture so now i'm going to get my little syringe thingy and pull up some tincture so i'm not measuring how much i'm really using because it's just for me to use by myself but if you want to know how strong they're going to be you could like keep track of how many syringes you use per x amount of candies but anyway so you're going to take your little syringe and you're going to press it on to the candy and not too hard but hard enough that it's not going to go flying everywhere um here we get a little bit closer so you can kind of see what i'm doing so yeah so i have i fill up my syringe and then i set it on top and push down with a steady hand that's why i'm using two hands so i can be really steady with it and then i just push enough that um fills the cat the sugar coating with the tincture but not enough that it goes onto the tray if you add too much it will leak off of the candy and go onto the tray and then you're wasting stuff um so just use less at first to see how much it can kind of hold and just a reminder here this when you're doing this is not the candy itself like the gummy candy the chewy part is not absorbing the tincture it's only the outside that absorbing it so then now i'm just doing the exact same thing but with my sour patch kids now this is what they look like after i did the first round so that means i've only added tincture to one side of the candy and there's those watermelons you can see they've already started to dry um and you're just gonna leave these out with um air circulating so i just have a fan facing them um to help dry them off um but i have kept on having to move the tray because it kept on sitting in the sun so you don't want to be in the sun or it's going to melt as i put them into the sun here but you know that's for the visual effects so has that good lighting but yeah so in the fan leave these to dry until they're dry ish and then you're going to repeat the process of adding more tincture okay now that they've dried which i think that took like 20 minutes not even i'm just flipping them all over and then i'm going to repeat the process so with these watermelons i could flip them over repeat the process and then turn them on their like other side i feel like they kind of have a couple sides they could sit on whereas with the sour patches i can only kind of turn them over one way or another but you can keep repeating this process over and over again so i only put tincture on or i only put one layer or one serving i don't know what you want to call it i only did each side once i guess is what i should say just because i wanted to be able to eat a lot of these in one serving so if i kept on layering the tincture on it would limit how many i could eat at once um but yeah so you're just gonna let them dry after this and then you could flip them over once again and keep on adding and you can keep on doing this over and over again until it no longer absorbs any tincture and i think you could probably do about four or five rounds on each side so keep in mind when they are drying it's evaporating all the alcohol from your tincture which is why you're able to add so much to it but um i think you could also add some more sugar coating to this to allow for more tincture on the outside but i didn't want to mess around with it too much i just wanted to kind of show you guys the simple way to do this um and you know it's kind of guaranteed that this is gonna work um you could also do this with your already infused gummies so if you actually make some gummies with your tincture and then put a sour coating on them you could do this again and that would make them like extremely extremely sour non-sour extremely extremely strong because in this case these ones are only having tincture on the outside whereas if you had a gummy that was already having tincture on the inside you could also add on the outside and that would just be super strong and lovely now i'm just gonna zoom in here so that you guys can see a little bit better about how i am actually adding the tincture without it splashing so i'm taking this little syringe and i'm pushing it lightly on top while still having control of the syringe and once you do a couple of these you get really used to it and you kind of know exactly how much you can use [Music] so they were all done but i guess i decided i was gonna add a little bit more which i shouldn't have done because i got kind of sloppy about it and you guys are gonna see what happens when you get sloppy about it or when you put too much tincture on your gummy and it's not able to absorb it so let's just take a little look closer up so you can see that tincture on the bottom of my waxed paper those little greenish brownish splatters there so that is tincture that is wasted i mean obviously you can lick the parchment but if you don't be so quick and lazy when you apply it it shouldn't happen so if you see my sour patch kids here there is pretty much no tincture that leads off just a couple of little specks and that's what happens when you're patient instead of when i went overboard with the watermelons without letting them dry in between okay now let's just take a look at some of the finished ones versus the original one so here is a finished watermelon um and then yeah that looks good and let's grab a un tincturized un infused i guess uninfused watermelon and that's how it looks so you can see that sugar chunked up and then it gives it that it also have that little bit of the brown and greenish after the um alcohol evaporates so it kind of looks like grubby i guess i don't know i just feel like it kind of looks like dirty but um it's only if you look kind of close up and then let's compare it with some sour patch kids on the left there that's a uninfused sour patch kid and on the right that is a infused sour patch kit so it looks a little bit like wetter kind of it's not wet though um but yeah the sugar kind of clumps i don't know i don't even really know how to explain it but i guess you guys can kind of see on screen there yeah then there's our little watermelons um and our sour patch kids um i guess now that i'm closer with my camera here i can show you a little bit better kind of the tincture that is still on the pan um it's not too bad but i was doing this with one hand part of the way because of the camera and stuff so i was a little bit sloppier but if you guys are careful there shouldn't really be any waste now they are all dry and i'm just packaging them up um they dried like i said for like i don't know 20 minutes half an hour if you want to be super sure they're really dry i would just leave them out overnight and if you want to you can always add more tincture there is nothing stopping you from adding more a day later two days later a week later whatever it's all gonna work now you have a bunch of delicious infused candy that was super simple to make and i hope you guys enjoy this little trick as much as i do okay so now these are finished let's taste them and see how they are i'm going to start with the sour patch kids here so immediately when i open it has a very strong smell and these are going to taste stronger than gummies usually would because the tincture is all on the outside of the gummy so when it touches your tongue the first thing you taste is the tincture whereas if you're making your gummies homemade the tincture is mixed in with the gelatin with the sugar and everything else and it's less of a like direct flavor as soon as you eat it um but once you start chewing it kind of all blends in so it literally just tastes like a sour patch kid with tincture i didn't make mine super super strong so like i would eat this whole bag probably but you can make them so that they're really strong yeah oops very good very strong tasting but that'll be depending on how your tincture tastes so it's just going to taste like sour patch with a touch of tincture okay now the watermelons they're just so cute i love these bags so much i reuse them to be honest they're super super cheap but i'm cheaper um so whenever i use them and they're just like for gummies like this i'll just like reuse it after but i wouldn't reuse it if i was giving it to someone anyways [Applause] um these ones are better not just because i like the watermelons better and surprisingly they like you think they'd be all sticky and stuff but they're not i literally put these in the bag like right after i made them instead let them dry because i'm lazy um yeah they're not sticky at all they're very good strong you can definitely tell that they have tincture on them but yeah thank you guys so much for watching this video i hope you enjoyed it if you did please leave a comment subscribe and give us a thumbs up thank you guys so much for watching and have a wonderful day", "6sBWiwLyvK4": "[Music] no till uh orange spatula sick you're a long time wheats fan you know what that means it means I'm breaking my cardinal rule today fellows because I am reviewing yet another gummy I always say don't be a dummy don't buy a gummy but today for you guys it smells good though you can smoke through the packaging I have purchased yet another gummy because people told me the flourish flourish F flourish gummies are really great and that I will actually get quite stoned off of them so this is a hundred and fifty milligram edible it has been rated by the SE labs which means that you know it really does have 150 milligrams of THC in there like the packaging a lot very fancy packaging oh so if you haven't tuned in two weeks before you probably wondering why I happen to tell with me well that's because I like to have a little fat with gummy edibles as a good way of ensuring that the THC hits your bloodstream so ask us where if any gummy review I always take a little spoonful and Nutella or spatula for and until a beforehand so that way I can take the edible and your optimal conditions and with gummies you want to be doing this under optimal conditions alright so here we go mmm great every time so I got my fat in my bite let's open up the flourish again really fancy packaging look at that that's so cool well shiny we that we so we gotta open up here and it's in four or pyramid-shaped chunks this is the mango hybrid flavor hybrid being the strange some kind of hybrid we'd strain mango being the flavor oh it smells great smells like mango let's give it a taste almost choked on it well that tastes a lot better than a lot of the other gummi edibles this tastes a lot better than like it appears or infuse creations any of those it has very little weed taste I mean it does have Sun but but totally fun mmm very jelly like a jello like texture kind of hard to chew in fact all right guys well I'm gonna finish these last two cubes here and I will see you in two hours to let you know if this SC or excuse me flourish h1 50 mango hybrid gummy is actually working keep your fingers crossed for me guys because I would really love a potent gummy I will see you in two hours to let you know thanks for watching weeds guys I am back it's been two hours since I had the flourish mango 150 milligram edible and I think I finally found the gummy for me maybe it's too early to tell what just a sample size of one I don't know if anything's different about me but man this gummy it's not perfect I'm not the highest I've ever been at 150 milligrams but I am high I am definitely high which is a lot more than I can say for even 375 milligram gummy add or candy edibles that I've had in the past and certainly higher than that I like how it tasted too I tasted pretty good um I like the packaging and I kind of like the high it's it's it's it's more of like a body sort of high whatever hybrid strain and it's kind of great pretty happy with this I've got another one to review of their 300 milligram errs coming up and I hope it is twice as strong as this one if it is I will be in seventh heaven guys I might have finally found the gummy out there for me whoever recommended the flourish gummies thank you I'm glad I tried this and I am definitely looking forward to giving the 300 milligram a shot as well fingers crossed it's not just an anomaly or a fluke and that these are really the the the real deal in gummy land but I will be sure to review more and let you know for sure guys again I'm excited I'm excited thank you so much for watching this episode here on weeds glad we had a fun result I will check you out on the next review thanks for watching peace pretty good hello and thank you so much for watching wheats if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment below and I'll be more than happy to try to find the product to review it again thanks for watching and we'll check you guys out on the next video", "p6oKnG_sEwc": "[Music] hi welcome to diamond delight edibles my name is Liz if this is the first time you stopped by and for the rest of you guys welcome back thank you so much so somebody asked me a few weeks ago if I could do nerds ropes and to be perfectly honest had no idea what those work so I googled those little puppies and found out that they're a gummy candy covered in nerds who sew off my kitchen I went a little experimented little tickety-boo and look at what up I can make your it's ropes so I am going to bring this recipe to you so without any more in further babbling here let's jump right into those ingredients what we're going to need and then let's get these guys made alright so the ingredients that we're gonna need for our nerd candies so this recipe is basically my W candy recipe with the cooked syrup and the reason that we're using the Kochs syrup is is going to help with those candies to stick better than just using the gelatin one so with that set you're gonna need about three or four boxes of the large nerds or about seven or eight of those small ones that are the two flavored ones you're gonna want one to two boxes of cornstarch and don't worry you can reuse it we just sift it up and you can reuse it over and over and it doesn't go bad so not a problem plus it's not expensive you're going to want two boxes of the small gelatin the three amps or the 85 grams two of those want three tablespoons of unflavored gelatin or three or three packages of the Knox a quarter teaspoon of kaurav cannabutter and we're going to melt this 1/2 a cup of either kanna syrup corn syrup or you can use inverted syrup if you don't like invert sugar if you don't like corn syrup and we're going to split that quarter in our gelatin part quarter in our candy syrup we're going to need 1/2 a cup of we're going to need 1/2 a cup of liquid so I like to use the kool-aid jammers or the kool-aid waters ones because it gives it extra flavor than just using water and it's pretty much like using water so you don't have to worry about things going bad so these are great to use so I'm going to use use a half a cup of this to bloom our gelatin and a half a cup for our mixture then for additional flavoring I know I feel I know these could be a little bit difficult to get is I use two tablespoons of drink crystals so I get these at the bulk barn Jurek from spring onwards they have me during spring in the summer during the winter they don't carry them or other box stores the stores may carry them otherwise you can just use the Lorena's oils if you want to add some additional flavoring but it's not really required because of all the nerds on it so it's not that big of a deal and that's everything that we need for the gelatin part for our cooked syrup we need 1 K 1 cup of sugar and again if you've got candace sugar you can divide that up a quarter cup of can of sugar to three quarters of a cup of regular sugar as long as you equal one cup of sugar it doesn't matter a quarter cup of water and a quarter cup of our corn syrup and or kit canister that's it for our syrup oops sorry and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid goes into our cooked syrup as well then for the glue that they that they used to stick on top technically they're nerds the Nerds use confection confectioners glaze unfortunately being in Canada wasn't the easiest for me to get but an alternative for an edible glue and glaze is to use tylose tylose powder and water so I'm going to show you how to do that and this is what you're going to need to this stuff a day before but it's super easy it just happens that time to do whatever it needs to do but it works great if you can't get the confectioner's late and for and then to make our clear to make our edible glue we're also going to need one cup of water that is all the ingredients that we are going to need let's get into that equipment there so there's a little bit of equipment this time so let's get into that equipment and then let's get these made alright so the equipment that we're going to need is a double boiler if you don't have a quote double boiler you can always just use a metal bowl that will fit securely into the pot and has enough room on the bottom for water without touching you're gonna need another small or saucepan a small medium saucepan for our syrup point you need a candy thermometer digital or the one that you hang on doesn't matter a couple of spatulas gonna need you're gonna need a pastry brush and I'm gonna use a funnel for putting it into our molds you can get these candy funnels or if your pot has the little specks on it and that will work as well or you can always put it into a measuring cup or something with a spout anything to make it easier to pour cause we gotta pour into some skinny guys offset spatula is something to be able to smooth out our corn starch and you're going to want to get some dowels so I got these at the dollar store in the craft section they're 12-inch by just slightly under a half inch size dowel so you want about half inch sized dowel by about 12 inches as I said dollar store craft stores usually how these pre-cut like so otherwise you cannot just buy one of those read it on once and cut up your own so we need basically one if you can is many has many dowels as you want to make ropes now this recipe probably makes around 10 to 12 I'm only going to do part of that today and the rest of the stuff I'm just gonna make regular gummies and I'll explain why when we get to making them all so if you want a bunch of those dowels a cookie sheet or doing them on and you want to line it with parchment paper another pan that we can use to press down the cornstarch with or something flat that's that's kind of heavy a drying rack and then another pan or something that you can use and we're going to put Phillip put the skittles in to cover them up later on once we get the glue on them so it makes it easy if you've got some kind of pan like that so basically all our equipment you know me I always forget something but let's jump right in and let's get these made so if you go and I'm using the tylose powder as your glues your edible glue what you're going to want to do is to bring one cup of water to a boil once it's come to a boil turn the heat off and then we're going to add in three-quarters of a teaspoon into into our boil water you're gonna whisk that around and you're gonna see it's gonna lump up and it's not all gonna dissolve it takes about 15 to 20 minutes for it to fully dissolve all right so my water's come to a boil I'm going to turn off the heat gonna remove that oh remember that thing that I always tell you I forget yeah it was the whisk one whit so we're gonna add in three-quarters of a teaspoon these are quarter teaspoons you want to kind of story sprinkle it around like so and then you're gonna whisk it and it's gonna stay lumpy a little bluffing like that for a while and every couple every two three minutes you're gonna come back and whisk it around and you'll notice every time you come back more and more will be dissolved and as I said it takes about 15-20 minutes for it to fully dissolve once it has you're going to put it into the refrigerator sorry you're gonna let it cool first then put it into the refrigerator overnight and the next day you're good to go and it lasts for up to six months so you can use this over and over not as well as for your any other projects edible food products projects that you have that you need glue fork so I'm just gonna continue to do that to stir that I'll show you once it is clear and next we're gonna make up our starch molds alright so here's my tylose my edible glue all clear now and dissolved so just gonna pour it into a jar and once that's cool I'm gonna cover that up put it in the fridge overnight alright so now we're gonna make our starch folds and starch molds are what they use in candy manufacturing so there's not a whole bunch of people on the line pop and they've silicone molds they use these huge place with corn starch they stamp in the pattern fill up the molds once they set the plate opens all the candies fall in Iraq all the corn starch falls to the bottom and they reuse it so we're going to make our own makeshift version at home so as I said you need about one to two boxes depending how large betray your you see because you do want it almost look for sickness of your cookie sheet whatever lip on that so carefully pour it into your pan and you want to do it on parchment paper because it's going to make it a lot easier when you need to put this back into the box as well as to get it thin too sifting and again you want to be very careful otherwise it's going to look like Scarface's come through your kitchen this stuff it gets messy again you want to carefully move it an offset spatula works really well so that you can move it and spread it out around your pan evenly so I'm just moving it around here so that is all trying to get it relatively all even so that our moles will all be about the same size and you want to have enough room as I said to be able to make them a little bit deeper there and you don't want to be going all the way to the bottom so once you've got it relatively smooth out gonna Mimi and stuff everywhere so what we want to do is to take another little piece of parchment paper and you want it to be able to fit over top doesn't all stick to our pan place it down on top and then use your pan to press down don't press down too firmly but a little bit just to get that compressed and the parchment will stop of the cornstarch from sticking to the bottom of your pan in defeating the purpose of trying to make a flat surface carefully pick this up so we're good like that there so now you want to take your dowels and that's why I said you want to try and have as many as you as you were going to make because your we're gonna press it down so you take the one with a your dowel and you press one down and rock it back and forth so that it makes a little bit of a wider crevice here or so it makes a little wider it up a little bit wider of a trench and then just leave it and then use your next one just go over a little bit button in half an inch or an inch and again you're gonna do the same thing gently press and work it down so the reason you say you want to use multiple dowels is if I go and I take this out if I took it out and push the next one in it pushes some of the cornstarch into the one that we just made so the multiple dowels will help you from avoiding that problem so I'm just gonna pull the camera in over top here so you can actually see it up close all right so it's that you just go over a little bit here from the other one about an inch is good and just gently roll it into place now if you don't have as many inch you're going to like you can see like I'd oh I'm now gonna take my first one so grab it from end to end with your fingers like so so that you don't interrupt your Bowl and now I can move that one there without interrupting that one and then the same thing carefully take this one and here how're we gonna get one of our box the Nerds I've just put them into a bowl or something for you to make it easy we're gonna fill up our little trenches here with our nerd on here a bowl here no jar from a bowl today and just grab some with your fingers and gently drop them fill out the trench chair you just gonna drop them along the bottom don't fully fill it up we just want to line the bottom of it and then anywhere where there's naked spots that we miss don't worry cuz we're gonna glue glue bunch on afterwards so going along do that my trenches removing the dowels grab them use your fingertips in the end to gently pull them up then once you're done filling up your molds there with nerds you're going to carefully place the tray into your freezer so we're gonna make our mold nice and cold nice and cold so when we drop our candy syrup it's gonna start to solidify and grab onto those candies really quickly but you want to be very very gentle because it'll fall easily and yeah you don't want to do this all over again so first case scenario you make a mess him if you have to redo it just to sift out your cornstarch and your nerds and just redo the process so the first thing that we want to do is bloom our gelatin so I've got 1/2 cup of and this has got to be cold but liquid needs to be called 1/2 cup of our I use the kool-aid jammer and then you're gonna sprinkle evenly on your gelatin all over the top and this is to prevent clumping and then you want to mix it in until it's all dissolved and while you're mixing it'll start to bloom and it should call right automatically kind of go to the texture of applesauce if it doesn't your gelatin is not is not very good it's lost its Jo so you don't want to add a little more or get new stuff so we're just gonna set that off the side until we need it God needs about five at least five ten minutes to bloom so the next step is going to be our gelatin side that we're gonna do you're gonna turn your heat on to medium low you're gonna boil a half a cup of your liquid so I used a half a cup of the cooling water pour that in and you're gonna stir to dissolve your jello and then just note for your double boiler don't forget to put your water in and also you your water should never touch the bottom of your pot so I said you just gonna stir this up until that just starts to dissolve and if you're using flavor drink crystals I this is where all added in as well so it can dissolve at the same time I add about two tablespoons as I said if not you can use the Lorraine's oil and you add that more at the end so we just stir this until it's all dissolved until it until it starts to dissolve then I'm gonna add in our corn syrup and our citric acid now that my syrup is mostly the sugars not have mostly melted I'm gonna add in 1/4 cup of my can of syrup or as I said you can use corn syrup or inverted sugar and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid and the citric acid and the syrup they are both for preventing crystallization well the can of syrups add a little extra but regularly corn syrup or the inverted sugar is to help prevent crystallization so again I'm gonna mix that stir that well until it's all combined and everything's melted together in the meantime make sure your can of butter is melted and you're going to get your hand blender ready to so we're gonna need that shortly and you're gorg um so now that our syrup our gelatin and that everything's dissolved now it's time to add in our can of butter and our corn gum so you're gonna take your melted can of butter throw her in mix that around just a little bit then we're going to use each ordered teaspoon of fargo and you're going to spread gently sprinkle it try and do sprinkle it evenly over the top please let it sit for just a moment get your hand blender and we're going to blender up [Music] so you're gonna let that blend that up for about probably about two minutes you want to make sure it's something it's a really wild ball supply then once you're done just let it sit for a couple of minutes for about a minute or two and see if any oil comes to the top raises to the surface and you'll be able to tell that the air the bubbles will start to dissipate and if there's any oil if it's not fully emulsified the oil will come up to the top and you will notice kind of little oil slicks if you do see any kind of little oil slicks just add a little bit more Gorica no more than about an eighth of a teaspoon and re blended with the hand blender until that's gone so you should have one uniform texture and then just turn off the heat on your gelatin mixture here there is enough warm water in in your pot here to keep your mixture liquefied now on to the candy side the candy syrup side so for our cooked syrup you're going to add in your one cup of sugar or I said or your mixture of sugar and can of sugar get add in a quarter cup of our can of syrup or corn syrup as I said use that inverted sugar and our quarter cup of water and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid mix those together and you can turn your heat on to high heat so you're just going to continue to mix stir this until it begins to boil once it starts to boil you're gonna stop stirring that and we're gonna cook it till two hundred and eighty degrees so now that it started boiling just do it's just start it just around the sides here I'm gonna stop stirring at this point and then I'm just gonna check my temperatures every once in a while till we hit two hundred and eighty degrees so I'm gonna need to check it right now because obviously we're not going to be there I'm gonna let it boil for a couple of minutes and then I'll check its temperature so I start my syrup has been boiling for a couple of minutes so I just want to see where it's sitting right now because we only use a quarter cup of water and we're cooking a high temperature it will get to the 280 very quickly so already at 270 almost there just after 2-3 minutes 280 once it hits your temperature pull it off and allow it to cool for until it hits about 240 so why I like to set it on a stone on natural stone like granite or any natural stone it helps to pull the heat out thicker or if you've got a trivet that helps as well so said just let that sit until it hits 240 all right so my temperature my syrup now is at the correct temperature it's down below just below 240 so now I'm going to and the reason you want to do that is if it's higher it's going to break your gelatin so we don't want to do that so now we are going to pour our gelatin syrup into our candy syrup if that well mixed well together and if you found that your candy syrup has solidified on the bottom or along the sides you can put it on to low heat just to melt that so you're just going to mix this for about a minute or two till they're both combined and make sure to get right on the sides it does like to harden up there see and once everything is all nice together and all melted well together we're going to treat our unflavored gelatin and I recommend kind of break it up into smaller pieces if you can plop her in there see this way again your syrup is not going to be too hot to break your gelatin and this way we get the gelatin all through everything kind of binds there both of those together so you're just going to gently stir that until the gelatin is completely melted so now here's a way that you can kind of give a kind of little pretest to know if your syrup is going to gel up well because on gummies were okay because we can always read about those but these a little harder having all the Nerds stuck to them so we want to get it right the first time just take your syrup take your spoon and allow it to drip off if it starts to solidify in midstream like it'll start to solidify and gel right up while it's dripping you're good to go if it continues to drip like mine is it's going to need more gelatin so what I'm going to do to make sure that that's going to work is I'm going to add another tablespoon of blooms gelatin so I'm just going to go bloom another tablespoon of gelatin in a quarter cup of liquid let that bloom and then add that in and that will take care of that problem there all right so I added one tablespoon of unflavored gelatin to a quarter cup of my cooling water and I bloom that for about five minutes and added it in and now you can see how much it's thicker and how it'll start to solidify find a mid stream and it'll it'll hold there that's how you should that's a kind of a quick test for you to be able to see if it's going to gel up correctly in your moles before you actually cast them so now we wait to pour it into my little funnel here well shoot and then just line up with your trench and you're just gonna fill up the trench I have to say this funnel makes it really really easy well I needs you then try to free pour it let's go just go along you fill up all your little trenches little cavities and then you take your Nerds actually found it's easier to pour and break from the box so don't bother putting them in a bowl it's just easier to pour them from the box just take off a little lip there so it doesn't get your way and just kind of squeeze it together so you have a little bit of control it'll all come flying out and then you just fill up the box alone and you just want to be gentle with it go easy because otherwise they'll come flying out and don't worry about all the excess that goes off into the cornstarch there we're gonna sift the cornstarch when we're done and we'll be able to retrieve all those I just give it a very very gentle pat you don't look like literally just feather touch it down there you go so we've got our ropes like that so you're gonna put them into the fridge for them to set up anywhere from about a half hour to two hours it can take for your gelatin to set now that our candies have set you're just gonna take them out of the starch mold here and just lay them on to a harsh line drying rack parchment paper drying rack and you're gonna set those out to dry overnight and I'm putting the start my topside is good with the amount of candies and stuff that are on it so I'm gonna I lay them with the starch side up and that's the main side that I'm gonna add any additional candies to that they need you the sec so I'm gonna let those set stay out overnight for them to dry before we apply our glaze all right so now why are candies for setting so you don't want to waste all that cornstarch and all those nerds that are stuck in there so you grab your um your corn starts with your parchment paper inches pull it up like so take a strainer take a strainer and pour it in a little neater than that and you're gonna slip your parchment paper paper back underneath and sift it back onto the parchment once you got all that all the cornstarch sifted through just drop your candies off into a hole here and then you can get your cornstarch box add your parchment again or back in the box and you're cute most of it and once your candies are dry take them off and just slip your parchment paper underneath it's just gonna catch the excess gonna catch the excess glaze so I've done this recipe a couple times using the tylose so I would recommend out of the two I would recommend going with the glaze and the reason is the tylose because we use water it makes them very well make sure candies very wet it does dry completely and that's not a problem but they are very wet they're very sly mean it makes them difficult to kind of work with and sticking the extra candies on so I think the glaze would be a lot better this you can definitely use if you can't get the glaze but I think they set the glaze would be better so a little bit so what you can do is you're going to grab your pastry brush dip her in and just kind of take off a bit of that access and you're going to go along and you're gonna dab it on your candies on your rope and you want to dab it you don't really want to brush because it will take the color off of the nerves their wallet water soluble so I think again using the glaze would help that with that issue once you get it get it blazed on you can fill in the little spots that are miss then just gently put them on and don't try and bustle it too much because I said it'll just kind of slip and slide off but just leave them like so and again we're just gonna dab that on and you don't get one they're wet you don't want to move them because if your ropes can fall apart they can break apart so but I said once they're dry they're really they're good so I know before I said okay we could use a pan to roll them in I found that method didn't work so well because I said after one or two it gets really wet and it makes it difficult to roll in so I found just pouring the freight from the box but is not the best method once you're happy with that that me and again you're gonna let those dry probably about 12 hours to overnight once they're dry they're good to go do not store your candies in ziplock baggies if it's especially for gummies it's not good you either want to store them in glass jars or in cell bags or the miler Ziploc bags those work really well so instead I'm gonna let those puppies dry overnight and I'll show you the finished product and here's our finished product so check them out look I hope they look just like the real things as I said we don't have live here so I don't hundred percent sure but looks like it from the pictures it looks like a lot of fun alright guys so I hope you enjoyed that recipe if you have any other questions or comments please don't hesitate to put them you know where and thank you so much for joining me today you have an awesome rest of your day [Music]", "F_UtiHIcRCM": "hi guys welcome back to my channel if you are new here hello my name is elish it is lovely to meet you i hope you're having a wonderful day in today's video i'm going to be talking all about diet products and my personal issues with them and the problems that i believe come along with diet products so my main issue with diet products is that you do not need them at all they're just a really good way to burn money and not fat i can confidently tell you that you don't need to take appetite suppressants count your calories or any other crazy diet products to lose weight and be healthy you can do it all intuitively your body is incredibly smart it lets you know when it's craving certain things some days it's hungrier some days it's less hungry it likes to tell you what it wants and what it needs all you need to do is learn to understand these signals and be able to address them if you want to make any dietary changes i would highly recommend visiting a dietitian or a nutritionist not a health coach or an online personal trainer because although these people do want to help you with good intentions they do want to see you become fitter and healthier they don't have the formal education or the qualifications to be giving you personalized nutritional advice and they're probably using a lot of anecdotal experience to give you food advice and that might not be the right thing for you whereas nutritionists and dietitians have been professionally trained to give you the best personalized nutritional advice for your personal body and health i just wanted to leave a little disclaimer here that i am not prescribing advice to any of you guys watching this this is just purely to share information and also provide entertainment with that being said let's get into the video like i said at the beginning of the video my main issue with diet products is that they're just a very expensive waste of money my second issue with diet products is that they can be incredibly dangerous and using them correctly or incorrectly can have really long-term negative health impacts down the line and my third issue with diet products is that they just promote diet culture and extreme weight loss and all of these awful things that just it needs to be stopped it needs to be ended and i hate it so much so this is why i'm making these videos i guess you do not need to diet you do not need to train a certain way you do not need to eat a certain way you do not need to look a certain way all you need to do is eat a balanced diet of whole foods which leave you feeling good happy and healthy and that leave you feeling really energized and fueled for your day-to-day life diet products sell quick fixes and promote diet culture while spraying on your lack of nutritional knowledge and also your insecurities diets are lifelong and what i mean by this is that diet culture has brainwashed you into thinking that you need to gain weight lose weight slim down tone up exercise this way exercise that way eat a certain diet this month eat a different diet the next month and basically change what you're doing to your body constantly a diet should keep you at a nice comfortable healthy weight for your body all the time whilst having no restriction whilst eating in moderation and just feeling comfortable happy and healthy it should literally be something that is second nature you don't have to think about it you should be getting in everything you need and listening to what your body wants as opposed to restricting and feeling hungry and then going back and binging etc so i'm going to delve into some diet hacks and some diet products and explain why they're bad and why you don't need them but i'm not going to name any brands or any names because i don't want a lawsuit you can connect the dots but i'm not going to say nothing i'm going to start with a theoretical appetite suppressant lollipops these are typically around 50 pounds for a packet of 30 lollipops which is a 30 day supply if you have one a day to curb your one a day hunger because you're only hungry once a day and they contain clinically proven ingredients meaning that some of the ingredients may have been clinically tested but the product itself hasn't been proven to work or not and obviously you're very inclined to want to trust a product that says it has been clinically tested because that sounds great it's been trialled it's been proven so surely it works well i had a little research i had a little look into this clinical trial i looked into a couple of clinical trials actually and they all seemed to have been paid for by the company that produces the ingredient itself so they were paying for a trial to see if their own product worked for those who don't know just because research has been published and certain results have been found doesn't actually mean that the research was accurate or that the results that have been published are accurate a lot of the time companies will pay good good money to get the results that they want published so they could just pay for the trial to happen and have any kind of results wrote down it's also worth noting that i couldn't find how much of this like magic ingredient was in each lollipop it didn't show how many milligrams or grams was actually in the product so they could claim it has this ingredient in but only have a teeny tiny amount so you pay in like loads of money for something which actually is negligible in the product yeah so i think that actually suppressing your appetite in the first place is completely unnecessary our bodies tell us they're hungry because they're hungry and after something they want to be fed so if you're suppressing that natural signal from your body i don't believe that is a good thing i don't think it's a good thing at all but i do actually have some proven tips for satiety and kind of hunger signals that are free and not damaging to your health my first tip is to eat balanced meals that are full of volume foods what i mean by this is every meal try and get your fats your proteins and lots of low calorie vegetables that you can just pile up on your plate so you're eating a lot of food you'll feel fuller for longer and you're also getting everything your body needs because your body always wants fat it always wants protein always wants carbs so you're making sure they got everything so that your body doesn't feel hungry like it's missing something out you know one that is quite simple but you might sometimes forget is to just have a big old drink of water because a lot of the time you are just thirsty you're not actually hungry my third tip is to not eat any food in front of the tv or whilst you're preoccupied especially if you struggle with hunger because your brain and body are very naughty and they will ignore the satiety signals that are sent when you're full even if you've got half a plate of food left because you're already concentrating on something else so if you concentrate on your food you can listen to your body signals bad and lastly it might be worth considering some kind of fasting as some studies have shown eating your meals in a shorter window of time can control blood sugar levels and also your satiety hormones which could really help with your hunger remember this is not me prescribing you any advice if you do need personalized advice go and find a nutritionist and dietitian and ask for their professional opinion and next up is weight loss shakes god i hate these so much they contain all of your daily nutrients and vitamins and protein and they're only 200 calories and you're gonna lose loads of weight yay like i said in my previous video your body needs calories and energy to function you could not drive a car without petrol in the fuel tank so do you think that your body will be able to function without any fuel in its tank the answer is no a lot of these meal replacement shake and weight loss shake companies advertise for you to replace between one and three meals a day with these shakes because they will provide you with everything you need to be skinny so if you were to replace three of your meals for three meal replacement shakes that would take you to a daily calorie intake of 600 calories which is not enough to feed a one-year-old baby in case you're curious about how many calories a one-year-old baby needs to function and grow it's one thousand so i'm kind of unsure as to why so many of these weight loss companies are recommending you eat less calories than a one-year-old baby if you are not into looking at the nutritional labels on the back of food products i strongly recommend you start why elish why should i do that well i had a little research and had a look at quite a lot of brands um i think i looked at five different weight loss shake meal replacement shake brands and had a look at the nutritional content of all of their products and they all seem to have around 20 grams of sugar per serving in the uk the daily recommended intake of refined sugar is 30 grams which is about five percent of your daily caloric intake just one of these shakes has 66 of your daily recommended refined sugar intake a packet of dairy milk buttons has 17 grams of sugar and a yazoo milkshake also has 17.8 grams of sugar these healthy and nutritious meal replacement shakes are genuinely likened to products which are known and accepted to not really be that healthy for you and to be products that you should consume as part of a balanced diet in moderation whilst meal replacement shakes are recommended to be consumed daily if not multiple times per day by consuming these products you are spiking your blood sugar three times every year and every time you do it your body sends a signal to the pancreas like hey buddy sugar levels are getting pretty high so your pancreas scores don't worry about that i'm just going to shoot out some insulin and that'll sort out the insulin turns the blood sugar glucose into usable energy around the body so that you can function but if there is too much blood sugar and energy for your body's needs it has to store it somehow and it stores this energy in fat cells as fat so if you want to do a one week weight loss plan with these meal replacement shakes you're having 60 grams of sugar every day and yes you're in a calorie deficit but you're probably gaining fat and you will be losing weight but that's only due to less water retention because you've got less calories in your body and less carbs than you would have beforehand in addition humans are predisposed to absolutely loving sugar we are addicted to sugar we love and thrive off sugar because it sends dopamine and serotonin to our brain so you can become addicted to the feeling of these drinks you can't think oh these diet drinks are making us feel a lot better and they're really helping this with me wait when it's all just a mind trick obviously you're gonna want to have something that's sending dopamine signals to your brain these products also claim that they are full of vital nutrition basically every single vitamin and mineral under the sun but all of the ingredients have been chemically processed so that you're feeding your body an ultra high process product where the absorption rate of the vitamins and minerals probably isn't even worth it supplements should be a last resort they are literally there to supplement your diet not be the entire composition of your diet generally for the most part for most people you can get absolutely everything you need from your food if you have a nice healthy balanced diet my last point about meal replacement shakes is that a lot of these brands aren't very well regulated especially in america brands can get away with lying about what's in their products we can also get away with not disclosing some of the ingredients so you might not know that you're eating something because they haven't put it on the ingredient list which i think is very naughty and yeah just not good it's not worth it next we have skinny tees which boosts your metabolism and also detox and cleanse your body that's just a fancy term for expensive waste of money these products are all usually based around green tea which you can buy from asda for one pound to get 32 bags or you could buy one of these teas for 30 pounds for 30 tea bags green tea supposedly speeds up your metabolism and this is due to its caffeine content both coffee and energy drinks also have a lot of caffeine in them too the effect that these products have on your metabolism is incredibly negligible especially if you're using them to lose weight without having addressed or changed your diet in the first place in addition consuming too much caffeine can be incredibly harmful to your body and i feel like these products promote an excess excessive consumption of caffeine and that is all for this video i hope you enjoyed my second episode of food for thought let me know what you thought in the comments give me a topic for a new video in the comments as well what would you like to see from this series thank you so much for watching and i'll see you in my next [Applause] [Music] video [Music]", "d2znw-FjhME": "[Music] hello this is Jamie and I am with edibles led and I'm Patrick I am also with edibles list today we're making lemonade not just any lemonade but in used lemonade using as Rossum cars called magical th see startups power this is one of the easiest ways to infuse drinks because its water soluble is just malko dextran it's involved in any warm pre-prepared already made our own simple syrup yes simple syrup just sugar stardust powder and hot one alright and then tell us about start us yes every packet is 15 milligrams of THC and it is gluten-free and vegan is the multi dextran powder it's one of the easiest ways that you can infuse pretty much anything with THC it goes great in coffee tea or soup but you can also mix it with a little hot water and then once it dissolves you can add it to anything you can pour it over a salad with a dressing you can infuse an oil and vinegar dressing with it put it in oatmeal put it on your stereo also you do a lot yeah I mean it's you can infuse pretty much any food since waited that easy is weighted so we're going to go ahead and continue we've actually started to juice some of the fresh lemons that we actually got out of our garden fresh squeezed lemon juice we're pretty excited friends I am through the classic way to celebrate summer making lemonade outdoor in the shade hello Memorial Day is to Felix away normal days coming up Pride Month for comic I north of July Arbor Day and all right hey guys this is Jamie and Patrick with metals list Cheers thanks so much tune in [Music] Oh [Music]", "FnneSRmwloM": "[Music] howdy friends and welcome to weeks the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and today I am coming to you with a product from my favorite company out there Kanak oh yes that's right Kanak Oh has taken the crown from kirova to be my favorite edible company on planet Earth as of this moment I hope to find somebody I like more but it's gonna be a tough tough road now that being said I actually come to you with this Kanaka with some reservations for the first time not because anything Kanaka has ever done but something that Korova once did and that was their salted caramel blondie this is the salted toffee blondie I generally like salted kind of blondie things but that kirova thing to beat a dead horse over and over and over and over and over and over and over was really bad so I'm a little apprehensive I hope that this is good I hope this is like all of their Kanaka products but the couple one was an anomaly as well so who knows maybe I just have tastebuds attuned to hating these but I come in with an open heart and an open mind because it is canna Co and I am optimistic but there is a little apprehension also if you've never tuned in two weeks before the way our reviews work is I'm going to eat this salted toffee blondie excuse me forgot the name there for a moment and then I'll come back to you guys in about two hours or so to let you know how I'm feeling because that is actually the most important part of the edible review not so much how it tastes but more how it makes you feel so I'm gonna go ahead and shut up open this bad boy up in their premium canna Co packaging got to love that packaging but look at that made on 620 117 pretty fresh all right it's green packaging here to let you know that it is only the 250 milligrams righty if it were yellow that would be signed to run cuz that's the 500 milligram one and that'll put you in your grave not that this won't do its kind of damage the 250 milligrams are pretty potent in and of themselves looking forward to it immensely in terms of potency so let's go ahead and open it up and give her a bite here she is chocolate drizzle little toffee chips on the top take a bite well I'll tell you this Rev the bet it's orders of magnitude better than Corollas and well it's not my favorite can of co-product it is far from bad and not something I'm gonna regret eating mmm that it's not bad that is not bad at all I had nothing to fear I had nothing to fear I should have should have gone with my instincts all along she understand that Kanaka was going to we're gonna pull me through alright guys well I'm a polishes style I will see you in about two hours to let you know how I'm feeling so I will see you then peace hi guys welcome back two weeks it's been two hours since I had the salted toffee blondie from canna Co that has 250 milligrams of THC and I am very baked i am super super high right now oh my god another winner from canna Co got a minute it's not my favorite of theirs in terms of flavor I get I just don't like salted Blondie's I guess that's just not for me although this one is a lot better than Corvis I mean lightyears ahead of it it's just leave my least and it's not by any means it's just my least favorite product I've had from Kanaka so far but if you like this salted Blondie's give it a shot you'll probably love it me I loved how it made me feel for sure though which is the most important part because again I am super high I just got back from a huge walk still feel like I'm on the moon could not be happier with the results of this one so again another winner from canna Co if you see the salted toffee blondie at your dispensary and you like salted Blondie's go ahead and grab it you'll you'll probably like it however if you've never had one before and you see a different can of co2 50 go for that you'll probably be happier at least I am but again this is not bad so guys that's gonna do it for this review here on wheats thank you so much for watching and we will see you on a future review peace that was pretty good hello and thank you so much for watching wheats if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you

the morning but which I don't like but I feel like this is gonna be a really good high so I wanna like have it last the majority of the day instead of like taking it like later in the afternoon then falling asleep like halfway through the high or some [ __ ] I don't know got these for $25 from the not from like directly from a dispensary but from a friend of mine so yeah there's a pretty good price I think if you were to go to like a dispensary or something they usually charge $10 per hundred milligrams so kind of a good deal but yeah I'll show you these guys again know if you can see right down there 500 milligrams yeah 500 huh so yeah let's dig in so that's pretty cool just like I don't know little sour patch kids they don't look quite the same the sugar is kind of weird it looks wet and another thing it says on the back here five servings per container serving size one piece but there's like just way more than five pieces in that I don't know if you guys can see but we're taking doesn't taste like weed at all it's a lot better than that nerd rope I had that [ __ ] was like I don't think I like nerds I don't know but I did eat like a banana like I think an hour or 45 minutes ago just to sort of like activate my metabolite I don't know but oh yeah and something else I forgot like I figured like people would just figure did I do it that way but like I keep like I got a lot of comments on the last one I did like the nerd rope the nerd rope 400 milligram edible I think it was there were a lot of people that like just thought that video was like one video or like one time I think like I just got a bunch of like comments that were like you know edibles take longer than 10 minutes to hit and I was like well you really think I've like a weed Tube channel and I don't know the edibles don't hit immediately after you eat them so I mean I don't know I mean but just this isn't gonna be the whole video like I'm gonna check back in like an hour two hours whenever I start like really feeling high and that's gonna be me then later so alright cleared the whole bag we're out of these shits so I'm gonna check in and like last like an hour maybe two hours maybe three hours however long this takes to take effect yeah I'm gonna take one more head of this [Music] little baby hit but yeah I'll check back in with you guys about two hours or so so peace alright so check him back in guys it is now 2:30 so it's been about three or four hours and I am [ __ ] high I'm so high like I just feel like good and like cozy like I don't know in movies right now I'm on yes

pretty good about him at least right now edible you know just kind of chill cuz yesterday I got like I drank so much like an I passed out I'm so tired and I threw up it was just like a horrible day so this just yeah it's a lot nicer everything like I don't know everything I look at like specifically focus on like looks very like clear and like clean but then everything else behind it is it like such an intense like a blur well yeah I'm just really chilling you know like this I like I said this is definitely a [ __ ] fire edible I [ __ ] with this i 100% recommend it but I'm other than that I have no idea what to talk about I kind of just want to know getting my [ __ ] back get in my bed and watch this movie so yeah I'll take one last rep I haven't been smoking too much we're hiding actually I had a couple reps of this like I think three hours in or so not too long ago he's dying but I did that because I was like kind of feeling the body high a little bit but I was just like nervous that it wasn't gonna be intense enough for whatever reason sometimes he sings some like a [ __ ] hit or miss but yeah so I smoked and then I like got really high and yeah I think I'm like getting maybe close to like the full effect I don't know how long this will last but I think usually the potent ones are the more potent the longer it lasts so maybe it's still building up but either way I'm just trying to chill out so I hope you guys are smoking I hope you guys enjoyed the video [ __ ] sour patch dummies stay high stay lifted stay quarantine stay clean and peace everybody", "Qqm0eS5nKmw": "okay so in my current attempt to worry less and experiment more I'm coming out of a sixteen and a half hour fast into this is a candy bar with a hundred milligrams of THC see how it is okay so when you finally wrestle with the childproof packaging which is also micro proof you get this it's a pretty little gold bar it's pretty being that this is the first carbs I've had in a few days it's actually really good you actually don't get a hint about cannabis flavor and who raped you oh no how far hundred milligrams are gonna take me cuz I believe I have a pretty high dollar okay so it has been one hour since I had my candy bar and while I wouldn't say that I feel high I I feel good there's definitely an edge gone a little bit of a body low I'm very uh positive okay now it has been to two hours since I ate my candy bar and now yeah I'm high I'm very tingly and they calm my body weighs a lot it turns out that 100 milligrams just write him out for me okay it has now been three hours since I ate my candy bar now I'm feeling just absolutely fantastic you'll notice the we're on the road because we've had to go buy 20 cheeseburgers I love you okay so 100 milligram bar we're probably five six hours now when I lost count awesome I really think I could even help my dosage coolest thing about all this is just the availability of something like this it was $25 at the dispensary the fact that something like that exists at the dispensary that you can go to the store and buy weed is just a mind-boggling world I'm glad we live in it until next time", "GopidLYktQA": "and in our Health Alert tonight nine students in Florida hospitalized after eating marijuana infused candy apparently a student inadvertently brought the THC candy to school mistaking the product for a popular sour candy our chief health editor dr. partha nany joins us now with more on what happened and how those kids are doing now doc thanks Alan well first of all the students injuries were not life-threatening the kids were between ages 10 and 12 and were sent to the ER because they were having stomach pains but this is still a warning for parents who have edible marijuana products in their home if the packaging and the candy or treat inside resembles any products that kids are familiar with then they're more likely to see it as normal food and be tempted to eat it unfortunately these types of accidental poisonings are on the rise so dr. nany why does food prompt more overdose incidents well Glenda edibles often have several times the recommended dose of THC now t-h-e is this psychoactive ingredient in marijuana yet the edibles take a longer time to kick it me that you won't feel the effects right away so oftentimes people end up eating even more of the drug as for kids they can experience severe effects like trouble breathing loss of coordination altered perceptions panic paranoia and heart problems all bad things all bad things for sure doc so when kids overdose what are the long-term effects super important question Alan and honestly I don't have a good answer for you because acute marijuana exposure on children has not been systematically studied so there's no research or science findings regarding the full effects so it's super important that anyone who has kids in their homes keep edibles and all types of marijuana products out of reach and out of sight they should also be kept in child resistant packaging that also contains the the way so that it seals it conceals the contents rather so it can't be seen and please don't consumes the edibles in in front of the kids because we need to keep them safe we do dr.

Nandi dot-com or send it to us on Facebook or Twitter we'll get it right to him", "zoshAm3-szc": "good afternoon everyone as you know I have the best superintendent in the entire United States with me today Jacqui bird and we're here together once again to talk about the great response from the school board and what happened because 12-year olds did things that they shouldn't have done and here's what it amounts to yep this is marijuana it's gummies it comes in a block it's about a hundred milligram block and this hundred milligram block is supposed to be torn in two Tim individual doses of THC laced gummies now once again I'm not gonna elaborate on the fact that I warned all of this was coming these gummies are produced in California and they're sold online and Leviticus Jones who's 12 years old came into possession of this package of gummies which is about so big Leviticus has told us a couple of different stories about how he can't became involved with possessing this but be that as it may we're working with him his parents are totally cooperating and understand the gravity of the situation so Leviticus comes to school today claiming that he got these this gummy that he tore in two pieces from someone else on a school bus that's still to be determined during second period which is gym class he presented this to a total of six other children in seventh grade I'm told that there were two boys 12 years of age and four girls of the six of them that received a piece of this gummy five of them were transported to the hospital because of an overdose it's easy to figure out six kids a hundred milligram bar that should be into ten separate doses of legal use in California of THC is now distributed the ten dosage between six children we rush them to the hospital with EMS where that are being treated the last child was taken by her parents to the hospital Leviticus will be charged with one count of possession of THC our marijuana resin six counts of distribution of THC within a thousand foot of a school and possession of paraphernalia so it would be seven felony charges and a misdemeanor charge we're fortunate in that the children are all gonna make a great recovery you're going to be all right there's no long term injury or illness here as we understand but obviously we're concerned we're concerned as to one how did a 12 year old ever come to be in possession of this drug this illegal drug in the state of Florida and - why did he offer it to these six kids which quite frankly with the exception of one little corner have apparently devoured this bar they're in gym class so the investigation goes on at this time and we will report the results of that to you let me turn it over to our superintendent and she will give you details about what they did and I just want to brag on the school system their response was remarkable to this emergency whenever it manifested itself at about ten o'clock this morning superintendent Burton Thank You sheriff good afternoon everyone you know again I applaud the staff for what they did when they learned of something happening well students they responded immediately they went by classrooms to check on children they went by and they made sure that they got the children and make sure they make contact and contact it the EM has to come out and take those children to the hospital for you know to make sure they are safe and to make sure they're going to be okay they're all okay but you know the sad part of this is again we could have been here with a different outcome if someone did not respond so I applaud the staff for what they did they follow through with the procedures and the protocols that we have in place and making sure we keep our children safe what I want to say to our parents is that everyone at school today is still safe they'll be safe again tomorrow they're gonna be safe throughout because we do have procedures in place to keep children safe but parents I ask you please talk to your children please make sure we're looking at their online social media if they're buying and purchasing see what it is and then parents talk to your children say if someone is offering you something something that's going on at school that's not normal please let them talk to you and notify us immediately notify the sheriff's office immediately if there's something wrong we want to make sure that everyone is safe when they come to school each and every day so again I applaud not only just our school staff I applaud the Sheriff's Office for making sure that they follow through and making sure that they do what they need to do to protect our children the sheriff and I have a partnership and we have a commitment to keeping our campuses and our children safe at all times you know I can't I don't know the exact symptoms because when they heard about it they they actually went to got the children and they had them transported you know so I don't know the exact symptoms or what they're you know exhibiting at that time because they responded very quickly when they learned of it this is the first time that I'm aware of right now that they can consumed it yes it is legal in California for adults it is not legal it is not legal in the state of Florida in in any way so any possession of this is illegal in the state of Florida and as to their symptoms they had stomachaches they were nauseous dizzy one of them was all but passed out and took obviously way more than the recommended illegal dose by the way fine I'm surprised that I'm finding myself have to talk like that but the bottom line is it's all illegal in Florida and even in California it's illegal for a child habit but when you can go online you know Green Hornet's becomes something that'll sting you and it stung all those kids today I know that Leviticus has it I don't know that he bought it online he's told us at least two different stories of how he came to possess it and we are working through that now so excuse me his parents were totally cooperating with us but obviously they will be working with us on the investigation we're focused on Leviticus at this time we don't have any indication that his parents contributed to this if we determine that then obviously there would be other criminal charges but we don't see that at this time in the investigation his parents have been forthright totally cooperative they they are concerned not only that Leviticus did this but that he exposed these other children so they're concerned about the other children as well and according to Leviticus he didn't take any of this the other kids did but he said he didn't so it's uh it's frightening and fortunately for us it was not some other drug that was more dangerous in small doses than the was even though this was toxic to them in the amounts that they took the other kids have eaten the evidence so to speak so in the in the technical term you could draw blood and then there would be misdemeanor possession but no we're not going to charge the other children they will be dealt with appropriately by their parents and the school system under discipline conduct rules there Leviticus right now is the one we're focusing on but if someone else provided this to Leviticus we want to know because ultimately he's 12 years old so if a 20 year old gave it to Leviticus then our focus is the 20 year old but we've got to work through that during this investigation six six kids and Leviticus is seven okay one child went with her mother five went to the hospital we've not found the one child so we don't know whether or not that child consumed but we're told antidotal II that they did but we've not confirmed that yet Leviticus says he didn't take in at least five for sure maybe the sixth one who we've not talked to we know we know five consumed we suspect the six one consumed five went to the hospital by EMS one written with the parents for six and Leviticus says I provided it ask them if they wanted some and they all tore pieces of the bar off and consumed it and Leviticus is facing seven felony charges in a misdemeanor okay anything else", "_mJYQtsh94Q": "[Music] what's up everybody my name is sarah b and welcome back to the haze today i'm going to be doing another edible review i will be reviewing the chill chocolates bam now these guys are a traditional white chocolate with oreo i believe oreo cookies on the inside at first to be honest i didn't want to try this nothing about this packaging looks new or inventive or really appetizing the the gloss finish on these boxes is not helping it it looks it looks a bit cheap okay i don't want to be that person cheap edibles can be great sometimes but a lot of them are not so i didn't want to try them purely off just the way they looked and then the fact that they are pretty expensive where i found these these guys are 100 milligrams for 22. but i i tried them i did i said why not you know i need to try another new edible something i haven't seen before and these guys were those let me tell you yes it may not look like much but these edibles are delicious they are absolutely fantastic so they come in this small box in the box you will find this box and this box is actually super cool because this box can be used later like i can hold weed in it and stuff at least that was my original thought to do with this box but sadly i cannot open this box at all i'll try to open it right now and it has like a little thing right here to show you how to do it it should just be a squeeze on both sides here there's a little part where you know you put your fingers on and then you're supposed to lift this at the same time it all should pop off it should pop off easy it's for babies not to be able to get into but i'm guessing a lot of stoners can't get into this at all as well but in that box you will find this bag in this bag you will find your edibles these are the small milk chocolate edibles with cookie crunches inside a lot of the time chocolate edibles i do get a very strong marijuana taste to it these guys i did not at all so kudos to chill you guys made a great tasting chocolate i don't even like white chocolate i'm not someone who goes for white chocolate often it's not something i really enjoy usually it comes off too sweet but these are like fantastic and every one of these small little pieces is 10 milligrams and it comes with 10 of them i took 50 milligrams because i didn't think it would have much of effect to be honest i already was thinking down on this edible i said it doesn't look great it tastes almost a little bit too good i'm gonna eat a little more and 50 milligrams let me tell you this it was bomb if you bump into chilled chocolates buy them because they are bomb i mean usually 50 milligrams i wouldn't be like as blown as i honestly was and it was a good high it was good i wasn't sure what they used for um how to medicate these chocolates but it was very much a body high my body was super relaxed so if you if you suffer from a lot of body aches if you have a lot of back problems like i've been suffering with my back a lot lately these guys are great for that because they're also delicious they're delicious you don't need much of it and they work after my height went away i did get the sleepies though because it is such a heavy body high i do believe once these edibles kind of wear off your body now knows it's time to go to bed and that's what i did i fell asleep super early yesterday so each batch in the back it says is tested three times and let me tell you it is very accurate the milligrams on here was fantastic so if you're looking for something that's easy tasting something good to help you out with some back pains and it's something that's reliable with its strength go to your little dispensary and pick up some chilled chocolates man do it you will not regret it again my name is sarah b thank you so much for watching the haze your guide to a cannabis infused lifestyle and i will catch you guys on the flip side you", "qB3ebFa54v0": "okay so my father-in-law gave me this to try because I suffer from arthritis I have promised with my SI joints the arthritis is in my back and also my shoulder in my neck I have a bulged disc between c4 and c5 the amount of pills that they have tried me on is ridiculous I'm on currently on naproxen 500 I'm on a muscle relaxant you name it I I'm just tired of the pill so I'm gonna try this for the first time and see if this helps at all okay so get off okay so I opened it it is that's here let's see okay like chocolate actually tastes really good so I guess it takes up from 30 minutes to two hours I'll let you know I'll come back and let you know if I feel anything or do I have to take another one let's hope this works okay so um it's been like an hour and I feel something in there my legs a little bit jiggly right now but other than that the pain in my back I will say it's going away like it it's probably still there is just going away like I can't it's not a thumping feeling anymore [Music] so it's like 1 1 square which is 25 milligrams and for me it's working good like downstairs I was thinking I should shut off my phone and restart it but I guess I did and when I went to record this I didn't understand why the phone was turning on and so I just had to I just had to hit the button on the side and wait for it to start up and so that happened at home and my arms really sore from holding this but it's like nice to be pain-free and okay well this is all for now else to tell you that you feel really happy like thinks that you think it sounds like [ __ ] up in your head like you're gonna say it sentence and like I don't know did you say it so um my eyes feel real tingly and my heart I can't feel no gum it's just a little bit scary okay this time that's it only thirsty oh yeah I'm thirsty I feel like I should get into a comfy like a comfy space or a comfy place like the chair or something and don't you sit down there and then I don't know see what happens okay um so one thing I'm noticing too is my eyes are like glossy and I don't like that and there's people in the house all they're probably know something so I'm gonna wait until they come upstairs and when I hear them come upstairs go downstairs and buy it's getting dark out so they'll be see my look okay um so like you get good laughs and stuff like right now I'm trying hitting like a little paranoid I don't know what's up with that but I really think that like I should just say what you know like I'm feeling and then probably I don't know just like sit somewhere like works in darkroom or something or just come upstairs like it bad cuz the heart is like hmm and I feel I should talk like kind of quiet because seems like the thing to do um and you're really like your body seems like it's a really sensitive to everything my back ache it's it's still like I said I don't feel it at all seems like you had a long hey you come home good a squirt of that cuz you feel better from [Music] and it seems like a good thing to I get do cuz you can hide it like you know like some people say Oh going home to have a beer and if you didn't want people to know that you like drink beer you can not say it or um somebody that did this well yeah like somebody calls you oh I'm just having a piece of a chocolate bar see they wouldn't even know which seems pretty smart thing to do my fingers there but oh well because that arm hurts like that's I said some sort of things are sensitive I still haven't had gotten the drink from before some really like I'm and this and then I'll get a drink and sit there with my blanket on and oh yeah like when you walk things too early like like you're walking I'm not saying you're not just like it's not it doesn't feel normal feels like it feels like a little better like they had a key bones in your legs you probably wouldn't feel the achiness okay so it's like now I'm going for real like you know what I probably do this again good thing I only ate one no Jumanji - oh okay may need to call night when one or something cuz you probably get really scared at one point wait I'm scared but I'm like oh like you know if the cops came I would just [ __ ] hide but like if you talk to you you wouldn't you'd be so scared you would even move where you are and then they you know no way you're in there and the house okay so why can't say into next time because what if there is no next time or like Oh smoking chocolate bar number two and Oh like have episodes smoking charcoal smoking another chocolate bar now I don't remember why I say mad cuz it's totally good [Music] I was talking about Chuck burn so like this should probably be a good night adios and I

your friends just subscribe get just subscribe and I like okay", "2VNYCOaQFSY": "[Music] hopefully 71 the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on this web view we are taking a look at the final product to review from a cushy punch their 100 milligram sativa variety flavor is strawberries the strawberry 100 milligram sativa variety of cushy punch we've looked at their 200 milligram TK o which I found to be kind of lacking and then we looked at their 100 milligram indica and in an experiment we also look at the 100 milligram hybrids and I found both of those to be not too bad so I hope that this is on the better end of the cushy punch I hope it's as good as the other two 100 milligrams I found those to be much better than the 200 milligram sort of surprisingly I would just go with 100 milligrams in terms of cost because I think it's about just about as potent as its 200 milligram brother so without further ado let's going to open this up and eat her down and what's gonna happen after that guys after I finish this I'm going to come back to you in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling because that's the most important part about the edible review not necessarily how it tastes but more about how it actually makes you feel so here we go looks like a like a little jam packet or a little jelly packet or a little butter packet it's got four little blocks in there and after we get it plopped out you can see it with its four a little squares but we're going to ignore the little squares there just plug the whole thing in my mouth and one go mmm not bad definitely a little bit of what we taste so much better than the infused creations or the what's the other one I can't remember the name off the top my head but any of those ones that are just like the gummy bears with the basically just like THC oil sprinkled on the outside this is a lot better this is more like the flourish although I don't think it's quite as good as the flourish so now that I've slurped it down I'm gonna wait two hours to see how I'm gonna feel you guys however have to just wait a couple seconds I'll be back right after this break here and I'll let you know how I'm feeling see you then it's been two hours since I had the cushy punch that's the name of it the cushy punch should sieve a hundred milligram THC strawberry flavored gummy here and I gotta say this might be the least hi I've been from one of their hundred milligrams it seemed like the hybrid and the indica hit me more that might just be because I've heard this about um because she punched before that they're not the most consistent some are code and some aren't and that might just be the case with this sativa I'm not not high just more at like four four and a half somewhere in that range instead of the six five and a half six is the other ones so a little bit less than before but again that just might be this particular batch where it might be that sativa doesn't quite hit me as hard but it still is better than my original impressions of could she punch way back when when I had their TKO at the very very beginning I still don't think it would be the first thing I reached for at the dispensary but it won't be the last thing I go for like my opinion used to be so guys that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds I appreciate you watching it as always and we will see you on the next review peace okay", "4lLn0PhkakM": "[Music] [Music] hey guys mr. and mrs. Smith here and today we're going to be reviewing the heavy hitters cannabis infused gummies we have strawberry pineapple to try today we're actually very excited to try these uh if you don't know already heavy-hitters is possibly our favorite brand I would definitely say I would say it's also primarily smoke heavy hitters for our everyday cartridge and then when we want to like it up a little bit we'll grab some other stuff but heavy hitters is definitely always on a cartridge for us so we're also going to be trying the heavy hares GSC I say trying we've had it many times but we haven't been able to find it for a while not what you are it kind of it kind of went out of stock just weird it used to be available a lot in like 2018 but it kind of just fell out of favor except for certain places would still carry a guy in town by our main delivery service was no longer carrying it but they had it the other day so I had to pick it up cause it's been too long it seems like they almost haven't had it in stock since the name change so JSC used to be Girl Scout cookies I don't know if they changed it in others stances I'm pretty sure it was part of the laws that happened I'm pretty sure it's part of the laws that happened in 2018 for California that's they weren't allowed to call it they can't call it candy I believe they can't use the term candy and they can't use the term anything that could be marketed yes towards children can't market towards children right Paul any so that's why it says gummies or it'll always seem medical or cannabis like that they never never make yeah that would be appealing to a child exactly it can't be bears or anything like that so I mean it's a good law honestly I totally understand why there's some other laws that happened in 2018 which I will give you a refresher on right now now there was some weird stuff that happened when California passed a recreational marijuana back in 2018 I believe it was one of the things that happen is towards the middle of the year they actually switched it to where edibles could no longer contain more than a hundred milligrams per package now if you work in the medical marijuana industry or if you were a user or anything like that prior you know that there used to be packages up to a thousand milligrams in just one treat and what that used to be really good at is you could like just take a nibble off of a treat throughout the day and just kind of keep yourself dosed and medicated off one treat for a whole week basically but they changed it because there were way too many people who would come into a dispensary have no idea what they were doing by one of those really high potency edibles eat the whole thing and then they have a really bad time and end up going to the emergency room they got sick of dealing with that so they made a law saying you can't have more than a hundred milligrams per package there are certain things you can get around that such as cannabutter tinctures and pills those three items you can definitely get in higher doses than 100 milligrams but for edibles and then kind of cookie or anything like that max you're gonna get in a package is about a hundred so today we're reviewing B's from heavy hitters and the way they went about with these twenty milligrams per piece is you can actually rip the pieces in half so it's actually two servings per piece so it actually comes in two to ten milligram servings which I'm pretty sure is the law is that each piece inside a package can only be ten milligrams or something like that I know five to ten milligrams is a state recommended serving I'm not a hundred percent clear on the laws but it's just an unfortunate thing that happened with edibles in 2018 but I am absolutely dying to try these guns so let's go ahead and open up to the [ __ ] strawberry cuz I'm Joey it's been it's been a long time looking for out that let me grab the a7 r3 with the 70s [Music] [Music] yeah we just won't have us we won't help you all this video it's just not working at the moment six and a half hours Nathan I might open the pineapple real quick to maybe these do not open well I feel like we should show just how much of a struggle these were to open just like a montage of the [ __ ] difficulty this is bad this one opened much easier but that first package it just ripped in such a way that it was really hard to open but this is just like the other one has a really strong smell I figured it's it's really strong artificial pineapple mmm it's it's kind of a a bit herbal but not like too herbal it's not like overly pungent or anything like that like you're not gonna have you're not gonna get in trouble they're just keeping these in your drawer or anything like that like no one's gonna smell it yeah I don't know if this has any actual like pineapple juice or anything in it it doesn't have it listed on the ingredients mm-hmm so we're not sure if this is artificial flavoring or real bad no artificial actual coloring and flavor so is that natural flavors that display really use the natural coloring and flavor like or is it a flavor that's kind of that's kind of weird I don't know if I feel someone from heavy Harry's modified food yeah I don't mind it I mean that's just what I mean the people are heavy hitters you might want to put that it is natural flavoring as well like actually specified natural color and natural flavoring because natural color and flavoring just sounds a bit odd it's it leaves it up to the imagination as to is the flavoring also natural or just natural color you're always a nice flavoring this yeah always alright so let's try the pineapple yeah I'm gonna do a full 20 but I'm gonna show the camera how it splits so this is the gummies from heavy-hitters it's a square and if you look very carefully there's this little seam in the middle that if you pull whoops it starts to come apart yes it does if you start to pull it comes apart very nicely into two perfectly even ten milligram pieces so let's start well I'm actually just gonna eat the whole thing at once wait so where's our list of like criteria so I know what the hell I'm supposed to be doing bring it up go on top down your mouth and just roll around a little okay yeah my hands are all sticky now you know I gotta say I'm a little disappointed I'm a little underwhelmed actually I had I had much higher hopes it could just be the pineapple yeah because I mean the strawberry definitely smells better than the pineapple the pineapple is a little strong it's kind of it's very herbal forward which isn't a bad thing a lot of people enjoy that it's not a bad flavor necessarily but it is definitely herbal forward if you're looking for something that you could just totally mound shun and forget that there's weed in it not that we recommend it's not gonna be that yeah definitely don't recommend that but I mean like if you're if you're a fan of someone who like Eric or someone who likes really really flavorful very liked gummies that don't aren't bitter or plant alike at all this is not for you this is made to be strong and to be potent and it definitely tastes like it so keep that in mind and next up we have the strawberry so let's go ahead and pop these open and yeah will rate them in a second let's try the strawberry and I want to go ahead and split this one yeah because there'll be 30 milligrams each mmm much better much better mm-hmm all right strawberry is actually really good um I would say it's definitely pretty it is still has that herbal flavor but um let me bring up the criteria so we can actually start to break these down aftertaste yeah yeah really bad yeah I would say it's a bit odd I I'm almost feeling a little bit um disappointed I know me too it which it sucks because I'm such a fan of their oils but that's where comes in would we be as disappointed if we hadn't hyping it up so much yeah we did we we've also we've held on to these for about two weeks we've been waiting and waiting and waiting to try these specifically for the on camera experience and you know I think that also kind of built it up the fact that we've been we've been like dying sitting on me dying to try them the whole time and I mean they're they're good [ __ ] effects for sure by new user mm-hmm will probably like would probably really like it however its strong grams each heavy hitters recommends 10 milligrams as a dose the state of California recommends that california recommends that I personally have very low tolerance when it comes to most things so if you're like me I would definitely recommend starting with 5 milligrams when it comes to edibles but I mean you've been doing it you've been using medical using marijuana medically for two years yes so her tolerance is pretty high so we can handle the 30 we just say no problem but the big thing is though from let's let's go ahead and actually break this down but the main thing that I'm getting from these is but from trying both of them it is quite herbal forward the the flavor is there the strawberry is much sweeter and more flavorful I would say than the pineapple pineapple is a little more herbal forward as well but let's actually start talking about our rating categories here and give these are actually solid score each [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] we're also gonna open this GSC previously known as Girl Scout cookies for those of you have been in the game a little longer and actually know the OG strings we're gonna be trying that card out today so anyways hope to catch you all later and see you in the next video like and subscribe [Music]", "-Yn9dXRFT4Y": "the Joe Rogan experience what was the last second ellic trip you had any I did mushrooms couple months ago yeah how is that it's [ __ ] awesome where'd you do him um did him with re on the show we did did him during a podcast really yeah and do you guys start tripping during the podcast yeah yeah we're having fun what is what does it sound like it was great podcast was great we didn't take too much yeah we took enough and what like you know no one can tell when you're on them like you can still function normally yeah I mean it depends on how far you go please you guys are so funny yeah you can go down the rabbit hole okay I'm you can go down the rabbit hole and be incoherent mm-hmm mushrooms it's

you're like hi how are you oh my god you're so wonderful but you're not like riding on their wings going going to the other dimension but if you take enough that's where you go if you take enough you're not talking to anybody and have you done Alice T yes and good yes great experience yeah oh you had a bad experience on that no no I took it I took it later in life I don't think it's I think most of these psychedelics where you have bad experiences what you're having is your own psychological dilemma and then your battle with whatever the the drug or the psychedelic is trying to do to you versus what your ego is trying to control and keep it from happening I mean I've seen a lot of people have bad trips on some of the worst trips I've ever seen people have was from edible pot edible pot is one of the strongest things that people don't recognize mm-hmm it's it's a very different drug than smoking it and when you know you when you think of things that can take you down the rabbit hole you don't think of edible pot people think of pot is just like oh you're gonna get a high maybe you can get too high but you're just getting high but boom when you eat it it's a completely different animal yeah literally like physiologically it's a different really yeah it's create something called 11 hydroxy metabolite that's five times more psychoactive than THC and what it's like not even psychoactive in smoking it it's a different drug that's a little different totally different drug that makes complete sense yeah it's a different drug it's processed by your liver well there's something called the one pass that passes through your liver and the THC gets processed into eleven hydroxy metabolites Google it's trippy [ __ ] I've way stronger registered on some Micro dos versions of mushrooms that I have to add two of them and they were it was great it just made things a little bit brighter have you ever microdose yes you know does that all-time hey white oh really Ron white so micro dosing [ __ ] yeah cuz I'm on this new drug it's called mushrooms and I just take a little bit every day woah yeah I know a lot of people to do that yeah a lot like dozens dozens of people who microdose including fighters I know a lot of fighters from microdose yeah I forgot today was even on any I was like I was just like oh this room looks like cooler yeah I just feel so oh yeah I ate that little piece yeah you just feel a little better and you're like what is all I took mushrooms yeah I forgot [Applause]", "xt9TmUHvmV8": "[Music] welcome everybody back to a new vlog

cannabis lollipop right hmm how about a little more i don't know so that's what we're about to find out today guys let's see if we can get high of cannabis lollipop but before i try i want to do some research on the internet and as you guys can see right here what it says about the cannabis lollipop and actually i bought this in the street sorry in amsterdam and what i found out here on the website it says that anything that is bought outside of a coffee shop here in the netherlands doesn't contain any thc so i don't think uh lollipop i cannot this lollipop can get you high to be honest guys but we about to find out today it's about to go down let's go guys first of all as you can see i act this is how it leaked with the amsterdam written on it and you have the lead logo on it let me open it and try this so we can [Music] see if you can really get high of cannabis lollipop or not but as we already know the answer guys you can get half cannabis lollipop though i'm gonna go ahead and try it anyway to show you guys so if anybody ever show you or you can hear how the cam is really about that that's [ __ ] actually as it says and let me open this it's just a little bit hot to open guys [Music] [Laughter] are you serious [Music] do a few moments later finally guys [Music] that's a whole lot of work to open the lollipop it wasn't i noticed so i opened it it was very sticky

people it might taste good it tastes like sweet actually and i haven't noticed any effect on i get how to feed anything like that just to say that's easy i want to do the research now anything that is bought outside of a coffee shop doesn't contain any thc and if you don't have thc in your canopies you can get high like so if anybody ever tells you how this that's [ __ ] because you can't get high off it cannot be lollipop it doesn't contain chc so it's just like our regular candy so if you have a key definitely don't recommend you to buy this for a kid guys because uh cannabis is drugs it's legal in some countries some countries not so i can't recommend any mother or family person to buy this for their kid no if you ever see this as i just ignore it but just so you know you can't get out of this i don't give that to my kids to be honest i won't give this to my kids but i'm just saying like it tastes pretty much okay but bruh oh if you make my thongs green right [Music] actually it doesn't taste that bad to be honest but for me i don't like these just like locris they you know so how do i recommend you guys to buy these yeah if you're 18 upwards i recommend easier to buy this you can actually find it in most of the shops in the upstate area most of the shops around upside you can find this here so you don't need to go to a coffee shop to buy a cannabis lollipop guys wait a minute you can buy a almost every shop here in amsterdam oh that says on the reset that i did you can only buy anything that contains thc in the cannabis shop so don't let anybody try to play you anybody trying to fool you or make you feel like oh i just take two of these or i just get half a cannabis lollipop because that's [Music] not me so here you have it guys you can get out of this [ __ ] so [Music] and the coffee shop is about to close in 10 minutes time so you know what's up guys my [ __ ] i gotta go born today see you next time guys and don't forget to subscribe like share my vlog have a nice day guys", "egNB5MXTmmc": "[Music] hello squid the marijuana reviews show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking a look at another drink Dixie elixir that's hard to read as Dixie there di xi\u00e8 elixir there are half and half lemonade NT th C infuse 100 milligrams so I reviewed a lot of drinks here on wheats and I find them to be pretty good there's some really great ones out there cannabis quenchers awesome Jasper's amazing there of course some Dead's out there but on the whole I do like the drinks so I'm really looking forward to this Dixie elixir half and a half a pretty cool little bottle here it's got a wrapper on the outside I kind of like the idea is that the cap there at the top if you want a dose the cap is designed to help you dose appropriately helps you decide like you know oh what's 10 milliliters blah blah blah blah blah what's it what's a dose of course we're going to ignore that and just drink the whole bottle in terms of half and half I love me some Arnold Palmer's which is what a half lemonade half iced tea is love love love them so I'm hoping like this the drinks in terms of taste are all over the map sometimes they're really bad like as Aspen but that means they can produce excellent rewards like zest and sometimes they're not too bad but they often have this really bitter aftertaste and I find that to be pretty often the case with the drinks I'm having trouble getting it off which is you know par for the course for me we're almost there keep peeling this plastic layer off until we eventually get to the goods oh boy there she goes okay there she is all defrocked there's a little cap that you can pour it in so on the back we've got our ingredients and our nutrition information I sadly don't see any lab and testing results but that's okay we're gonna hope that it has 100 milligrams in here it says shake gently before consuming which is what we shall do I assume this opens like a childproof lid it does handsome looking bottle there down the hatch hmm it's okay definite cannabis taste to it more tea than lemonade taste it's not too bad um it's only eight and a half ounces so I'll be done with it in no time again there is a slight cannabis taste to it it's not as bitter as the cannabis quench reserves ASP but but it is there so if you really hate that cannabis taste you might want to pass on this one but for me I'm uh I'm I'm I'm David it's again it's not as bitter as some of the the other brands out there hopefully it means it's still gonna be nice and strong so guys I'm gonna finish this off and then I'm gonna come back to you in two hours like all of our reviews to let you know how this Dixie elixir has landed thanks for watching weeds guys and I will see you in just a bit peace [Music] Dixie elixir half and half and it's pretty good it is in the oh it got me to about a six I'm about a six right now 400 milligram edible that's not bad and one that only costs eleven bucks which I think I neglected to mention the first half I'm pretty pleased with it the taste was good for a drink it wasn't outstanding tasting and it didn't get me crazy high but overall it's a pretty good little product one that I'm pleased with if you pick if you see it at a dispensary near you and you're looking for a drink and they don't and you don't want to get completely [ __ ] up the Dixie elixir might be the product for you I think I might try another one in the future see how it goes for me but overall this is a it's gonna give them my own thumbs up for me not a not a ringing endorsement but but far from uh from a negative review so uh that's gonna do it for this review here guys a nice short and sweet one but before I go and share with you a little cherry on top something I can share with you guys that isn't necessarily we'd really did something I just love that I want to express to you guys and hopefully you will dig as well and this week uh it is going to be Silicon Valley yay there's a little Dinesh in a little guilfoyle now normally I'm very much against these little pop vinyls I think that's what they're called these things just seem like capitalism gone amok but well here becomes capitalism run amuck I think I got in flight two for $5.00 at Gamestop and I was like well III have to have a Dinesh and Gilfoyle so Silicon Valley uh-huh on HBO great great show by the legendary Mike judge of beavis and butthead and king of the hill and office space the movie so it's a great show about that Lampoon's Silicon Valley and I just culture hysterical in its fifth season right now on HBO check it out if you haven't I'm sure you've heard about it from people other than just me and that guys is gonna do it from the cherry on top and that's gonna do it for this review here on wheat thank you so much for sticking around to the very end guys and we will see you on the next review peace", "1wSCMic5Epo": "[Music] hello and welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are looking at a trusty lovable brand one that we reviewed a couple of times in the past and like them every time we're gonna take another look at them in this post and apocalypse world and that is the fine folks at cannabis syrup well mostly for buying folks I think they do some review inflating on weed maps that has me a little peeved but for the most part I do like cannabis quite a bit this is the hundred milligram variety cherry flavored I think we've done grape and chocolate didn't change arena in the best so now we're doing cherry again this is 100 milligrams 10 servings of 10 milligrams each of course we're just going to do it in one I've like canvas syrup every time I reviewed them I find them to be quite potent I think that they are reviewed by s or excuse me they are they used to at least be reviewed by SC labs but I don't see it on here right now but I'll double-check that but independently verified doesn't taste terrible I therefore being unfortunately has a bad texture it it's gonna or thickness it's got like a cough syrup like thickness or at least it used to well let's just go ahead and shut up and open this up and and give it the old-fashioned review here alright almost done with the protective loo balloon okay here we go here is our cherry liquid maybe we could just do it in one gulp that's fine now I do have a chaser here in case things go badly but let's not let's hope that doesn't happen down the hatch did I get it no oh it's like robitussin well it's no good it's not terrible it tastes like cherry cough syrup um but it won't get you uh what's the word for when you do sizzurp I can't remember whatever that kind of crunk is or drunk or [ __ ] up this won't get you that it'll get you high but it won't get you whatever it is like doing coding also don't do coding and I'm done oh well glad to be done with it and guys if you've never tuned in two weeks before you're gonna have to wait a couple more seconds to find out how it's actually going to affect me cuz that's the most important part of the edible review how it makes you feel not how it tastes so I'm gonna sit here stew for the next two hours see how I'm feeling and I'll come back to you guys to let you know thanks for watching wait so I'll see you in just a second this cherry is a real peach that was terrible but this is really good another kind of a syrup another winner ten bucks for this I had a discount to think it got up like seven bucks did it taste terrible it has a cough syrup it kind of flavor as I went over ad nauseam but I'm high I'm still high right out of the sort of six ish kind of range five six someone there feeling good like the format like the syrups it's an easy quick discreet way of doing it this might be the last cannabis we review or review for sometime maybe we'll try some of the higher dose ones because I think they do actually have some like two under or not I've tried that 200 milligrams I think they might have 500 milligrams I'm not sure but maybe we'll do some of those but for the lower doses the 100's the 200s that is going to do it for our cannabis reviews we know they're good now we can concretely say that you can pick up cannabis and feel like you're gonna get your money's worth happy to tell them are happy to give them a good review so again this was the cannabis cherry 100 milligrams from cannabis give it a shot if you haven't already I think you'll be quite happy with cannabis when you do that's going to do it for this review here on weeds guys I appreciate you watching as always and we will see you on a future review peace", "5-o1BEb8eek": "now speaking of getting high yeah you know not all highs are good highs sometimes there are bad highs yeah do you have a horror high story of that experience while you were high I'm sure yeah so I was in Jamaica and my friends there was like 15 of us got all guys we decided to take brownies one day and like the crew range from guys who smoked weed everyday to guys who had never smoked weed in their entire lives but everyone was no pun intended pot committed to taking these brownies they're like this big I took one we all went to the beach and then like all of us were hit with this ridiculous wave to where everybody was I can't even like astronomically high like I wa I couldn't even cross the street like I was trying to cross the street at this pizza place with my two friends and I couldn't I kept backing up and I can I finally sat down and got food and then we ordered buffalo chicken pizza and I was enjoying it and then my friend said like ma'am I've gotta get out of here like I think like the walls are like coming in and his friend was like a very like he was like the guy who would get so drunk and not feel it like he was like the big type of dude who wouldn't get freaked out and he got freaked out to freak me out then all of a sudden I just woke up and what happened was apparently I woke up on the ground with like ten Jamaicans standing over me and my friend said that my eyes started wrong in the back of my head they thought I was joking they slapped me in the face and I fell off and like I guess essentially having a mini seizure and since then I haven't taken edible it was the only time I've taken edibles and I just have I mean the ruined edibles for me I'm not doing it man it's crazy we went to bed at 4 p.m. that day it was a complete waste of a spring break danger you", "K3jYmHtFVoQ": "today we read

coming out of my ears", "6M5vTfGskPU": "[Music] I'm Ian Mitchell I'm an emergency physician in towns British Columbia at the royal inland hospital I'm also an associate professor in the department of emergency medicine at the University of British Columbia and locally I'm a clinician at the can solve clinic today I'm gonna be talking of a tale of two drugs those drugs are THC and gabapentin we're talking about their history how they've been used their research basis and why physicians feel that those two drugs are so very different and should be treated so different I'd like to begin with some history in the history of cannabis begins millennia ago cannabis is one of the oldest domesticated plants in the world going back it's used in to ancient China and Egypt in the Western world we found out about cannabis through India where physicians brought back cannabis to be used in North America what was used for over a hundred years by some of the best known physicians in the English world including Sir William Osler who believed that cannabis was the best treatment available for migraines at that time Canadian drug companies fought amongst each other over who provided the best quality cannabis to Canadian physicians and patients cannabis was criminalized in 1923 in Canada for reasons that are still unclear the history of gabapentin is much more modern gabapentin was invented in 1974 by drug company called parke-davis parke-davis as well as distributing cocaine and cannabis also invented pcp ketamine and gabapentin really the party people love drug companies gabapentin was approved for sale in 1993 for the treatment of seizure disorders we look at the mechanism behind these two drugs cannabis affects the endocannabinoid system we all have a system within our body that responds to cannabis and also responds to chemicals within our body that are similar to cannabis these chemicals called anokhin of annoyed help to regulate our mood or sleep and our appetite on the other hand gabapentin works on a different system it was initially designed to work on gaba receptors however later research shows it actually effects calcium channels on nerve terminals looking at the research base of these two therapies we find that the research that's been done in cannabis is overwhelmingly looking at harms over 90% of the research money that was ever spent was focused while looking at the harms of cannabis very little was spent looking at benefits part of the difficulty in studying cannabis is there is no supply of research cannabis in America to look at the benefits the government will give you as much cannabis as you want to study the harms but if you're looking to study the benefits of cannabis you are not allowed to have any that's recently been reversed however the cannabis that the government has been sending to researchers has been of low quality and containing mold and has been unable to be used in research studies can is not much different in Canada red tape and hurdles mean it is more difficult to study cannabis in Canada than it is to study heroin turning back to gabapentin we can look at the research and gabapentin as being part of a criminal enterprise that really focus on a physician called dr. scott rubin who was incarcerated for falsifying data in research studies he played a big part in the researching of gabapentin and its uptake by physicians Pfizer the drug company marketing gabapentin realized that there was little money to be made in just the seizure management aspect of gabapentin so they sent sales people out to doctors offices to convince them to use it for many other conditions in populations that had never been approved for children old people as a result gap in and a huge uptake among physicians but ultimately Pfizer had to pay out the largest consumer fight in history 430 million dollars for their fraudulent Mis marketing activities we find that this pattern continues however with industry paid physicians still be much more likely to prescribe Gavin looking at what effects these medications have on people both gabapentin and cannabis they have a similar side effect profile our side effects include dizziness sedation coordination problems cognitive impairment people are often very much more concerned about the mental health aspects of cannabis and how there are some adverse effects associated in that way particularly with schizophrenia what we understand is there is an association with cannabis and schizophrenia if people start using cannabis at a very young age and they are prone to getting schizophrenia their symptoms may come out earlier and be more severe but it does not appear that cannabis by itself can make someone schizophrenic it can only affect people who are already vulnerable to this condition there's also the myth of the amotivational syndrome this is an idea that stoners sit around all the time and are very lazy and that just hasn't been borne out by research turning back to gabapentin we find that we have new concerns about mental health and gabapentin from recent research we know that it increases suicidal ideation and that's most often in people between the ages of 15 and 24 people who are much more prone to be suicidal already it's also impairing for driving gabapentin is both drugs can be abused both cannabis and gabapentin we know from older research that approximately 1 in 9 people who use cannabis recreationally may become dependent on it although this is based on old figures and may not be reflective of current conditions physicians were told that gabapentin was not addictive was not abusable and this of course is not the case there is a large illicit market for gabapentin particularly in prison it helps to make the effects of opiates more prominent unfortunate also helps to increase the rate of death associated hope you know there was a withdrawal symptom from gabapentin that is not as severe as with alcohol but is still unpleasant and no one should ever stop gabapentin cold turkey because of this withdrawal syndrome cannabis has been very heavy rig heavily regulated since 1923 was made illegal it was made partially GLE in 2001 in Canada with the advent of medical cannabis and we had full legalization of cannabis in 2018 gabapentin remains unrestricted in canada available by prescription it does not require triplicate as opiates do or other addictive medications do gabapentin rescheduled in the United Kingdom due to epidemic of misuse the Canadian Medical Association the standard for Canadian physicians holds that the evidence is insufficient to use cannabis for neuropathic pain they are supportive of gabapentin and that certain research have called them out on this saying that they're been overly cautious about cannabis per se the CMA has been somewhat silent about gabapentin their journal the Canadian Medical Association Journal has articles noting the abuse the over prescribing and the lack of efficacy of gabapentin but the Cana Medical Association at this point has no moves to restrict physician prescribing of gabapentin of note there is no Sunshine Act in Canada so it is difficult to know who is getting paid by companies to help prescribe gabapentin moving on to some myths there are a rich mythology around cannabis first being that it is common to have cannabis that has been contaminated with fentanyl this has never been proved to be true there's no confirmed samples of cannabis with fentanyl in it fentanyl is actually destroyed if people smoke it in a joint it has to be smoked in a different way off aluminum-foil there's also the terms indica and sativa that are still commonly used at one point this represented difference between the two types of plants and fateh actually the type of effect they would have on people however over the last few decades hybridization amongst these plants has rendered these distinctions meaningless and is no longer possible to look at a name to look at a label and tell what is in that plant or what the effect it's gonna have on a person myths around gabapentin are few there was a gentleman in the UK who was claiming that after taking gabapentin he became gay I haven't read any research studies supporting that so far looking at the clinical indications for these medications for cannabis we have indications for chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting for spasticity for PTSD and for chronic pain but many people have raised concerns about cannabis being a panacea and applied to every condition out there and we hear this especially for physicians but just for comparison I'd like to read off the indications for gabapentin and what people are prescribing that form and we find that doctors are prescribing gabapentin for acute pain chronic pain post-operative pain neuropathic pain they're prescribing for tremors seizures and muscle cramps they're prescribing for depression mania herpes zoster tardive dyskinesia restless leg syndrome fibromyalgia cancer diabetic neuropathy interstitial cystitis arthritis anxiety pancreatitis chronic cough occipital neuralgia migraine bipolar disease drug dependency alcoholism alcohol after all opiate withdrawal and benzodiazepine with all doesn't work for all these things the evidence just isn't there it's unclear whether gabapentin works for much of anything however we've seen a tremendous rise of gabapentin and that's come from large amounts of pharmaceutical money being used to promote the drug it's being heavily up taken because now physicians are much more concerned about prescribing opiates or restricted by the college for prescribing opiates for their patients so they have to turn to an alternative the fact that it may not work very well sinks to the bottom there's a perception of safety with gabapentin that is really not true we now know much more about its side effects and its impairment risks there's been a tendency of physicians to say well if the gabapentin is working is not working for you that we should increase the dose and there's been many studies showing that increasing the dose does not add to any pain relief but only increases side-effects nonetheless this is a very common prescribing pattern within British Columbia so if we look at the protocols for treating neuropathic pain because one of the main reasons that gabapentin is around gabapentin is certainly high up on the list when we look at an algorithm for a managing neuropathic pain that comes from the pain family physicians they also include opiate analgesics and tramadol which are terrible drugs for neuropathic pain and have significant side effects cannabinoids only appear as a third line agent unfortunately if you look at the evidence to support gabapentin which is the first-line agent I'll quote from a study here there is moderate to high quality evidence that anticonvulsants are ineffective for the treatment of low back pain or lumbar radicular pain there is high-quality evidence that gabapentin toys have a higher risk for adverse events these are medications that do not work well for the indication that they are prescribed and they have significant side-effects and yet they are among the most commonly prescribed pain medications from physicians today so this brings us now to a state of reality pain and evidence-based medicine we have limited evidence-based medicine about cannabis because for many decades we weren't allowed to do the research and we're in a research deficit so we don't know how well cannabis works for many conditions on the other hand with gabapentin it's been researched thoroughly and what we're finding is that it has been well researched enough to know that it does not work for most conditions it's prescribed for and it has significant harms so there are many patients with chronic pain and some of them will be helped by gabapentin but is a very small number and certain does not justify the number of prescriptions being written for this medication there are very few prescriptions written for cannabis because physicians shy away from this from lack of knowledge but it can certainly be an effective medication for patients and if we move on to a summary from one of the gabapentin studies it reads even absent clinical trial trial data it is possible that drug X may help some patients who have clinical features of neuropathic pain in the same way that not every patient responds to medication with proven eck efficacy for the condition there are some patients who may respond to medications even though efficacy was not demonstrated in a clinical trial the problem is that throws out evidence-based medicine says you shouldn't pay attention to studies I think you should pay attention to studies but the studies haven't been done for cannabis with this equipoise and what we understand certainly some patients are going to be helped by gabapentin and it doesn't mean that needs to go away but it needs to be far more restricted than what it is and physicians need to consider the cannabis with a similar side effect profile and more effect on neuropathic pain maybe a more appropriate selection for these patients and they should consider where the research comes from and the bias behind these both of these medications thank you", "2zjR0bzWFhY": "let's pop what you already know that this is your boy legal Karma's what I'm talking about today I got some karma edibles whoa check this out karma edibles we got that grape flavored this is a nano infuse nano

suckers it's basically the same way you make the candies your quarter cup of canola oil which I already put in the pot your half a cup corn syrup I use beehive please do not use like Aunt Jemima or anything like that like pancake syrup don't use that use beehive or you can use a no-name brand I believe that is bought a fresh coordinate Aunt Jemima because it won't turn out so we got our quarter cup of oil in there we have our half a cup of corn syrup and I'm going to do the 3/4 cup of white sugar while there's no numbers on it so I had to put a mark on the stove so medium it depends how hot your stove goes to be quite honest so I keep it if it was numbered I think it would be number four or five on the stove so I'm just gonna stir in the goodness and don't worry about it all being granule e because it will dissipate it'll heat and it'll go to a liquid state so there we go get my candy thermometer you will need a candy thermometer it has to go up to 300 degrees because 300 degrees is the hard candy state so I put that in there and put my timer on the stove for 12 minutes just so I don't forget that there's something on the stove I have done that before so we let that go and it sometimes goes from 12 to 15 minutes depending on the temperature of your stove you don't want to burn it because it's a total waste of ingredients especially the can of butter so I have my sucker trays I have my sucker sticks I'm going to make 20 suckers I believe it is we'll see how many we can get out of the mix I should be able to make 20 suckers and their happy face suckers so we're gonna watch this boil which is probably gonna be boring so maybe I should pause it you know we'll just let it go if I pause it I'll probably rough it and shut it off or something like that so I'm gonna go get my ball and I'll be right back piece got my tea got my bong so yeah it takes about 12 minutes or so to reach 300 degrees I do stir it occasionally just to move the mix around the butter doesn't always cling to you'll see it's kind of like when you fry eggs and you put oil or butter in the pan you'll see a little bit of the the residue on the outside of the item you're cooking and that's basically what happens here so I try and stir it all together but you're not gonna get it all mixed even when you're pouring it out you'll have some butter left over and I call it sweet butter there you're see see how well that's bubbling that's what you want so we got nine minutes left and I'm not even sure what kind of candies I want or what kind of suckers I want to make today I have caramel watermelon Apple raspberry butterscotch and cherry I'm thinking cherry what do you guys think wish I was live so I could ask you guys so butterscotch or cherry I don't know I'm gonna put them in my hand I'm gonna do this I'm not even gonna look I'm not even gonna look and I'm gonna pull one out and that's which one I'm gonna make cherry so we're gonna have cherry suckers yay sometimes I put food coloring in them just to give them a little punch of color I don't always do this just because sometimes my friends when they're over here know munch on some of my candies and one of my friends this is allergic to dyes so I don't know maybe I shouldn't only two batches of suckers I'll do cherry and butterscotch and that way she can have butterscotch because there are no colorings in the butterscotch well I don't have a butterscotch colors though so as you can see it bubbled very vigorously and then it fell down so that's all normal don't think it's too high of a temperature as long as you have your thermometer in there your candy thermometer and you're paying attention to the degrees on the thermometer and keep in mind that 300 degrees is hard candy state so as long as you reach 300 degrees with your mix even a little above 300 degrees you will have a hard candy it will solidify into a hard candy state so we are at almost 375 we have 6 minutes left to go and I'm gonna take some of my medicine in a little store today so I have some Skywalker og lapped no more CBD oil that did not last long I wish it lasted longer who excuse me so I'm also gonna take you once this is all done I'm gonna put you on the other part of the counter over there and we're gonna pour out the candies so I'm thinking what a neon color or just regular color for the cherry probably regular color yeah so I hope everyone's having a good day I got my healing health compassion center shirt on and on the back it says THC and CBD equal healing so yeah this is from my local compassion center I went to a little party that they had they had their two year anniversary and I went to their anniversary party and they had games and they had some really nice food out there some cookies and cakes and sandwiches and it was really nice and they were handing out these t-shirts so it's it's an extra-large I am NOT an extra-large person but I got myself a nightgown it works so we are reaching 300 degrees and let that bubble a little longer clean up my mess over here so I can put everything down on the counter yeah so hope everyone's having a good day hope it's a beautiful day where you are it's very warm out here today I think right now it's almost reaching 20 degrees and it's I don't know not quite 11 o'clock yet so I guess we're in for a hot day I was hoping for a cooler day so I'm shutting the stove off because it is at 300 degrees as you can see it said 300 degrees whether you can see that or not I don't know so we shut the stove off I need my knife so they're very hard to open at least for me so I gotta score it with the knife whoo there goes my bone there's the cherry oil oh my gosh it smells amazing maybe I should do too just so that we have really good flavor oh my gosh what did I do with my knife I am just not with it today folks know I'm a little out of it I had a good sleep though come on okay there we go - dreams of cherry we're gonna stir this baby around you can see the smoke that's okay it's just the oil you can smell it it smells amazing so I'm gonna move you over to this part of the counter so that I can show you please excuse the dishes in the sink oh no is that gonna work okay yeah please excuse this think I have a few plates in there and some stuff from doing all the baking yesterday I was just too tired to do the dishes last night but after this batch I'll do it there's no suckers gates and not prepared you are known to propose so we put the sicker sicker sicker stalks stick oh my gosh sucker sticks say that five times fast in the trays so when you pour the hot candy mixture in here that is going to push down the sticks okay so here we are oh I know something I forgot to do and I got to do it before the candy mixture goes in here you got to do this folks you have to use complements butter flavored to lubricate the sheets for the candies so I have to do that right now so that my suckers come out of the containers so there we go we're ready to pour it into the funnel got the dye today guys so there we go we got the dye in there so they look like cherry coming on folks [Music] so here's our funnel we just pour it in you're going to see the butter remain on the top some of the butter that didn't get mixed into the mixture which is fine because we just reuse that again and they pour off the SX and just put that aside so where are we at I'll go this way so he just pour it out maybe I won't get 20 suckers but that'll be alright a few is enough just munch on these throughout the day so be careful not to overflow just one enough in there sometimes I twist the stick so they get coated I think I have to do that this time too so that they stay in there sorry for the sniffling folks they still have that little bit of a cold going on oh we're gonna get 20 suckers hi mama oh wait that's Molly and because there's still so much in there I'm just gonna pour out the butter the oil I have another tray I don't know if you can see this pink one over here I'm just gonna fill that with the rest of [Music] they smell amazing you guys I wish you to smellivision love cherry so there we go that's it and then you stick them in the fridge or the freezer for about 10-15 minutes and they will solidify but with the suckers I can't move them like that I'm turning the stick so that they all get covered with the mixture and they'll be gooey and all stick together instead of this one didn't even go in excuse me I'm so sorry about that everyone it's I really feel like I have a cold I should probably be wearing gloves but because I'm the only one eating these suckers so we're gonna let them sit there for about 20 minutes I'm gonna put this one in the freezer and there you have it so I'll just let these solidify I might even put these in the freezer and you see if the Train will fit there we go good thing I didn't go shopping and fill that freezer full of stuff yeah so it smells amazing in my kitchen smells sweet and there you have it folks and in one of my videos I will show you the actual suckers but there you go just let them Harden in the fridge and I don't know about 10-15 minutes maybe 20 minutes if you want and pull them out and enjoy so enjoy everyone have a great day love and peace stay tuned stay unique bye", "DGlNc6tjTT8": "the cannabis edible one of the many glorious ways to consume cannabis they're tasty they're filling and best of all they get you high so you've been thinking about trying a cannabis edible for the first time to see what all the hype is about you should know that eating cannabis edibles to party your relaxed can be a fun and rewarding experience but remember THC does have the ability to intoxicate and should therefore like anything else be used responsibly I have before us the ultimate guide of all you need to know to guarantee an awesome edible experience ladies and gentlemen I give you the puffs puffs posts official guide to edibles I shall start us off with a story that is all too common among so many edible users and me Gwen Gwen wants to try cannabis edibles for the first time and enjoy a healthy dose of THC with her friends tonight she's inedible and eagerly awaits the euphoric effects she waits and waits expecting to feel something at any moment a full hour goes by and still no feeling of a cannabis hi she waits and waits another full hour still nothing by now Gwen is growing impatient and suspects that the edibles she ate just aren't potent enough for her she eats another edible this one should do the trick no more than five minutes go by and suddenly Gwen is hit with a full-frontal TC sensation she is consumed too much and the effects are overwhelming her she spends the rest of what should have been a fun night feeling over intoxicated what went wrong here did the edibles do this - Gwen or an a momentary lapse of preparation did Gwen do this to herself to find out what happened here we need to delve into the rules of edible consumption and examine just how Gwen broke these rules rule 1 know your notes unlike alcohol cannabis THC is a very safe non-toxic substance with no known lethal dose however much like alcohol when somebody ingests more than they can handle there can be some undesirable side effects excess of THC beyond one's threshold can result in a temporary increase of anxiety agitation elevated heart rate or even vomiting one of the biggest mistakes when made right off the bat was eating a cannabis edible without inquiring what the dose was one thing to remember for your first time is to start low and slow with a more manageable 20 milligrams of THC eaten will give you higher than 20 milligrams of TC smoked so you may have to dial your usual dosage back of it most health experts recommend a conservative 5 to 10 milligrams of THC to start you off just because your party animal friend can down cannabis animals like their potato chips and function fine doesn't mean you should immediately follow suit understand that everybody has different limitations when it comes to metabolizing THC the process of knowing your dose is crucial to gauge how much TC you can consume comfortably without erling yourself into a sour experience know your limits stay within it rule to wait just wait there is a difference between smoking and eating cannabis when cannabis is smoked your lungs absorb the cannabis right away and you feel the high instantly but when you eat cannabis it is processed through the liver and may take anywhere between one to two hours to feel the full effects another one of Gwen's many errors was failing to recognize this waiting period she mistook the delayed process of the edible digestion as it being ineffective in doing so she overcompensated by doubling her dose unnecessarily now any negative sensations she feels off the first edible will compound two hours later when she fully digest the second one she what when should have done was relaxed sit back eat Cheetos and let the edible run its full course so if you take an edible and you were waiting to feel for its effects but they never seem to arrive don't worry just wait some more give your body the appropriate amount of time to fully digest the edible and then decide whether or not you want more THC in your system rule 3 know what to expect so you've taken the appropriate dosage that best suits you and you've exercised patience and waiting for the substance to run its course good job the effects kick in the process of liver digestion is much more thorough than lung intake and your body will therefore absorb more properties from the cannabis at best you may feel a very cozy and content feeling or experience a heightened libido and increase sensuality rule 4 there is a time and place for edibles especially if it's your first time try not to drink alcohol while on edibles whose can magnify the effects of THC potentially making the user too hot I also would not recommend driving working or operating machinery after you take them since they can't intoxicate you instead it may be wise to reserved an entire day set aside for them like maybe the weekend or on a date you can just sit back and relax these conditions are optimal because you can feel the effects of an edible six to eight hours after ingesting them so be ready for a long day of fun taking an edible before you go to bed is also an option since the effects can combat insomnia for many people just like baby pictures and recounting your last trip to Las Vegas there is a time and a place for edibles so I hope you learned a thing or two from our guy remember when trying any new substance do your research find out the ideal dose for you educate yourself on what you can expect to feel and know when the best time to consume them is with all that being said I wish you all the best of trips follow these rules and I can guarantee you a safe and fun edible experience every time

wheats mini-review and we are coming to you from Denver Colorado today our first trip out of Southern California and we are gonna look at some of the edibles here available in Colorado but first a mini rant Colorado I'm afraid in comparison to Southern California you do not hold a candle when it comes to edibles so for example I've got the Dutch girl caramel waffles I believe those are a stroopwafel this is a hundred milligrams of THC and it cost me $23 so roughly if you go milligram two dollar ratio about 300-400 percent more expensive than what you get in Southern California but I don't want to judge too harshly this also is Dutch girl stroopwafels promises to have feel it faster with n.ex.t technology whatever the hell that means they say nano extraction technology and that you fill these edibles faster than traditional edibles now if you guys have seen weeks before you know we traditionally do 30 60 120 pip updates not gonna be the case on these sweets vacation review I'm just gonna eat these bad boys come back to you guys in about two hours and let you know if we're feeling anything at all so here we go without further ado here is the product open up here and it's a little waffle cookie a little stroopwafel if you ever seen these German type cookies this is what they look like mmm smells delicious smells like a caramelized little Stroup cookie stroopwafel cookie but let's give it a taste no problems on the taste phone I apologize in that regard Colorado but for $23 is this gonna get me [ __ ] up I'll let you know guys in two hours thanks so much for watching we'll catch you back on weeds welcome back to wheats wheats on vacation here I'm back talking about the Dutch girl caramel waffles the stroopwafel it's been just a little bit over two hours and I just wanted to come back and tell you guys how we're feeling so for one hundred milligram edible I'm feeling a little high not especially high but for for something it's 100 milligrams probably right about on target but for the price I am not familiar with the Colorado market as well as I am the California market but I'm gonna guess that's probably right in the wheelhouse of an average price but these things are delicious so wheats on vacation if you find yourself in Colorado looking for an edible and you've got some money to spend and you like the way things taste you like your caramel waffles don't be afraid to pick up the Dutch girl it's good it's just not gonna put you in the hospital which is also good because you don't want to be in the hospital either but it's also not gonna put you in your bed so with that being said thank you so much for watching wheats guys and we'll check you guys on the next review hello and thank you so much for watching weeds if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment below and I'll be more than happy to try to find the product to review it again thanks for watching and we'll check you guys out on the next video", "8OJ6v23ah6w": "good morning guys I wanted to quickly go over how to calculate milligrams of THC and explain what it is exactly I think this is one worth knowing since milligrams of THC is quickly becoming the new dominant unit of measurement when it comes to trying to discuss dosages just like it's the dominant unit of measurement with prescription medication and a lot of other substances also in legal jurisdictions it's becoming increasingly the standard way to label the dosage up on marijuana edibles and drinkables when we talk about weed traditionally it was always done by weight grams ounces pounds and so on which was very broad and also very standard and in the last 15 years we also started using percent THC to be more precise which describes the THC content of a particular strain per gram and thus its potency per gram but that figure was always expressed as a percentage for example this strain is 12% THC but now we've gone one step further to the milligrams that milligram figure is not as confusing as it seems if you have one gram of weed also known as 1000 milligrams and it's a strain that's 12% THC that means there's 120 milligrams of THC in that single gram why do we need to take things to milligrams because one standard dosage especially when it comes to edibles has been defined as 10 milligrams 10 milligrams of THC is the amount of THC that a relative novice consumer would need to consume in order to feel mild of cannabis effects a mild high so if you buy a marijuana chocolate bar and it states that the whole chocolate bar contains a hundred and sixty milligrams that means that's that chocolate bar has 16 of those standard doses and they're most likely divided into the little chocolate squares in that bar now that doesn't mean that to the average marijuana consumer they'll be able to get decently stoned off of ten milligrams as I said in my episode on tolerance just like with alcohol marijuana tolerance Rises 10 milligrams is really just a measurement for novices for myself I need at least 25 to 30 milligrams and my tolerance is above average but it's nothing special I know super heavy marijuana users who don't feel much of anything until they get to about 50 milligrams but if you're just starting out with edibles 10 milligrams should be your first trial run obviously to control dosage on such like with such precision you have to live in a legal weed jurisdiction because that's the only way you're gonna see the percent THC or the milligram THC vigor expressed in a reliable way on the package so there you go now you know what milligrams THC is and how it might apply to you hope you enjoyed the show if you found it useful be sure to subscribe and hit that like button see you next time", "lur_XKWEC9A": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of your dispensary classic ass episode today which of course means an edible and i think maybe uh the first edible we have ever done here on wheats was from this company uh this is a product i just learned about a couple weeks ago and was super excited to try and that is the korova one of our long time favorites although it's been a couple years probably since we've reviewed one of their products this is the korova mini cookie single serving technically 100 milligrams so what makes this different is this is just one cookie with all 100 milligrams in it as opposed to the bags of 10 cookies that have uh 10 cookies with 10 milligrams each for 100 milligrams total so this is way less this is considerably more potent than your standard karova mini cookie uh and that is something that i always endorse i like smaller edibles i like edibles where you don't have to eat the giant all kinds of things and this one here is definitely that just a delightful a little a mini cookie and i believe i picked it up for 13 at my dispensary which is a pretty good value uh the the bag of 10 mini cookies i think is uh more on the order of 20 so you get the same amount of potency uh in a much smaller package uh so we've got our cookie here on the back is the ridiculous dosing guide uh so let's say you really wanted to break this down in the 10 milligram pieces that the state requires well that's how you do it um i don't think any person's really gonna do that i think this is probably more designed as a single serving and that's how we're gonna do it so let's go ahead and open up our karova mint dip mini cookie take a look at it there she is ah man this brings me back uh i ate a dozen of these back in the day the full-size ones back when um edibles could be of any size or milligramage they want uh i this was probably one of my two or three favorite kroba's the mint dip nostalgic for it anyways so this is our 100 milligram edible let's give it a bite here straight into the mint [Music] [Music] wow [Music] holy hell if that has if that has 100 milligrams of thc in it i would be very very impressed but also not that in surprise because it is corroba they make great products this little mini cookie with 100 milligrams of thc that i just had half of in one single bite um has very little weed taste shockingly little it's there but for something this small and with that potency i was expecting a lot more to be honest um i am not going to knock that against it i am however curious to see how it is going to come out so i'm going to finish off this uh little cookie i'm going to give myself probably a half hour so to space out my high and then two hours after i have the other half of this i'll come right back here with you guys and let you know our wrap-up thoughts the most important part about the edible review is it actually going to get you high so until then stay high stay healthy and we'll see you then bye everyone i'm back guys it has been two and a half hours since i had that first bite of our karova mint dip cannabis infused cookie and this is a huge winner for corova this is precisely what i wanted ah man what a good feeling uh this is what i've always hoped for desired is the super potent super strong small packaged edible and that is exactly what is uh delivered here uh taste was very much on point uh shockingly low cannabis taste for a surprisingly powerful edible uh as you can tell the eyes are even quite bloodshot it's uh how potent this is um i can't say for absolute certainty that this is like a one-to-one equivalent kind of high to the uh ten mini cookies uh but i can say for absolutely sure uh i feel um as uh as uh sure as i've ever felt in endorsing this uh even if i can't say it's as great as there are 10 mini cookies in terms of potency uh this thing is still damn good damn good enough that one of my dogs has decided to open the door there so ah wow a little rambly here that's how uh we know it's quality massive massive thumbs up for the corova cannabis infused mint dip mini cookie if you're like me you like potent edibles and you like them in a smaller form factor give this one a shot and then anytime we have a review we like this much we like to add a little cherry on top a little something extra just a little non-weed related thing that we can give out as a little recommendation this week here's something that uh that's exactly what i wanted to in the moment um uh we'll go a little too fur here a little channel youtube channel recommendation all of this stuff from veritasium which i think i may have or may not have cherry on top before uh but we'll go with the very specific video titled the infinite pattern that never repeats oh man it's a 21 minute video of pure interesting mathematical goodness i'll give it a chance give it a shot it uh it even if you don't like mac it looks cool as hell um and i think you'll still get something out of it uh also goes great with weed um or without your decision so guys two things i love super super much here our kurova mini cookie mint dip and the channel veritasium with the video the infinite pattern that never repeats how cool anyways guys that's gonna do it for this review and cherry on top thank you so much to anybody who made it here to the very end until we see you for our next video stay high more importantly stay healthy we'll see you then goodbye", "iJwdqt7ebmE": "yeah here we go here we go again what's up yo back with another review today Oh edible gummies Mira Mira specifically Rob hots sour flavors I believe this is a relative new relatively new flavor for them I'm not a million percent sure even close to sure if it's on the REC side if it's not now I would imagine it will be soon so diving in the flavors we got inside here blue raspberry grape and green apple I don't know I had to look at it I actually know the flavors of jelly me anyway that's pretty much my favorite flavors enjoy ranchers and other candies so that was a super big plus for me I'm not really a huge tower fan so I'm really hoping they're not especially a sour yeah I was gonna enter a picture probably already did or I am now so we're gonna dive into what one thing to keep in mind is the brain all right we go is that the milligrams posted on the bottle or on the container are not necessarily the exact amount that are in your specific bottle your specific bottle will have a separate location where it is located exactly how many milligrams are in there I will insert a picture of it but it's I just keep smearing it you cannot see it at all anymore but I know that this bottle says 500 milligrams and it has 467 point 6 4 milligrams in it meaning each piece is not 50 milligrams but 46.7 6 milligrams per gummy it will always tell you the specific amount of THC that is in and milligrams that is in your container but it's not always exactly what's on the bottle sometimes it's more though I had another bottle of greens but I ate before I could review sometimes it's more the greens were 500 and something milligrams so each milligram or 5/10 I think or anyway doesn't matter because it was 51 milligrams per gummy i remember that specifically so sometimes you're getting more sometimes getting less if you're really a budget conscious person and you want to really maximize your bang for buck check out the different flavors and see what milligram is the highest of the actual bottle that you'll be purchasing we're gonna move on to the scent also it doesn't say whether it's a hybrid or indica or sativa so that means it's a hybrid most edibles are pretty much hybrids anyway I'm to get a edible specific video posted so keep an eye out for that because I'm gonna give like tips tricks all kinds of different information about edibles specifically that you can apply across pretty much all edibles sauer sorry I'm getting a little bit of the grape but I'm gonna be completely honest with you guys these two are the two that I'm gonna be eating and one of them is great the reason these are the two that I'm gonna be eating is because I licked the [ __ ] out of them getting the sub nail photo and specifically the purple one is the one that I started with so it got the most saliva on it so I'm not sure if that has affected the scent that I'm picking up the most in here I'm like rotating something like the blue raspberries up on top I still kind of get great more than anything else behind this hour cuz this hour is the first thing that I smelled so that's a little bit concerning for me but when I was licking them I didn't taste a lot of sour however in the photo you can see there's a lot of like more there's a lot of rocky material that's only on one side from what I can tell because the green one too it didn't have any on the bottom I'm thinking that's the sour so I would imagine that you could dust that off and they wouldn't be sour but tact tactically they are I'm gonna grab one that I haven't wet because that they're more sticky Wow they're mean Wow I'm having before but they are they're very soft and compression they're definitely gummies cuz they're a little bit sticky but let's see yeah they're a little bit sticky my fingers are a little sticky after that but I could be because I was also handling the ones that I licked so we're gonna let see my fingers do not feel sticky at all or the like least amount like to smile if anything so now we're gonna squeeze squeeze squeeze squeeze it is sticky yeah it's sticky and that's one that was not licked but it's not super bad cuz now after I've done it a few times it's pretty much not sticky anymore so a little sticky but you'll be able to like dust it off and no big deal as long as you don't like continuously looking and grab it and grab it and grab it that makes it sticky alright let's ride let's ride so I'm gonna be doing actually 150 because I'm gonna try all three well I was Jenni myself so harshly I'm like oh you're not getting quick enough that I couldn't actually think about adding up the numbers so it actually may be more like 135 levi's I am going to put the sour directly on my tongue with this one and then the other way on this one and whichever way I like the most I'm gonna do for the blue raspberry because that's my favorite and the apple looks like it's not got a lot of stuff on it so [Music] okay I push the gummy off to the side to just deal with the sour but it's really not bad like you can see my face with like a little bit but when it's really sour it's my faces all kinds of you know I am definitely getting a great flavor I would say that there is a mild earthy flavor to it I mean hash has a very very attached distillate has a very mild cannabis flavor to it but I'm picking that up so it's not but I I mean any edible honestly any edible is gonna have the slightest flavoring whether it be hashey or earthy which this is a little bit both I'm getting it's interesting you know I'm getting the earthiness of the you know cannabis component but which is in distillate but I'm also at the end getting a little bit of the tang or the dryness maybe that's it of the hash flavor if you have smoked hash or gotten it on it and like licked it and stuff you kind of know what I mean you the smell like honest if you know what the smell is you kind of know what the taste is so they're green apple oh and as far as I continue to talk the flavor I'm left with is a very mild grape kind of a again there's it's not really necessarily earthy at this point it's an off great like it's great but just like a little okay solid metal that straight-up tastes like Ukraine Apple the end part I got a little bit of sour and as I was coming out of it it tasted like a sour green apple so that was really nice not quite as much earthy flavor in that one I just think maybe the green apple complements or goes with the cannabis ever slightly so more than the grape so more I'm not really tasting the green apple anymore it was strong when I was eating it but it doesn't really have a leftover flavor and blue raspberry [Music] whoo Smiley's an idol I ate a boy okay that was delicious it honestly reminds me of a blue Slurpee but I I honestly don't think I've ever tried a Slurpee ever but it's what I imagine a blue raspberry a Slurpee tastes like blue raspberry otter pop that's the closest that I can relate it to cuz it's not quite blue raspberry Jolly Rancher but it's blue rounder blue blue raspberry otter pop so it's a little duller than a Jolly Rancher but still nicely blue raspberry we're popsicle I swallowed unexpectedly during that so some sour got in my throat so it's not the best feeling and I did just eat on three so I'm imagining the flavors gonna be a little ol kooky but I kind of maybe I just want it I feel like I have a remanence of blue raspberry in my mouth but I might just be wanting it so much that its existing you know for the placebo effect so flavors oh dude I didn't get any hash from that no earthy no hash maybe because I like that flavor so much or it goes better with it I don't know but it tasted delicious so that you know as far as overall experience I appreciate that the sour is not super sour I almost think there's gonna be people who are disappointed but it's not super super sour but I thought it was a nice mild level of sour what yeah I still get the grape more than anything in that particular whip waft I wonder if it's because I was also thinking it was gonna be so much more sour that I smelled this no I smell sour but it's not as strong it has before that's so funny anyway I love Rob hot gummies I've had them pretty consistently there's definitely other companies that make really good gummies but Rob hots from what I've experienced so far seems to be the best thing for the [ __ ] and having good quality like great quality gummies however I did want to mention gelatin and glucose syrup is in here I don't know how that relates to either vegetarianism or veganism all right so the milligrams are definitely affecting me at this point I'd say I'm Spacey relaxed [Music] I'm frontier I was more minute early and now I'm more relaxed and I think when I get to doing the video editing it'll be easier to focus than trying to pull thoughts out of this brain it's more just do versus think which is wonderful my hands are so dry my knuckles oh my gosh I need to get more lotion I have to go okay I just needed a quick thing yeah yes I would recommend rabbits gummies I would say pretty much overall at this point different flavors you you're gonna like and not like so that's gonna be a personal thing but overall I think that Rob Potts does a good job with their gummies and the sours were delicious and not super sour and I really like that I hope you guys have a wonderful rest of your day", "hNNcotxEnew": "[Music] welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you guys make sense of your dispensary I apologize still for the mayhem going on behind me here in the closet hopefully should have the construction wrapped up soon and something a little bit more visually appealing to see in the background so knock on wood so guys welcome to weeks as I said this is the first time you've tuned in to wheats the way our reviews work is I take the product I eat the entire thing of the product unless it's a special experiment or something I'm gonna eat or drink the entire thing and then I come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm actually feeling because that's the most important part of the edible review not necessarily just how it tastes I'm speaking about how things taste I think I'm probably picked up what is going to be the worst tasting edible I have ever had I have got a sneaking suspicion that this is going to be grotesque awful and might even make me gag so I'm really excited about it oh just give a pretty sneak preview there see this is another cannabis syrup I've reviewed one of their 200 milligrams before except I think I've reviewed a couple of their 200 milligrams before and really liked them found the taste to be a little hard to get through with their fruit ones and they've got a tons of fruit flavors all kinds of great cherry strawberry watermelon blackberries tangerine so on and so forth and those are all okay those are all doable but they do have something a little bit special a little bit something different a little bit something outside they're a fruity comfort zone and that's what I decided to go with oh and again this is a hundred milligram edible the first we've reviewed their 100 milligram line we've only looked at the 200 milligram before it cost me $10 or excuse me they cost $10 but I gotten a discount for just eight bucks to a pretty affordable price for this edible or this drinkable whatever you want to call it viscous liquid but the grotesque thing I picked up is the cannabis and it is going to be disgusting chocolate flavored syrup Oh God so this is a canvas chocolate flavored syrup 100 milligrams of THC in there they claim to be ten servings we're just going to do it all at once not going to chug it learn my lesson in the last time and if you look on the back there you can see I don't know how well it shows up but you can see this is actually rated by SC labs independent laboratory body that will determine how much tea is it C is in the product for real so you can feel pretty confident that this actually contains what it says it does all right guys I'm installing I've not been wanting to do this but it's time to it's time to go ahead man up and try this disgusting sounding cannabis chocolate syrup Oh oh boy I mean it smells like it smells kind of like Hershey's syrup it really does with weed and then like this other undefinable pungent something rather bottoms up oh my god it's so thick I wasn't think oh my god Wow excuse me it's like drinking wet cement um wow that is unpleasant it is just so dead there it goes again I'm burping again sorry I just sticks in your throat oh man this is they really taste it to be honest it just was like why does it feel like I put glue down my throat oh it's much much thicker than their other service which are already thick to begin with this is unbelievably thick oh my god here goes another little sip ah it does kind of taste like chocolate jorgito tastes like drinking nesquik mixed with a glue and weed oh well guys I'm gonna finish this off I think I'm about halfway through and then I'll come back to you guys in two hours if I haven't choked to death and let you know how we're feeling thank you so much for watching wheats guys I really appreciate it sorry been rambling here at the end but thanks for watching and I will see you in just a few seconds peace what guys I am back it has been 2 hours since I had the cannabis syrup chocolate oh boy and it was every bad every bit as disgusting and terrible as I had possibly conceived it to be it and that's only in terms of the taste let's let's get that right off the bat and actually it didn't even taste that bad it's just it has the consistency of bull semen so it's hard to get down I mean it's it's it's ridiculous you saw me literally choke on it there for a while so that being said it's great still I these hundred milligram canvases are yeah right at about to say half the strength of their 200 milligram brothers right where you would expect them to be good price eight bucks for this and yeah I'm pretty pleased with it I guess would say I'm pretty pleased with cannabis in general not so pleased with the chocolate syrup I would stick with the fruit flavored ones if I were you guys and I still haven't yet found that magic recipe to make it palatable I know I tried sprite in the past and that didn't sort of work out as well as I had hoped but I will find it because I'm gonna be reviewing some more of these cannabis syrups because I'm still intrigued by them so if I find that magical way out be sure to share it with you guys but otherwise that's gonna do it for this review here on wheats I appreciate you guys watching it as always and we will see you on the next review peace", "cmLmf5v9u0g": "hey guys thanks for watching we're doing edible reviews here on edible expertise um with cannabis being legal in um chicagoland area and and growing to the rest of the united states there's so many emerging players in this market today that we want to not really know what's going on so um we're reviewing the new terabytes today from kiva confections these are the chocolate covered blueberries i got them at new era dispensary down the street on north avenue in chicago check them out for you know your next your next run um but these actually these costs about 40 20 of these come in the 10 and they're 5 milligrams of thc each we're going to give it a taste and come back and see what effect it has so first glances here you can see that all the chocolate covered blueberries are in there um not a bad size not a bad size you know i'm looking for something that tastes good right but um [Music] we're gonna we're gonna see how this goes so let's let's give it a taste [Music] so first initial thoughts really chocolatey um nice and soft too um really good blueberry field blueberry sorry can you top really good blueberry taste as well um overall one of the top tasting edibles i've had and i've had a lot of edibles recently with it being legal in chicagoland area so not bad not bad um so we're gonna wait about an hour and come back and and see how i feel um because you know sometimes i've had 5 milligrams of thc you know i'm gone and then other times i can't feel things so we're going to see how i feel when we get back what's up guys so it's been about 55 minutes since we've taken the five milligram thc edible now again i i take it about i take i take edibles you know almost every day so it's different effect on me depending on the day it's been a while since i've had an edible but yeah this is giving me pretty high feeling it's uh it's hard to explain obviously but uh yeah good a good effect i would definitely recommend uh this is and now i'm gonna go watch some some movies or something but yeah take care", "81YRgf39vtY": "what is up ladies and gentlemen boys and girls it Sheboygan and today we're coming in with the shorter story but nevertheless a [ __ ] bang or hope you guys enjoy drop a like if you do also I do want to mention real quick if you guys haven't subscribed to my second channel my smoking slash gaming channel be sure to do that it'll be linked in the top of the description don't forget to drop a like if you enjoy let's dive right into it so either way eating a thousand milligrams of THC now I don't recommend anyone do this you know that's one thing that I wanna I want to make very clear and the reason that I was able to do this and to an extent handle it I mean I passed the [ __ ] out but to an extent handle it is because I smoke and have smoked a lot of marijuana and done a lot of different things with THC in my life and large quantities so you know I I'm kind of I don't know for some reason edibles just never really get me like that you know like I can't just eat a you know bag of edibles and just get high it doesn't work for some reason with me and I I mean it used to but as I you know kind of progressed and started smoking more and more you know and this happened fairly recently and you know as I started smoking more and more and just getting older and becoming more of like a veteran smoker if you if you could say I guess you know edibles just stopped having an effect on me for some reason it was mainly just dabs and bud that would get me I which I'm ok with and you know it still is that way but you know either way I decided you know can I I wanted to test if I could really get higher or not off edibles like truly baked like how I used to get off the edibles you know I was curious because the past couple times before this that I'd eaten edibles I didn't really get very high at all I had to combine it with you know a couple blunts or something to really get where I wanted to be so you know I had a couple bags I had three bags in total of these edibles that were I think they were I know they were medical they were like actually professionally made not like some homemade brownies or anything they were these little uh these gummies and they were called like terrible's I think I think I've made a video about these before but it was a different story but these edibles were the same edibles in that video so you guys remember that shout-out to you that's an old video I think but either way these things have 400 milligrams a bag so I figured you know my original plan was I'm just gonna eat two bags and then I was like well I kind of just want to get to the 1000 because that's a cool number you know and like I'd been sitting on these bags for a little while I was originally planning to sell a couple of them but I figured [ __ ] it I might as well not you know I kind of like these like they not only you know did they have THC in them and quite a lot but they were actually pretty tasty like there were some good edibles and I've had some edibles that did not taste too good but these are pretty flames you can't really tell that there's Whedon them like if I just put these in a bag I don't think you could tell they're edibles by eating them until you get high as [ __ ] but either way you know I decided I'm gonna eat like two and a half bags and go for that 1000 so off I went you know I looked at the back the dosage was like there was like 20 pieces in each bag so I was like alright I got to eat 50 of these [ __ ] so I literally poured out two bags onto a plate and then I like pulled out ten little like gummy things out of the other bag and I was just like alright I'm digging in so yeah I went pretty ham on it you know I I was on an empty stomach I hadn't eaten and you know I found up and probably a solid like fifteen ten minutes even you know I mean I really I went for it man I went for it man I'll tell you right now and you know at first I didn't really know what to expect you know I this was by far the most I'd ever eaten in terms of edibles and I wasn't really sure what to expect because I figured in my head like that can't be that like insane you know like I'm probably gonna be kind of stone but I don't think I'm gonna be super [ __ ] up but edibles are very different than just smoking a ton of weed edibles you know they're there in my eyes a silent killer they sneak up on you and just [ __ ] you they just do your dirt and let me tell you I was sitting on my couch and I was playing some games I had my Nintendo switch hooked up to the TV it was Boston and let me tell you I was playing tomorrow cart and it just happened man you know I was I got done with a couple races and I didn't really like notice when it hit me but it was very quick you know I got up to grab something to drink and I felt like how do I describe it I felt like those like balloon people out front of the car dealerships those like Wiggly like inflatable tube guys with the flailing arms you know the the family guy like skit they did on that I felt like one of those dudes I felt very very noodley I felt very wobbly and I was I was you know I wasn't really a fan of it but either way I made it up the stairs grab something to drink went back downstairs and just slammed into the couch just absolutely collapsed into the couch I was never so happy to sit back down ever in my life and have an ice-cold water it was so happy it was just a truly a cherished moment a moment of pure euphoria if you will but either way you know I sat back down and I was loving this [ __ ] let me tell ya I was just skirting on Mario Kart playing like [ __ ] I don't think I want any races I played like probably five or six races in a row and I think I came in no higher than fifth in any of them but nevertheless I sure as hell was having fun because let me tell you guys if you if you have a switch you know but if you don't have a switch playing online on Mario Kart is scary because the Japanese guys are really good like the [ __ ] Japanese guys are so good like they don't play but either way you know back on topic so I'm just getting smoked by the Japs dude it's like [ __ ] Pearl Harbor all over again it's terrible and you know I'm eventually I tap out you know I go to play some other games I end up playing some Xenoblade gas game super vague I love the switch by the way this is not sponsored but the switch is a great console it's so convenient so convenient but either way you know I'm chilling and you know I I don't really like I'm not doing anything that takes too much thought so I'm not really like realizing how high I am but eventually as playing games maybe like an hour and a half into it and I hop on my computer you know where I always am the bool spot and you know I'm just playing some games on discord with some people and I'm just something very loud just bangs outside of my house am I getting robbed all right well if I get robbed that would be kind of late for the commentary but either way back on topic hopefully not um you know I was on discord with some buddies playing some games and I I realized as I was playing with them that like nothing I was saying was really coherent whatsoever like I was like I mean I was I was able to talk and conversate but like I was just talking like an idiot pretty slowly and everything I said was just dumb you know like I I just I knew inside that I was just being an idiot but I just couldn't control myself if that makes sense you know I was just being a [ __ ] and I couldn't handle it but either way yeah I was like all right you know I have to plan maybe like two or three games to counter-strike I was like all right I'm going to bed [ __ ] this like I got to lay down or something you know I was slumped because as I was progressing through these games you know counter-strike games are long I played like 2 or 3 games and they're probably like 30 minutes a game you know 30 to 40 so long games so you know after like two and a half hours into my high I was slumped you know and it wasn't like this SuperDuper baked like whoa man kind of thing it was just like the entire thing was very very passive it was like I just I was just chilling you know like that's honestly the best way to put it you know it was a really nice body high you know very noodley just [ __ ] didn't feel like I had any bones you know I just kind of felt like a I don't know dude what doesn't have bones do frogs have bones frogs have bones but not very strong one so I'm gonna say I felt like a frog and it was just some wild [ __ ] it was a fun time but either way hope you guys did enjoy this video a little short story today also on the second channel the smoking slash gaming channel the videos on there are more you know I put a lot more effort into the production of them you know it's a lot more editing a lot more work so it's gonna take longer to get uploads on that channel so please do be understanding impatient with that but yeah that's all I got to say either way thanks for watching hope you enjoyed it see you guys next time peace", "VWrYRMJQJVA": "[Music] is it true buds TV edibles review we're looking at the Chiba choo 100 milligram caramel hybrid it looks delicious I got a discount on this one I think I got it for like 10 they retail for around like 13 bucks which you know for the price that's a little steep I mean there are other ones I think the tootsie roll type the chocolate a fees are around the same price point if I'm not mistaken so let's open this baby up comes a little foil wrap let's see if it's broken into segments or knots okay just like the other ones a little widow can be a little tricky it's not broken up but that's all good so it's a hundred so what I'll do is get about half of that more almost three quarters Panama's case is down pretty strong actually has a nice caramel feel to it though but let's see if it actually really does a trick for the price point taste is good there are no other products are cool too but the price is a little high I'll come back to you in a little while and I'll hope I am just that so it's about an hour and a half later and it's pretty chill laid-back nothing too crazy no anxiety not two blades honestly I thought it was gonna be a little stronger but still decent I'm sorry to say Chiba Chu I will not be buying your caramel again I don't think it's the best bang for the buck but if you are a caramel enthusiast suggest trying it as you can see though I did an evil thing I probably line it up on the chart here I ate probably about 70 milligrams which you know but still cool and I'm not completely hating keep it choose a legit brand this is just the least favourite out of your products for me what if you like [Music]", "vOZQqYB52Lk": "[Music] what's up fun wolf and welcome to wheats the marijuana review show we help you make sense of your dispensary cocoa cocoa classic episode today and that means edible my favorite of all cannabis products we are taking a look at ed abou and I believe our second product may be third from Moon Moon Moon intergalactic milligram each intergalactic milligram each milligrams milligrams so this is a 100 milligrams of they're a rocket fudge sounds good I've had their spaceman mint bar before also 100 milligrams and I found it to be excellent so I'm coming up this one with some pretty high expectations we've got some pretty standard packaging but nice you know it's got everything you want to see on it including the lab testing results right there on the front from SC Labs which is great and then on the back you've got your nutrition information your ingredients and then right there whoops on that side mirrors are reversed it shows you your different ten milligrams serving size suggestions I think they're supposed to have discrete different little things but they don't but who cares and I picked this up from a brand new dispensary in Long Beach opened just yesterday called the lift and I picked it up for 20 bucks which is pretty expensive but not that expensive for a Long Beach okay oh wow and then look at this we've got even more packaging there on the inside with the childproof zipper thingy I think I figured out this one boy I have seen probably probably five that seems about right five different childproof mechanisms these modern child proofing packages I've seen and they're all different and they all are infuriating in their own little ways like this one I can see what I'm supposed to do but the mechanism isn't lining up right let's hope they get this [ __ ] ironed out soon because it sucks not to have that all right oh here we go here are the moon bars there are half of them there all right no there are six so there should be four remaining in here oops and there we go there the other four they say THC on them and this is the rocket fudge let's shut up and stick it in my mouth hall and of course guys I'm gonna be eating the whole thing not just the one ten milligram piece um that eat the whole hundred milligrams and then come back to you guys at the end of the review to let you know how all this is hitting so two hours later I'll come back to you guys mmm yuck as far as chocolate goes that's one of those cannabis tea tasting chocolates I've ever had um this chocolate doesn't mask the cannabis flavor really at all but that could be a great thing I've got my fingers crossed that that means this is potent as hell and they've got a lot of strong THC and vibed weed in there but if taste is important to you stick to your kiba's stick to your defenses cuz this does not taste good I'm actually surprised by how bad it tastes mmm well it does have me optimistic that this thing is gonna rock my world when when we come back so again taste ooh not so great especially for chocolate but it's all about that potency and so guys I'm gonna eat the last remaining six of these and then I'll come back to you guys two hours after I finish the last one to let you know how I'm feeling thanks for watching to this point and I'll see you guys very soon boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom moon moon moon moon moon if I want to get banned from it YouTube I'd show you my ass right now guys it's been about three hours since I actually had moon that's because I was feeling so nice and so relaxed and so high that I wanted to just keep on with that bus and three hours later I am still quite high this is another real win for moon it tastes bad it's one of the worst tasting chocolates I've ever had but but but it is only a hundred grams or sorry grams calories which is so much better than like the Korova mini cookies I know I just had like the Pete's mini cookies and they had 700 calories you had to eat a [ __ ] it tastes really bad to be honest but you have to only eat so little that little chocolate bars only like that big you know that wide so you just you know you can eat it in three bites and be done with it it's not gonna be pleasant but you are gonna get really stoned and you're not gonna have to eat a whole lot if you want to just grab something to split between three buddies pop it in your mouth man this will get three pretty people probably pretty feeling pretty high before like a show movie whatever moon has been surprisingly man for a smaller edible company or seemingly smaller I don't see them a lot of places I have really enjoyed my time with them this is a big big thumbs up for me guys so if you see moon in their rocket fudge or I think I reviewed their spaceman mint before go for it man they're great and guys right before I balance here I'm going to share with you something that is weed related as a cherry on top I knew I normally try to share something without you or share something with you that is not weed related but I want to go ahead and share with you something that you can definitely use I've had this bad way for a year now although it's oddly gross on the top this grinder is amazing Black Tie grinders used it every time I have flour don't really have to clean it very often it's just a very very sharp very very handy grinder I think it cost me 20 something dollars on Amazon you know upgraded from like the two dollar pieces of plastic [ __ ] to something really nice and the Black Tie grinders is quite as as nice as their logo implies so that's gonna do it for this cherry on top and that's gonna do it for this review both great products wholeheartedly endorse both thank you so much for watching to the end you big jerks and by jerks I mean Best Buddies thanks again and we will see you guys on the next review doses", "szIfo0BJMs0": "[Music] there's a color-changing pineapple behind me see know what that means it means it's time for weeks the marijuana edible review show where we help you guys make sense of your dispensary and on today's episode I'm gonna help you make sense of one thing I have never understood at any of the dispensaries I've been to because I have seen this product at practically every dispensary that I have been to and I have never ever picked it up because it always seems like such a bad deal to me and that is cheeba choose as I said I have seen these at practically every dispensary of it around but I have never actually picked them up because they just seem like a tremendously bad value so this is their extra strength hybrid and chew at a hundred milligrams of THC see if we can actually get that oriented properly for you probably not oh there it goes um so yeah you can see hundred milligrams of THC 520 milligram doses but let's look at the back and you can see that price tag they sell this for 15 bucks I got a discount for 13 to 13 dollars for this tiny tiny tiny little thing now I do like small edibles I do actually have always have an affinity for potent things in small packages that's what she said but this just does not seem like it could do the job hundred milligrams isn't that much especially for 15 bucks and it just doesn't seem like it could pack that much of a punch in something this small I mean I've had like the punch bars before which are quite small or I've had the bang the bite and each of those actually had nearly twice as much THC in them as there's this thing did and they were considerably bigger even still so I do not know what to expect I'm hoping because they are everywhere they're sort of ubiquitous that means that there's some reason they're so popular and they're as potent as they are but we're about to find out together all I know is if this ends up being a disappointment I'm gonna have some harsh words for Chiba Choo so I'm gonna shut up now open this up pop it in my mouth poll tell you how it tastes and then I will be back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling although for you it'll be just a couple of seconds okay so I'm unraveling it here comes in it is definitely a caramel I don't know how you would split this in five doses otherwise it's pretty pretty mushy it smells good it smells like a caramel I'm just gonna plunk this whole thing right my mouth I'm gonna do it in two bites just do it in one here we go well maybe actually cut some music in my new tune there we go down the hatch so it taste is good you've got to give him credit for that wow that was a really good taste in caramel perfect sort of consistency very little cannabis taste I was happy with that but what I'm unsure about is how this bad boy is actually going to hit me for that guy's you're gonna have to wait a couple seconds me on the other hand I'm have to wait a couple hours to see what its gonna do to me I will let you know I'll see you guys in just a bit peace it's been two hours guys since I had the Chiba juice and it's just as I feared Chiba I'm afraid I do not choose you it's it's about as bad as I had hoped um yeah I can't say I feel nothing I would say I'm at maybe a three two and a half somewhere in there um so you know not high at all you know I feel something maybe there's sort of the effects after you had smoked a joint an hour later or something just like the echo of a high so it's you know it tasted good I like the taste of the chima choose it's just too expensive for what it is and does not provide enough of a high I have tried other 100 milligram edibles that I've hit harder than this and that 15 bucks for this thing it's just it's it's too much I cannot recommend the Chiba choose at this point I don't think I would be reviewing any more Chiba choose just because you know one and done with this one maybe unless you guys really have some wrong feelings about other ones or if there's something you really want me to review from cheap at you let me know but otherwise this one is enough of a bummer on its own then I don't feel like I have to run down there their entire catalogue I think they have more projects than this I think anyways that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds guys I appreciate you watching as always and I will see you on our next review peace pretty good", "YFKNLym1r3w": "what is up ladies and gentlemen boys and girls it's your boy goblin and today we're coming in with a hoot and a holler hey we're coming in with something a little different a bit of an educational video if you will now hope you guys enjoyed this one drop a like if you do and without further ado let's dive right into it so first and foremost i want to clarify why this video is being made right i get a lot of people coming into my twitter dms or my instagram dm's and they send me pictures of edibles they get and they're these like nerds robes or these gummies or all of these different things and you know up until recently i didn't have as much knowledge on the topic i guess you could say as i did now right like i never really bothered to actually learn much or educate myself because i kind of stopped buying edibles for a while but as i got back into edibles you know i kind of started learning more about what the current street edibles are like and listen alright ladies and gentlemen there's a trend going on that when i mentioned it on stream the other day the vast majority of people in chat not the vast majority but a fair bit of people were like what are you talking about like oh i didn't know that and today we're going to address that right i'm going to give you guys some tips on how to spot a fake edible what a fake edible even necessarily is but first and foremost right i think it's important to note that there's really only two cases where you should even be buying edibles right a go to a dispensary dispensaries have great edibles that are made in ways that a lot of street edibles just can't be made because it requires equipment that is so expensive no dude in his garage is going to have it 99 of the time right or b buy it off a friend of yours who makes it right if you are buying a street edible and it advertises a milligram amount 99 of the time that is wildly inaccurate nothing close to the real dosage right but we'll get to that part later because the real thing i want to push here is like folks make your own edibles okay before i get dive into how to really spot these edibles it's so simple to literally just get together with your homies smoke some weed and cook edibles it's some of the most fun i've ever had in terms of anything weed related making edibles is a blast dude if you've never done it before it's literally it's so easy dude brownies are the easiest thing to make give it a go okay but now let's get into the the real beef of this video okay so first and foremost there's something i want to highlight right not all edibles are made the same way right there's some edibles that are sold on the street you know specifically if you're buying a pre-packaged edible if you buy nerds ropes i guarantee this is probably what you're getting 99 of the time right i know these are a huge trend right now everyone's eating these [ __ ] nerds ropes dude there's probably a few of you guys smacking that [ __ ] right now while you're watching this video okay listen i'm on to you okay i'm on your ass now all right listen so there's different ways that edibles are made edibles of course can be cooked and that's more common when you've got like a brownie or a cookie you know they take an oil or a can of butter and they actually cook something but there's a new and kind of i wouldn't say new but a what's becoming more common trend which is spraying right and a lot of people when i mentioned this on stream the other day this is the whole reason i'm making this video a lot of people didn't know this exists what people will do is they will take distillate and just spray it on the edibles you take a [ __ ] piece of wax paper and you lay it out on a table right and you take nerds ropes obviously are such an ideal candidate for this because you could just put them so tightly together and just spray them down and waste no distillate right so you take this wax paper and you lay these [ __ ] edibles out you lay some let's say you go buy some candy you know you go buy some cheap wholesale candy you lay it out and you just spray the [ __ ] out of it it's so much quicker than actually cooking and think about it for a minute do you really think your plug knows some guy who is handcrafting some [ __ ] nerds ropes one by one in his garage or has like a nerd's rope machine listen there's machines that do a lot of things but there's no machine making nerds ropes and there's also no guy dumb enough to hand roll a bunch of nerds ropes when he knows he could just buy them and spray them and sell them for a shitload of money right you have to understand that this is a very common trend in the comment section i'm actually going to link an article that talks about this right there's a couple articles i found i'm gonna link you guys can actually read some stuff hey you don't gotta believe me that's fine i'm not always the most trustworthy source hey but these articles are okay these will tell you some facts right but moving on from the whole sprayed part there's a couple prop well not moving on but there's a couple problems with it a you don't know what the [ __ ] the dosage is right you have no idea what these people are putting on you can't dose it they're not actually cooking it the spray is uneven but that's really the least of the concerns of the sprayed edible because you have to look more at the fact of like what are they actually spraying onto this product right when something is cooked like you know let's say let's say someone takes an oil or like a can of butter and they make a brownie or a cookie or something like that with it typically you're you're more going to be questioning the strength of it you're not going to be concerned about a synthetic or something fake in it but when you spray an edible you are opening up the door for synthetics to be sprayed on it and this is becoming a more common thing people don't realize that not all edibles even have thc in them sometimes you can get an edible that is just sprayed with synthetic [ __ ] right k2 for example they spray that right that's not like an actual plant they spray some plant matter and you smoke that [ __ ] right they can do the same thing with edibles if they really [ __ ] want to right they can spray it with some synthetic chemical [ __ ] that you don't know what it does to you you don't know where it's from and there's a million different chemicals that they can choose to spray on these edibles and that's why you have to have due diligence when you're buying and you have to look at what you're purchasing and honestly in my opinion the brownie in a ziploc bag is a hundred times safer than your prepackaged nerds rope or sour patch kid is ever going to be okay because like nobody like sure there might be exceptions i know there's of course gonna be that one guy in the comment section he's like well goblin you know i actually have a sour patch kids nerds rope factory in the shed in my backyard and i have over 15 employees churning out nine different machines of nerd ropes you know what good for you you're the one in a million all right but the rest of the people watching this video they aren't in that scenario they're buying it from some guy who is spraying some hoopla right they're buying it from some guy and they're not buying it directly from that guy either it's passed through a hands on hand so you're getting marked up sprayed [ __ ] you're not you're not even getting a good deal on this you have to realize your plug like if you hit up your plug and you asked to buy like a hundred of these edibles in bulk i guarantee you're gonna get some ridiculous price that makes you realize wait a minute how does that even work and i'll tell you how it's probably sprayed specifically if [ __ ] are selling these little nerds ropes or whatever man are these other candies that are on you know trending nowadays you know you go on tick tock and you see these people claiming they they make these edibles you know oh look at these candies brother just spray that [ __ ] dude 99 of the time they don't actually cook something into it but even when they do cook something into it here's the next concern the next concern is that there's no actual viable way of really testing a street edible right you you can't really know you know nobody's taking dispensary weed where they know the exact percentage and cooking it in edibles they're taking street weed that's never been tested and cooking it into an edible that that that's then also never been tested so they really don't know what the dosage is in these you know they could tell you how much they put into it and you can maybe ballpark it but when you get something that is packaged and your plug says yeah it's exactly this dosage don't believe them right if you've got a plug it just tells you yeah these [ __ ] are strong eat half that's honestly probably more reliable going to be a better product than the guy who's trying to sell you some thc milligram that he doesn't actually know exists right so always should have your due diligence and once again this should just be a an advertisement to cook with your homies dude go make some edibles hey go hop in your group chat right now all you need is literally like like a half ounce an ounce and you can make a small little batch of edibles bro that's all you need you and the homies will have a good [ __ ] time you know what i'm saying listen and you don't even need good kush you can get mids bro you don't even need good [ __ ] but hey that's for another video all right another thing that's very important to talk about specifically i see this on some of these right this is a small little disclaimer that we're going to talk about here is i see some edibles advertise activation time and that then and there should tell you to run if if there's ever a packaging on an edible you purchase that says oh man you'll be stoned in 60 minutes oh dude man activates in 45 minutes dude everyone like it's your digestion dude like everyone digests products differently the only way you could advertise that is if you're spraying it with some boo-boo [ __ ] that does actually activate that quick but if it's actually cooked into the product and you have to digest it right that's a whole different story right that's a whole different story and obviously you can't advertise activation time like that so just what i'm trying to say here in this video guys is is really think before you purchase an edible and it's really sad that the street market has become this way you know when i was young and i first started smoking it was just you'd buy some mids and you buy some mid wax and edibles was something you made with your friends out of one of those two things nobody really sold them unless it was your homie with a tray of brownies who was selling them right pre-packaged edibles were unheard of around me right now that's like the norm everyone's selling this crazy carts [ __ ] fake edible [ __ ] it's crazy man and that's why that's why i make some of these kind of informational videos just spread the word about it dude hey man listen if you're a plug out there selling these shits dude you're guilty okay you should feel terrible about yourself but either way hope you guys enjoyed this video drop a like if you did hope you guys learned something let me know in the comments if you did thank you guys for tuning in i will see you guys next time peace and subscribe if you haven't already peace out everyone", "oQhItiXuOJ0": "[Music] parents look closely at this picture it looks like regular coughs syrup if you saw it in your childhood room would you think twice about it it's called cush the drug got a Miami Dolphins player arrested in Collier County this week and then he was cut from the team we sent NBC to investigator David Hodges to find out what it is and you know if these illegal drugs are hidden in plain sight being a big issue for parents and Peter the biggest danger is that they're far more pwned than anything parents may have seen or even tried when they were young so to help your kids we're gonna help you spot them at a quick glance you might not recognize it what does this look like to you ketchup pills that looks like marijuana syrup the final answer is correct Kush syrup found in the car of Miami Dolphins player and Collier County sold in a medical marijuana dispensary in California but not untouchable for kids in South West Florida pretty much everything through online channels you can figure out a way together Steven hill helps kids with substance abuse at Sal's care he says teens will try something like Co syrup just because it's new but I just think it's a different way to do it different and possibly more dangerous syrup has a thousand milligrams of THC the active principle of marijuana per bottle and if taken all at once 10 to 20 times what you're typically going against smoking a joy the side effects would be palpable a lot of times very erratic hallucinations and you can also get psychosis on a temporary basis so the the judgment and your behaviors are definitely impacted grown-ups don't know Lesley Robinson is founder of Street chicks and recovery which runs a marijuana adolescent prevention program in Lee County middle schools she also produces videos helping educate kids about some of the side effects of marijuana in products like Co syrup and it's so potent you're gonna be able to tell your child is high she says the best way for parents to spot these drugs is to pay attention to the new products on the market educate yourself on the other forms besides the bag and the smell the Collier County Sheriff's Office told us they don't recall ever making any arrests where this kind of syrup was down before but many of these drugs come and wave so the best advice for parents be on the lookout if you didn't buy it or authorize it question it for the NBC to investigators I'm David Hodges call email or download the NBC 2 news app and submit your tip now", "LGxMyTPPCDY": "[Music] hi guys welcome to week two the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary today's review we are taking a look at our second drink from the company that I just found out their actual name up I called them dozers in the past because there's the only labeling I saw was this little dozer guy right here I have no idea why it says dozers because the name of the drink is actually G drink by G pharma labs the same people who make the candy bars liquid gold the liquid gold candy bars same people make these make the drinks I didn't particularly like my dreams during class time but I've heard enough good things that I figured maybe I'd give you a second shot so this is a hundred milligram edible excuse me drinkable two servings hundred and ten calories per serving so 240 calories in this bottle it cost $12 as you can see there but I got it nine bucks so about what you would expect for a drink edible they're usually a little bit more expensive and edible but let's open it up here give it a taste and then I will come back to you guys after I drink it two hours is not good there's a very strong marijuana that astringent sort of acidic burning right at the top [Music] so I don't think it's as good as the Cannabis winter or be partly rape or excuse me the habit sparkling sodas but I'm gonna finish it and I will let you guys know how we're feeling in two hours because that's the most important part of the animal review so let's hope this it's us a little bit better than the G drink from last time and I'll see you guys in just a couple of seconds but for me it'll be two hours guys it has been two hours since I had the G drink pink lemonade hundred milligrams of THC and I apologize for the sort of construction going on behind me here doing a little bit of remodeling so I've got the closet covered down so I'm sorry that you guys can't see our fancy star system that's will be back there and I apologize that you're seeing all the mess that's back there as well but you know wall do one thing that I'm not happy to deal with is how unhide I am yeah this G drink is a total total bust just like the other G drink I had before I really don't feel anything at all and it tasted terrible so this is a this is a total bust for me again I can't say I feel high in the slightest and again and it was just the most awful taste going down the worst drink I think I've tasted so far and so yeah even though and it's it's not super cheap at $12 for the for the drink I think I'm gonna I would have to give a hard pass to the G drinks I do have one of their higher potency drinks to review think it's 210 milligrams so we'll see we'll give them another chance on that one to see if maybe they can turn things around but for right now I would tell you guys to avoid the G drinks if you're looking for a drink go with the cannabis quenchers like there's a lot and we'll definitely get you high these here so far the two I've reviewed major duds from me well guys that is going to do it for this review here on weeds thank you so much for watching I appreciate you guys watching it as always and we will see you on our next review peace", "3V4wLZjxwY8": "what's going on you too so I made a video last night and I had some technical difficulties so be sure to hang out you can see it you guys really didn't miss too much but all you really missed is me talking about my ingredients and watching me putting it in and all that stuff but other than that you guys are good and check it out additive you're gonna add to your base very very strong you don't want to kind of make do all this and have it just you know you have to eat 10 candies to do whatever you're trying to do you want to make it worth it spend the money put the effort in and I assure you it'll be well worth it in the end so it's been about four and a half five minutes now and we are just crossing 240 degrees so I like I said this doesn't happen super fast it but once we hit around 270 degrees it will start moving a little bit a little bit faster so when you're flavoring with this recipe you want to use one of these kind of bottles you can get them at a Seymour Michaels any arts of crest or you can get them at Walmart when I went to Walmart they only have peppermint cinnamon and that's not my thing but right here I have cherry and I have an orange oil that I like to add so usually if you're going to say if you're going for lollipops or like life savers or anything like that flavor to get that exact flavor like they come out like it comes out of their factory you want it for this recipe when you use a half of one of these bottles and a half of orange oil bottle and it'll taste just like you bought some lifesavers what the orange oil does adds a little citrus and it just gives a little brightness to it but you don't need that I did a batch with just watermelon and you know I loved them they tasted great it wasn't super watermelon flavored and to be quite honest with you I hate the flavor of water now so these these oils then they they taste great but I know you're probably wondering why you don't add it now so you have it all incorporated it's all said and done well this is a different kind of liquid than what we got going on here obviously so if you added this to a 320 degree sugar base and this will probably burn out see they want you to wait till 250 degrees to add your additives if your flavoring but I feel like that is just way too late of a weight I like to do at almost 275 degrees you're gonna deal a little more heat when you gives you a little bit more time because once you add this stuff this is going to cool down drastically and fast so and one thing you don't want to do with this is mix it around a bunch because if you think if you live in New Jersey you walk along the boardwalk what do they make in salt water taffy so you keep stretching the sugar adding air adding air what's it gonna turn into a taffy it's not going to be as much of a hard candy it's gonna keep out again it's gonna it could turn into a candy corn which is honestly not a bad texture in itself either but it just now we're done for right now well what I like about doing these little candies and gummies and stuff like that is these molds there's so many damn cool molds that you can pick up like a robot dude here it got lollipops dinosaurs and it's like pixelated dinosaurs are pretty cool I seen Super Mario Batman ones like Legos you can actually take the Lego ones and build with them so there's like really cool stuff you could be doing with candy and if you get really good at it you know pull your kids aside and you can do a day with the kids and show them how to make the favorite candies and kids blown away that you can actually make this yourself it'll definitely be way more impressed with this than a batch of cookies that Pillsbury makes just don't have any funny business to it so we're crossing about nine minutes now it's a nine 10 minutes and we are hitting 250 degrees so in about four minutes we only went about ten degrees so once we're all mixed up and our basis set we add our additives we add our flavoring the name of the game is speed and just I don't want to say steady hand because if if you know me I am the last guy to ever have a steady hand you can people will hand me a 2 ounce ladle got a 2 ounce souffle cup and say fill up some butters just the laughs at me because I shake but for some reason I can do this pretty well but you want to almost come down and just go in a line 1 1 1 1 1 if you're just all over the place you're going to lose quite a bit of what you're doing here and nobody wants that but I would say 1 to 2 ounces for this batch usually I do a 2 cup of sugar 1 cup of corn syrup and a half a cup of water and so I'll do it it's basically a double batch of this that I would do 2 to 4 ounces but this I think 1 1 2 2 maybe 2.5 ounces will be good all right it's been about 4 4 minutes later and we are just hitting 290 degrees so I'll check back up at the end a couple of minutes all right it's about 3 minutes later and now we just hit hard crack we're at 300 degrees so most people will want to go to 310 but we're going to 320 so I'll check back when we get there well it's about 30 seconds later we're at 310 so we're almost there so get ready all right so we hit 320 degrees so now what we're gonna do is so now this is a so now this is a hard Canyon and it's going to be very hard it's not going to be questionably hard and it's not going to be and it's not gonna lose its hardness from what we had so now we wait until about 270 degrees and we're gonna add about one to two ounces of whatever additive you're gonna add and your flavor so we'll check back in about five minutes when we get there so what I like to use to make my my tinctures or if whatever I'm going to make the most is I'd like to use either a leave o or a magical butter machine the the two of them it's it's perfect the you can perfectly adjust the temperatures and you could really make it long and really strong or you can make it really fast and get you get it done fast so if you're looking for a way to do it without having to you know use mason jars and stuff like that look into buying a leave out or a magical butter machine those two things makes the process so much easier and not just easier but it makes it stronger and enough of talking we're there so now that we're at 270 degrees we got to move fast so speed and accuracy is the name of the game now do not let any sugar touch you so first get all your stuff ready because you're gonna add at one shot so I'm gonna add my flavoring to my additive half I want of the cherry I'm gonna do and I'm gonna do half of the orange oil now people like to do food coloring and all that you don't have to I don't like it because I just don't like the I like the natural color that you get so this part you don't mix too much the more air you're gonna add the worse off it's gonna look so you got to be fast go okay so we're all mixed up don't know what to do let's go and then we pour accuracy now look guys I have super shaky hands and I'm go it's all about accuracy if you tried to reheat this it would still work but it's not gonna be as clear its goal is is clarity and just like I said if you reheat it you're gonna be mixing it again so you're going to add more air the more air you add the different the texture is gonna get try some of these but a nice steady pour and you could if and when we look you're going to tell that we didn't even have that much waste so this a little bit I got here and the rest I got here I can reheat and I can make other candies so what we'll do now is we're gonna is we'll wait and I'll give it about it don't take long about three minutes five minutes and these things will be rock-hard and check them out so check back in a minute all right everybody we're all done so let's take a look at what we got just like that all you gotta do is pop them out and move and look these things they're rock-hard they don't stick together nothing and you're really that worried you can get some powdered sugar and you're good look at that perfect so I got these little robot guys so many cool things you could do and I got these little dinosaurs so what I like to do is I like to have little ones and I like to have full-size ones because a lot of ones honestly where you're gonna find yourself like in these little small ones the best at least the parquet knees but like I said guys super easy super fast and anybody can do this you've got to get yourself two simple ingredients throw it all together and you're home free you can take these out in the lake with you and your fish and boom you're good but if you guys like what you saw today leaving a like subscribe don't forget to check me on instagram at the edge a chef and a lot of big things happening this week with medical edibles calm which I will be announcing later in the week so definitely be on the lookout for that because there's some big things happening I appreciate you guys watching and as always smoke on", "NCVBujyWvyE": "hi my name is coupons in this video is for mature audience so you better be mature if you're watching this today we are celebrating a thousand subscribers on YouTube that's right a thousand of you awesome people subscribe to my youtube channel thank you everybody who Tunes in and watches my videos and shares them and likes them in comments I really appreciate that holy [ __ ] so to celebrate a thousand subscribers I'm gonna stick to the theme of a thousand and what I've got here is a 1-1 gram snake of some shadow I've stretched out here so we're gonna do a 1 gram damp of some of this grape star shatter if I can get it to focus I picked this up earlier from the hem Center really cool dispensary and this is about who cares what percent 66% but we've got a 1 gram dam which is a thousand milligrams of concentrate and then I also have a thousand milligrams of edibles that we're gonna take today so a 1 gram Babb and a thousand milligrams of edibles do you think that you can handle this what I've got here is the let's get it to focus I have the Colorado cannabis oil capsules and there's four capsules in here and there are a total of 350 milligrams through the whole bottle and they actually make these words four capsules and it's a thousand milligrams but I couldn't find that so these are just I guess less filled and the capsules but let me give you a breakdown we're looking at okay so each capsule is about 93 milligrams of THC and it is full spectrum or RSO so there are other cannabinoids and there's really good stuff I've had this many times before and it's actually my favorite edible so this whole bottle is 372 milligrams of THC and it's not like it's full there's only four little capsules in here and we're actually gonna take we're gonna take three of these which should be just over a thousand milligrams it'll actually be about 1100 milligrams so I'm excited and then I'm gonna try to stream on Twitch after this so this is for a thousand subs on YouTube but you know I stream every night on Twitch if you don't sub to my twitch channel like twitch that TV slash coupons check that [ __ ] out I'm probably live right now if you're watching this and I'm probably not on my thousand milligrams and one gram that but maybe we hit some milestones again I'll do it check out my twitch check out my other social media we have links in the description below follow my Instagram my Twitter sup to the subreddit check out the Facebook I don't know check out all that stuff join the discord that's the good one let's take some of the capsules first maybe like a half now and half after cuz like what if the dev just wrecks me I can I can't continue let's give it a go so this is 350 milligrams for four of these and they're just little capsules and I guess this is the same size for all of them so if you get the higher dose which ones they just they fill more but they have more of the liquid in it early oil so let's go for it let's take a nap now [Music] just little GHC capsules I kappapa movement in this or above okay so that's four of them I think and honestly guys I mentioned it before this is my absolute favorite edible I hate if I want to take a thousand milligrams I usually hate a thousand to get high if I want to take it it's like several brownies or like a fuckload of gummies you know what I mean I'm not trying to eat like a [ __ ] eight ounce bag of gummies to get a thousand milligrams I'd rather just like pop a few capsules and this is actually these are the low dose not like a pop four and get a thousand milligrams some of them are even more potent so I need to look out for those they're hard to find and they're kind of pricey well that's half of it down it's about 550 milligrams of THC here was 1100 for the capsules overall so we have half of that down and let's fire up the let's fire up the nail here we're gonna do this on quartz banger I got the pearls in there hopefully hoping I can get the time right I don't do a lot of dabs on this lately so I'm hoping I get the time right but if not I'm down for four reheats and whatnot we were just gonna milk this a one-gram dab is like it can be a million different things a hundred people could do a a 1 gram them and everybody consumes a different amount so there's different amounts of waste or whatever so I'm just gonna try to go pretty hot minimal waste but you know how it is let's let's see we got here [Music] we got a nice big old Glover here let's see how it looks [Music] oh that's thick [Music] not nearly enough holy [ __ ] [Music] take us amount of oil in there [Music] my eyes are watering [Music] oh it's so hot in here

lollipops though police say they were laced with marijuana and now that girl's mother is demanding answers news 8's Bob Wilson live for us in Hartford tonight with more Bob you know her mother is a drug and alcohol addiction counselor and so she knows what she's talking about she says you know it's a lollipop you've heard of pot laced brownies or cupcakes but lollipops she says she wants to get the word out there about what happened to her daughter they're very dangerous and they mess with their hearts and they hallucinate even knows what she's talking about her daughter became very sick at Enfield high school on Monday and ended up in the hospital her mom says she ate several candy Pops given to her by a friend they were laced with marijuana a bad batch of cannabis pops and she didn't know what she was eating because she's never been introduced to any drugs and she ate three of them and got a bad reaction to it and the toxicologists that a lot of kids are getting sick behind it this afternoon police detained a student at the high school for distributing the lollipops they have made their way through the high school and Eva is speaking out so other parents can warn their kids a lollipop is specifically for kids they're targeting kids yes and we're too close to Halloween so please be careful with these lollipops police say what makes this so dangerous is that the suspect they talked to the juvenile who admitted to having these lollipops had them flown in from California police say they say when it comes in from out-of-state especially like something like that that's untested you don't know what they're putting in it and it can be too much too little or something contaminated the FDA is not overseeing the the strength of this stuff the the cleanliness of this stuff so the puts this stuff in your mouth tonight you know it's just a really foolish thing to do tonight police are still investigating to see how many pops are still out there parents who have talked to their kids about drugs once before will have to do another talk about lollipops you just don't know what's out there you say don't accept candy from strangers don't say don't accept candy from your friend you know it's just very strange very scary for parents and the pot lace pollen lollipops in Enfield were green but we did find them on the Internet we did some digging in some research and found them they come in all colors they're for sale you can actually no order them over on online and police are saying it is illegal and they will follow up on it I'm Bob Wilson

another review today and what we're going to be reviewing today is a product called the blue kuduro pick this up last week as a buy one get one i'm going to try the hybrid version of it today so combinations teva indica and this is made by a company called MIP manufacturer website dub dub dub deep blue kudu calm I'll put that link down in the description 100 milligrams in this bar and it's kind of when they described it to me it's kind of like a tootsie roll so the ingredients on this are chocolate organic vanilla extract organic tangerine flavor oil powdered sugar organic coconut oil nonfat dry milk cocoa powder light corn syrup and cannabis and again there's 100 milligrams in this little nut log here there's a technical difficulty so what I'm going to do now it's also know also here it says new and improved recipe and then I've always loved new and improved always implies that it was old and lousy before so I'm going to take this thing and it doesn't seem to be really very packets friendly here so I'm peeling off the end it's going to peel back I'm probably to take about a fifth of this it's kind of crumbly it's not like a toy Tootsie Roll is kind of like a compressed brown kind of crumbling off as I check yeah it's kind of nasty so when I cough about that much little knife down here I'm very soft softer than a 20 cut off the end here got your rather unappetizing little compressed now and avoid instead of the circle so let's pop this in the mouth and see what happens the very weedy very very weedy and taste nobody would eat this and I realize it's not just a chocolate brownie or chocolate fudge it's got more of a consistency of fudge and then a tootsie roll it's not nearly as chewy but again a heavy heavy on weedy taste and 100 milligrams per log so that would and I pay ten dollars for this now to be fair i got this buy one get one at the giving tree it was a the buy one get one day for selected edibles there but i'm going to evaluate this based on its actual list price so that would give it am milligram per doc milligram to dollar ratio at ten so that's not very good that's Louis one of the three that I've reviewed so far that's it for now if I think of anything else up tomorrow when I come back and give you the evaluation for the actual pain relief and effects I'll let you know well it's next morning now this is the recap of the review of the blue kuduro the 100 milligram hybrid version that I took about a quarter of the roll last night so that should have been around 20 to 25 milligrams and let's recap the taste and consistency well this ain't no tootsie roll you know this kind of way it was described to me at the dispensary this Mort tasted like a dry fudge with a serious ganja funk I mean it was a really strong there's no way you can miss it the aftertaste wasn't bad but not good I've said the consistency was the most unappealing thing about it it kind of tasted like dry dry really dry fudge just like a Elmo sandy taste so with that I have to say I have to give the edible rating of this as six so taste rating on this of the four of them out of the four rating from my scale I give it a six now pain relief this is the high point of this um little long goodie this worked really better than I expected based on its reported milligram content within 90 minutes I was fully medicated and at that peak I experienced a serious body effect I mean it was a significant body effect I could really feel that the pain relief was excellent felt a little heavy in the body but not in an unpleasant way and also a very solid head effect a very lightheaded fat and solid had effect nothing that I couldn't handle it wasn't like I was unable to comport myself in public I would say this hybrid definitely lean toward the indica side of the scale based on amount of body effect but overall very very good lasted also for a very long time the head effects were gone within four to five hours and the body fix lasted until after I fell asleep now so that was 6 plus 6 7 plus hours and woke up this morning felt very good was able to do a three mile mark with a mile walk with minimal discomfort after the way I felt yesterday that was saying something I have to give the coup du roule to some hybrid cooter roll a 9 rating on pain relief so very very good third part of my I'm rating scale is side effects as I said I got a significant amount of body high and that made for some couch lock not bad i mean it i was very very relaxed actually sat through an episode of american pickers and I hate shows like that so I kind of tells you i might have experienced some couch lock but i was stable still able to read in function i was also able to go out into a couple errands so I was not scared to go outside or didn't feel uncomfortable so I'll give this a good solid raining of 84 lack of side effects very good and value this is where it gets hit again this is 100 milligram role for ten dollars that's its list price now I said before that I got it as a bogo the buy one get one at the giving tree so instead of 100 milligrams for ten dollars i got 200 milligrams for ten dollars but that's a sale price and i only go by a retail price for the rating so at the retail price of 100 milligrams per ten dollars it gets the rating at the ratio of 10 milligrams per dollar and that's the worst i've done so far and i'm going to have to give that a value of six on the scale alright in summary that means that you had a 64 taste a 9 for pain relief a sick an 84 side effects and a 64 value that gives you after you / for a ganja geezer rating of 7.25 but actually you notice there it's a 7 I decided that as subjective as these are you don't I'm just going to round down if it's below point 5 on the scale I'm going to round down if it's above point 5 on the scale I'll round up so the actual rating will be a 7 well that's it for now that's a review of this next maybe not next time but I had to mention here that I had a low kudu sativa role which I will be reviewing the future i'll probably do it in a much shorter format maybe just actually do the effects and not the unwrapping and everything just to say how that worked out but until then i'm going to say goodbye and stay medicated you", "Ycpkm2BjNb8": "oh [ __ ] coding my name agile welcome to dab gaming TV I'm your host vory and in this video I have a very special edible for you guys personal favorite of mine I'm so glad we found a box of these hiding out my work because these things are [ __ ] fire you guys heard a keep Cola yet if you have it keep an eye out for these products look them up check them out I mean look at [ __ ] color come on this sells itself people are like what is that I want to I want to know more about that item all the time all day long so this to the best of my knowledge it's like some sort of like blue cotton candy blue berry something whatever I don't know I don't know what the [ __ ] flavor it's supposed to be it's delicious it's really really good you guys a lot of cannabis drinks have a heavy flavor in the background this does not this is super enjoyable I've had their their Cola I've had the root beer I've had the orange cush they're all awesome this is the best one so I bought for today it's like that I just I had to swoop I'm not gonna miss out again and neither are you guys so let's get a little poor upshot here hopefully my camera's gonna focus fire guys be one sec let me check the camera here oh yeah we are in focus and let's go in for this poor now I know it's gonna throw up like a ditch but at the same time I just you know I wanted this shot look at that color that's a [ __ ] trip uh-huh it's just screaming blue right looks like something out of Fallout right let's get you a cola or some [ __ ] it's too cool so my favorite thing about this product is not how it tastes but how it hits it says on the bottle 100 milligrams of THC that's like did I I don't know according to whose standards but this [ __ ] hits like a 150 160 even like a 180 would you know if you guys have had a lot of edibles in the industry right now you know they vary greatly 100 milligrams in one brand is nothing and then 100 milligrams in another is really [ __ ] intense this is one of those heavy ones this is one of this ones it's gonna [ __ ] hit you I'm really really impressed so had one earlier off-camera starting to feel it now we're gonna go ahead and consume two more um um I'm getting set to have a great night yeah so let me finish this one with liquid because I think the cold ones gonna be harder to drink but it'll be more pleasant so trade offs Cheers yeah warmer you definitely taste the canvas isn't it but it's still good it's still really really good Cheers mmm that is the [ __ ] spot oh yeah so I wanted to make this one more of like an official review because of how I feel about this product you guys it's really just super nice it's price point and I don't really want to say well we sell it out if you want to check it out we're on weed maps you know check out some stats a dispensaries would keep colas and it's just one of those things where I feel like you get a lot of bang for your buck a lot of canvas drinks are they're pretty expensive this is one of the more affordable ones I found and it just just works and normally doesn't work but it's really enjoyable to consume and that that for me is just a huge win because there's so many edibles out there that you just kind of have to get through or get through it and then it gives you bubbly guts you know like nasty just feeling like it's just too much so much [ __ ] you know it's just cheers to keep Cola you guys are doing it right much respect from dad even just shits fire seriously super fire so you guys can check out the bottle you can see it's a lot of information on it got this story there it says born in Colorado Keith's Cola and all of its products are intended to provide a breath of fresh air into the world of Medicine we infuse each of our products with premium California cannabis we hope you enjoy oh damn you know [ __ ] anybody from Keith Cola sees this small chance of that but you know if anybody sees this you guys as far as I'm concerned you guys have succeeded in what you set out to do this is truly a breath of fresh air to me it's so enjoyable I love selling it love having hot in the sales room just to show people especially people who dab because they have a higher tolerance and they're not that ain't a bull's a lot of times because they're a flavor person and then I can show them this and honestly say hey you're gonna really enjoy the [ __ ] out of it and it's gonna step very high up to a whole other level you know you're gonna feel like you just dab for the first time again or whatever you're not really even gonna smoke that much and they'll be like what I'm like no really for real come back and tell me what you think and they always come back and in life clock you got any more of this one or whatever it's just like it's just one of those things I love I love it it's so [ __ ] good you guys pop this second one shake it up because if you notice stuff does kind of tend to settle on the bottom I've seen that in like all candidates drinks I don't know what's up with that it's just something into the process and how they infuse it it tends to settle out huh but anyway I had to give these guys a rating out of 10 they're getting a solid nine like not to be [ __ ] with I haven't really had anything on their level and when it comes to a cannabis beverage in terms of like like this is this is dangerously good type [ __ ] like I should say that on the pond start slow dangerously good you know it's these are fire so [ __ ] it's something where if we have them in stock it's this gonna be like god dammit here take my money it's one of those situations for me where I like it I like it so much I like it a little too much dangerous Cheers yeah look at that [ __ ] beautiful we're gonna take a quick death because I just got home from work I'm ready to [ __ ] have a dad all right hopefully I can make this little duct work taking a rip out of that Otis today stuff so [ __ ] good there's just not a lot of edibles out there that I can truly truly enjoy yes you guys I understand you feel me let me know down below in the comments maybe there maybe there's something else I need to try tell me what's up my dad you know kind of awkward but is how we do it purity pure THC a dabs Cheers well that hits the spot after a long day alright so I'm gonna save this last one for my day off tomorrow not tomorrow next day for work tomorrow it's been a long week tomorrow is my Friday so at least there's that huh I look forward to having this one I'm gonna finish this one off camera you guys sigh don't rush it too much but [ __ ] this is this is so far I get if you see them anywhere do not hesitate pick this [ __ ] up it's gonna knock you on your ass and she's really just [ __ ] good my name is vory and I'm the dad demon thanks for watching peace [Music] you", "bo9qKWBA0hs": "yahwah's good you two happy Sunday what's the date Saturday for me but well I I mean but it's a it's gonna be uploaded on Sunday so you're good you're good happy Sunday everyone or Saturday no it's it's Sunday for you now cuz you're seeing this on Sunday but or I mean maybe Monday or whatever day of the week it is today I'm gonna take a bunch of weed pills and see what happens I've taken thirteen before one time but it wasn't it wasn't these ones the ones that I made before when I took thirteen weren't nearly as potent as these these ones I used more reclaim than those other ones if you guys want to see how I make my reclaim pills I have a youtube video up just go to my profile and you can find it so I make reclaim or THC caps with reclaim these ones are pretty strong probably around 60 milligrams each maybe a tiny bit more I'm gonna take six of them right now I normally take two and when I take two I get pretty blazed and a lot of the times often take two and then I'll take two more so on I'm taking four in a day but you know spaced out and then that'll Holly not need to smoke as much because I'll be pre placed throughout the day enough I'm trying to be or whatever so today we'll see what happens if I take six so let's say that let's start taking these I'm really really bad at taking weed pills um just cuz they're fat I mean these pills are you it's [ __ ] hard you miss okay though we'll get to it look into it one we're drinking a mango smoothie by the way right here mangoes help you get more lick if you eat mangoes 30 to 45 minutes before getting late these pills probably gonna take longer than that to kick in but still mangoes I love them what you guys might witness me choke right here in this YouTube video cuz really better taking pills you know we to Ithaca okay number three going in okay gone down easy so far number I think it's the smoothie honestly a thicker consistency drink makes it really easy to swallow fat pills for me number four down the hatch up to number five I did not drink quite enough somebody knew that but it's doing down it's just fine the last but not least not least goodness gracious number six Cheers I almost got that one stuck in my throat but we're good six pills down the hatch a YouTube video though I feel like from me wouldn't be complete without at least a DAB so I'm swiping the wheel off of my fingers they just these ones have a little bit of oil on the outside just cuz I found sitting here for so long sometimes they leak a tiny bit instead did YouTube video for me wouldn't be complete without an ice dam but I'm not yours Emma do you want to die right now all right we're gonna do a dab right now then I was gonna say I'm not sure if I'm gonna do it now or wait like a little bit but then it took a weed pill while ago so I feel like once that starts kicking in she probably won't want to dab so it's perfect timing to take it down right now I'll heat it up and let's get it got that well you know what I feel like I hit the creation in the last YouTube video didn't bring my last video on Instagram last video on Instagram was at that pen in nature let's go for it the konk studios burning tube here nicely clean ready friend Aloha I don't know why I have a feeling that while recording this video the storage on my phone is gonna run out I just have a feeling we'll see so if it randomly cuts out yours like wait a minute this video doesn't seem quite right it's probably because my phone died not my phone dialing my phone ran out of storage recording in 4k 60 frames per second takes up an incredible amount of storage no [ __ ] big files so yeah what I do normally is all I record a video and then I have to edit it right in Adobe Premiere is what I use it's on the phone it's really great for editing for videos like that elissa we're at 5 minutes in 20 seconds so we've got like 6 minutes and 30 seconds will be about damn time so then I'll go and edit it and once I edit and get the full video then it saves again in my phone so it's like I have the footage twice so it's just an insane amount of sort so I've been going back and kind of deleting the extra videos and stuff so we're good on that I actually forgot to grab dams hey babe do you think you could grab some dabs um we have 30 seconds and some papaya and lime warp would be lit gonna go six minutes in oh no I think I said six minutes and thirty seconds tonight in the recording yeah okay as usually I'm not ready at all whew sorry about that babe knows like I just feel everyone else okay going in on the dab cheers everyone might be a tiny bit let's have I mean I need to be here I'm not sure Wow definitely didn't sorry I'll get you're good you did it was my apology long and okay here hit that up really interesting on the temp there but still nice now holy [ __ ] I'm gonna be so glazed when these weed pills kick in oh and we interesting to see what we end up doing today probably some streaming on Twitch yeah some art maybe will be will try to make some music [ __ ] yeah well I'll check back in um and like an hour maybe I'll check in every hour on these weed pills and let you guys know how it's going I think every 30 minutes okay okay every 30 minutes we'll do a quick clip until I start feeling them and they'll tell you guys a little bit more about what's going on so yeah I'll start a timer catch you guys in a sec when I check back in in 30 minutes yeah all right Chiefs it's been thirty minutes actually 35 minutes we just finished some yoga um I mean we took that dab right before so I can't say that I'm baked from the six pills yet but I was laughing while doing that yoga because I was farting a lot yoga always makes me fart I don't know what it is [Laughter] yeah it's all the stretching and stuff so I had the giggles I was like what's this because of the weed pills like you know what I don't think so but my stomach started hurting maybe like 15 minutes after I took the weed pills but it's because I hadn't really eaten much except that mango smoothie right and so I ate a Nature Valley bar and now I feel phenomenal but I mean it's like 2:30 now so I should probably eat some lunch you know actual fat meal you know what I'm saying before these weed pills really start kicking in is what I'm thinking so yeah I think that's next up on the plate is making some food maybe some potatoes oh yeah it's settled making potatoes I'll show you guys what I make alright it has now been 1 hour as you can tell via my eyeballs I'm starting to feel it it took 6 weed pills I haven't dabbed in just about an hour so I could be mine early lit still from that last time for sure for sure but I am NOT just mine early let you see realized pretty nicely blazed right now we'll check back in on another 30 and see if they're fully kicked in and whatnot what's going on I got my eyeballs and they're pretty red right now so see if they get redder if I get more lit we're not thinking about it I feel like thinking about how that I am makes me realize that I am indeed quite blazed already see where it goes see you in 30 peace alright checking in haven't made the potatoes yet it's been at least another 30 or so minutes I need to make the potatoes now and then it's like what type of potatoes are you gonna make I was you're good I'm blazed the pills are working and yeah I got a little cardio in so that was nice you know warm up the metabolism to get the pills going even more so yeah ok let's check back in in 30 minutes or actually I'll check back in when these potatoes are ready which will be 30 minutes we're checking that's like a blanket to see it's like it looks like a blanket but it's a jacket it's like psych Oh underwear with it two things all right so it's been another 30 minutes the potatoes are cut up I haven't seasoned them yet because I was checking my canvas which is freshly rezoned what are you judging how much you think I'm lid off of based off of that's what I thought this is literally reflective now I can reflect a traffic light like oh it's green no I'm just kidding I don't think that's the thing look good at that this one's available on our website links down below alright we're now four hours in since I took the pills and I am blazed I forgot to take I'm so blazed I forgot to take a video of the food I literally just ate a ton of potatoes some turkey sausages and some guacamole I like to dip turkey sausages in the guacamole and then yeah and then potatoes and I just ate all that and now I'm just like yeah [ __ ] yeah so I think that uh Senna and I are gonna finish watching this episode of this dank show we're watching and then we'll see where the day takes us after that you know what's good YouTube its cosmos and as you may have noticed it's not the same day as I was just recording and that's because I kind of fell asleep last night I mean I definitely stayed up pretty late but I forgot to keep recording about how late I was I was pretty damn blazed overall I would say but I figured since I forgot to record it again we'd wake up and do it all over again cheers [ __ ] let's get it we'll take when I take six pulse we'll take five bills right now I got pretty blazed yesterday we'll get pretty blazed once again today we're getting kinda low on the pizza Oh kind of low on the pills and I have to make some more soon let's down these five pills take a DAB to start the morning off and we'll

"what's up family and how we doing tonight and welcome to another great episode of Bammer TV I am Dave your host as always and don't forget to tune in to the weed reviews playlist we are posting a new weed review every week or two weeks right now so definitely tune in for that but today I want to give you a quick little how-to video on something that we really should be thinking about a little bit more and that is how to accurately dose your edibles the big thing with this is you don't want to accidentally give anyone an overdose it is possible to overdose on edibles I have done it it's not a very fun time what I want to tell you guys is how to accurately dose your edibles and it's actually a fairly easy process as long as you have all of the right information what information do you actually need for this process you need the accurate test results for your butt or your trim whatever you're using for your edibles and you need a reliable method of extraction and a reliable method of integration or homogenous ation into your edibles to make sure that it's fairly dose throughout the entire batch and not just you know you have one cookie that's 500 milligrams you have another cookie that's 10 so you take your test results from your reliable lab or however your tester marijuana and you take the number that is the percentage of THC so the average is about 24 so let's go with 24 for today so if you're T of your weed has an average of 24 percent THC in your test results that breaks down to 240 milligrams per gram if you're not good at math here we go one gram is one thousand milligrams so if you have 24 percent of that is THC you know that it's 240 milligrams per gram is THC so what do you do with that information you take that number times it by however many grams of marijuana you want to add into your butter oil tincture have whatever you want to do and that is your total dosage for that product say your you use 10 grams of 24% THC marijuana so you know that your batch currently has 2,400 milligrams of marijuana if you're using this in edibles and say you're dosed in your butter the same way and you want to make sure you get 12 cookies out of this batch you take your 2,400 milligrams of THC divided by 12 and now you have 12 200 milligram pieces to enjoy as far as dosing for beginners and whoever else may be eating these you have to understand when you consume edibles your system intensifies it there's an enzyme in I believe it's your liver that transfers the Delta 9 THC into Delta 11 THC which is approximately four times more potent so you have to be very careful when you're dosing your edibles because even a dose of 50 milligrams in your system is more like 150 to 200 milligrams so you really have to be careful with this stuff that being said guys remember you need accurate test results from your lab you need accurate and reliable homogenous ation skills to make sure that everything is completely incorporated throughout the entire batch and then you need to be able to do some basic math that's my little spiel for today I hope you enjoyed it like I said in the beginning tune in for more weed reviews and other marijuana product reviews and like I said I'm Dave from Bama TV pleasure as always and I'll be seeing you there [Music]", "D8xmdJWgNG4": "welcome to episode 5 of mmm medical edibles my name is chef Tanya Nicole I'm a chef and a culinary nutritionist what and today I'm going to teach you how to make cornbread we're gonna make both a sweet and savory version we're making this cornbread recipe for reggae legend Stephen Marley this is the funnest night today's episode is sponsored by apple and the new comedy web series the weekend warriors it's adult humor with a lot of cannabis go to our playlist section if you'd like to see a preview what are you talking about again before we get started subscribe and click the bell so you get all of our notifications you're gonna start off with Keith if you need to learn how to do car beep check out episode 3 on our playlist you'll also need kosher salt pepper chipotle chili pepper all purpose flour sugar cornmeal evaporated milk and honey eggs unsalted butter spraying vegetable oil cheddar cheese liquid smoke roasted corn roasted jalapeno bacon and spam good luck with it for today's recipe you'll need a cutting board and knife a spoon a spatula a whisk measuring spoons measuring cups something to portion out your mixture my god are you still talking you'll need a saucepan a sifter or if you don't have a sifter you can use a small strainer and several mixing bowls of different sizes you can see here that I have a very large loaf pan because I make a few of these what I like to do is I cut a piece of parchment paper that would fit the bottom of the pan I spray the pan with some canola oil and then I just place the parchment paper on the bottom there that way when you go to take your lows out they'll come out really easily I like to be preventive spray it and that way no one's gonna come out [Music] you want to pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees we're gonna start off by measuring and sifting our flour we're gonna do two cups of flour for this recipe and I usually just put my sister right over the bowl the great thing about this recipe is all the dry ingredients go in One Bowl and all the wet ingredients go in the other okay if you don't have one of these sifters here you can use a strainer now when measuring anything if it tells you one cup to cup whatever the measurement is you want to make sure you get a full cup and then you have a nice full measure and now it goes right in the sifter I get most of it in there if you look at the texture of the flour you'll see the difference we want to separate the flour by sifting almost as if they were individual particles we're gonna measure two cups of cornmeal I happen to like to use Bob Mills and this is a medium grind you can find it fine grind I just happen to like medium and that means the coarseness of the green a good idea is to measure right over your bowl that way if you spill you don't make something so much of a mess and then again just like the flour you just want to make sure you get a complete measure now because it's a medium grain there may be some pieces that don't get sifted and that's fine again I'm just sifting what I can liking it a very light airy texture right hey why hear the most annoying sound in the world those are the thicker grains so you see the thin ones next we're gonna do 1/2 a cup of granulated sugar 2 tablespoons of baking powder 2 teaspoons of kosher salt there's so many things about what you just said that make it not coated sift it into the mixture and again if you have any particles left over you can push it through with a spoon or a spatula our final dry ingredient is Keef we're gonna decarboxylate Lynn to deke our beer Keith just put it in the oven at 300 degrees for seven minutes then you want to let it completely cool before you add it to any item now let's add some Keith we're using three grams of key mix thoroughly with the whisk if you find that you have some large Keeffe lumps in the batter you want to make sure to just pop them in between your fingers well before you add the wet ingredients so you bet your Keef is evenly distributed throughout your batter when you D carb the Keef it really compacts together for our wet ingredients we're gonna start by melting two sticks of butter all of our ingredients have been taken out of the fridge so that they can come to room temperature before preparing this recipe if you don't have key if you can use cannabutter instead we're gonna put this on a low to medium heat we just want to completely melt the butter so that we can add it to the other wet ingredients start with 2 cups of evaporated milk you're gonna need about 1 and 1/2 cans I love evaporated milk because I can just have it in the pantry so if you store it in an airtight container in the fridge you can use it for other recipes if you want to substitute with regular milk you can do that next 4 large eggs you want to crack them in a separate Bowl in case you get any shells or the egg is rotten that way you don't mess up the entire batch let's add the melted butter lastly we'll do the honey and then we can start blending everything all together you want to use your canola oil or your vegetable oil to spray your measuring cup we're using 1/4 of a cup of honey spray it lightly I happen to be using organic honey do-do-do-do-do-do sidenote if you eat local honey it'll help your allergies if you don't have cannabutter and if you don't have Keith you can use infused honey now give it a good whisk you want to make sure that the egg yolk and the egg white have completely blended with the rest of the mixture I like to try to break the yolks before I scramble them before I mix our dry in our wet ingredients I'm going to chop up the rest of the ingredients for our savory cornbread you don't want to mix your dry wet ingredients then go chop everything then add it to the batch you want to get them in the oven fairly quickly because you don't want the batter to sit for too long so I have five pieces of bacon here you can add more or less depending on your liking let's celebrate with bacon for Stephen Marley I'm gonna give him the honey cornbread a lot of people don't eat pork so this way I ensure that he actually likes what he gets and this will be for the savory recipe again I love bacon so these will be perfectly fine safe here with me bake off we're gonna slice up some scallions I think I'll only use form these I like to use the green and the white part of the scallion I already roasted the jalapeno pepper and the corn and all I did was take each one and put them on top of the gas stove burner and then I'll turn it ever so slightly as it gets charred you don't have to do this but I like that it adds a smoky flavor the bacon is smoked the corn and the jalapenos are roasted and that'll add another layer smokiness as well so I like to cut the little stem off and then you want to put your hand flat and curl your fingers up and run the knife through the middle of the jalapeno looking as you're doing it and then we're just gonna cut this little membrane out putting about shut up and I'll make sure to take out all the seeds as well you want to just give this a nice mince so that you have small pieces of the jalapeno throughout be careful after you've handled jalapeno your hands are very spicy so even when you wash your hands be careful touching your eyes anywhere on your face or your southern regions I'm gonna cut the corn in half that way it's easier for me to get the kernels I'm off you're gonna make a little well right in the middle and then we're just pouring the wet ingredients right in you don't want to over mix this you want to mix it until it's just well combined so make sure you get all the edges the sides and the bottom you just want to make sure there are no dry pockets as we mix it you'll see the flour absorbing the liquid so this recipe is done if you just wanted to make the sweet honey corn bread you can make your recipe out of what we just did but since I want to make a savory batch I'm gonna split this batch in half and then add the rest of the ingredients to the second batch on bread we divided the batch in half we have a total of six cups there are three cups here now we're gonna add all of our ingredients for our savory cornbread we're gonna add a cup of extra sharp cheddar cheese if you go a little over it's okay make sure you break up all the corn kernels you want about a cup we'll do bacon we need every last job there's so much beauty in the world scallions jalapenos we're gonna add a good amount of black pepper and half a teaspoon of chipotle chili pepper mix well to combine I'm gonna start with the sweet honey cornbread if you want some cornbread let him go up to the front get his own portion of cornbread that's your call babe I'm using this I can get a uniformed portion size you can use a measuring cup or anything else that you have you want to fill each mold about two-thirds of the way up so that it has room to rise now we'll portion out our savory cornbread I like to put out all the way on the other side of the cake pan so that I know which are which but these are very visibly different then you want to make sure you don't fill it all the way up to the top we have a total of 15 corn bread loaves some sweet some savory we use three grams of Keith and each loaf is 120 milligrams we're gonna put these in the oven at 350 degrees for 30 minutes while those are baking this is a perfect time to take a break a smoke break so roll up a joint pack the bomb take a dab whatever you gotta do it's a bit COO so I personally don't mind the spice in the jalapeno cornbread laughs no but if you don't want it to be spicy you can omit the jalapeno and you can omit the smoky Chipotle chili peppers jalapeno ocula ethanol for the sweet honey corn bread loaves that we're giving Stephen Marley I'm gonna let them completely cool and then I'm gonna decorate them the cornbread has completely cooled you just want to take a regular money and just use it to pop out the corn loaf and as you can see it popped out really easily sometimes the parchment paper will stick to the bottom of the loaf and just peel it off as you can see the parchment paper didn't come off with this one let's cut each loaf to see what the inside looks like because it's the inside that counts each loaf is 120 milligrams so I like to cut it into four pieces look at how delicious that looks you see the medium grind cornmeal it's nice and fluffy it's nice and golden brown on the outside nice and area on the inside you can see the medium cornmeal grinds now we're gonna cut it into our savory cornmeal loaf this one has smoked mesquite bacon with jalapeno peppers and roasted corn scallions and extra sharp cheddar cheese and did I say bacon you can see all the components in this loaf that make it delicious I'm gonna design a Jamaican flag what part of Jamaica for the sweet honey cornbread that I'm gonna give to Stephen Marley first we're gonna add the yellow so that we have an outline for the rest of the triangles for the green part of the flag just gonna use some candy melts with that color I've melted it here then I'm gonna take it and spread some on and you're just gonna spread it just like if you were spreading peanut butter and then I'm gonna take my small knife and I'm gonna lightly press it to the edge you want to be careful as you work towards the edges for the black I'm using already dyed decorating I see it's just confectioner sugar with some water and then some dye added to it that's exactly what I did with the yellow just take your time if it gets too cold you could stick it in the microwave and that will soften it up now that we've finished all the colors in the flag we're gonna re out line the yellow here they are sweet honey cornbread for Stephen Marley I hope he likes them it was an honor to bake for a legend like him and then what's good like a pinch what a great guy and great hospitality and for everyone else we have our smoke mesquite bacon with jalapenos and scallions and extra sharp cheddar cheese and roasted corn it's gonna wait

your dog [Music]", "5-gIY7HuJNo": "they honestly turned out so good and I'm also going to show you guys how to make a coating on them that's like sour and fizzy kind of like on like the root beer ones you can buy at the store so these are actually like legitimate gummy bears instead of just like Harding jello like a lot of recipes have let me just show you them so you can see the texture of this is like really sticky this is what's making your gummy bears actually be like real store-bought guy bears and not just jello so here's the texture of the gummy make sure when it's still warm so you can really see that string yes this is just like candy nothing like just hard jello that you see recipes for so you know this is gonna be a good one so chewy just like the ones you buy in the store like they're so stretchy just like a gummy bear and like they're fizzy when you eat them so good hey guys welcome back today I'm going to show you how to make Mountain Dew soda bottle gummies I'm going to be using coconut oil to infuse mine but you can use butter or a tincture all three of those options will work for this recipe you're going to need some soda you don't have to use Mountain Dew you can use whatever flavor you like you'll need some jello I chose line because it's the closest to Magic Mountain Dew without like over powering and I'm do flavour some gelatin citric acid corn syrup lecithin potassium sorbate mixture which will keep your products shelf stable so you don't have to put it in the fridge you can just keep it in a drawer or in your car or whoever and I'll post the link for how to make this and some coconut oil you can also use butter or a teacher I actually would prefer to use a tincture for this but I don't have any right now so I'm just going to use coconut oil I made them last night and they turned out really well with the coconut oil I feel like you can taste the coconut oil flavor a little bit more than if you were to use like a tincture but whatever you would like to choose you can use because I made quite a bit yesterday for this recipe I'm going to do a smaller amount in the description box below I'll put the measurements for what I'm doing today but you can make whatever amount you like just multiply the recipe I have it below to make this recipe we're going to have to reduce our soda so that we can get the flavor without too much liquid we need half a cup of soda and then we're going to reduce it to a quarter cup alright we have half a cup here we're going to put on a stove on high and we're going to move let this cook for however long tanks to do half of the mixture so I'm just kind of going to have to eyeball it and see where it is and when it looks like it's a little bit lower I'll pour back my measuring cup and see where I'm at so we started with half a cup so we wanted to be 1/4 cup this will probably take about like 15 minutes now that we have our soda on the stove reducing we're going to prepare our gelatin so we're going to put 1/4 of a cup of our soda into a why dish dish so 1/4 cup and we'll just pour it into a dish and then we're going to put our gelatin on we need one and a half tablespoons of gelatin alright so we put 1/4 cup of soda into this bowl and then we're going to sprinkle a tablespoon and a half of gelatin on top so we're just going to sprinkle it lightly over so we can get as much much coverage as possible so that's one tablespoon and then we're going to do half tablespoon for a total of one and a half tablespoons then we're going to add 1/4 to 1/2 of a jello of flavored jello pack so yesterday I made these with more regular gelatin and no jello pack I need these ones here and while he turned out good I felt like the flavor wasn't strong enough and it needed like a little bit more flavor so I thought this time around I would add a little bit of jello so it can be anywhere between a quarter and a half of this depending on how much flavor you think you want so you can always take this out and measure it but I can just eyeball it we're going to sprinkle this on top so it may be like a third of it and then we're just gonna leave this we're not gonna stir it in we're not gonna do anything with it we're just going to leave it here and by the time you get back around to it most of the gelatin will have absorbed absorbed into the soda now we're going to add an a quarter of a teaspoon of this potassium sorbate mixture again I'll put a link down below this is gonna help it so you don't have to keep it in the fridge you can keep this outside in the fridge it's just like regular got me to buy from a store and then we're going to do a quarter teaspoon of citric acid the citric acid is not necessary it's just if you like them a little bit more sour if you don't have citric acid you could crush up vitamin C tablets and those who work as well so we're doing one quarter teaspoon and then we're gonna add in a teaspoon of lecithin I only have the pill capsules cuz that's what was cheaper for me to buy but if you can buy the liquid kind it would be a lot easier because it'll save you from having to bust these open now my coconut oil already has less of shin in it so I'm not going to add too much this mixture but if your coconut oil doesn't have less its it lecithin in it then you might want to add a little bit more of this so I'm just gonna do one for mine if I had the liquid kind I could just pour oh I probably would just do a quarter teaspoon so this is gonna help bind the coconut oil together with the gelatin liquid mixture so that our coconut oil doesn't separate from everything else and like I said I have more of this already in my coconut oil so I don't need too much in here but if you don't have any in your coconut oil you're going to want to add a bit more to your jello mixture and I barely even got out any with the pills really actually just by the liquid all right now let's check in on our soda we started with half a cup and you need to reduce it to a quarter cup so I'm just going to pour it directly right back into my measuring cup and see we're at all right looks like we're exactly a quarter cup which means I probably should have checked on this sooner that way I couldn't have reduced it too much but if you do end up reducing you too much just throw it away and do it again soda can always be replaced all right so I'm just going to pour my reduced quarter cup of soda back into the pot and then I'm going to add a quarter cup of corn syrup now this is the most important thing for your gummies to be like a real store-bought gummy so corn syrup helps but will helps the most is having the sugar heat it to a high enough temperature to get it almost to the softball stage so I'm gonna use a candy thermometer for that I know most people aren't going to have one of these but if you are planning on making gummies often I usually just purchasing one they're probably like something like ten dollars and they can be very helpful with making your dimes so I'm trying to put it on here and we're going to try and eat this to 230 degrees Fahrenheit now because you guys most of you guys won't have a candy thermometer I'm going to try and see if I could help you out by just telling you the time so I'm going to turn this on high and I'm going to set a timer on my phone or a stopwatch so I started to now and we'll see what time rats when this is got into 230 degrees Fahrenheit all right so we're four minutes in and we're at 180 degrees Fahrenheit and we're waiting for this to go to 230 degrees Fahrenheit so it looks like it's starting to thicken a tiny bit but it's still pretty much all liquid it will started thinking a bit when it gets closer to 30 now you want to be careful to not go over to 30 that's why having a candy thermometer it's good because if you don't have one you can easily within 30 seconds to a minute go over temperature and then it becomes too hard so while having it to that higher temperature we'll give you that real kind bear consistency if you don't have the candy thermometer just ear on the side of not too long because you don't want to ruin it but luckily this is just sugar and soda so if we wreck this mixture and just throw it away and that's why we add the coconut oil after so that we make sure that this mixture is perfect before we add our coconut oil or a tincture or butter that way we're not risking wasting it all right we're at 210 degrees and it's moving up fast so we got to keep an eye on it now now I'm not gonna leave I'm not gonna leave this unattended I'm just gonna watch it up until the moment it gets to 230 Thunder 8 minutes and we're at to 3000 or at 2:30 so we have to take this off now take that off the heat immediately see how fast that happens holy yeah eight minutes on high heat okay this is getting a little too hot so I'm gonna go hold it by the fridge so it doesn't heat up anymore all right so we see how fast the temperature can go up so if you don't have a candy thermometer be very careful to really not let it get too hot you do want it to get as high as you can safely without your candy thermometer because that is what gives a texture the gummy bears but it is hard to do it with other thermometer so I just took this off the heat and left it for about like five minutes so I can demonstrate to you guys what happens here so you can see the texture of this is like really sticky this is what's making your gummy bears actually be like real store-bought guy bears and not just jello so this is the key out this they're just going to be like hard and jello so that's kind of like what it looks like and this is gonna melt back down when we put it back on the stove and mix in our coconut oil now I'm going to turn the heat on like medium I'm going to add two tablespoons of my coconut oil so have some medium heat and stirring in the coconut oil with the soda and corn syrup mixture that we just brought to 230 degrees now we don't want to add in the coconut oil right after it hits 230 we want to take it off the heat we want to let it cool for a little bit like I would say five minutes is fine because we don't want to be adding the coconut oil for something that's 230 degrees because that's too hot all right we're just stirring this in and you can see that it's not actually combining so there's the oil and there is the corn syrup mixture so we're going to need to get a whisk to combine this a little bit better now we're just going to try and stir like this we don't want ki to be too high medium or medium low is good now we're gonna add in our gelatin mixture which is gonna help bind this okay this is getting too hot you can see so I'm gonna turn the heat down to low just take that off for a minute so don't have that I'm too high I would say medium low will be perfect now we're going to add in our gelatin mixture so clearly I had that too warm I should not be bubbling that much so I know I said to put it on medium heat do not put it on medium do medium low or low okay now we just have to be patient and let it melt a bit more so this is the hardest part is getting this all to combine because the texture of the corn syrup might stay chunky and then it won't mix properly but if we keep it at a low enough heat and mix it in with the whisk we should be able to properly combine it and you do want to make sure you have the lesser thin to help emulsify it so this is going to take a while probably going to take about five minutes with me stirring this all in make sure you're patient and you don't turn up the heat trying to melt this fast because that just won't work out well so just keep it at low or medium low to stir this in and do it slowly and by slowly I don't mean whisking slowly but just take your time you can see the chunks are less stuck together now it's starting to combine now you want to make sure before you do this you have your molds prepared so just lay your molds oh and put them on a tree that way as soon as this is done you can pour them in the difference with this and most of the gumming recipes you see online is that this one has a different texture using that corn syrup and heating it up to that own soft ball point so it does harden really fast it is really sticky so once this is done and we're going to want to put it into the molds as soon as we can so I've been stirring this for close to 5 minutes now and almost everything has combined just a couple chunks left on my whisk so I'm just going to push those out with a spatula she's looking really good you can see it has that stringy texture it's not just like liquidy so it looks like it's just about all mix perfectly - that one little chunk there and this took about ten minutes of slowly stirring incorporating on low heat so now we're going to put this into our molds I'm using one of these to put it into my mold but you can also use the little droppers that works fine I just find that this is easier and if you're making a lot of gummies this is really useful overtime to spend like five dollars or whatever it was now I'm going to turn the heat off and pour this mixture right into my little squeezy container if you're going to use the little dropper you can put this on a hot pad and do it directly here whatever works for you okay now use ones I guess that's just a snack for me so that's alright so here's the texture of the gummy make sure when it's still warm she can really see that string yes this is just like candy nothing like just hard jello that you see recipes for so you know this is gonna be a good one so chewy just like the ones you buy in the store alright so I just wrap a towel around here because it's a little bit hot and it's right off the stove and I'm just going to put these into all of my molds you can also just use any molds going bury molds or find you now let's just put these into the fridge it shouldn't take too long probably about 10 minutes all right now we'll just take them out of the mold they were in the fridge for about 20 minutes you can see how they're kind of different than regular jello gummies like they really have that like that sticky gummy bear texture and that stickiness will go away after they dry out for a bit and we put their coating on you all right so now for coating on them I did in three different ways I did one with sugar coating one with a fizzy coating and then some with no coding so the ones on the top here I was just sugar so I just shook it in a container of sugar and put it back on the tray and then for the fizzy coating it's one third of a cup of sugar one teaspoon citric acid and then I'm going to say 1 teaspoon baking soda but that was too much baking soda so do half a teaspoon baking soda instead so here's that teaspoon of baking soda but like I said we're going to use half a teaspoon not a full teaspoon like I did you could taste it too much and I'm just gonna mix that up quickly once I just shake that up I'm gonna add the gummies into it shake it again and put them back on the tray the one thing I do want to mention with this recipe is you can put them in their sugar or citric acid mixture as soon as they come out of their mold whereas with some of the jello recipes you need them to drive it first these ones you don't need to do that so you can put them on right away in that way you can make sure they really stick whereas if they get too dry they won't the sugar won't stick to the outside of the gummy and if that does happen to you you can just spray them with a little bit of water and just wipe them off so they're a little bit damp and that stickiness comes back and that should work for you quite honestly I kind of enjoyed them with nothing on them the most but I really did enjoy the fizzy sugary coating anyways that's all you guys I hope you enjoyed this video please comment if you try it out and if you did enjoy it please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe I hope you guys have a wonderful day", "NiaPli8UDB0": "welcome to episode 4 of mmm medical edibles I'm chef Tynan Nicole chef and culinary nutritionist and today we're gonna make flavored candy also known as Jolly Ranchers this episode is sponsored by fat bull and the new ill-mannered film series custom agents check it out on our channel in our playlist section the following are the ingredients you'll need to make the candies okay today's ingredients are sugar light corn syrup flavored oil food coloring water vegetable oil Keith and confectioner sugar for this recipe will be using Keith if you'd like to learn how to deke are pure Keith you can go ahead and watch episode 3 this Keith is from this tangerine dream are you high for today's recipe what you'll need is a candy thermometer a pastry brush and several spatulas I prefer silicon some candy mullets metal measuring spoons and a large saucepan start with your large saucepan our first ingredient is 2 cups of sugar and I like to sift the sugar in case there are any large lumps that's annoying next we'll add 3/4 cups of water which I've already pre-measured here for this next part I recommend you pre grease your container with a little bit of vegetable oil spray that way the corn syrup won't stick to it and you'll get the correct measurement oh yeah got any grease yes I also recommend you do this with your spatula as well and your measuring tool I'm just gonna use this to make sure it's all coated okie dokie for this we're using a 1/3 measuring cup all of the tools have been sprayed with vegetable oil now we're going to measure out the light corn syrup we need 2/3 of a cup so we'll measure 1/3 of a cup twice you can see that the syrup is not sticking normally you have to fight for it to come out we're gonna do this again now that we've measured out our corn syrup we'll just add it to the rest of the ingredients and you can see how easily it comes out of the bowl now we're going to take this over to the stove this next part of the recipe is going to take some time so you want to make sure that you can really pay attention to the saucepan on the stove you want to watch what you're doing make sure you're not on the phone or distracted you don't necessarily have to attend to it in terms of storing or mixing it but you were going to be watching the temperature because we want to make sure that we get the right consistency for our Jolly wrenches it can go from soft candy to hard candy to burn candy the mixture can easily burn and then the taste is going to be really off you'll still be able to eat it but probably will not be enjoyable so make sure you have time to pay attention that way you won't have to start over from scratch and waste your batch you want to turn the stove on to a medium heat you're gonna stir your mixture until the sugar dissolves you can see that it's sticking a little bit so just put some elbow grease in it oh that's greasy that's really [ __ ] I said yeah it's greasy get in the corners because sometimes the sugar tends to clump up together on the bottom and then once you see the sugars pretty much dissolve you can just leave that alone we're gonna use our candy thermometer and you want to make sure that you don't put the bottom of the thermometer to the bottom of the saucepan because then they'll give you an inaccurate reading I put a little bit of water in here what you're gonna do is you're going to take your pastry brush and just dip it a little bit in the water and then I'm gonna wash down the stuck sugar crystals onto the mixture you don't want that to interfere with how the candy comes together you can see that the mixture is coming to a boil and that's perfectly fine we're waiting for it to reach 260 degrees so once the temperature of the candy reaches 260 degrees you're going to add your food coloring okay you can get this at any grocery store and we're actually gonna do the mint green color for the green apple flavor that we're doing today and that's just following the instructions on the box start with nine green drops and 3 yellow drops and then we'll see what that looks like and then adjust the color accordingly if we need you we just need about one or two more degrees some more and then we can add the food coloring one two three nine well once you've added the food coloring you're not going to mix it at all you're going to just let the boiling action mix it itself it looks like it's a nice bright green I added a little bit more yellow because it was just a little bit too much of a grass green than a green apple green I passed on grass all the time the minty green gives more of a green apple tone to it we've pulled the pan off the stove at 300 degrees we're gonna add green apple flavoring to this I'm adding a full tablespoon you want to keep all of the essential oil with in the saucepan and now we're gonna add our Keef as well now remember this has already been decart so we don't have to worry about that and we just need to get it off the paper there we go star very quickly you don't want the essential oils to evaporate completely this may smoke so I have my lid ready and because we're using Keith versus BHO you may not have the same uniformity but this came out really really good all right we're gonna lift the lid on and now you're gonna take your candy moles and spray them with vegetable so the color looks really good I try not to over pour it if you have someone that can help you they can kind of shimmy the candy tray so that all of the portions are pretty equal I've done this several times so I have a pretty good grasp on it the colors of these Jolly Ranchers look really really good they're really bright and green they have a uniform texture to it you can't see the keep at all I can't even see it in these when you pour these you want to have a very steady stream and a steady hand the higher you go the smaller the stream will be but just remember that the candy cools very quickly you just want to make sure that each one has about two-thirds full these green Apple Jolly Ranchers are for Bernadette price we'll be seeing her later in New York what would be filming a video for the new Sean price out and they have compressed show senator so they don't we'll put a link to it in the description I hope you like them you want a lot of these two completely cool for this recipe we made 200 pieces using five grams key so I use all silicone tools because as you can see the candy is all on it all up on it so I usually just run it under hot water along with the saucepan and any other tools and I find that it cleans very easily some of the mixture fell onto this silicone pad that I have here and that's actually completely cooled it cooled we're gonna stack the candy rolled trays just the silicone mat with confectioner sugar and then we can pop them out of the candy molds that will prevent them from sticking to each other I also have a container with the lid that also has confectioner sugar on the inside and then we can store them into the freezer [Music] by spraying the moles with vegetable spray it allows that the candies come out very easily you can see that there are really nice bright green the Keef is evenly distributed throughout the candy you really don't see very many speckles at all if any I like to sprinkle in between now let's go grab a sandwich bag and use it as a glue here we are green Apple Jolly Ranchers if you want to make these sour candies you can just add some citric acid to the bowl and shake it you want to make sure that all the powdered sugar is coated on each and every one of these so what I like to do at the end is put a bunch of powdered sugar on the top put the lid on and just shake it vigorously before I put it in to ensure that they're all individually coated this is episode 4 of mmm medical edibles please subscribe comment and give us a green thumbs up that was awesome [Music] I'm rolling up all your good and all your gun [Music] this is not for you no chocolate for your dog you", "uVrVyKUO5_c": "[Music] what's up friends welcome back today we have a little bit different video than you guys are used to so instead of giving you guys a exact follow the steps instructions this is gonna be more like you guys come along with me when i experiment so i like to try out different ways um that we can make different treats and a lot of times it turns out sometimes it doesn't um but i kind of just go with the flow and see what will happen i feel like no matter what you can always salvage your treats into something it may not be what you intended it to be but it'll always be delicious so for an example my intentions with this video was to create infused jolly ranchers and for them to be hard candy now that did not work out they ended up being a soft candy so i just kind of went with it and i thought it might be cool for you guys if you want to see my thought process and how i kind of decide to go with things when they go wrong so please let me know if you guys enjoyed this type of video or if you'd rather it be um here is like the guaranteed results from this step-by-step process [Music] all right let's get started here's what you're going to need some jolly ranchers or any hard candy that you enjoy some coconut oil or tincture citric acid and some infused sugar or regular sugar unwrap your jolly ranchers and then separate them into colors that you think would mix well once melted together i'm doing blue and green and the purple and reds now i'm setting up my double boiler and adding in my pink and red jolly ranchers they're mostly pink and i am using a total of 20 jolly ranchers now i'm adding in some lecithin and i'm just using my spatula because it is really hard to get off a spoon and then putting that back in and mixing it up now because i'm just doing a little experiment i decided that chamoy would taste really good with this jolly rancher mix since it's mostly all watermelon so i'm adding in two tablespoons of chamoy and then two tablespoons of infused sugar of course you could use regular sugar or you don't have to use chamoy i mean this is totally very flexible you can kind of flavor this to how you want you can put whatever creation you can come up with in there pretty much now i'm just waiting for this to melt over the double boiler it does take a long time i probably took about a half an hour to get to this point now that it's mostly melted i'm going to add in my coconut oil so i decided to add in three tablespoons there wasn't an exact reason for why i chose this amount it's just kind of like i said an experiment to see how it goes so we're going to mix that in and the oil is pretty tricky to combine with the mixture so i am going to use a whisk and just whisk that up really good just do it for a few minutes and it will come together very nicely and there is no problems getting this to emulsify just be persistent with stirring it until everything is nice and smooth like this so at this point it's pretty much ready to be refrigerated and like i said you guys can add whatever you like so if you want them to be very sour add some citric acid if you want them to have any sort of other flavor you know add it in anything is probably going to be just fine so then i now that this is all mixed together i'm going to pour it into a little dish because this is a smaller amount i'm just using a smaller dish so that i can get them to be thicker instead of very thin if they were spread out along a larger container this container had some grooves so i just filled it with some tinfoil so i could get the bottom to be flat and then place some wax paper inside of there um i had some issues with the wax paper if i was to do this again i would use parchment paper i just didn't have any on hand so then i'm going to pour this mixture into my little lined container and then i'm going to put it in the fridge to set i also just popped the little bubbles with a toothpick and then kind of just dropped it a bit to release any air bubbles um in the end because this turned out to be more like a starburst i didn't need to do that because i could have just squished it or molded it down with my finger okay so here it is after being in the fridge for probably about a half an hour and i was ready to score it because i was wanting these to be hard candy and you need to score these earlier on in the process so i'm just measuring it out and attempting to score it but it doesn't really hold my shape so i put it back in the fridge for another half an hour or so and then took it back out to score again and then i also sprayed my knife with some cooking spray so that it wouldn't stick now it's very malleable like i can reshape it really well and cutting it was fine but this was when i realized that this probably was no longer going to be a hard candy and it was going to be a soft candy so i cut all these shapes and then put them back in the fridge but they were kind of like they kept on molding back together so point being is that it needs to stay in the fridge a lot longer so i put them back in and then worked on making a coating for them so for these i thought they'd be absolutely delicious with a tahini coating so i started with one tablespoon of icing sugar one tablespoon of infused sugar and one tablespoon of tahini and then i tasted that and i felt like it needed more sugar so i added in some more sugar as well as some citric acid to make it more sour and then i tasted it again and it still felt like i wanted it to be quite a bit sweeter so i just added in the rest of my sugar and you guys there's no like exact measurements you just do this to what you think tastes good more sugar less sugar whatever you like and then i'm also going to grind this down in a food processor just to make it a little bit finer to coat my candies and then i poured it back into my container now these have been in the fridge for over an hour and while they were in there i'd go in with my knife and kind of just cut them so you can see they're still very squishy and like a soft candy nothing like a hard candy so that's a texture we're working with here now i'm just peeling them all off of this wax paper and you can see that it's stuck to the back of them quite a bit it was easy for me to get off but if i had used parchment paper there wouldn't have been that issue anyway so if you were to do this use parchment paper and not wax paper and then i separated them all and then put them into my tahin sour sugar coating and shook them all up then i put them back into the container as i was taking them out i could tell that they were very soft so i knew that these weren't going to be the type of gummies that were going to hold or not gummies the soft candies that were going to hold their shape outside of the fridge now that i've made these i've realized that in order to keep them out of the fridge we're going to need to add gelatin so let me know if you guys would like to see me do a recipe like that um but they look so good and of course i had to try one and they were so tasty like the watermelon jolly rancher chewiness with the sour sugary tahin coating and then the chamoy and the watermelon like i don't even know how i can explain how delicious that was but like so good now we're gonna do our batch of blue and greens using our tincture um these take forever to melt oh my goodness so yeah i left them on here for probably like a half an hour and then they finally were melting and make sure you guys are checking on the water in your double boiler i found that my water was going down fast and i constantly had to re-add it so just make sure you have enough water in there all the time okay so now after this has melted quite a bit i'm going to add in my tincture so we're doing one two three tablespoons and then to compensate for the extra liquid we're adding in three tablespoons of sugar i'm just using regular sugar because i don't know why i think i ran out of infused sugar anyways we're mixing that in and now we're going to add in some lecithin and i'm going to use my whisk to get that since we need to whisk this all together to get everything to emulsify so just stir that all up and get it to mix together and then i want these to be really sour because sour blue raspberry green apple like that's a good combination am i right okay so citric acid mix that in i had the candy thermometer in here because i was trying to make hard candy so we had to bring it to a certain temperature to allow that to happen um but in the end i realized it was not going to reach that temperature so i decided these are also going to be soft juice um which means i'm going to also add in some coconut oil so i'm just doing one tablespoon of this i could probably have added more but i just wanted to try using a little bit less since the three in the last recipe was a little bit soft now i'm adding in even more citric acid because i want these to be super sour like i've said before these recipes are extremely flexible if you're just making these for yourself it's not going to hurt if it's not exactly perfect every time if you're making these for other people then that's a different story but it's always fun to experiment um this is my favorite part of making all these treats okay now that we have the coconut oil in there we're mixing that all together and it's coming together very very nicely we just have to keep whisking it to make sure it's all mixed together you can see it looks nice and smooth and now we're pouring it into the same type of system the little container with the wax paper again because i don't have any parchment paper and then i'm putting it in the fridge i had intended to come back for this an hour or so later but it ended up sitting in the fridge for a couple of days because i got too busy to continue with them so now here we are with our refrigerated mixture slab i took it out of the fridge and then i let it sit for about 20 minutes to kind of soften it up so you can obviously tell the fact that it softens up at a warmer temperature means these need to stay in the fridge again it would u uh we would need to use gelatin to make them stay stable at um or to hold their shape at room temperature and if you guys are interested in me doing a video like that let me know this is just an experiment like i said a few times already so anyways so i just cut them up into these little shapes and then i put them in a container with some sugar and a little sprinkle of citric acid shook them up and then i put them back in the fridge so that was all we needed to make both of those and they were so good now let's talk about how they turned out taste wise okay so i'm just eating them while i'm talking so i can explain so first of all don't put them in the freezer because they'll get kind of wet on the outside just keep them in the fridge this green one it's sour green apple and blue raspberry the flavor is literally amazing they go so well together and the sourness is perfect [Music] that is really really good like i really like that it is very soft though it's not as chewy as like a starburst it's much much softer like very like your teeth just like go right into it so i mean maybe if you eat them in the fridge it'd be a little bit chewier but i let mine sit out um so i could see how well they would do i think it's about 24 degrees in my apartment so if the air conditioning was on i probably could get away with keeping them out of the fridge okay now we're going to try the watermelon cherry chun way one so it definitely is mostly watermelon only a little bit of cherry and we can really taste the watermelon chamois which one is really good i think the only thing i would change to the watermelon one is to do more of a sugar coating like i did for the green one um i just kind of want that like really like sour sugar to contrast the sweetness of the watermelon chamois um it is pretty oily but only on your fingers you can't really like taste the oiliness overall i rate the watermelon choi one seven out of ten and then the green one i would literally rate like a nine point five out of ten it was like so so so good i think it's gonna put some citric acid in it as well but both of them are good if i could do anything different aside from the sugar i would also add gelatin so they could be shelf stable but i don't mind keeping in the fridge anyways i hope you guys enjoyed this video

jack-offs and welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary although this time we are not going to be reviewing an edible we are instead going to be reviewing capsules delta-9 capsules to be exact 300 milligrams of THC 10 capsules in there with 30 milligrams each this will be the second time I have reviewed a capsule I reviewed I think it was gold caps the first time hated them a huge waste of money they were very expensive and they did nothing for me these are both cheaper and more potent I believe the other ones were 250 milligrams for 40 these were 300 milligrams for 30 so not a good sign necessarily but this is from Delta 9 this is why I decided to give capsules another chance Delta 9 is a company that I know from their chocolate I've reviewed three of their chocolate bars and have found them to be all amazing so I thought I would give their capsules a fair shake because I've never tried anything from gold capsule than there's one capsules and those were terrible so because this is from the trusty brand delta 9 or at least their chocolate is the trusty brand I thought let's give the capsules another chance who knows you might find some some gold here if not liquid gold so but I think I'm gonna do with these actually is I'm not going to eat them or take them all right off the bat I think I'm gonna do them in two batches 250 milligrams batches about 90 minutes apart so do all three of these over the course of the three hour span and come back to you guys two hours after the last time so this will take five hours in in totality to let you know how we're doing so I'm gonna take or four and a half hours I guess I don't know something like that so I'm going to do ten of these then come back to you guys in 90 minutes let you know how I'm feeling and then take the other ten and then come back to you guys two hours after that and lets you know how we're feeling with the whole batch so let's get started with this first half here let's open it up and just like you would expect this little bottle here oh and we've got our dastardly packaging which I opened nice and easy alright so here we go open open open here are what our capsules look like they're pretty handsome capsules white and green just like the packaging so let's grab five of these for now let's put the other five back in the model and let's take the five that we've got here and just uh I pressured that male life like I could choke okay [ __ ] it'd be funny did it choke thank you Ron Palmer love you alright well those pills tasted like plastic and amazing oh my god such rich complex flavors and those pills ooh still you know decoding all of the complex and just interesting tongue feel that I had with those pills of course I'm just [ __ ] with you who cares what they tasted like they tasted like pills I will see you guys in 90 minutes however to let you know how these first half of these pills are filling so I will see you guys in just a bit thanks for watching wheats and I will see you soon all right guys on back it has been about an hour and a half since I had the first five of the Delta nine capsules which is 150 milligrams of THC and I would say I'm already way higher than I was before when taking the gold caps 250 milligrams of THC definitely way higher than that but not outrageously high I'd say I'm at a four maybe a five somewhere in there so definitely feeling it which is a huge improvement but not you know this isn't like akarova 150 milligrams cookie um these excuse me these five pills um but we still have half the bottle to go so we'll see how much more these final five pills are how much farther they get us in the process all right so here we are we've got our final five these handsome little devils here we'll just do the same thing as before risk choking to death and take them all down in one go still alive that's got to be a sign of something so we've seen how it the first half go after about 90 minutes now let's see how the second half of the bottle goes and for that guys I will check back with you in about another 90 minutes and we will see if I am maybe at Delta nine instead of a delta for that kind of works all right guys I'll see you in about 90 minutes peace welcome back guys another 90 minutes has passed since I had the Delta nine capsules the remaining 150 milligrams and that seemed to do the trick put me from about a four to a straight linear about eight or so I'm quite high as you can tell from the eyes well no no no let's not say eight let's let's let's let's pump the brakes a little bit and go with a seven it's not let's not jump too far I think I'm maybe at about a seven but I'm pleasant with them I'm happy with where I'm at capsules I don't think are ultimately going to be for me these are a hell of a lot better I think than the gold caps the Delta nine capsules that's just on a sample size of one from both companies so you know take with that what you may but but my experience on these are a hell of a lot better than what I have with the gold caps and these were cheaper so that's a total win for Delta nine I don't think I'm gonna be purchasing them they're a little too expensive for me for what you get I do like the concept of them I do like the idea of capsules and just being able to like have something super super discreet that you don't even have to eat I just haven't found one yet that's as potent as I'd like them to be these are close these are close and if they were a little bit cheaper I would buy them on the regular for different occasions but as is I think I'm going to probably not be picking these up in the future but you know who knows maybe if they come out with different dosages or change the price or if I'm looking for something just to mix into a medicine bag or something maybe I'll maybe I'll still give these a chance and also let's give the wheats producer here round of applause for this back here oh my god isn't this amazing the wheats producer just which the they came in here the other day and they're like this place is a piece of [ __ ] we're whipping it into shape and I was terrified because if you ever met the wheats producer you would be you know mortified if something like that were to happen to you and look what happened you know a few days later we have this professional-looking thing in quotations thank you so much for watching wheat skies we will check you out on the next review Papa Papa peace great", "8z5bUfY2fJ4": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to wheat's the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of your dispensary uh accidentally jumped the gun forgot to record this once so i already opened this package that was just a moment ago haven't eaten anything welcome to weeds guys with a review show here on welcome to wheats everyone the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of your dispensary classic ass episode today which means yes a good old-fashioned edible and one of the most old-fashioned kinds of weed edibles the gummy that's right we're taking a look at wanna one of the makers of the cannabis infused sour gummies these ones your standard 100 milligram edible 10 different uh pieces at 10 each however these ones are also a cbd blend uh at a ratio that they actually have listed incorrectly there of 10 to one even though it should be one to ten the way they have it listed in that it is 10 milligrams of thc per piece one milligram of cbd per piece 100 milligrams of thc total 10 milligrams of cbd total in this package in these strawberry gummies i picked this up and i accidentally already opened it was recording didn't realize my bad haven't tried any i picked these up for 18 bucks at a dispensary here in long beach california which is a slight premium i would say over there traditional gummy edibles which probably average about 15 so a definite premium there not a whole lot but something to notice and again it doesn't have that nominal amount of cbd in it which i'm curious if it's going to have an effect on me that's not a lot of cbd i'm guessing it probably won't but we'll be on the lookout for it um and on here as well as all the good stuff you want to see they've got lab testing results although this is nearly a year old at this point which is a little disconcerting but whatever uh nutrition information all that good stuff so let's go ahead and take a look at the most important stuff the gummies themselves these 18 gummies and here you go looks just like that 10 of these squares in there oh smells very strawberry not very weedy at all mostly just strawberry well let's go ahead and give it a bite give it a test see what it's like gummy weedy strawberry a lot of wheat flavor actually more wheat flavor than i was expecting not grotesque but for the gummy candies higher than average but otherwise a totally fine gummy candy nice soft chewy okay well i would say in terms of taste a slightly weedier taste than your like plus or your steezy gummies but not revolting in any shape or form but it's there uh but of course guys it's not the taste that we're in this for trying to figure out if they're gonna work or not are they gonna make you hide and for that well that's what we're gonna have to wait around and see um so uh any time i do gummies i like to try to do them under the optimal conditions i don't think i said this i did have a little bit of fat beforehand just to make sure it's going to hit me just right not necessarily for you or for everybody i do it just in case so i had a little bit of fat before just for the optimal thc absorption um but it's still going to take a while to hit the old bloodstream so i'm going to finish these gummies off of the next i don't know hour so do all 10 as we do here on wheats we review the whole product i'm going to review them over the next or as i said eat them over the next hour and then two hours after i have that last one or thereabouts i'll come back to you guys and give you our wrap-up thoughts the most important part of the edible review is it gonna get us high and for that guys you're just gonna have to stick around and i'll be back in just a bit to let you know our wrap-up thoughts about these wanna sour strawberry gummies well here's one for the blooper reels guys i'm back two hours two and a half hours later with these wanna cannabis infused sour gummies uh and as you can see with my eyes they are pure as the driven snow uh and i came here with a really bad review i was gonna come and really trash them as i was like these are pretty um non-existent non-existent in terms of the high that i feel from these wanna cannabis infused sour gummies uh and i was gonna say something along the effects of well maybe it's the 10 to 1 ratio and maybe that little 10 percent of that welcome back to wheats guys it has been two and a half hours since my first uh bite at the wanna cannabis infused sour gummies and if i look very very sober you're correct um i this guys is gonna be one for the blooper reel uh i came here to excoriate the uh folks at wanna i'm saying that these gummies basically did nothing to me all ten of them felt practically nothing and i was originally going to think well maybe it has something to do with that um strange 1 to 10 ratio of cbd to thc and maybe just that 10 cbd was enough to totally blunt the thc and but not provide any of those cbd benefits that was just i've said i was gonna feel like i felt just kind of peaceful but that's about it not really high at all uh and that's because that is actually the case uh i had it wrong not them well actually the bud bud tender had it wrong uh i ordered the one to ten and they gave me the ten to one uh so this really is 10 cbd milligrams to 1 thc so this is 100 milligrams of ca cbd 10 milligrams of thc the exact opposite of what i thought it was um at least i know that i know when i'm high or not and i was definitely not high in any traditional sense with these but that's on me not on them this one's for the blooper reel we'll have to review wanna again in the future this was just a fun little [ __ ] up um and an 18 mistake so uh wanna i am sorry i uh did not mean to disparage i don't know anything about you just yet i do know that my bud tender [ __ ] up the order uh oh well uh [ __ ] happens but we will check you out again in the future apologize for that it's been fun it's been funny anyways that's gonna do it that's gonna do it for this non-existent review here on wheats no cherry on top just a big shame on me thank you so much for watching guys stay high and more importantly stay healthy and we'll see you guys right back here for our next review

option but with Edible marijuana Providing such a different experience than smoking how does it work and is eating pot Actually better for you? When you heat cannabis you effectively change the chemical makeup of compounds within it called Cannabinoids Smoking heats it to around 800 degrees Celsius and converts thc a to Delta 9 thC which binds to receptors in your brain making them continually fire and causing your imagination, thoughts and perceptions to magnify this is why every thought can feel like a significant one and Because it travels straight from your lungs into the bloodstream and to your brain the drug works within minutes and lasts about two to [three] Hours, but when making edibles the weed is heated to around 150 degrees Celsius burning less of the actual plant and minimizing Carcinogens ThC is Lipophilic not water-soluble so the activated Thc must be dissolved into something fatty like oil or butter and once the substance is consumed the onset of the high is delayed as the drug is absorbed more slowly through your gut but this high typically lasts four to eight hours and most report feeling more high than Compared to smoking marijuana [this] is because when you eat edible weed the ThC is first metabolized by the liver before entering the bloodstream and here Delta 9 thC also becomes 11 o h thC which Passes the brain barrier more rapidly and is a more potent chemical so using the same amount of marijuana You actually get more high with Edibles because it ends up creating both Delta 9 ThC And 11-OH-THC which is a stronger compound and because there are more? psychotropic types of Cannabinoids acting on your neurons you'll be high for longer of course you also get to skip out on the toxic chemicals that smoking provides like Carbon monoxide Bronchial Irritants and tumor Initiators smoking anything means you're inhaling cancer-causing molecules so if you can get high without smoking it will be healthier for your lungs and body the downside it's much harder to control the High you'll get because it can take up to one to two hours to feel the full effects and the dosage can vary significantly modulating the effects or Titrating as it's called is much more difficult [and] as a result you can end up a lot higher than you intend - but unlike those who consume too much alcohol Opioids or other drugs you won't be suffering any serious long-term harm Toxicity [or] Lethal overdose if you do consume more than you intended [if] you've ever wondered why marijuana gives you the

be exercised when using animals as well as storing them this video is designed for personal use and it's not professional advice but moreso tips and tricks I have learned myself if at any point in time you're enjoying this video feel free to hit that like button and subscribe for more content like this so the first thing that we need to cover quickly is cannabinoids there are three main cannabinoids THC CBD and terpenes THC or tetrahydrocannabinol is the psychoactive part of cannabis and will cause the high most people associated with cannabis CBD or cannabidiol is the non psychoactive part of cannabis which carries well-known medical effects terpenes are responsible for the smell and flavor of cannabis and have their own effects but are non psychoactive for the most part optimally you want a combination of THC CBD and terpenes for the best experience whether for medical or recreational use otherwise known as the entourage effect in this episode I will be discussing THC for the most part but it also applies to see with the intervenes the exact same way for example if I mentioned 20% THC the same applies to 20% CBD or 20% terpenes making edibles in figuring out dosages can be challenging so I will be covering two examples of how to dose in edible the first example will be if you have lab tests in material and the second example will be if you have untested material if you live in a state like California or Colorado lab testing of cannabis products is required for retail sale this is a great way to control the safety of cannabis in regards to pesticides molds and other harmful issues but also serves as an education tool for patients and recreational users one of the issues of cannabis testing is that it is not standardized yet meaning that THC CBD and terpene tests that you're receiving may be higher or lower than the product truly contains some brands will market their total cannabinoids as the THC percentage which can throw off consumers so make sure that you read any tests you may have access to carefully to ensure that you have the right numbers so for this example I will be talking about Hades og Hades og has 20 1.07 percent THC and 0.04 percent CBD program once again this is a rough approximate not every cannabis flower has the same cannabinoids and some tests may not be accurate but we will use this as a solid approximation for our edible dosage to calculate your cannabis into milligrams of THC multiply the percentages that you have by 10 will move the decimal point one point to the right this Haidee srg for example would have approximately 210 point 7 milligrams of THC program and about 0.4 milligrams of CBD program if I were to infuse a gram with this Hades og with a cup of butter my cup of water would have approximately 211 milligrams of THC and a half a milligram of CBD if I were to infuse 10 grams of this ad 13 with a cup of butter that cup of butter would have approximately 2100 and 7 milligrams of THC and about 4 milligrams of CBD this applies to all cannabis products you have whether it is flour hash Keef wax or trim if you have a lab test a gram of shatter at 80 percent THC for example that is 800 milligrams of THC per gram in some cases you may not have access to lab testing where you may not trust the results that you were given in this case I refer to important TC percentages as follows flour is between 10 and 30 percent THC Keef is between 20 and 40 percent THC hash is between 30 and 50 percent THC and waxes between 50 and 90 percent THC on average flour is 20 percent THC Keef is 30 percent THC hash is 40 percent THC and wax is 70 percent THC these are rough approximations for each product and some products may be higher or lower than the range as I mentioned for the most part these are good starting guidelines for most medical and recreational users so for example if I had 10 grams of hash I would approximately 4000 milligrams of THC in the finished infusion 5 grams of flour would be about 1000 milligrams and 2 grams of wax would be about fourteen hundred milligrams first off I need to mention the edibles can take anywhere between twenty minutes to three hours to fully kick in and edibles definitely hit harder than your average joint or bong run if you have eaten anything else that day that will also have an effect when the adipose potency as well as a handful of other factors so it is best to start off with a low dose wait an hour then increase is necessary in the United States the suggested single dose for an adult over twenty one is between five and ten milligrams of THC this means if you make a 100 milligram edible that by a state's definition is between 10 and 20 doses of THC if you are introducing a cup of butter of THC and have a cookie recipe which calls for 1/4 cup of butter and makes 12 cookies they would aim to have 480 milligrams per cup or approximately 2.4 grams of cannabis flower that would end up producing 4 batches of 12 10 milligram cookies so you could have a few over a couple hours and being able to control the dosing safely but like most things those dosages don't apply to everyone while I certainly suggest starting off at 5 milligrams for 10 milligrams for an everyday user this would almost be micro dosing prior to legalization in California there are four main doses of edibles 100 milligrams 250 milligrams 500 milligrams and 1000 milligrams some companies offered 2.5 milligram micro dose edibles and some companies offered 10,000 milligram edibles that would leave in a weed coma for a week the reality is your dose may be anywhere between 5 milligrams and 1000 milligrams or even higher but you need to work your way up slowly 500 milligrams and 1000 milligram doses are typically considered medical doses and are great for pain and other similar ailments and were utilized quite heavily prior to recreational legalization 100 milligrams is my go to dose per cookie as I can eat more or less as I see fit just as a quick background I have been smoking every day for a few years I suggest new users start off at 5 or 10 milligrams than 550 milligrams 100 milligrams 200 milligrams between 50 milligrams 500 milligrams and then 1000 make sure to space the edibles out at least one hour in between and only bump the dosage if the last experience then give you the desired facts for example if you go and buy a 10 pack of 10 milligram edibles go home and eat one an hour later you do not feel the effects as desired so yeah another 10 milligram animal and they get it in another hour next time you should start off with a 50 milligram edible then see how you feel out for an hour before consuming a second one once again this video is a personal suggestion and should be used only as an approximate guideline for dosing edibles for personal use make sure to keep your edibles and infusions out of reach of children and exercise caution after consuming any edibles but

tetrahydrocannabinol but lately there's been a lot of hype around delta 8 thc a cannabinoid cousin of delta 9. delta 8 thc is chemically different from delta 9 thc by only a few atomic bonds while delta 9 can exist in cannabis strains in amounts up to 30 to 40 percent delta 8 only exists naturally in fractions of a percent nevertheless companies are stoked on the idea of extracting and concentrating delta 8 for its unique effects word on the street is that delta 8 thc gets you high but to a lesser extent and without the anxiety it's also known for its appetite stimulating analgesic and neuroprotective properties and anti-nausea effects in a 1995 study conducted by dr rafael meshalim eight children with cancer who were being treated with different drugs along with chemotherapy were given delta 8 thc in conjunction with chemo and as a result vomiting was completely prevented with side effects reported as being negligible so obviously delta 8 thc deserves our attention there seem to be both medical and recreational benefits to the cannabinoid are you into delta eight throw those thoughts in the comments and thanks for watching today's marijuana morning news my name is brooke burgstahler i really freaking love you now follow us at big mike and have a beautiful day [Music]", "gQYc6uzjt9E": "I love ICS it's like on a hot summer day when it's just like it's hot to eat but you want something you have like a refreshing cold pop smoke back baby but this time we got a summer this I'm gonna show you a really easy way to make watermelon lemon juice pops all right you need some watermelon slices I cut down the time you should already know how to cut a watermelon you're in the top three cups of milk one and a half cups of cream two bowls just because you need to go ahead and sort things out a frying pan and a couple strainers as well your molds for your eye sees and Bram you need like an eighth of weed depending on how strong you want it I think a eighth is good for this amount my man the blender right here and just a positive attitude we're gonna start over our cannon milk I'm gonna go ahead and put the water medal to the side right now three cups of whole milk I got about one and a half cups of cream right here as well it'll fit in this cotton at an eighth of the weed here just some water my mouth is mad dry right now you're gonna go ahead and put a couple of inches of water into your pen and you want to make sure that you keep that and make sure that that's always simmering and it doesn't need that plate we need water into that pan you know I'm saying so this is a slow process we're gonna have this on a simmer for about two to three hours to not go past three hours because then that's it you waste some weed isn't even working in the next step we're gonna go ahead and place our watermelon trunks into the blender this is crazy this isn't a baby boys and baby girls it's time to grind this what is my favorite color but is my favorite flavor maybe one day I can make a business out of this got the dog spoken in the back beat I think the sound of a dog is a very summertime now we have our watermelon chunks they grind it up we got a strain it and we got to get a lot of this juice out of here right so we're just pouring that in there for now I've been smoking way too much weed all right and the good thing about this is the fact the lake you could save this juice for later you have like fresh mixer for your vodka when you want to go ahead and have some drinks always have paper towels on exact this is the essence of life things get messy sometime you know I'm saying and next up we're gonna go ahead and cut up a lemon I'm only gonna use half of it because the strange that we're using is lemon curd and also I just don't like to add too much citrus to milk it's good to have cattle milk already made and thankfully already have some like that's in the fridge ready so that we can use for our process now always use very cold milk when you're gonna go ahead and combine it with fruits can you pass me the can of milk thank you so much so we just need 1 cup of canned milk and then I'm gonna go ahead and put my watermelon pulp in the bowl this is has a couple seeds unfortunately for this fine you split them up add a little tiny bit of honey for flavor as well I'm gonna shake it up so you're gonna pour it into the mold we got some chunks in there it's gonna be a textured treat all right so the go ahead and cover up your popsicles and then the next step is obviously to go ahead and put them in a freezer and let them freeze for as long as ICS and tentacles freeze right I already had a couple of them in the freezer so let me present to you my little pop baby look at this water bellicose pop I know I got married in here so I know this is gonna be potent it's gonna be potent baby unless it tastes good Wow this was awesome hey baby can we say ding ding ding ding", "G70-Bp6kHGU": "is it just pure pain now that's what you hate to hear goodness gravy I've got a story for you guys today listen in the pursuit of life sometimes we run into bumps along the road the bumps vary in size and severity sometimes it's a little tiny pebble in the road and sometimes it's a giant [ __ ] boulder like for instance if you were hiking and you got hit by a giant [ __ ] boulder we're doing our best alright and sometimes things don't work out the way we would we would prefer today is one of those little interesting conundrums that we run into every now and then in our lives and it happened to me I ran into a bit of an issue so sit back relax and let's talk about how I once accidentally drugged myself with the largest edible I've ever eaten last February for all the coronavirus garbage happened I traveled to Los Angeles for spring break and one of the things that I had to do was I had to sign a [ __ ] ton of posters for u2's there was probably more than three thousand posters that I had to sign and the posters were being kept at the house at The Misfits YouTube group were staying at in LA Carson was there Schlacht was there Cooper's there we were all just trying to like sign all of these posters as fast as we could because there's so many of them and it was take us it was taking us literally hours to do at this point there was maybe about five or six people in the house at this time and that's because at that point the whole main misfits crew had gone out to dinner somewhere I don't know if you know this about the misfits in general but they smoked a lot of weed every trip they do they probably spent a couple thousand dollars on weed okay they smoked the mary-jane they do the weed in order to make the process of signing these posters go a little bit smoother I had smoked like half a joint of weed so I was already decently high because I hadn't smoked in a while either sign in a way crossing my eyes Dodd might ease however my personal reaction to weed is that I get the munchies I get the munchies pretty hard I smoked a little bit of the mare Lona and then I say oh I'm gonna eat an entire sleeve of club crackers with no cheese because gluttony I originally planned to go to dinner with my girlfriend and her father so I was trying to wean off of the hi and just kind of sign the posters and wait until it kind of wore off and then I would go and do that one of the things that they had at this house was they had a giant counter in which a bunch of snacks were all laid out there was chips there was more chips there was I think pizza I don't [ __ ] remember as I look across this horizon of bountiful snacks I see a nerds rope and my monkey brain is like oh and I'm thinking to myself man I remember nerds rope I haven't had nerds rope and [ __ ] forever dude I'm thinking back to my childhood where we would go to a campground in Maine and I would wattle on down to the snack shack and grab myself a nerds rub and before eating it considering its potential applications as nunchucks or trying to tie a knot with it but then realizing I'm a kid I don't know how to tie knots and my prefrontal lobe won't even be done cooking for another 20 years so what's even the point give me a slush puppy give me a Game Boy SP let's [ __ ] it up but lord have mercy did I learn in this moment I no longer was a child but a man a man who experiences consequence in the worst way possible so I'm signing more posters you know I'm cruisin I'm having a great time all right nerds rope tastes a bit strange but that could also be my perception that I have of being already high and it's kind of you've ever been high before it kind of messes with your perception of taste a little bit it was like drinking a diet coke versus a normal coke where there's like you know there's something there there's something there but I don't fully process why it tastes different so I finished the Nerds rope and then I go to have another nerds rope because I'm high and have the munchies as I'm biting into the next nerds rope one of the misfits guys says Ted don't eat those those are edibles hmm sorry I said I'm back I must uh I must have heard you wrong um scusi yeah Ted that's inedible so I say no [ __ ] way how much was it he says I think I think it might be like 60 milligrams what 60 milligrams to give you context the largest edible I'd had up until this point in my life was 20 milligrams so of course I asked are you sure one of the guys walks over to the counter and picks up the package of the Nerds rope and with the most you are [ __ ] face I've ever seen in a person he says it's actually 400 milligrams now remember I've already freaked out when I heard that it was a 50 milligram edible and I've just been told that it is actually eight times that amount so you may be asking yourself Ted how the [ __ ] did you not know that that was inedible and that's a good question let's start with the packaging that's the packaging it uses the same packaging as the actual branded Nerds rope it's got a thing that says Terran share as if it's just a normal candy in hindsight that's very much so implying for a good reason that you really should be sharing it and not eating it entirely on your own if you're not really paying attention and it's been like eight years since you had a nerds rope this is pretty easy to mistake for a nerds rope in addition to that there was a very specific and deceptive way that everything was laid out as snacks in the misfits house and I'll just let swagger CIL's explain that for me there was a very reasonable way like we set it up because the Nerds rope was inedible it's a 400 milligram edible and he didn't read the packaging but we have on that bench it's a big-ass bench it's snacks and food chips Pringles gummy bears all that [ __ ] munchies and then there's weed food which is edibles in between that and the weed which makes sense like a spectrum dangerous that's the thing is that it would make more sense to kind of put the weed food away so that you don't confuse confuse you've ever been in a car crash even if it's not your fault there's a certain feeling after it immediately happens it's this mind racing feeling when you have absolutely no idea what to do but you also know that something has to be done or you're [ __ ] aka panic so at this point I begin to freak for three reasons first of all I didn't know if I was personally prepared mentally to get as high as I was about to get second of all I had made plans for dinner with my girlfriend and her father that night and I definitely won't be making it and I'm pretty sure she's gonna be a little bit pissed and the third reason I hadn't smoked weed in two months which meant that my tolerance was rock-bottom I like to explain this with what I like to call the skyscraper analogy right here we have the tolerant skyscraper which represents my tolerance to marijuana let's just say that whenever I smoke weed I started the ground floor in the lobby if my taunts were higher then maybe I'd go a couple stories up to the mid-level apartments that's where all the stoner kids from high school hang out and they're all pretty high up there but it's nothing really to be worried about you're probably couch locked but you'll be fine with my tolerance at zero though I knew in my heart and my soul that I was going all the way up to cheech and Chong's [ __ ] penthouse as an unwilling and unexpected guest for an undetermined amount of time as things stand right now I don't even live in the building I'm from out of town and I sometimes commute into the city oh it's a Friday night oh we should go we should go get drinks in the city that's the that's what I'm operating on I know that I'm on a timer most edibles take about 45 minutes to an hour before they kick in but I know that I've taken this edible about 10 to 15 minutes prior which means math I've got about 45 minutes before this edible hits me and I died although other things can affect this such as being on an empty stomach which I was my first thought was that I need to make myself throw up because if I can get rid of as much of this edible as possible I could potentially mitigate the level of inebriation that I was about to experience so I stumble over to the bathroom and I start to gag and I'm trying to make myself throw up but I've never made myself throw up before I don't know how to do it so the next step is that I got Carson on his phone looking up how to's on wikiHow on how to make myself throw up and then Cooper's in the kitchen and he's making cups of saltwater for me to chug because apparently if you chug saltwater it helps with the throwing up process I'm not sure how true that was it just ended up with me just throwing up a bunch of pinkish salt water so I can't speak for its effectiveness but there you go and I'm pretty sure since the Nerds rope was sort of a candy sugar based food it was really easy for my stomach to digest it really fast so I'm pretty sure if I hadn't thrown it up within maybe five minutes there really wasn't that much that I could do from there so by the time I was done throwing up some food that we had ordered earlier arrived and Cooper basically advised me that the best thing that I could really do for myself would be to just fill my now completely empty stomach from this point on all I could really do was buckle up strap in and get ready for the [ __ ] high of a lifetime god bless my soul [Music] so I'm gonna give you guys a walkthrough of what this high was like it wasn't fun I also have some video footage that Cooper took so link to his channel in the in the description once I kind of came to terms with the fact that I was gonna have to ride out this high no matter what I decided to give myself a home base just somewhere where I could ground myself and not really need to worry about moving around or anything I found myself a nice armchair and I sat myself down there and prepared for the ride of a lifetime the first thing that happening was a classic weed symptom which is cottonmouth which is when your mouth gets really really dry so I was pretty much just constantly drinking water I remember starting to get colder and The Misfits they had a room where they just had a bunch of extra merch laid out where they could just give that to friends and stuff while they were in LA and I kind of just walked in there and just threw on one of the sweatshirts and then just went back to my home base and sat down and I was wondering for myself if that cold symptom that I was experiencing was real I did research on the symptoms that I was experiencing and this was something that actually happens informally it's referred to as weed chills the THC literally lowered my internal body temperature so I actually was getting cold another thing that happened and I think this also might have been a symptom of being cold but I started getting shaky and it's really funny the way that I described that when I was high and I actually have video footage of that right here welcome back it's gotten worse friends we are it's been about 45 minutes since last and bad okay I think you need another stick of butter I feel like my entire body feels like rubber bands pretty much after that point was when things started to get um they started to get bad the shaking was also the reason why in the video you can see me clasping my hands together because I was literally like shaking so much that I had to hold my hands together really tightly and keep my body really tight and close so I could be in like a comfortable state and then I get into what is called the painful zone or the first level of weed hell pretty much any position that I was sitting in felt painful don't do too much weed I was in the pain hotel and I was its only guest any surface that I touched whether it be the arms of my chair putting my hands on my knees anything like that just felt bad and what I think I would attribute that to is just being so high my sense of touch was just so elevated that my brain was just overloaded or something most of the time I was just trying to like breathe deeply and kind of maintain my composure but whenever Cooper would turn the camera on me and he would start recording I would sort of like try to elevate my attitude and try to seem as cheery as possible because I didn't really want to seem like an idiot hi stoner on camera you know at a certain point I had to move my home base because it was too disorienting to be sitting straight up I had to go and get [ __ ] horizontal baby I pretty much had to make a mental agreement with myself just to survive is it just pure pain now that's what you hate to hear it was during this time of unbearable dizziness that my good friend Schleck decided to use a [ __ ] handheld massager on me I'm just getting the lactic acid fun I just want to get the juices I just want to get the juices flowing if you please organism do you see my attitude there I wonder why I wouldn't like that a rapidly moving massager if you want a lesson on what not to do to someone when they're high that really takes the cake eventually the fateful moment happens I had a weed barf I honestly think it was really just because of how dizzy I was getting from being high and luckily for me I had a whole sandwich about an hour ago I literally had to run across the entire room and just run into the bathroom and throw up after I threw up though that's pretty much where the high took the downturn now it was cleansing I had it was a cleansing barf yeah it was uh it was detoxifying I went to go eat some skittles but without even knowing I was on camera I went around to people and not trusting my own ability to determine this I asked them if the skittles were edibles or not I ate the Edible at about 6:30 p.m. that day and I stayed awake all the way until about 4:00 a.m. that night I woke up at about 9:00 a.m. and I was still very high but I was definitely a manageable amount of hi what struck me though was I was high for the entire next day I went to bed that night hi so in total after eating a 400 milligram edible I was high for about you know 26 hours if there's one thing you guys shouldn't take away from this is like any anti weed sentiment from this video I think weed is a perfectly healthy drug to use recreationally but we'd like everything else follows the rule that too much of anything is definitely a bad thing obviously only consume weed in a state in which it's legal and if you're of age I hope you guys enjoyed this video let me know if you want more stories from my life I don't really know how many stories I have to tell this is like the second one I've ever told on this channel but I hope you learned a thing or two and if there's one thing you should take away from this it's this weed is for sinners and I'm going to help [Music] ped accidentally took 400 milligrams of edible", "Uzs_MaYujqs": "welcome back to the cannabis packaging show I'm here with my man Nick Nick what's up everybody how you doing Nick's looking fresh he's ready for the Christmas party boys we're here to talk about edible packaging the very best edible packaging 20:19 being an important year for all of us to stand out and make your mark on this industry and let's just jump right into it we're content with specialty packaging I'll throw that in there too okay we'll show you some of our CR jars for gummies mm-hmm and we can change the colors okay change the code of the cap stick one of these here you can hot stamp on them a lot of people are doing labels on these jars it's easy to put compliance information warning symbols some of those are hard to stamp directly if there's colors involved but in a state like Arizona you can just print this glamorous directly at the back of the jar sharp right style of CR capsule jar this one has a label apply the clear label for capsules gummies mints all the above and you can do gold or silver tipping on the edge of the jar this is a non CR jar but another really nice option again you can do gold or silver for the cat I can't get it open so a lot of these a lot of these products can be both used for let's say gummies or flower I think edibles and flower probably have the most interchangeability between products as indicated by the next item about to come on this is a non CR glass jar with a rubber stopper that is an embossed um silicone stopper we also have cork Stoppers we can seal there you can apply a label and you can't do some printing direct on [Music] all right another option is to put your jar into something else this is an acetate box with a jar inside of it and we've printed directly onto the plastic and the shower is a plastic jar there's a label outside jars plastic and glass I want to show this guy here this is a molded pulp box with a sleeve around it Nick what do you see going in that for edible as what would types of products I think we'll go get in there I see you know you can put gummies in there would have to be in some kind of bag or something airtight I think edibles I think maybe even like almonds or some kind of natural edible assets have it got the natural feel to it and so I think that would like good with the product do like brownies rice krispies treats anything like that to chocolate as long as it's wrapped and packaged inside again we'll show it again our famous of all box which was shown for cartridges and three rolls but it is versatile chocolates are in there and this is another customer who used a plain black box and they had different wraps that they were using but the vault box there Melissa this was your customer so there's the idea of when people are getting started sometimes they say oh I can't order like let's say three five years from now you'll be able to order let's say no God willing things go right fifty a hundred thousand no problem but initially you're getting started five thousand of four different SKUs could seem like a lot so you can do five thousand of something of a standard box and then create wraps around them to customize strain by strength if you're just getting started out if you're going to already high it's easier and better but it's definitely an option so don't think that just because you're small you can't have beautiful packaging because it's a way to help you become big okay of course the mylar bags are always an option these have a food-safe liner on them this is a CR closure as well on here and and totally customizable we have some non contemptible examples to show you this is a really nice 2-piece box it has an added tag on it there's a ribbon that goes straight through the top of the box also to hold the tag in place that could be great for chocolates having like nine truffles we would customize a back form for something like truffles for you or if you had little paper cups you could put them in there to fit whatever another cool package of a craft paper it's wrapped around it's not really sealed completely but it is folded down has this hemp looking twine string and finally we'll show this is a not a contempo product but it is a CR package that a lot of people seem to gravitate towards this is for gummies in Vegas so inside of that package is it's like dentine ice it's like a blister with the foil seal and just goes right what's the name of that company give them give these guys a shout out district sorry that's district you know tag all right Juno Tech you've officially been featured on the chemical packaging show all right so what else do we have for edibles anything else we want to show is that give a general idea of what can be done yeah tins of course can be used for mints right you can do a sliding tin or you can do something like this which is a new package by contempo it's biodegradable and it's launching in 2019 so go to contempo packaging calm and subscribe you'll be the first to know when it hits the market Mike we can't totally see that in the camera you want to tell a little bit more about what it is or should we leave it at this is called mystery my friend who views ferments could be used for a couple of different products alright guys anything else you want to add before the next episode I just like everybody to drop a comment on which early 2000s boy band member I think it looks great the most handsome of them all tonight Manny you're gonna come on the show next we'll see mostly I'm JT doesn't he makes a good looking guys alright guys thanks for watching the show", "VEiE_EhsW6Y": "a warning from police in Westchester County tonight about cannabis candy they discovered some during a bust last week and now one police chief wants to warn parents that these marijuana infused treats could easily be confused by kids for the real thing Marcus solace has a story police admit it wasn't the arrest of the century an alleged low-level marijuana dealer busted in Tarrytown this week but it's more than buds that were seized there's THC in liquid form attachments for e-cigarettes and what's most troubling for the police chief edibles in the form of gummy candy I feel very strong that there is no need to put it in the form of something that's very attractive all to young children Chief John barber Len says the issue isn't whether recreational use of marijuana should be legal in New York as it is in several states and most recently in Canada his concern is the marketing of certain products containing THC there's two issues here hey is it an attraction to younger people that really shouldn't be making that decision and B what is the possibility of accidental exposure the chief points to a Journal of the American Medical Association study that found in Colorado the number of children hospitalized due to accidental exposure jumped 34% so could the sugary stuff be mistaken for something harder the similarities are striking down to the same shape and coloring of the products so if I was to put this on my counter with my ten-year-old daughter home what's to say she's not gonna pick it up and he didn't think it's a gummy worm from CBS

is the capsule category uh we are taking a look at buddies today oh boy that uh has quite the reflection buddies soft gels one thousand one thousand one thousand one thousand one thousand one thousand milligrams of thc of course we're not doing on 1 000 like all of our wheats reviews we aim to do 100 milligrams of the thc and review that much of it but a thousand milligrams is quite the uh achievement uh especially for as few as there are there are actually only 20 soft gels in here uh leading to 50 milligrams a capsule if you know you are very simple multiplication um really really excited about this one uh if i can find oh my dog is growling at another dog here she's being kind of a [ __ ] underneath so um so these are as i said very very very strong for a single capsule i'm kind of interested to see what they look like 50 milligrams in a single capsule to me seems very [Music] uh at the limits of what can be done but i don't know you know maybe they figured out some kind of magic um so uh on this buddies package here we've got all our incredible information we want we've even got nutrition facts so one of these soft gels has 6.61 calories in case you want to get that

is often used vegetable glycerin is often used uh when making like tinctures uh and then grape seed oil is apparently what they are using uh as their um uh base instead of the more common sort of mct oil you see i don't see grape seed oil very often so 50 milligrams we are gonna do two of these capsules uh and just to ensure that i'm gonna get the best effect i am after i take these capsules going to uh eat some food with a lot of fat content in it just to be sure it gets in the bloodstream in the most uh effective way possible uh and then the other big thing to know about these capsules is their surprising affordability uh buddies i've seen they have quite a few products i've seen um carts from them uh they are sort of partnered with packs i've seen pax pods uh and now of course these um soft gels uh and they're always quite affordable uh these soft gels are no exception soft gels are usually quite expensive um for example like the gold cap which was it used to be a big brand a thousand milligrams of this would have cost you uh well over a hundred bucks uh these were a scant forty eight dollars for a hundred or excuse me a thousand milligram uh capsules a hell of a good deal especially if they are as strong as advertised and then last thing i'll bring up is the lab test results they're on the side um so they do you know show that these have 50.7 milligrams of thc as uh denoted by their lab testings and then of course they give you all the other great manufacturing information on it uh and well let's go ahead and open it up take a look at our very shockingly small soft gels for something that's going to have 50.7 milligrams of thc supposedly there it is um nice looking oil actually a super consistent handsome little tablet capsule soft gel let's get that nomenclature correct so here is apparently 100 milligrams of thc uh i cannot wait to be impressed forgot to bring a beverage with me so you know what just gonna have to dry swallow down the hatch well there we go that's 100 excuse me 101.4 milligrams of thc according to their lab testing results so i'm really interested to see how these are going to fare uh that's going to take me and our custom review wheats review process two hours to find out i'm gonna uh chill out here hope to get quite high as i said eat some nice high fat meal and then two hours from now i'm gonna come right back to you guys here and say hopefully i'm super high well for that we'll all have to find out together see you guys right back here in just a bit [Music] my buddies my buddies my buddies and me i'm pretty sure that was the name of a child's toy from the 80s my buddy it's probably the inspiration for chucky what's not the inspiration for chucky is buddies 1 000 milligram soft gels or in our case one tenth of that 100 milligrams of buddies soft gels um and uh that's where the beginning and end of the similarities to chucky are um in every other way it's distinctively non-chucky-like um it never gets married it doesn't have children it doesn't break the fourth wall um buddies why were we talking about chutty chutties chuckies buddies they're pretty good 100 milligrams um of these uh i wouldn't say it's quite as strong as a um good solid baked edible but i'm not gonna complain that much either um that is the smallest footprint of a thousand mil or excuse me 100 milligrams i think i've ever taken uh and i am uh pleasantly quite high again for something that was so miniscule um and i have nine whole doses left in here uh equivalent size to doses all for uh that very affordable 48 bucks like you're not gonna you know um you're not gonna find ten edibles for that price so that's uh that's a pretty good uh gonna be a pretty good endorsement from me it's not the strongest hundred milligrams i've ever had uh but i am always always looking for things that are going to um pack uh sort of out i'll punch their weight class uh and these tiny again these things are so small uh that is 50 milligrams of thc right there dropped one better not let the dog get that um and uh so yeah very very happy with buddies looking forward to doing uh another nine rounds with them in fact um so i'm gonna give it you know what i'll just go ahead and give it two thumbs up of buddies their thc thousand milligram thought soft gels not the best hundred milligrams i've ever done but again a hell of a value and a tiny little footprint uh so before i go with you guys i mean anytime we do the big old siskel and ebert two thumbs upper uh we want to go and mix our metaphors even further so we want to go ahead and add a little cherry on top some you can sort of mole over think about enjoy watch process during your busy boring days um that is the coronavirus uh you know that you can do with or without weed and this week i want to leave you uh with one of the things that i love hearing the most and um uh and and it can be a bomb for our uh anxious times and that is the phrase uh this x can be a salve for these scary times um just pay attention and anytime there's something that isn't uh people are talking about that isn't scary or is vaguely pleasant you'll hear somebody in inevitably describe it as a bomb or a salve for these anxious scary trying boring uh you know pick your adjective times uh and uh then you get really irritated with it quite quickly so my cherry on top is uh my observation that you're gonna notice people saying an x for y a lot uh that x being a bomb or a south things people never use any other time um so why that seems so uh pertinent now i don't know what also isn't pertinent is this review of buddies thousand milligrams which we did a hundred of thumbs up also thumbs up this phrase which is um a a tincture for our a highly uh friction something something world um i failed to come up with another one wow this went on for a while buddies really great boy this one off the rails in the best way possible thank you so much for watching it's been great stay high stay healthy really do stay healthy and we'll see you guys on a later review also stay high goodbye", "qhfZyTBPoQ0": "today a little bit of baking they really making some caramel lollipops what makes these camera livebox specialty masks were using today we butter / can of water whatever you want to call it get high better that make you feel good juju today we're using my form of it I like youth coconut oil cause it draws out the most THC out of the lead for some reason I don't necessarily know the science part of that don't but I do it with very good understanding of how that [ __ ] works and it can be substituted for a regular letter so the recipe were using today actually calls for regular butter but I'm just substituting same thing at cold temperature or room temperature cocoa butter I'm sorry coconut oil will freeze and make it usable as butter if you melt it it's gonna become a will so you can use it it's very malleable now we're gonna let me show you guys what we're working with here we've got two tablespoons yes two tablespoons of water one and a half tablespoons of vinegar and we've got one teaspoon of salt sea salt to be specific a high-quality it looks like nothing's in there but daily hey there's something in there I promise yeah then we have the cocoa might throw up my baby boo but baby doodoo and it's gonna taste bad hum and then we've got one cup of brown sugar right here and last but not least we have 1/4 cup of sheriff liked it or not the darkness once it's all finished we're gonna mix in some vanilla extract the only reason I don't have that way that was because I like to do this by eye so to speak they call for a teaspoon just kind of portion today the recipe calls for us they pretty much just mix all of this in the pot so yeah man have you come over here I'll show you how to do this by the way we're drinking a Bohemia it's a pilsner don't really know the [ __ ] oh yeah it tastes good sure the first yeah so you put the heat on after you add everything yes okay he goes on a hot pot of burning sugar before you think you started it makes sense isn't the bottom of the sugar 1/3 water in vinegar hmm no been the corn syrup this person a little tricky because the brew is in the bowl this is why you should always have a rubber spatula I've mentioned that before make sure you keep your rubber spatula with you okay was it medium I don't know how you're still worse don't use an electric stove and I don't I don't know sponsored by Stokes if you use an electric stove at home you need to throw that [ __ ] trash yeah stir it a little bit right make sure I'm not sure the bottles combined yeah and then we can add that I stood this butter here all right so we're just gonna pretty much get this to a boil I'll show you guys what it looks like on the back to the world but the whole ultimate goal here or the end goal is to get this to be 300 degrees that's gonna be a hard crack it's much easier when you have what's called the candy thermometer Andy it's very easy to measure and even tells you what it's called that's gonna be called a hard crack meaning like this it's gonna be not chewy little more than a lollipop texture so yeah we're just gonna blow this out and let everything out together so at first this is not gonna look like it's coming together it's gonna look very separate like your sugar that the bottom of it and that the link was just kinda at the top not makes me bitter but as you can see keep boiling this is not something that you want to keep stirring by the way just stop as you keep boiling you'll see that it starts to blend together okay we're just about at 300 now which should be a hard crack temperature and starting to solidify just a little bit have any worried that the wood is starting to come together so to speak so go for like two more minutes we're gonna give it a chance to cool it down and we'll come back and show you when it cooled and then let's start to transfer it to the mold but it means this little container here it's just a lot of measuring jar to make it a little bit more you won't and then I just also add a little bit of vanilla extract just gonna starting to cool down I'll give you some flavoring actually I want to add something else for flavorings so that I really know the proof why should it rate and nephews away right there you are alright now we're gonna start pulling into the molds ooh that's hot this book mmm cannot fast swirl the lollipop stick in there to get it's all to sit yeah I don't work a little clipping at this - I chose always so size [Laughter] that's okay they're still warm and I solidify them when I close the lid go for it on that right now we need to work quickly because the rest of the mold arch the caramel is still very hot and I want guys to come out so I'm just gonna work work on the stick place man it won't be some sideways ass looking sticks sorry another thought mm-hmm were you making this video about was perfect hmm cuz you're on time oh yeah you tell I don't work out I do push ups and push ups push ups when you lift your fingers are the only thing gonna work out okay now to form Oh as you can see it got a little a little friendly with you yeah yo right here Cheers seal them up pop them in the freezer an apartment afraid of me back in like counting so you saw who I thought put bets at the cool yours one attack in like ten minutes hmm you see what they look like boom should care more heart Dali Pablo look at the back look at the front try this yeah there is wait in there you taste the weed yeah tastes like a lollipop right like the year oh yes um I was making lollipops with the chief do tune in again next time when that video will be who knows what it will be who knows but uh you know pops [ __ ]", "sOPTCsoAPXw": "what's up everybody today we're going to be making cannabis hard candy using canned butter and kennel oil so let's get into it all right guys so before we get into the video i just wanted to give you guys some information so so in this video i'm going to make a large batch of heart candy but what i'm going to do is divide the ingredients into two different pots however since i'm not actually accurately measuring the ingredient one pot is going to have more than the other one so it's not going to be equally divided so when i add my jello at first it didn't turn out right but overall it did so just for my beginners use this recipe for only one type of method don't do it the way i did it so i just wanted to let you guys know that but let's get into the video so the ingredients to make my cannabis hard candy would be lecithin so we will need the lecithin to help bind all the ingredients together so i'm using one teaspoon per recipe next we're gonna be using two third cups of light corn syrup two cups of sugar i'm gonna be using one pack of jello i'm gonna be using blueberry jello and raspberry jello next we will need our water we're going to be using one cup of water also you will need a candy thermometer so we're going to be using a quarter cup of peanut butter for one batch of our hard candy and i'm going to be using a quarter cup of can oil for the second batch of hard candy make sure your candle butter is at room temperature before making your hurricane but let's get into it all right guys so now what we're going to do is measure out our can of butter [Music] now i'm just going to add this to my container so now i'm going to measure out our kennel oil [Music] so this can of oil was made with 14 grams of blue drink all right guys so once you have all of your ingredients the next step would be to turn your stove on now the temperature that i'm going to be using is like medium heat i'm not going to turn it on high so i have two parts on my stove and that's on purpose so i'm going to be using one pot to make the hard candy but once i finish making a hard candy i'm going to add some of that mix into this pot here so i can add my kennel oil so you don't have to add your peanut butter or your kindle oil mix it after your ingredients reach the 300 mark so just keep that in mind let's get into it all right guys turn your stove on medium so that's high right there i'm not going to do that i'm going to do like right here so like medium to high heat so add your sugar then the water [Music] and then your syrup while you're mixing your ingredients just look on the side sometimes there's going to be sugar crystals that's going to form on the side of your pan just remember to brush the sugar crystal that may form on the side of your pot now it's boiling so i'm not going to miss it anymore now i'm going to add my thermometer all right guys so my temperature is getting closer to 260 degrees which is perfect so at any point now it's going to shoot up to 300 degrees hopefully i can get this on camera but we'll see all right guys so we're getting close to it so this way was perfect so this time didn't shoot up like it would usually do i guess because of the temperature that i got it on once it gets to about like three or five i'm gonna turn off the stove and add a portion of my mix to the other pot it's over 300 degrees so now i'm going to turn off my stove and add a portion of the ingredients to the other pot let's go ahead and turn off our stove [Music] now we add our jello to the mix [Music] now i'm going to add our kennel oil [Music] and our peanut butter [Music] now i'm going to add lecithin [Music] so [Music] all right guys so i had to put this back on the stove to mail the ingredients so what happened is when i split the ingredients from one pot to the other obviously i didn't split it equally so this one here had way more jello didn't have the ingredients so it was really really dry so i put this back on the stove just to give it more of a liquid base so now what we're going to do is now we're going to add this to the mode so let's get into it so now i'm going to add my mix to this mold right here [Music] now i'm just going to pour the rash onto this mat right here [Music] do i'm gonna put this in the fridge for about three hours and yeah i know right now it don't look that good but don't worry it's gonna come out fine all right guys so we've been about three hours so now my hard candy is now hard so now what i'm going to do is break the hard candy into small pieces and remove the other hard candy from the candy mold so let's get into it [Music] [Music] i'm just going to use a knife to break my card candy [Music] so [Music] [Music] all right guys my cannabis heart candy is now done thank you for watching this video don't forget to like share and subscribe [Music] peace [Music] you", "kQuwgg6DNLU": "how to make awesome homemade lollipops hello everyone today I'm going to show you how to make lollipops at home using three different methods store-bought candy molds free form on a cookie sheet covered with a silicone mat or parchment paper or how to make your own mold using cornstarch making your own cornstarch mold is actually pretty easy all you need is a shallow container I'm using a baking dish that's kind of small but I was only making a few lollipops in there put in the cornstarch you're going to smooth off the top using a spoon or maybe something like a like a popsicle stick just drag it across the top to smooth it out you don't want the cornstarch to be compacted because you're going to be using a some kind of object in this case I'm using I'm going to use a juice bottle cap I'm going to press that into the cornstarch to make the mold cavities now I made a mistake here I dumped the cornstarch in what I should have done was sifted the cornstarch into the container and it would have been kind of light and fluffy and I wouldn't have the problem I'm having here when I was pressing the bottle cap into the cornstarch I had to press pretty hard it was sticking to the cap and made the bottom of my cavities uneven so sift the cornstarch smooth it out gently and then press in whatever object you want to make as your candy these are hard candy lollipop molds I bought these online because I couldn't find any locally I'll put a link in the description box if you're interested to prepare these you'll need to spray them a little bit with some cooking spray just so that the candy releases well now these are specially made to withstand high temperatures and are for hard candy making you could also make chocolate lollipops with these as well but do not try to make hard candy lollipops with molds the clear ones that are designed for candy melts or just for chocolate because they will melt nd I bought two kinds I bought just the plain round ones and I bought flower ones but there's a whole pile of different ones available okay so here we go on to the actual candy making in a large saucepan place two cups of white granulated sugar a quarter cup of water and two thirds of a cup of light corn syrup you can also use the golden corn syrup as well it'll just affect the final color of your candy if you can't find corn syrup where you live you may be able to find a candy recipe that doesn't use it you just might have to look around a little bit now to flavor this candy I'm using some orange extract I put in one at teaspoon they actually sales specially made candy oils for candy making you only have to use a little bit and if they have intense flavors I didn't have any in the house at the time so I just used the orange extract now you're going to begin to heat this mixture over high heat at the beginning you're going to have to stir continuously because you don't want it to scorch or stick to the bottom and at this point you can also add some food coloring if you want to change the color now I wanted to match the orange extract so I added some yellow and some red to make a nice bright orange color I'm using paste food color but you can use the liquid food coloring as well now you're going to need to stir this continuously until it begins to boil once it begins to boil you can stop stirring now I've seen some candy recipes that ask you to add in the coloring and the flavoring after you're done boiling the candy either at the beginning instead of the end and it still worked out okay so I don't think it matters so I'm a mixture has come to a boil now you can stop stirring and you need to continue to boil this until the temperature of the mixture reaches 310 degrees Fahrenheit now in order to be able to tell you've reached the right temperature there's a couple things you can do you can use a candy thermometer these are relatively inexpensive if you're going to make candy often go and buy one because they're really really useful if you don't have a candy thermometer or don't want to go buy one you need to heat your candy until it reaches the hard crack candy stage I'll put a link in the description box that shows you what that means now I turn the heat down just a touch from high to medium high I just made sure that the candy continued to boil until it reached 310 degrees once it reached the right temperature I transferred it into another container that had a spout on it just so that it would be easier to pour once you're done pouring the candy out of the pot into the other container do not scrape down the sides of the pot or the bottom just leave the residue in there and I'll show you how to clean that pot out in a minute now at the beginning you'll notice that your candy mixture will be very runny and I'm going to fill the hard candy molds up first with it you just pour enough in to fill the mold and try not to add so much as if they leak out into the handle or where the lollipop stick is going to go the lollipop sticks I'm using are actually paper and I purchase them at the bulk barn but you can also buy them at candy-making supply stores or baking supply stores so I just push them into the candy and there was a bubble there so I just burst it and push the candy onto the stick now I'm going to fill the cornstarch mold cavities with the mixture same thing just gently pour it in there now I'm very intrigued with this cornstarch method and I think I'm going to try maybe another video and try to make different shapes and this time I'm going to sift the cornstarch in to see if it makes a big difference but you can imagine how much fun you can have with this so I filled in all of the mold cavities and then I added the sucker stick or the lollipop stick I just put it in there gave it a little bit of a turn and then just gently press down on it to sink it into the cornstarch so that it was in the center of the lollipop now another variation that I actually saw on Martha Stewart website was it you can add sprinkles and decorations to these while the candy is still hot these are little fall leaves sprinkles different little maple leaves different colors and while the Candy's hot just sprinkle it on and just gently press it into the candy and let it harden and you've got these little decorated pops you can decorate for absolutely any occasion as you can imagine I had these little pumpkin sprinkles as well so I press some of those now for the freeform lollipops if you're making them freeform without a mold I suggest that you allow your candy to cool a little bit when it cools it won't be as runny and if it's not as runny it'll be easier for you to control the flow and to make nice little round lollipop shapes if the candy is really hot and are really runny it may leak all over the place and you'll get very very thin lollipops the Martha Stewart website actually suggests that if you're making them free freehand like I'm doing here you take your pot when you're done boiling it put the pot into an ice water bath to cool it down a little bit more quickly but since I filled all those other molds first by the time I got to the freeform method it had cooled down quite a bit so as you can see it's a bit harder to get the same size of same shape but it's the same idea you pour it on and then you add in your lollipop stick and you can see here just by looking when I was pressing in these sticks that they had it had cooled significantly and you can even add candies in this case I'm pressing in some candy corns because it was near Halloween time that I was making these and the cool candy had cooled quite a bit so I had to press them in but it still worked quite nicely now as far as cleanup goes when you're done with the pot put it immediately in the sink and fill it with hot water and just the hot water sitting in the pot will dissolve any of the candy that's in there the same thing goes with the rest of your utensils like the this measuring cup that had some candy left in it and any measuring tools you have like a spoon or maybe your candy thermometer put it in let it sit in the hot water and the candy will dissolve all on its own or you can even take the pot and put it back on the stove filled with water and just let the water simmer and you'll simmer away all the candy as well so you can see it's sat there for about an hour a lot of the candy has gone out of the measuring cup and all the candy has disappeared out of the pot as well so it's nice and clean so cleanup is not a nightmare if you just are patient and let it sit in some hot water so I refill but measuring cup with hot water and let it sit and give it a stir every once in a while and the candy will just dissolve right off your container so you're going to let those candy molds cool completely and then you're just going to pop them out of the mold and they should come out quite easily I did spray these a little bit of cooking spray first and they popped right out and they are just gorgeous I was very impressed with this first attempt using these candy molds so there are some flowers the candy stick is cold white adhered to the can you don't have to worry about it falling off and here are some of the ones with the little sprinkles on them and the lollipops are nice and clear so you can see them from this angle which kind of looks like they're floating in the ambi or you can look at it from this side as well pretty cool these are the ones I did free form and they should come right off the silicon mat you'll have a little bit of an imprint from the silicon mat on the back of the lollipops and here are this cornstarch lollipops just take them out tap off the excess and then you can wipe them down with a clean dry towel to get rid of more of the cornstarch and the core starts in the container you can reuse that for baking put it back in the container or you can use it for more lollipop making as well it's completely reusable now here are some of the completed lollipops it made about two dozen of them and they tasted great they tasted just like orange now these this is one of the cornstarch ones and you can see the back of it is not smooth and it actually looks a little like the surface of the Moon it actually holds details quite well which is kind of interesting here's another cool recipe it is for candy apple chips this video will be going live on November 4th 2013 so if you're watching

you call your dispensary today good old-fashioned classic ass episode of wheats which means it is an edible review my favorite kind of review if we're being honest love me some edibles and one today that i've got uh high expectations for no pun intended uh it comes at a premium price and it comes from a relatively um experienced well-known player in the field but one uh one of these players that is known for their cartridges not their edibles but they are branching out and so who is that that is heavy hitters that's right guys we are taking a look at the gummies uh now out from heavy hitters uh those are the fine folks that make really really nice um premium thc cartridges we've reviewed a couple of them here on wheats like them quite a bit uh and now they are making their own gummies that they say are ultra potent um there are some curiosities with this here first of all it says that they are five 20 milligram pieces which is a hundred milligrams what it's supposed to be uh it's just another sort of indication of how [ __ ] up the labeling is and how nothing really matters with labeling um because technically it's supposed to be everything is supposed to be uh at most or minimum 10 doses of 10 milligrams but this says five 20 milligram pieces well but then they get away with it by showing you actually on the back uh that even though it says they're five uh 20 milligram pieces oh sorry it's right on the front it does say two 10 milligram servings per piece so it's kind of very disingenuous to advertise it that way but whatever um we do have everything we

range this comes in at a premium for 20 bucks uh so the heavy hitter's name uh given a little extra premium on the price let's hope it's going to be a little bit premium on the product so uh let's go ahead and open it here does have some opening instructions on the back i find those always to be those pictograms that show you how to open these child proof uh bags are very bad i think um usually they're not too bad it's usually about actually the trick is opening the bag beneath the zipper as opposed to above the zipper is the trick for most of these originally you know you rip the zipper anyways what does it matter um i just think the iconography of those things is terrible so here we go here are our uh 20 milligram pieces excuse me are two 10 milligram pieces i guess it is nominally scored as such does smell like strawberry and of course like all of our wheats reviews the way we do it i'm going to do the entire product i'm going to eat all 20 not 20. all 100 milligrams of heavy hitters strawberry gummies uh and then about two hours after i have that last one i'll come back to you guys and let you know exactly how we're feeling let's go ahead and try our first of five right here for you hmm wow that is a tasty gummy that is a very tasty gummy i like the gummy a lot almost zero weed taste i mean i'm really looking for it there on the aftertaste not not much i mean that is a gummy i would be very happy to eat uh just uh out of boredom and anxiety like all gummy candies should be consumed but yeah that's that's that's great um a shockingly shockingly uh devoid of cannabis taste which you know hopefully is gonna be a huge positive if these get me as high as their ultra potent label suggests we shall see look that sugar off my fingertips well we're two-fifths of the way there i've got three more of these to go i'm not gonna gorge myself right now i'll have these over the next i usually like to do this over about the next half hour to hour or so and then two hours after that last one actually that is not 100 true um what i'm gonna be doing is doing these next three on a live stream with you guys as soon as i wrap up this first half of this review i'm gonna save these three i'm gonna be doing a live stream hanging out with you folks saying hi getting high with you and at the end of that live stream i'll come back and give you my wrap-up thoughts but that's just a little pitch to you guys let you know we do the live streams now and i hope you will join us for those in the future regardless if you do or not we will be back to tell you if these heavy hitters strawberry cannabis infused gummy are worth the heavy hitters premium price until then stay healthy and stay high my friends see you real soon bye-bye welcome back to weights everybody looks like a dog might be joining us welcome back tweets guys it's been about three hours a little over three hours since our journey started with the heavy hitters strawberry cannabis infused gummy and the dog is still coming in hello dog uh and i am very happy to say and especially if any of you had watched the live stream i did while enjoying this review these are quite good uh these are a premium product at a premium price but i gotta say they do land in that top tier uh echelon of gummy edibles i am very high i'm very pleased with my high uh quite impressive with these and that's not to even mention as a taste which um these are among the best tasting gummy edibles i've had especially for as potent as they are um really happy with it the only downside is that price uh these are more affordable or excuse me more expensive rather than most of the gummy edibles out there uh but you know i i uh some of it may be just uh some psychology of uh wanting it to be more expensive more potent because it's more expensive but if you hear me rambling it seems like it may actually work i don't know might be more than just psychological tricks i really enjoyed it really enjoyed it heavy hitters strawberry hundred milligram gummies can i get a big old thumbs up from me if you can find it and if it's not that much more give them a shot for sure so speaking of premium products uh i want to share with you guys a little cherry on top a little something extra that you can enjoy that's not necessarily weed related that's like let's do something a little premium we're going premium edible

every Thursday we share with you how to videos and product reviews and much more to ultimately help you get the most value from our favorite plant and today we have for you for tips on how you can get the most value from cannabis tinctures so let's get to it let's dive in and let's try this now tinctures are extracted cannabinoids which are mixed into either an alcohol glycerin or coconut oil solution and they're ideal for people who are using cannabis for medicinal reasons or for people who are new to cannabis as well there's a few reasons for this one is that they're administered via a syringe so you're able to easily and accurately dose yourself in really small increments because you can basically count each drop as you administer it also the tinctures come in many non psychoactive options and they also carry little to no smell and involve no vapor or smoke now the most popular and beneficial way of taking them is sublingually so the solution is absorbed in the body through the oral mucus all and to do this you use a dropper and you place the cannabis solution right underneath your tongue you hold it there for about a minute before swallowing and then you will feel the effects typically in about fifteen to thirty minutes and the last you for about three to four hours this way of administering it the cannabinoids and the terpenes they're absorbed through the tissue lining into your bloodstream so this increases the bioavailability of the cannabinoids so if this is the method that you're interested in then here are four tips for you on how you can get the most value from cannabis tinctures now number one is specific cannabinoid options so when it comes to tinctures many people don't realize that there are many options pass the sativa indica and hybrid options that they're used to tinctures can be made with specific cannabinoids and some with different ratios of one two one three two one or twenty two one of a combination of cannabinoids to meet different patient's needs because each cannabinoid is known for helping to treat different symptoms and ailments and can cause different effects so you can find teachers that are in THC which is psychoactive CBD which is non psychoactive THC and CBD a which is the acid form of THC and CBD before it's exposed to heat and both of these are they're fairly new cannabinoids to be offered and studied their non psycho active but there are astounding results that have been discovered with patients who are using these cannabinoids for an assortment of different reasons number two is using whole plant tinctures from flower so here at green flower we tend to favor whole plant tinctures from flower as opposed to trim now the flowers are just the most cannabinoids and terpenoids aplan whereas the trim it doesn't have as many terpenes and it mostly has the cannabinoid THC in it so these types of tinctures they'll give you the fullest entourage effect from cannabis and provide you with the widest range of terpenes now the cannabinoids and terpenoids resides and with some trim only tinctures you just lose quite a bit of the medicinal value from this lack of a rich terpene profile so when entourage effect is present in many of these flower rich tinctures what happens is you have multiple cannabinoids and chirping that are present and they work together to enhance the medicinal value of each of their individual properties now number three is choosing alcohol extractions so we also tend to favor tinctures that are made from an alcohol extraction process since this process it's just the gentlest on the plant and so it keeps the terpenes more intact because some extraction processes they strip the terpenes from the cannabis and other ones like co2 break apart the bonds between the cannabis and the terpenes and then they reintroduce the terpenes then ultimately what we've seen is that when you keep the terpenes completely intact with the cannabis that's when you'll see the best benefits and the terpenes make the benefits of the cannabinoids even more effective in your system and they carry a bunch of medicinal value themselves as well now Alison Attell from treat well which is a leading cannabis tincture company here in California she said that with alcohol extractions she's seen that with her clients and patients that they're not building up a tolerance to the cannabis so they're able to use less cannabis to achieve the exact results that they need which is a really big plus number four is choose products with testing and proper labels so when you're purchasing tinctures there are a few that you want to make sure to look for and to favor you want to make sure that the bottle itself says how many total milligrams of THC and other cannabinoids are also present in it as well as how many milligrams are in each dropper otherwise you're not going to be able to accurately and safely dose yourself and then we also recommend checking the company's website before purchasing to make sure that the cannabis teacher that you're purchasing has been lab tested for things like molds and pesticides and consistency potency and residual solvent now if you are interested in learning even more about tinctures and all the different ways that you can use them to help enhance your life and to treat different ailments and symptoms that I

how to make some edibles and you want to make some really easy to do recipes at home edibles which is a good thing because that's what we're gonna do in this video I'm going to teach you the five most easiest things to make at home with edibles and cannabis my name is Judy Shekar and you're watching puff puff toast let's start off with number one cannabutter one of the most common things to make with cannabis it's super easy to make all you need to do is melt some butter and as you're melting the butter you add a gram of ground cannabis into that butter and you keep melting it melting and melting it until it's nicely infused with the cannabis and voila you have cannabutter super easy super simple and a lot of people use it the second thing that you can make at home is cannabis tea using the can of butter which is interesting because I actually wouldn't expect putting butter in teeth but a lot of people do and apparently this tastes really good so all you do is brew your favorite tea and a teaspoon of that can of butter into your tea and it's this blend of something really delicious warm and nice the third thing that we're going to talk about on how to do our Keith's cookies so Keith is basically the extra powder that comes off of the cannabis bud or when you ground cannabis any leftover powder that happens all of that can actually be used to make keep cookies and and they're really easy to make all you do is you get that left over ground Keith add in some cookie dough bake it and boom you've got Keith's cookie super easy super simple very very delicious apparently number four is I want to tell you how to make pot brownies okay so super easy again but one thing that you want to make sure that you want to have is a brownie mix that uses foil because what you're gonna do is you're gonna heat the oil up and as you're heating oil you're gonna add the ground cannabis to it and then you're gonna mix that oil into a brownie mix and then you basically bake it and you have pot brownies the last thing that I want to teach you how to make is called a firecracker very very very easy all you need are graham crackers peanut butter and cannabis powder so ground cannabis call you to as you spread some peanut butter on the ground cracker add some of the ground cannabis on top of it slap on another peanut butter spread ground cracker on top to make a sandwich cover it in foil put it in the oven for 30 minutes and then you've got this amazing sort of peanut butter brownie cracker sandwich with cannabis so those are the top five really easy ways to make cannabis edibles at home however I'm sure there's more out there and if there is let us know in the comments below let us know what do you make it home with cannabis that's all for me my name is Trudy Shekar and you're watching puff-puff post", "zcGyJlpRJQ0": "what's up YouTube your Boise man back at it with another video and I'm just just a follow-up on the CBD froggy let's see CBD frog give

you normally drink on a daily basis or whatever but this actually is a thc product um this is the first time that i've actually tried this product itself um so we're just gonna go ahead and just start jump right into it quite honestly i've already took the initiative and took the top off of this but um the brand is pretty much called keith uh i really don't know much about them it's apparently a mocktail garbage cannabis infused with lemonade um again this is the first time that i'm ever going to try this this cost me about like 20-26 dollars um yeah so there goes that and it goes for like 200 milligrams uh thc so without any further ado let's go ahead and just dive into it and see if it's actually i'm excuse my language if it's even worth the uh 30 you know for a drink anyways i don't know how i feel about it i don't know if it needs more sugar because i expect lemonade to be sweet this is not really as sweet and it has a weird taste to it but either way i mean i can taste the marijuana in it or the flour whatever you want to call it to be quite honest with you but all in all taste wise out of 1 to 10 per taste i would have to give it a 6. it could be way better it could be way way better but all in all i mean still drinkable but um i don't know the thick like how it's gonna affect me in about 30 minutes i would say about 15 30 minutes around that time frame so i'll update you guys as soon as you know that what whatever i'll be right back what's up you guys i'm back okay so after it's been about 30 um what time is it it's been about 15 minutes um i'm starting to actually feel it i feel good um it's not making me freak out or anything so i really enjoy this product though excuse me the only thing that i don't like is the fact that the taste the taste is disgusting you guys i can't really handle the taste but um it tastes kind of not bitter i wouldn't say better but kind of like let me try it one more time i don't know you guys i just plain i guess you can say but either way you guys it does the job and i'm not probably not going to drink all of this because 200 is a little bit too much for me but yeah don't forget try this out again it's keith

there are 25 individually wrapped packs in here it says each pack includes lollipop and dip these were 3.99 at target and honestly i saw them there and i would not have thought a thing about them but ashley our daughter is absolutely crazy about anything sauerkraut and she is very very familiar um these are all raspberries she is very very familiar with uh the what they offer from sour patch and she said i've never seen anything like that before and so she bought and some for her uh i think to give away to her kids at school and uh or to eat maybe to eat because when you go into her house her uh her place she has a ball like welcomes you when you go in the door and in that bowl is all kinds of different sour patch things bags and and she just loves stuff like that and so when i told her i said well i'm gonna buy she bought a bag i said i'm gonna buy a bag and uh because she really wanted two bags uh to have enough for all the kids and i said i'll buy a bag and we'll review them and i said then i'll give you the rest of the bag so that's what we're doing um this has pink raspberry and it has red berry there are it says one pack 25 servings per container one pack 15 grams is 60 calories so 60 calories for each of these if you eat the whole thing um includes lollipop and dip so this is like um a different dipping stick is that what it's called or which and you could you have a place on the back to put two in from um i've got the red there you go okay so so you get the the pop and it's shaped like one of those children around the front with the hair it's already got powder all over it [Music] i like the red berry flavor i don't really get sour from them made in mexico okay okay now all the powder in the bottom is white so and you get a little tartness from it but it's not a lot it looks like it's got hair oh i can dip his whole head and make maggie mustard hazel yeah that has white hair that is actually really really good no it's not bad i get a little bit of sourness to it but but not much it um frosted the frosted tips um a little bit of sourness but um it has a really nice flavor for me personally i would much rather just buy this in a candy form than buy it on the stick yeah i'd rather have like a gummy or oh it has his face on there too oh see i was looking i was looking well i thought it was just the shape of his head i was looking at the back of his head the whole time and i turned him around he actually has eyes and a snake it looks like a tiki uh a tiki face yeah liking gilligan's alan yeah um okay these are pink raspberry i like the flavor of that one's a little stronger oh that's really good i like that one better i mean it looks good this one seems to be stronger it's really nice raspberry um oftentimes when we try candies i'll compare i'll say these remind me of something else whether these remind me of a lifesaver starburst jolly rancher these don't remind me of any of those these are in a category the flavor the flavor is in a category all on its own these are very distinct sour patch kid flavors that don't remind me of other candies do they you no but i'd still would rather have just the gummies the gummy candies oh i would too the sucker is just more to deal with you got to have the stick you could take somebody and you when you grab a gummy and just stick your mouth and start chewing well or um if if sour patch kid made these in like little hard candies i would totally well i mean they they would that that would be something really cool um for me i'm not going to eat it and we've said this about other things about dum dum suckers that we've got i wish they sold these in hard candy because they sell some really good good flavors um but a stick is is not something that i'm going to walk around i mean these are great for kids i think kids will love them adults will love them too if you don't mind eating suckers i would just rather not have a sucker right i would think ashley will eat a couple of these but i'd say she'll be sure because ashley's not i don't i can't imagine actually sitting around on the couch eating these i just can't but you don't know so uh but they're out there they were new to her and so i don't know if it's a new thing or not uh but i hope you enjoyed the video and thanks for watching [Music] you", "V_OLCJGpjEc": "alright guys so what happens when your dog eats over a dozen pot cookies now I hesitated to make this video footage is like a year old and I'm gonna show you I just wanted to you know I decided you know I'm gonna make it you know it's by mistake you never want to give your dog marijuana or anything like that I'll kind of talk and give you guys kind of the story of when I went down and I'll have some footage of the day you know going in and out and then the end of the video I'll have some more footage so basically what had happened was I have an ex-girlfriend okay I absolutely loved her dog like I grew up with dogs my whole life but me and her dog just had like this special bond and I just fell in love with pit bulls ever since I was up people just got pit bulls just cuz their look and they look aggressive and all that stuff but pit bulls are the most affectionate dog absolutely love them so I get a phone call alright I haven't talked to my ex-girlfriend in like 2 or 3 months she calls me she's like hey she calls me cry and she's like oh my god like Avis had a seizure or a stroke or whatever I can't lift her up and put her in her car you have to come over blah so I hop in my Jeep I fly down there like I freakin robbed a bank I'm like super like oh my god like this sucks like I love you know her dog so I get there and you know sure enough she's laying in her dog bed can't really walk is like drooling a little bit and I'm just like damn it like this is it you know I had to put her down or whatever so I pick her up take her to the vet and the vet gets to asking her questions she's like she's like okay how old is your dog has your dog maybe eaten anything or whatever and she's like oh she gets in the trash sometimes but she's never like nothing's ever happened to her and then she's like has she maybe eaten any marijuana whatever and then Desiree kind of pauses and she's just like and then it dawns on her okay her brother was over a brother I'd cancer and you know eating edibles and stuff like that really helps like his appetite and he doesn't have cancer anymore which is awesome but basically they they made like 20 pot cookies and somehow you know it dawned on her that she left the bag and that's what must have happened to Ava she goes oh my god that you know that must've been it she must have had the pot cookie so basically we go from thinking her dog is dying and having a stroke or whatever - oh she just is super high right now on weed and needs to come down off his high so it was actually like a really scary day that turned out best case scenario because you can't really overdose on weed like it's not gonna kill you or anything like that so after all of this desert was actually going on a trip and she was like hey can you watch Ava over the next few days because I don't want to just leave her alone when she's working you know tripping so I was like yeah sure whatever you know awesome she goes to my house and I bring the kennel all along because Ava with some pit bulls no matter like even if you you you try to train him good some of them are just a little bit dog aggressive so Ava happens to be very dog aggressive you know won't hurt a fly as far as humans and stuff like that but does not like other dogs you know and I had my my English taffy shadow but you know I had a kennel you know I could just separate them into rooms or whatever but I thought you know what this might be a perfect opportunity to kind of see if they can become friends because Ava is dog aggressive - random dogs but if she like she has been together with other dogs before in the past and it's worked out but I was kind of scared you know being you know my little puppy I don't want it like Ava freaking biting her biting biting him so I was like okay Ava's were very high right now when you're high the last thing you're thinking about is kicking someone's ass so I was like maybe Ava's super chill and whatever and I can kind of introduce the dog so I was super nervous to introduce shadow and Ava but it worked out perfectly so Ava had no aggression she was just chilling kind of excited and all this stuff so they became actually best friends after this Ava stayed over at my house and they cuddled together they were freaking licking each other's faces and all that stuff so definitely be careful guys if you guys smoke marijuana or anything like that if you guys have edibles laying around the house you definitely don't want your dogs to get into it Ava was high for like two or three days she had trouble walking running just we're actually weird like normally she just licks your face but she was like kind of biting you softly I was just just not acting like yourself so I can't imagine like what it would do 12 pot cookies to a 60 pound dog or a 55 pound dog I can't imagine me taking two of those cookies I'd be tripping out of my mind but yeah guys that's what happened kind of hesitated I'm making this video just because it's kind of a weird topic and some people could take it the wrong way and I know you have to be careful you can't just leave stuff like that laying around but thank God it wasn't like some pharmaceutical medications or anything like that because that would kill your dog even like ibuprofen or whatever but the marijuana happened to be in cookies and dogs [ __ ] you know love cookies so April was high for three days and then after that she was just fine and shadow and Ava have been best friends ever since you know me and my ex went out together or anything like that but sometimes like if she goes on a trip I'll watch her dog if if I go on a trip she'll watch shadow so but yeah I hope you guys like the video give it a thumbs up share this video with your friends and yeah just be careful you don't want this to happen to your dog I know it's kind of like it might be a little bit of a funny thing at the end of the day because it did go from we thought Ava was dying to oh she's just tripping out so for us it was kind of like a really awesome thing that she wasn't having a stroke or anything like that but at the same time be careful you don't want that to happen to your dog it's just you know it puts them through torture for a few days so yeah I hope you guys liked it and I'll see you guys next time you walk inside one thing she too long wanna see her walk come here evil walk to me okay yeah this definitely isn't funny but it's kind of funny it's just so relieved that she didn't have a stroke or a seizure or anything like that so this is like best-case scenario yeah we can link relax now well not relax that's better she's taking extra extra extra my neck come on longest pee ever just come oh my god she's so stoned look at her hey left how are you peeing again this Danish cheesy so weird come on Yvette come on you're just running everywhere come on what are you doing David Oh with that noise that noise tripping out so I found the bag I think this was the cookie bag I mean it looks exactly like it so this was in

I think it was actually gonna be sour I'll bust in this video yeah see you guys later my next video stay tuned with you subscribe comment down below or like this video bye [ __ ]", "gz0KRXd8m7M": "they had a bunch of different oh my [ __ ] god all right i stopped at a dispenser yesterday called lit i actually filmed an entire tour of their facility and grow it was [ __ ] epic that video is gonna be up in a couple weeks make sure you subscribe so you can check it out when it's up but while i was there i picked up a couple sodas these are called keef colas they had a bunch of different flavors i grabbed three different ones i grabbed the orange kush which orange soda is probably my favorite soda this one is blue razz and then this one's actually sparkling water and it's raspberry flavored i'm probably not gonna like this one but i figured i'd try it and compare it all these drinks only have 10 milligrams of thc in them so they're not super potent if you smoke like once a day or less this will probably get you pretty lit but for 10 milligrams it's honestly like the potency of a beer for me like i would need to drink five of these to feel a decent buzz i know on the med side this same brand makes 100 milligram sodas but my medical card isn't valid in colorado it's only valid in pennsylvania so i can only shop on the right side out here got all the nutrition facts for you there's 34 grams of sugar so it's about as much sugar as an average soda i'm curious if it's as sweet though because personally drinking weed just does not sound that appealing to me let's find out took off the child lock smells like orange soda looks like orange soda but does it taste like orange soda wow it's actually extremely refreshing there's like a slight weedy aftertaste a little terpy but like it's not bad it's not like actually like weed or like planty it's like actually like terpy i honestly expected to hate this and i kind of like it it's pretty good again this is not going to get me like [ __ ] lit this is basically like me taking one hit of weed and drinking a soda with it now if one hit a weed is all you need this is probably going to be pretty good for you but if you're trying to smoke all day constantly be like getting that high this isn't ideal what i liked about lit was they had literally products for everybody their edible selection was huge they had so many different options like they even had drinks like that's pretty cool they had super cheap stuff and they had the super expensive stuff that i buy so there's really everything in between it's weird it's like already flat it like still tastes good but it doesn't have that like carbonated like bite that soda has to it typically i literally poured this two minutes ago so the fact that it's already flat is kind of weird personally when i consume edibles i want to have like a nice 50 to 100 milligram dose and please don't leave me a comment saying about how your plug makes 500 milligram edibles and anything less than that of [ __ ] i really do not care about the crush you have on your drug dealer and i don't care about how he's lying to you doesn't hatch cannabis empowers soda curious how blue raspberry soda is going to taste i [ __ ] with like a blue raspberry slushie so i'm kind of hoping that's the effect we get the lack of carbonation is weird i really can't get over it this tastes like straight up blueberry i definitely like the orange soda more if you like blueberry you'll definitely like this but it is an intense blueberry again not weedy at all though like it's definitely a little turpy you can taste them like weed terps kind of like the problem with this is dude like i just drank a soda and a half i don't want any more soda don't get me wrong i love a good soda but there's an excess to this and for this if i'm actually trying to get high i'm really not trying to drink four or five sodas there's definitely a market for this i just don't know if this is something i'm gonna get again like i'd rather smoke a joint and drink a root beer i don't know if i need them to be like the same thing together i also picked up these edibles just because the packaging kind of sold me they're called wild i got their raspberry gummies there's 10 edibles in this box and each one is a little over 10 milligrams even these might look like a lot but like i could eat five of these and get a 50 milligram dose way easier than drinking five whole sodas when i get edibles on the wreck side i want them to be like as small as compact as possible if i could get minced i'd be happy like if you could just throw five ten mints in your mouth and get a hundred milligram dose i'd be pumped these are actually really good probably because there's practically no weed in them that you can actually enjoy the flavor you wouldn't really think that there's weed in this as you ate it i mean two more i didn't even realize this but the sparkling water has no carbs in it that's pretty nice isn't it kind of funny how edibles are all like the most unhealthy food and then they're designed to get you high as [ __ ] to the point where you want to then eat more unhealthy food dude these are really [ __ ] good this is my breakfast today i swear to god i really don't want to finish this one i'm not going to lie you guys the orange soda tasted really good and like i'm like kel from keenan and kel like i just [ __ ] love orange soda but like this blue raspberry it's just too sweet ultimately if you're looking to get [ __ ] up there's better ways to spend your money just take a fat dab or something but like if you're just looking to have a new way to experience cannabis which i'm always down for this is pretty fun ultimately when it comes to like a favorite edible brand i don't really have one i'm not really loyal to edibles i don't consume them a lot so i don't have like the experience with all the edibles i like the wanna brand when i'm out here a lot typically but these lift ones are fire i really like i can't stop eating these i'm eating like five of these before i've finished this soda oh i'm at like a real stand still guys i really do not want to drink any more of this oh it's so close to being done though i like how it just has a little thc morning a lot like gummies oh this is getting worse and worse i'm gonna try this raspberry sparkling water i'm gonna compare it see how it is flavor-wise but i don't know if i'm gonna finish this one i've had so much carbonated beverage already smells just like sparkling water looks just like sparkling water that was waste [ __ ] that unless you're on like a no carb low calorie diet uh just stick to the soda it's this is bad i'm going to eat another edible just get that taste out of my mouth these are fire dude i know i was supposed to make this video about the sodas but these wild edibles are [ __ ] delicious but like look at this guys i've eaten 80 milligrams of these already and i had 20 milligrams of the sodas and this was a much more enjoyable experience the sodas are cool but i personally feel like they really only belong on the med side where they're 100 milligrams like if i could drink a hundred milligram soda i would drink it but at 10 milligram i'm just like that's just not enough for me but click like if you enjoyed this video and leave me a comment let me know what your favorite edible brand is it doesn't need to be in colorado just let me know and make sure you subscribe we got a lot more videos on the way especially my tour with lit dispensary you guys are not going to want to miss this video it was so cool i got to check out their grow i got to check out their store and it is in like the coolest location you guys you do not want to miss this video feels weird to just be like consuming weed but not be high this is the last one of the wild edibles i consumed a total of like 130 milligrams so i will get a decent high from this actually but again if you're consuming these 10 milligram wreck edibles make sure you're getting as small or as delicious of like pieces of candy or mints that you can like little mints are so much easier to consume than like an entire brownie or an entire soda but thank you guys so much for watching i truly appreciate every single one of you my name is jeff peace", "Z9jrHoPJb3k": "[Music] [ __ ] enemy how y'all feelin did they mention it today we don't be talking about some [ __ ] kind of nanos these are some edible gummies these shits or Varmus [ __ ] but before we get into that [ __ ] of course you know I gotta ask you where the [ __ ] is another [ __ ] guys please subscribe to my [ __ ] man I appreciate everybody that's here and always say it cuz always [ __ ] mean it and make sure you hit that so you can get a notification anytime so don't forget the follow up [ __ ] over on Instagram this cannot underscore me cannot under [ __ ] score me alright so if you don't like the word [ __ ] mother pregnant you should probably go to another [ __ ] sample I'm gonna just tell you that [ __ ] right now alright so hitting my little uh my extreme cubing dad my weed man came through the other day I want to say you sailor sunday driver I'm not 100% sure but the shade is bomb and any other boy with a little ounce of shape for Christmas so that's dope what kind of lead man gives you Christmas yes what kind of nanos Matt he's [ __ ] right here I ain't gonna front they probably the dopest they're probably the dopest edibles in my opinion that I've had that's on the market that I've had sorry he's gonna need no booze on the market I'm saying it was on the market that's I've had okay so I really like them it's a hundred milligrams and the whole thing and it's five milligrams each dummy now a lot of [ __ ] be like oh 100 milligrams etting she got it had thousand milligrams if you got a thousand [ __ ] from the [ __ ] shop it probably wasn't a thousand milligrams I don't give a [ __ ] what you say or what you think it probably was not a thousand milligrams now some people can't take that [ __ ] don't get me wrong but most people can't because I've had a lot of people that has say a hundred that ain't [ __ ] I ain't got I'd do a thousand I'd do 500 and then they'll take like 10 or 15 of a real actual tested gummy and number uh gonna be [ __ ] up so I don't want to hear that [ __ ] so you know but don't get me wrong some people's tolerance is stronger than that [ __ ] you know cuz I also know that because my tolerance is like probably 40 54 where I like my high to be and if I wanted I could go 60 70 and still be like oh I wouldn't like out there but I could see people being over 100 but my point is you give them up like as a try on the dole singing it yo [ __ ] is to hide I think you need to take a month like a break if your tolerance is too goddamn much so anyway in Tunisia's ah let's see you got twenty gummies in here so I can say it's 100 milligrams one gummy is a serving and so you're looking at 23 servings in this [ __ ] no I'm sorry so many free calories per gummy okay when you're looking at the fat to zero fats about six grams of sugar and I mean six rounds of carbs and four grams of sugar so if you're on a keto diet this definitely is not the one for you and if you are vegan this is not for you or vegetarian this is not for you and the reason for that is because this does have gelatin in it which is weird though because the main ingredient is going to be agar but then they put gelatin in it so you could have just stopped with the agar instead of putting the gelatin in it and this is why I say this for companies that'll do this I give you when I come into the dispensary and they'll ask hey do you have any vegan gummies right that's understandable I've never remember you might have had a [ __ ] come in and say do you have non vegan gummies even make sense so the average person I'm talking probably 95 plus percent of people do not know the difference between a vegan gummy and when it comes to the taste so if I was a company I would just make all my [ __ ] vegan because it don't matter who will eat it because now it can get to anybody because no one's looking for the gelatin the market is not looking for the gelatin so I would just change that up if I was you [ __ ] because they have some that are vegan and those are good and there's no difference in the taste so to me they might as well just do all of them as vegan so I don't know why they only do a couple of women beginning some of them not but that's that so the other dope thing with this company is that they do them in sativa indica and hybrid so I like that because now you can get a little specific with your filling and your effects of [ __ ] and some companies stick to just doing this shit's hybrid which i think is it I think it makes sense because you know if the person walks up and that's the only gummy there some people would not [ __ ] with it if it's in the car and not [ __ ] wouldn't fit sativa but if it's hybrid they're like all right let's go [ __ ] it let me get it so I see the positives of that however the ones who are able to beast like specific admission I see there should fly off the shelves way quicker then a hybrid ones so this one right here is a cran a crammed pomegranate punch weird [ __ ] I don't know but it did taste good and the other cool thing with this is that it's enhanced nano molecular technology that they put in here in gummies and what man no molecular means whoa I don't even understand how that makes it react faster because it makes it react faster but what that means is that's just like a way of like I guess you could say measuring like how the speed of your molecules changing inside of your body so I think what's happening here is that they've sped up the process somehow of making the molecules in your body change for you to feel that humming um it's scented at two hour waiting game these [ __ ] is like probably 20-30 minutes if that like I got to give it to a one what was it last weekend for some reason I couldn't sleep welcome to 1:30 was up like a [ __ ] and I had to go rock climbing at like 10 o'clock or so I was tired as [ __ ] didn't want to go because I hadn't had any sleep whatsoever so I took ten milligrams of this [ __ ] and this [ __ ] was like a six hour energy drink like it was dope it really worked there was no crash I was like goddamn that [ __ ] is pretty bomb and so I like that versus that two hours you don't know when is gonna kick in type of filling cuz I've had that [ __ ] happen before once and some edibles cup but god I took the [ __ ] because it took so long for dumb [ __ ] to kick in I'm sitting there and I'm like mm-hmm hey y'all see that leprechaun run by look how things are turning out of nowhere you forgot you took some [ __ ] so uh I like these because they react a lot quicker so I definitely say give these shits a try now let me show you what they look like they like in little coin shapes and they are gluten free for all you gluten-free [ __ ] out there so it's a little sugar sprinkles on top of it mm-hmm so I'm fine and taste of them are really good no no she was bomb man actually there's really really good so it says that the candies Awards I never saw this really the winner most accurate formulated edible I guess that you mean it's pretty consistent and what they're doing in it I guess it's on mark of what is supposed to but yeah I got a really say my Anisha it's a pretty dope and another thing is some people don't like it we on 5 milligrams per they like oh how come I can't get nothing stronger it's still a hundred milligrams in the package whether I gave you 10 10 milligrams or 25 milligrams it's still the same [ __ ] amount and I personally like when they can chop it down like that because first of all some of these gummies are just good goddammit and I like that [ __ ] so I like to be able to eat more than one and that's one thing the other thing is you have more control over your dosing so let's say you want to go 25 instead of going 20 or 30 like 20 is not enough but 30 is too much so you just want to be at 25 I ain't the one for biting the [ __ ] in half and then putting that [ __ ] back you got me [ __ ] up I don't think that smart I don't think that's a sanitary I think this is like a nasty bout [ __ ] you put that [ __ ] back into the bag with the rest of my fingers now you'll slime it and touch the other ones he you nasty so for me I like to go put five milligrams and so I can like micro dose my [ __ ] and I can have more than one I will say this does give you a little bit of after cannabis he tastes but who gives a [ __ ] it's [ __ ] candidates like I hate when people be whining over to flavor like my Adeline fat and in my mind I'm like I would like to taste the vodka but I'll still take a shot I know you know like oh I just love that case well you say you like the taste of survive that is because it was smoother than the dog [ __ ] you started on back in the day so get the [ __ ] out here so you don't get a little cannabis taste just you know manna lemon woman up and grab you chronic leaves and [ __ ] take the tents guys damn it but even with that being said it's really just a good good gummy but you do get a little bit aftertaste a little bit weak but anyway so definitely I say [ __ ] these if you find these [ __ ] I say get them I'm gonna ask the the company when I see them why they don't just do it all it just you know Eggar and just make them all plant based versus doing the gelatin I say this ain't no like oh go on and be vegan and about that this is literally just to me from a company standpoint it'd be like if I was only in the company I would just make it where I know everybody can get it but I wouldn't even promote them as being safe vegan I would just put them out on the shelf and let them be what they are so that would be me if I was the one doing it but anyway that's the end of this video I hope you guys enjoyed it like I say have you seen these [ __ ] make sure you get them and before you get out of here make sure you subscribe and hit that

five pieces 20 milligrams each made with premium MKX gold distillates the flavor is blazing blue raspberry I've had regular blue raspberry other companies like this magnet it's been tested by CSI labs

pain in the ass not just like these things really don't know so there's like the little lips sealed down in there you take your nail any kind of like work into it just kind of break it free after a second and then you can break in [Music] nice little thick pieces [Music] cheers fans definitely got blueberry although that's amazing flavor really amazing flavor there so if you got a have tried MKX and they're coming let me know which ones you've tried what you thought of them flavor is on point really can't taste too much of a chain see on the back end definitely a lot of flavor from glue right there definitely high quality made there nice clean taste good pretty much I want to say I was not allergy free but there's pretty much very slim chance you're gonna be allergic to anything that's in this there's no milk eggs fish felt shellfish tree nuts peanuts wheat soy were used during production of this product so pretty much almost hit just about everything but thank you [Music] about six or seven ingredients to actually make it [Music] we've got your little scan codes for your testing results scan it right at your phone results from right over your phone you can make sure everything's legit with this company which they are great company I had the watermelon the other day and they were off the hook so I was like how I gotta try these grab some of the blue radish play some blue

This sh*t is crazy! What up, Internet? Corinne here, and you're watching Corinne vs The Galaxy! Yes! Today, I'm trying a project that's been suggested a gazillion times. The galaxy lollipops. \"Stuttering Noise\" Hold on. Let me fix this real quick. *Banging Noise* Phew! That should do it! Are you ready for blastoff? Let's get started, shall we? *Engine Noise* *Cartoonish Sound Effects with Darth Vader's Breathing* This video posted by 10 Minute Crafts, makes it look pretty easy. So, I'm gonna follow their instructions and dive right in. The first thing we have to do, is crush some Jolly Ranchers. F*** yes! This is a major stress reliever right here! *Clanging Noise* Actually, this is pretty damn hard. Some of these little suckers do not want to break. Oh, yes. A mallet. *laughs* This definitely works a lot better. This process alone took me more than thirty minutes. So you're a f***ing lie, 10 Minute Crafts. A lie! Also, what the f*** are these things? This is not Jolly Rancher. And it seems pretty important for the final outcome because of the white. No mention of this candy anywhere. What is this candy? Ugh, now I'm gonna have to go to the store, and find some stuff that will work. Yes! Candy melts! That's the ticket! Okay. Now we just separate our candies, into little sections on this lollipop mold thing. But, *laughs*, they're all stuck together now. Yeah, I just have to chisel it out here, I guess. Alright, now separating the candies into the lollipop mold thingy. And then adding some of the white candy melt pieces. Wait, does this go in the microwave or the oven? Rob said to try the microwave. Don't know why I'm listening to him, but we're gonna do it. Yeah, this doesn't really fit in here. The little spinny plate can't really spin. And only half of them are heating up. So, that's a no. Great, now we know. That's why this show exists. Isn't it awesome? Okay. Let's try the oven, then. Wait, maybe this is good? Maybe if I mix things around a little bit? Sure, okay. Yeah, I don't know. The candy melts seem a little curdlely? I guess that can represent some star clusters? Yes. We have to let those cool and prepare our sugar mixture. Just add in sugar, water and corn syrup. So now you're supposed to cook that until it reaches 300 degrees. To be honest, this takes a while. Once you reached burning stage, you're getting pretty close. Actually, I don't know. This kinda looks pretty yellow. But little things like that wouldn't stop God. Right? God? Are you out there? Can anyone hear me? Yeah, now you have to pour your melted sugar solution, into a measuring cup. And then pour that, into one side of a cake pop mold. Now we're supposed to sprinkle some edible glitter, on top of there. To create some cosmic star dust. Yeah, that's that star stuff. Maybe I'm God. *MWAHAHAHAH* The power's in my hands! Then you're supposed to place your colored piece, good side down. Into the melty sugar substance. Now if you're smart, you'll already know that this sh*t is really hot. And it's probably best that you don't try to touch it with your bare human flesh. F*cking dumb-dumb! This sh*t burnt my finger and it hurts like a mofo! F***! *Sigh* Okay, now we have to let this cool. Great. I guess they look okay? You know what, I still have faith. You just have to melt some grape Jolly Ranchers, in the cake pop mold, which is easy enough. And then add a lollipop stick to each one, like this. And place the other piece on top! This is a little bit of a messy process, so be patient. Um, okay. I think these are gonna work. But this, this is when the real magic is supposed to happen. Got my blow dryer and here we go. The big reveal. Yeah, this is definitely not what I was expecting. I mean, I guess if you want to keep things positive, it kind of looks like Mars? Which is in a galaxy, I guess? *SIGH* Okay, um, we obviously need to try this again. And I'm thinking we need this candy. Right here. Actually, you know what? It kinda looks like one of those candy sticks that the Cracker Barrel sells. Okay, Cracker Barrel, here we come. Ooh, I wanna play checkers. You go first. Random person: Oh. they're here. Fine, I'm gonna leave now. Bye. Ooh. *Laughs* Look, here's me. Triggered. Mhhhh. Rob: Oh, Jesus. Corinne: It's the peacock section. Do you need anything from the peacock section? \nRob: *laughs* There's no black and white ones but I think these should work. Sour green apple. That's a big bag. That's heavy. Can you get this for me? All righty. Here we go again. Luckily, I also got some of these peppermint because these ones are mostly white. And the sour apple ones are mostly green and that is not what we were going for. Why you gotta let me down, sour apple? I thought we were friends. The only problem I foresee is that the lollipop is gonna taste like peppermint now. But honestly, that doesn't really matter to me because I don't plan on letting anyone eat any of these. Yeah, okay, here we go. I'm just randomly adding all the different colors to my lollipop mold. And you know what? I'm feeling really good about this round. Into the oven, we go. These are already looking better. Not all curdlely and what not. Let me get them a little mixing. I think we got something here, kids. Now time to retry the sugar-water-corn syrup situation again. And I think this is also looking a lot better. Meanwhile..Yeah, um, my measuring cup is currently occupied. So I'm just gonna use this other little vessel here. And yeah, sure. Now we pour this into our cake pop mold again and let it cool for a bit. Now I'm just adding my cosmic star dust and my galaxy disks. And now we wait. For like six days or something. Let it marinate. Now that shit didn't take billions of years. It only took six days and only rest on the seventh. Yes. Alright, we're just gonna pop these suckers right out of there, and I'm thinking it's looking pretty good. Not as yellow as the other ones, so that's a good sign. Now we melt the grape again. Hehe. Add our lollipop sticks which I was much more organised about this time. And then just stick our other half in there. I think my grape was a little too hot. When I did it this time, because things started spreading out a little more than they did previously. Also, this made it a lot more clear without the need of the blow dryer. So I'm gonna go ahead and say this was intentional. They look pretty dang cool. I actually did hit them up with the blow dryer a little bit and this just brought them to a whole other level. It's honestly quite the process, though, so you want to be a little careful. Those people, they can shove their ten minutes right up their ass. Right down their black hole. No? Too far? Okay. To keep it 100 with you, I would probably rethink some of the color combos if I were ever to do this again, But since I'm planning to never, ever do this again, I think they look f***ing great. Really like this one, but this one is my favorite. I mean, all of them are pretty cool and kind of out of this world. From this moment on, you can now refer to me as the Galaxy Queen. I'll also respond to Guardian Of The Galaxies. Yes, here I am, your new galaxy queen! As the official galaxy queen, I control all existence, and am the knower of all things. For instance, here, in this galaxy, there's a planet called Catdor. Home to the giant fire-breathing cat dragons. There's not many a space traveler who had found their way here and lived to tell the tale. Except for Pete, Pete's a crazy motherf***er. And see this galaxy? This galaxy here actually contains the planet Earth. And you know Earth can be pretty cool? But, there's some f*cked up sh*t going on there right now. Actually, you know what? We're just gonna burn this sh*t to the ground and start all over again. Well, uh, I guess that's it for this video. Um, doesn't really matter if you subscribe or like it up and I probably won't see you next time. Computer, set a course for deep space nine. And computer, turn up the space jams. *lit af techno music*", "EHBqjp1NS7o": "what's up guys Sara here and today I want to show you guys how you can easily calculate dosage when making your own edibles so the first thing to understand is that the average dose is considered to be ten milligrams if you're new to using cannabis or you have a really low tolerance level you might need like half of that maybe even less if you have chronic pain or your chronic user you might need considerably more so it's just good to maybe aim for the 10 milligram mark and when you eat your edible eat like half of it wait the 60 to 90 minutes and see how you feel and then you know for next time maybe you need the whole thing maybe you need to maybe you need even less okay but when we're calculating the dosage when you're making your edibles at home it's kind of nice because you can gate you can make them basically cater to exactly what you need based on your personal requirements so what you want to start off with is some cannabis obviously and this is more than a gram but like just for simplicity sake let's say this as a gram of cannabis now when we're talking about dosage we deal in milligrams like I said the average dose is 10 milligrams so I'm gonna take this one gram and convert it to milligrams one gram of cannabis is a thousand milligrams okay and then if you know the strain then you will know what the dosage is of THC in that cannabis so some strains have 22% some have only 12% the average is 10% so if you don't know what it is go with the 10% mark but obviously it can vary quite a bit it's best if you know what the strain is that's that you're using so we've got a thousand milligrams in our one gram and for simplicity sake again we're gonna state we're gonna go with the average teach the content which is 10% so 10% of a thousand milligrams we go 10% times a thousand I got 100 milligrams so in that one gram of cannabis there's a hundred milligrams of THC now let's say I'm gonna make a batch of cannabis infused coconut oil so I'm gonna take a cup of coconut oil I'm going to infuse it with cannabis and then I'm gonna use it to make something gummies or cookies or whatever okay so I have my one cup of coconut oil I add my 1 gram of cannabis which is a thousand milligrams which contains a hundred milligrams of THC so I know now that in this one cup of coconut oil there's a hundred milligrams of THC now when I go to bake with this let's say again for simplicity reasons or sake I am going to use that whole cup of coconut oil and in a bake a batch of cookies and I got 25 cookies out of that batch so I've used the whole cup I've used the hundred milligrams of THC and I got 25 cookies so I go 100 milligrams you know that was in that recipe divided by the 25 cookies so I know that each one of those cookies has 4 milligrams of THC in it and like we said the average dose is 10 milligrams so this would be a really good like starter amount for somebody you can have one cookie which only has 4 milligrams of THC see how you feel next time maybe you need two cookies or next time you make a batch of cannabis infused coconut oil maybe you use two brands or three brands or whatever depending on what you need personally so that's a really easy way to we calculate dosage when making your own edibles so that you can better control your own medicine and how it best works for you thanks so much for joining me guys if you're new to the channel please hit the subscribe button and feel free to check out my website too it's food is free com have an awesome day and happy baking", "L2vQzbYUFQ8": "SOCIAL MEDIA BY STORM -- A DAD COMING HOME AFTER WORK, EATING DINNER AND THEN ENJOYING SOME BROWNIES FOR DESERT.

Facebook though but I really just want to do a video so I guess anybody who comes in and just pick up when they come in so I want to get this done all right I don't know if I'm gonna wait for any people to arrive I'm just gonna start doing what I'm doing and if someone comes in that's great okay I'm gonna be making Jolly Rancher edibles with canvas so what I'm gonna be using is tincture you can get from you dispenser re I made it myself if this is a THC Pro and chem dog what I do is I actually cook live plants I have an illness I have fibromyalgia so I cook with live plants and I cook cooked the plants for about 24 hours in palm palm leaf glycerin you can get it on Amazon or anything like that okay so we're going to be using the tensor that I made which is an indica indica for night time I usually I just got finished doing the day but I want one for the nighttime we're gonna use 45 Jolly Ranchers seems to be the best for the the molds that I have which are emoji I'll show you those so it's white die very just unwrap them when you unwrap them what's going to happen it's cool they're gonna go like this this is not gonna be the situation afterwards okay afterwards you're gonna wind up with you're gonna wind up it's gonna be a little bit more sticky so don't anticipate for them to be like this I keep the rapper's after I drop them so there's 45 of them I keep the rapper's I will show you afterwards they won't go in the same way like this they'll go in from the side and it's kind of like the same thing and I'll show you in the end how that's gonna work out now so I use 45 of these I use watermelon I get them from Amazon I love them then like my what about one's my favorite and Jolly Ranchers are by far my favorite and one of my fav one of my things was trying to get this recipe so that when I put in my liquid cannabis it stays more like a candy I must have gone through so many tries doing this and it winding up you can actually cook if you wanted to cook less of them you could get like a gummy candy but my fake teeth so I'm not using that I need to have a solid candy and be able to suck it all the way through and and you know what I don't really want to eat them like that because when you start to eat them like that though you can get a little bit carried away especially with like my Jolly Ranchers I like to have probably one every hour or so so I don't want if I said chewy candy I'll just chew it up but not with these teeth okay okay so 30 milligrams depending on what you want it's tin sure you can use the alcohol tin sure if you wanted to just the alcohol will burn off you could use I used cooking hash before and I would just throw it in and it almost didn't matter what how many how many Jolly Ranchers don't kind of glue up back up the same way okay so I'm also gonna add a Tama butter just to keep the facts rolling because cannabis stays glues itself just absolutely glues itself to any fatty substance that's why it's good for them to go into baked goods brownies and all that's fun stuff so okay we're gonna I'm gonna use my like nonstick pan just a little tiny pan it's not gonna take much the smaller almost the better because I mean really look I just this and it's gonna be on the bottom and you want to be able to keep control of this now this has been on D carved you need some decor of your cannabis most of the time if you're going to do almost any cooking with it except I cook fresh so what I do is I'm cooking it fresh for 24 hours which actually then activate the cannabis so that and furthermore I'm now gonna cook it again now if you do a cooking hatch or you're doing a concentrate it hasn't been activated yet so you need to make sure to stay in this pot for like 20 minutes and try to keep it on 300 for that 20 minutes if you do that you should be golden okay so we're gonna get started now and I'm gonna put it on on a very low I haven't looked at the stove so and I'm currently I have an electric stove with this I hate electric so I so much more prefer fire if I was cooking but now that I'm cooking cannabis I'm so glad to have a an electric stove okay so I'm gonna throw some butter in I'm gonna take my t-shirt here I'm taking in 30 gram 30 30 milliliters milligrams no I'm not exactly sure mm ml in grams okay so it is at 30 taking me a minute to get this going to make sure that it's the exact right consistency your marijuana after you're using it okay so here is gonna show you here is the what it looks like in the pan and then I'm gonna start to you see that yes so let's get this going and like I said it's on a medium very not even meet him he on like a three I have it on very very low I just want to get the butter into the tint tincture I don't suggest you use a I suggest using only plastic utensils with this because the candy when it when it becomes a solid again it's going to get into the wood it just the my wooden spoons are just not the greatest okay so now what I'm going to start to do is so now this is all ready now if you were gonna do this with a hash you would start with the butter and really make sure it's on low and then start to cook your Jolly Ranchers I'm shaking you guys like nuts I'm sorry alright let me hold this a little bit better see that looks good so like right now I can the marijuana smell is starting to come up into the house now it's not a heavy duty smell this is probably lighter than normal but if you are gonna have guests your house is gonna smell like marijuana you may not smell it but your guests will want to give my sister cookies in public she's always says that they smell this is just gonna take a minute but you gotta keep it going you got a he picky pick go in keep it go in and it's gonna be funny because it's going to once it gets totally liquid it's gonna be really easy to work with but it's gonna get not easy and fast go a little bit slower to and you can see that the water the texture is starting to get pink and I have one viewer on here hi how are you I hope you're enjoying this please share it I would okay even though I've had a ton of people asked me for this and now I can just point them in this direction and they will be able to go and make it I'm always being asked on my social media to do videos so now I am doing them I'm just doing them live I can't see any comments if there is any so we're getting there we're getting there were getting there once these get warmed up and get heated it's gonna like it gets very gooey very fast and then it gets really really easy to work with I was very surprised how easy it was for me to work with this once it got melted because I have I have fibromyalgia so my I incorporate cannabis into my life because I have fibromyalgia and I think just by far is the best medicine that I take I think it would definitely be the last one that I would allow them to take from me if I had the choice I still I'm all medicines and I'm really working hard to get the right dose going with the cannabis but the more I the more I I know the more that I eat it the better I feel so one of those I like to have a second candy so I wanted to make sure to have I actually had a company that I was buying from and they had something that was called Ranchers and it's by want to say baked it's the company but really nothing nothing for the amount that I was spending on them I could just cook it myself and be done with it I don't want to be bothered with having to put money in other people's pockets when I am gonna be leaving my own money in my pocket and being disabled I gotta keep as much money as possible all right we're starting to really Eric we're getting there we're getting there it's getting there it's getting there it's getting there but I like to show how it's going it entire time so that you understand what what it takes to and what it's going to look like and not just oh all of a sudden it looks like this no it's gonna take you a minute to stir it and start it start started started sir they still have these candies left to go so but as soon as this gets all liquidy I will be able to start throwing in more and they will liquefy much faster and of course I would normally use my other hand to hold this still which I'm holding the camera with just so you can see it right I should get a stand we are getting there see now look how easy it's getting to be worked with like this is just so much easier now and see how the the tincture is still like it's not mixed in all the way so if you were to do it like this you would really have to whip it and like if you wanted to do a smaller amount say I guess I took about half in there where you wanted to make it a chewy you would like really make sure that you whip it whip it whip it whip it whip it whip it whip it whip it whip it whip it and then put it in your mold but I didn't really need to do that because I am going to be keeping it solid usually I like throw maybe in a couple at a time but they almost all fell in anyway so I might as well just take it from there all right yeah I'm having a hard time because I normally just stick in a couple of something and I just said that no I said it twice and that's what will happen when you smoke cab as you'll say things twice some talking all right well hello hello my second person watching I'm so excited I cannot see comments right now if you are commenting there I have to push on the thing I have gloves on so I'm not gonna be able to see anybody comments but um please share [Music] everybody always wants to know how to make cannabis candy it's so easy so easy just so ridiculously easy now if you wanted to you could go to your dispensary buy like want to say an ounce of some nice you know some nice weed and cannabis marijuana pot have you wanna call it and you're gonna bring that home you would take a full pound of butter and first you would put the the cannabis in in a tin in a tin pan and you would put tinfoil over the top and then you would cook it bake it on low for [Music] see then it's not the recipe I'm just giving you extra because this is taking a long time you were D carve it so you put it in the tappan you put it in the oven with the tinfoil on top and then you bake it at like 125 so like 150 for two and a half hours no no no no you know what look it up on the internet I'm pretty sure it's one no no I'm so sorry this is not my recipe right now because I don't cook this way I always to cook with my pictures I don't ever use anything else so the fact that I'm trying to come up but this is old and I headed that's its problem okay so if you'll go to the Internet it's kinda butter and it really is just bake it you have to I think the baking in the oven could be for 25 minutes or can a be an hour of 25 minutes or two hours and 45 minutes I can't quite remember like I said it's not my forte I am going to make some kind of butter and get it right and then put it on live as well let me just put this down so I can get this going just first live ever so sorry for my one person who was watching alright I just needed to get in here a little bit like this but it's it's a very sticky but then you're gonna put the cannon we after you cook after you D carve it in your oven you're going to you're going to melt the pound of butter in like a saucepan and then put the cannabis into the butter now you died I think you're gonna cook for an hour and a half to two and a half hours I'm not exactly sure and then you would use the butter right into here and it would probably like even out you only want to use the wood you would be using like one stick so like an ounce and now it's a butter and that would be comparable to the tensor and then it would in my mind it would definitely come out the same way I don't see any reason why it wouldn't come out the same way all right all right but my one person is watching I don't know who you are but thank you so much for watching okay so here we are I see I still have a little bit there's still a couple in there but this is primarily what it looks like so it's not going to be as see-through as its start first started because we're use that we used butter so it has just a small tint on there this is so easy so so so easy yeah almost there I should have thought about this in the first place goes right into my crook of my arm here and I'm a little turning now see it's very I mean better than you would think it is but is when you're holding it but it is very easy to work with I was very scared that it was not going to allow me that I was gonna go get so stiff on me now you're gonna lose like a little bit like on the sides and whatever it don't really worry about that most of you medicine is gonna be in here it's gonna be nicely mixed okay so that's evenly evenly through all of your candy it's gonna be even it's not gonna be like there's a piece here and this piece here and this piece here and this piece there it's not gonna be stronger in one spot then it is gonna be in another so now these are gonna turn out to be about five milligrams of THC this might be ten I'm going you know what I'm gonna say it might be 10 because the I used the THC Pro and I used the chem dog which are you know pretty strong indica breeds strains so this one could be stronger it's not really intended to make for me it's just about kind of making it through the day with my pain so if I can put it on myself a little at a time that is just so much better for me and being that this is something that I like to I try to have to incorporate it into something that I like to do because I'm actually like handstand medicine until I was sick but cannabis just was not a part of my life I didn't do any drugs I didn't drink I didn't do anything but cannabis has just made a whole world of difference whether it just be for me being my fibromyalgia or the fact that I'm gonna have an attitude with my family and you know we're getting in there that the world is changing so see how we're getting now with that so good I love these they taste just so amazing I brought to my door and she was like no I don't want to eat it she really really doesn't what she likes to smoke it but she doesn't like the taste of it in her food so she put this one in her mouth and she's like oh my gosh this is so good okay so now what I'm gonna do is super spoon okay now I'm going to just hold you up here get this as good as possible kind of far away but alright I might have to put you back here alright so now at this point so easy mix it up still um okay now this is the special part because you want to get it in to the molds and put to the side is kind of as quickly Funko's you're gonna take off the heat so we are gonna go ahead and take off the heat I'm gonna leave it there okay for this second do this on the stove it'll just be easier to wash off so you I have emojis can you see that yes see they're emojis they don't really come out looking like that though they they kind of do but not really so they're adorable but they're also like all the other ones had like edges and I had one that have hearts on them and then it has the edge and then it's in my mouth and I really frickin hate that so alright okay so now you're just gonna take your spoon and just go ahead and stop putting it into the molds and that's about it feels like one spoonful almost wonderful but was CMI you see how bad I shake oh my goodness okay look because I want to not like have candy everywhere and of course with my shaking of course I do and at this point with my fibromyalgia I'm trying I usually yelling at my husband to help at this point oh I'm in so much pain but because I'm on here talking and I know someone is watching that my Adrenaline's running so I'm not in pain but I'm still shaking that also could be my nerves too from doing my first life fill my [ __ ] person it takes more Muslims more time to get this in here now I should be able to pick one out once I get them into both molds I should be able to pick one out and show you what it's going to look like should be almost cool by then I think might be yeah all right so this has this mold has 24 and so I'm doing 48 candies though I'm getting it everywhere okay seriously last time I did this I did not get this like this this is horrible I'm gonna put him gonna want to put this in my freezer after this into mist you can see it's true see you know what you know why because the spoon that I used last time was a little spoon that was like perfect every scoop fill was perfect this one's a bit larger and you know what I'm short if you know how to cook candy you're probably looking at me going holy God what the hell is this person doing she's just making like an absolute mess of it but I will show you that it looks like right now I still have the other ones that go so there we go okay so yeah I did get it everywhere cuz that's just the way it is now at this point I really need to get moving because it's starting to get solid on me you see the strings coming out that's it getting solid I'm just gonna let some heat go on that so it's not so bad because this is a horrible mess but you know what I'm gonna do right after it's done I'm gonna eat the candy that smoke that's upbeats because it still will come out perfect it's just on the side it's not a big deal still candy see I didn't do that last time I had nice what a mess alright it's alright here we go heat back on it cuz it's just a mess right now well it's hilarious see that stringy stuff should not be happening see that won't happen if you use a smaller spoon and it drops right off and it's like perfect at the zone I use is old and gross and I really don't want to show that to you guys so I don't want to show you that that's what I'm using because you should be used to make sure that like everything that you're using is good because this is your mess and it is going into your body it's just an old spoon and it has like it's like it says 65 year old spoon so you could just imagine you but it's clean and it's usable but it doesn't look like it's used I'm gonna wind up with less than 48 I think and I just think that's because I got them on all the sides but don't worry whatever you get into the hole this will go down into that area like and you still will have a good candy and you can like spread it although it just seems to be sticking to me but I'm sure that you could [Applause] see now I'm a little a little bit more salad [Applause] it's stupid super-sticky when you let it go this long okay I should be done by now super super sticky so see that so once it goes kind of past you got you just sometimes you're better and just get it done really you could put it into I would assume that you I could probably put it into one of those cake things that squirt it out but I am bought one I don't really big all right I know it's my blog right but it's so good all right [Music] and my face but I have candy on them [Music] okay so stove off I'm a dumbass is what it is the first one was pretty much better they're heavy alright so this is what we have I don't remember which side we started off with so I'm just gonna pick us up I'm gonna pick this side because there's a little one in here now I was still little and it's not wrong it's not cold enough I should have put it in the freezer while I was taking care of that alone I'd see it's gonna come out looking if I pop it out now they're not ready they're still warm you know I don't have it open okay so just you really don't need to put them in the freezer see this comes right off it came right off oh yeah it was just wipe it down and it comes right off with the pan just put hot water into the pan don't forget to lick the spoon okay so that's my lollipop but like the next hour I let this dry chemical right action this is what I know because it is a decent amount that's been here I'm just like okay so this was what's left over in the pan and I usually they look that behind because I'm gonna eat this for the next like half hour or so because I'm a high dose er today I didn't have any but normally when I'm going to cook I always wind up running out unless my oldest daughter is here and she will my youngest daughter will cook for me as well I just hate asking her because she works so much but at the time I am cooking something that means like I have not had like I didn't have any candies today because I really needed to cook but I didn't get my approval to do my online my life until today so I just waited I don't know why I don't want to take the tension or just regular like in my cup or something but so this is like a big lollipop in the end so you can't take heed that's all but normally I would like to start off with a candy and then and then I would probably maybe have one every hour every couple of hours and if I haven't had something all day then I'm looking to have something more like 25 milligrams or above by the end of the day I usually hope to have a BMI system around a hundred and fifty milligrams which is just perfect for my body my [ __ ] body feels really really good at the end of the day I'm never actually stoned your body it doesn't edibles don't really work that what's in some edibles could really like send you into another space furthermore these edibles could also do that em it really depends on your tolerance it depends on how much them how long have you've been doing it you know someone actually could be there they're just even one thing just and you could smoke it and smoke and smoke it and then edibles will just not work for you so but for me they work really really good with my fiber males I really really really enjoy the fact that I have something that's more on the holistic side to working and that I can make any medicine so this was my video on how to make Jolly Ranchers go over real quick again I used my own tincture butter and regular Jolly Ranchers my favorite one Ellen and just rewind video whoops you can go back and you should have all the information if you have any questions for me please comment I

subscribe I will get back to you and as for now have a good day Cheers oh I don't know how to shut it off let's seal it like that", "yWvNBBq1Av4": "hi everybody its flower child and I'm coming to you tonight to show you how I make my hard candies with cannabutter so in the pot here nonstick pot I have a quarter cup of cata butter it's probably medium strength medium to strong kinda sorta depending on your preference I like the stronger that way you don't need so many candies anyway I'm getting ahead of myself so here we go quarter cup of can of butter in the pot and melting yay so we wait for that to go down then you have half a cup of corn syrup I use be high so there's half a cup of corn syrup 3/4 cup of white sugar here are my molds that I will be using and I pour my hard candy mixture in here and plop it into the mold you'll see that as well so I'm just gonna show you again you will need a quarter cup of butter 1/2 a cup of beehive corn syrup or whatever corn syrup you're gonna use I prefer The Beehive you can use your cheaper brine it really doesn't matter and then 3/4 cup of white sugar so I'm gonna go ahead and pour in the corn syrup I wish I had an extra hand but I don't so do the corn syrup I'll scrape that out in a second and you're putting your 3/4 cup and I like to just sprinkle it over I don't like to plop it all in in one little flop like I just did so you stir it all in it looks so good smells yummy too nice and sweet so you stir that around make sure it's all mixed up and there's no clumps or anything it will melt down with the heat regardless anyway do that and we need a thermometer a candy thermometer we go up to 300 degrees and this thermometer which takes about 15 minutes on the stove I like to have my temperature at 4 degrees you don't want to have it the stove too hot cause you will burn it and I have done that before which it's a total waste of ingredients but anyway sorry the boys heard a noise and like all boys do they mouth off so anyway again you will need 1/2 a cup of corn syrup 3/4 cup of white sugar and you will need 1/4 cup of cannabutter so the all the mixture is in there the stove is on I'm gonna put in my thermometer my candy thermometer and we're gonna wait for that to go up to 300 degrees which is perfect for hard candy so I'm gonna pause it and let it go anyway this goes for anywhere 12 to 15 minutes and it'll be at 300 degrees and tonight we are going to make root beer yummy so I'm gonna pause it now ok friends see you soon hi I just want to show you how it's cooking and it does bubble a fair bit but you just let that go be careful again that it is on a low temperature that you are not going to burn your ingredients you do not want to do that you want to cook it slowly but at a high enough temperature that it is going to boil like this so your eyes just above 250 sorry I had to look at it if my glasses I need better glasses so anyway it's up to 50 you're gonna pause it again - you're almost ready to pull out the thermometer and shut the oven or the stove and at that moment I put in a teaspoon full teaspoon of the root beer flavoring I am NOT going to show you myself doing that I'm the only one doing this and this stuff is quite hot so I will show you once the mixture is ready I put in a tablespoon or teaspoon sorry of the root beer flavoring in the pot stir it around then I pour all the mixture into my funnel and then I drop little by little obviously to make sure I get it in there enough and not too much in forgive the left side of the sink I have a few dishes in there I did not finish yet but I figured once I'm done all this I'll have to finish the dishes anyway so we're going to do that I am going to pause it and do the mixture and put it in the final so that I can put it into the mold okay so I have put them all in the moles if you are a little overflowed but I'm not gonna test them I'm just gonna leave them the way they are so there we go usually they do if I write on my measurements out I normally fill them all out but I was a little generous and the other ones so it doesn't matter but now I stick them in the fridge for about um you know about 15 minutes 15 20 minutes and they should be all solidified and hard and ready to be bagged up and put in the freezer so there you have it and they look good can't wait to have any but I hope you enjoyed this little instruction instructional video on how I make my canna heart candies so enjoy your day folks hope you enjoyed the video take care love and honey's flower child signing off have a great day stay true and stay unique bye Mase hope you enjoyed the video my friend", "v68wmJ03Roc": "welcome to another episode of the gold TSP I'm Ashley and today we're gonna making some vanilla bean rainbow sprinkle lollipops I wanted to use vanilla bean in these so that way you could see the vanilla flecks in the lollipop itself we're then going to top it with some rainbow sprinkles I am trying to hit 2,000 subscribers on my birthday in June so if you haven't hit subscribe hit that button now here's how we're going to make those lollipops the first thing we're going to do is make our candy base and I have 133 grams of light corn syrup in my saucepan I went ahead and measured it in here because I didn't want to waste any of that stuff because it's so sticky we're then gonna add 200 grams of granulated sugar and 75 grams of water we're going to take this over to the stove and cook this until it reaches 350 degrees Fahrenheit off to the stove we go while that's heating up on the stove we're going to prepare our candy making station I have a towel here that we're going to set our pot on as soon as it comes off the stove once it comes off the heat and it's here we're going to add a quarter teaspoon of vanilla bean powder this is crushed up vanilla beans and vanilla pods and we're going to dump that in and stir it through with our heatproof spatula well then take the mixture and pour it into a heat-safe jug well then pour these onto a Silpat mat I'm using my Mac around one because it has a template already on it but you can use a piece of parchment paper you can also use candy molds if you like we'll then sprinkle on our rainbow sprinkles and stick in our lollipops once that comes off the stove this is going to happen really fast that's what we're going to be all prepped and ready to go you [Music] our lollipops are all poured and I'm going to go ahead and let these cool for about 30 minutes just to let them set up and then you'll be able to pull them up in that and enjoy them well that's it for this episode of the gold TSP I hope you guys enjoy my vanilla bean rainbow sprinkles lollipop if you have any ideas for any flavors you'd like to see me make please leave me a comment down below and I'll do my best to make it happen you haven't hit subscribe hit that button now and like video if you did I'll see you guys in the next video", "AsHXOcp-bdU":

obsessed with candy I remember constantly begging my dad for\na dollar so I could get on my bike race as fast as I could to our local\nconvenience store where I would purchase as much candy as I possibly could for\nthat dollar and at that time you really could buy a lot for a dollar so in\nmemory of my younger obsession I figured we would switch up a few things and\nwe would make some liquor lollipops in this video we are going to make some\nmargarita flavor so let's go spice things up so on medium heat I'm going\nto add 3 cups of sugar 1/2 a cup of corn syrup and now 3/4 cup of the tequila mix okay so now stir this until the sugar\nkind of dissolves and then to add a little bit of color and a little bit of\nflavor I'm going to add the strawberry syrup and then one more teaspoon and\nthen stir it real quick and as you see it has started to bubble so now that it\nstarted to bubble we will want to stop stirring this and just let it bubble up\nand you'll want to take your candy thermometer and just check the\ntemperature and once it reaches 320 degrees we can add the liquor okay so\nin the meantime while your mixture is reaching a high temperature you want to\nget like a pan and line it with parchment paper or you can get some\nsilicone molds and just spray them with some cooking spray because you are\ngonna have to work really fast and so you want everything prepared and then\nyou want to get some sucker sticks also you can use skewers if you want and just\ncut them down alright that's looking pretty good between 300 to 310 is the\nhard crack stage that's why you want it to reach 320 okay so for the last\ningredient so now that this has reached the hard crack stage now we are going to\nadd some tequila this is just cheap tequila it doesn't have to be anything\nfancy and you'll want to add 1/4 cup of tequila and then I'm just gonna give\nthat one last stir to mix the tequila in and then I'm gonna check the temperature\nreal quick and you want to make sure it reaches 310 again alright guys if you\ncan see it's pretty much there at the 310 mark and just in case you're\nwondering it is kind of a long process it does take a while for it to heat up\nto the hard crack stage and then once you put the alcohol in it takes a\nlittle bit for it to heat back up to the hard crack stage as well but once it\nreaches 310 you can go ahead and just turn your burner off and then this is\nwhen you will want to work really fast so that you get perfect little\nlollipops because it definitely hardens really\nfast so I'm just going to pour mine right into the measuring cup so it'll be\neasy to work with okay so we're going to try really fast to pour it into the mold and then for the parchment paper you can\njust go ahead and just try to make little circles and then I'm just going\nto take some margarita salt and just put it on the top makes it a little pretty\nand really gives it that margarita drink taste and then you can take your sucker\nstick and just put them just kind of twirl it around like this and make sure\nit really gets into your syrup and then I'm just gonna lay my sucker sticks like\nthis because obviously these aren't real sucker candy molds but you can always\nbuy those at the store they actually do sell sucker molds but the whole point is\njust showing you you can really use whatever works for you or if you just\nwant hard candy you don't even have to add the sucker sticks it can just be\nhard candy okay so you can just leave it on the counter for about 10 to 20\nminutes until they hardened or if you want it done faster you can just put it\nin the fridge for about 10 minutes Aiden what are you doing getting a piece\nof candy see my boys have my same addiction of when I was a little girl\nwith loving candy my boys have candy jars alright so I actually put these in the fridge\nfor 20 minutes just so that they'd be nice and hard and if you can see they\nare done cuz you can hear it's nice and hard and then these ones really turned\nout really cute too so a little circle one and a little star and then these ones\nturn into like little cute hard candies so they all turned out really well\nI'll show you again so you can hear it so they did harden nicely and so they are done I hope you guys enjoyed making this\nrecipe so let's give it a try this is my broken one mmm this is really\ngood and if you guys have a favorite candy\nyou can send it to me and my boys and I will open it in an upcoming video where\nwe will try out all your guys's favorite candy and you can find my address in the\ndescription box below and if you have any questions just\ncomment below and if you want to see more videos please remember to subscribe to\nthis channel thank you guys so much goodbye

channel I hope you guys are having a good day you know what I mean like I'm so sorry for my wheel being in the way but um here's the thing I can't do anything about it because I don't have my tripod my tripod broke I try to get a tripod the other day and they didn't have any for some reason so I'm guessing I need to either order one online or just somewhere else I don't know what to really do about it but right now you're just gonna have to kind of deal with this I couldn't move it but then I'm gonna be like up here to video so I don't know what you guys would prefer see I'm saying like I just don't have any like flat oh that kind of worked okay okay we're gonna roll with it anyway so today I'm doing a quick little review on an edible eye balm I love edibles I mean I love him but at the same time they're deadly to me they're strong girl I took a edible for 4/20 it was the la familia hot chocolate one I took the whole thing and that thing smacked so today I didn't really want like a chocolate or like a brownie I wanted something like more candy like so I got the Smokies edible and these are in the sour blueberry fruit shoes basically so it's a hundred milligrams there's two milligrams of CBD per not per actually the whole bag is I guess that's what it is now per serving it's 10 milligrams of THC so per gummy and then 2 milligrams of CBD in one little gummy so I'm not gonna do the whole thing and by the way you guys this review is going to be really really [ __ ] forward really honest I'm gonna tell you guys about the taste I haven't opened these or anything yet so I want to record like my reaction of like the taste that I get instead of like trying them and then coming back and then you know my thoughts would be kind of you know what I mean so yeah anyways these are vegan this is a vegan uh thing not all of them are weakened from this brand so if you are vegan and you know you stay away from Dairy and stuff so I'll definitely ask them which one is the vegan one because I know not all of them are vegan but I know that their dairy they're gluten-free all of them are gluten-free but not all of them are vegan so I just got this because of the flavor you know what I mean so I'm not vegan so it doesn't matter to me but it's a good thing that it is vegan so I don't mind it and I don't really care so yes so the ingredients on here is just sugar corn syrup pectin I don't know what that is but it is citrus acid natural and artificial flavoring FD&C blue one which is probably like the color of the candy soy let union I don't know and then cannabis extract so the weed basically you know so yeah the sugars in this is four grams I'm thinking yeah per piece it's four grams so if I'm gonna have three of them for 12 grams of sugar when you do the math it's kind of a lot so these are sour they're Fruit Chews had crafted gluten free vegan and so I watched a review on these and people said that only 40 will do the trick I'm gonna try 30 just because I want to see how I feel and if I don't feel it as much I'm so sorry about the [ __ ] Sun oh my god but if you don't feel it as much then I guess well if I don't feel it as much because you're not going to taking them I am but if you don't feel it as much then I'll take then I'll take another one pretty pretty much but I know how adipose are they sneak up on me I keep eating them like I eat them and then I keep eating them and then boom you know so these were $21.99 okay before attacks at my dispensary so I think with tags and all the little bag they charge me for because I've got to break minds it was like $25 so basically it's really easy to open I just rip this up hopefully it's easy to open it cuz I haven't even opened it yet already strong it's kind of like this there's like a little this in here and I'm guessing you pull that apart and they open up they smell like blueberry literally like [ __ ] they smell like powder aid okay you guys the blue powder right that's what they smell like I totally spot on that's what I'm getting and they look really cute and like flat and big oh they're soft they're like super gooey look at all that little sugar let me just you know I'm saying basically they're just coated in sugar they're sour they're pretty big I would say they're like as big as a [ __ ] let me see some money up in here so this is a quarter and then they're a little bit bigger than a quarter even so okay you guys so I'm gonna try one and I'm gonna see you in like a week [Music] mm-hmm gather my thoughts okay so I'll say this they taste really good they have they're sweet they are sweet you know I'm saying like I'm not really like a candy person but I like gummies and like sour stuff so I can make an exception but they're really good I had one of these they don't taste like we do know what I'm talking about you know when you take some edibles and they have that weird like nasty aftertaste of the weed you know you can you feel on the back your throat and all that I don't get it with these ones so I'm gonna take another one this is gonna be my number two you know I'm gonna take the three in front of you guys so you guys know what's real and I'll check back in with like in an hour and two I got some laundry to do so I'm gonna be a little bit busy and then they're just gonna hit me like a truck and I'm gonna be gone you know what I mean I don't know I hope so I hope these are strong they were saying these were strong so they better be so this is gonna be twenty you know what I'm saying these are really good you guys like even if they didn't have ween in it I would probably eat them they're kind of like okay they're like a sour patch kit all most like they kind of remember that but they're not as sour they're like they're like up from sourness it's like a good five it's it's the perfect amount it's honestly good with this week and see what I mean so I'm gonna eat one more you know I'm saying well you know we get lead tea today [Music] he was a [ __ ] fly in here anyways these are really good I wish they had like a pack where they had like all the little flavors that would be really dope like you know they had blueberry rhinos berry that would be mom like a little mixed assorted pack but yeah so I've had if I'm gonna have three out of like seven left so that's 70 grams seven milligrams so basically I'm ready to eat another one this is gonna be thirty and I will check back with you guys and an hour or I think on the back it tells you yeah wait two hours so I'm gonna wait two hours and I think he's gonna give me pretty lip but I don't know because I'm not smoking at the time maybe I will smoke a bowl but I'm not gonna like smoke because I feel like when you smoke weed and you take edibles it's both of them combined and it's just too much so I'm really trying to see how strong these are going to be just with 30 milligrams and if you guys the real tea on this you know I'm going to eat the last one and then I'm gonna go and go do my little [ __ ] wash my drawers and then I'll be back and then I'll tell you guys how they are so yep sure yeah of course chuckles you guys but I told you guys I did a little bun you know what I mean it's like a tank guys so it's like eight o'clock now I took those three edibles at 6:00 it was kind of like noise in there but anyways there's six it's been like two hours I smoked a bowl I'm not really feeling it all that much so I'm gonna wait until like 20 more minutes see if it kicks in and then if not I'll take another alignment so then I'm gonna give it the complete fill out two hours so you know it's good at all so we'll see but if not I'm gonna take one more or maybe two more to see if it's gonna hit me later but yeah that was 30 milligrams and it's been like an hour and 40 minutes I don't really feel anything but I'm gonna wait 20 more minutes because you know how they are they hit out of nowhere so I'll be back with you guys I'm kind of talking fast I'm not trying to but it's just a quick update you don't even a brief summary so I'll be back and I'll see you in a bit hey y'all so it's an update it's been I think a day or so two days I don't know when I recorded that video but basically I'm here to give my initial and final final thoughts you guys about that edible the was it the sour blue raspberry by Smokies the gummies the Fruit Chews to be exact you guys they were [ __ ] smacking okay when I had the 40 milligram that night oh my god was I gone was like on I kept [ __ ] eating I didn't really felt them like hitting me like instantly instantly but I felt like they really creeped up little by little and I also feel like it took a little bit longer for 40 milligrams to hit me it took like I would say to and I have hours and then I was just like Munchie [ __ ] madness you know I was eating anything I was just eating chips food I ate even after my dinner like have some snacks if you're gonna eat some edibles because trust you're gonna need up and then what's getting pulled in here okay and then I took 50 milligrams that I think the day after okay I took 50 milligrams and that actually hit me a little bit sooner I would say that one they fit me I don't know why maybe like maybe because the timing that I took them at I feel like the first time I took the 40 milligram I took it at like 4 to 5 so it was like kind of late afternoon already so you know it girl was tired she was doing her SH and she was tired but the second time when I took it I took it earlier in the day I took it out like 2 o'clock because I wanted to be like awake and [ __ ] at least enjoy my high you know so I took the 15 milligrams and on this sweet so I took him I took him I'm chillin literally I would say two hours later two hours and ten minutes later it hit me I was at Walmart I was grabbing some things and that [ __ ] hit me like a brick like oh my god I was literally in one of the aisles and I was just [ __ ] dying you guys and I know you guys don't really care because don't everybody feels that way but I was legit like [ __ ] dying like over nothing and I was just like the [ __ ] but I realized that okay the edible so I know decided it's my cool I left Walmart and then even when I was home after that my boyfriend looked at me and he was like you're [ __ ] what did you do like I guess I was that [ __ ] high guys but I was like I just knew what it was you know to me that I didn't feel like I looked that [ __ ] high but I guess to somebody that you know from their point of view they would get it but um yeah to me I was really [ __ ] high but still productive so I would recommend taking them on like a very like good day that you're not gonna do [ __ ] you're gonna be eating a lot you're on your own time definitely don't do it if you're gonna go into work or something like that it's noticeable if you're high you know what I mean it is for me so my eyes got a little they got sleepy they got a little low they got red so you know but you guys the edibles smack I totally recommend them I'm going to try other flavors you guys I'm gonna do more reviews on this monkey's fan because I think it's probably one of the good ones okay really good really good so I've been totally gonna recommend to you'll I haven't tried other flavors but I definitely like the sour blue raspberry because I'm a sour person so you know I like sour candy so they were really my cup of tea so if you guys are into that I definitely recommend these edibles so that is my review you guys I don't want to keep going on and on and on but the same thing basically I rate him a 10 the taste is a 9 out of 10 the potency is a 10 out of 10 because I was gone with 40 so that's good because you can literally take 40 40 and then maybe the other two before work because it's like okay they're not gonna hit you as hard at vicious 20 milligrams you know what not as me as hard but like so like 42 like 60 it's like the perfect range for me yours might be a little different so I don't know so be careful but your dosage and all that dogs barking so I'm just gonna go and yeah you guys have a good day I'll see you on my next one bye bye", "e2UwbKShMC4": "[Music] [Music] you", "WHkCVQ4q1EM": "this is our one cup of organic sugar and there's a half a cup light corn syrup [Music] [Music] and then 1/4 cup of cup of and turn it on medium heat medium-high heat and you keep it there stirring until it starts to boil and then you stop stirring it till all the sugar dissolves in Sirte candy thermometer in [Music] and the instructions say don't stir after your magic potion concoction I do potion so I couldn't say it yeah that see the other one I had to stir until it reached 300 and then put the stuff in well THC starts being killed at about 300 so I always wondered why are you putting it in yeah this is much [Music] we've reached boiling yep we've reached boiling now it's time to insert a candy thermometer there I go I'll put it over by the handle maybe it'll stay a little better I like to do not stir while it's being communal diselle you can see their temperature turn that to bake your phone at the same time it's got quite a ways to go wow that's a long time yeah I think we're gonna pause this of her well", "D--AfKOBJB0": "[Music] what up y'all that [ __ ] came to me how y'all feeling today man [ __ ] today we gonna do a little review about these Smokies so I got a little edibles something for you but before we get into that [ __ ] of course you know I gotta ask you [ __ ] the [ __ ] please subscribe to my [ __ ] man I appreciate everybody that's here and always say cuz always [ __ ] mean it and make sure you hit that thing so you can get a notification anytime I post some [ __ ] if you dig in the turfy shirt go over to counter me calm yourselves terpene shirts can survive 10 11 12 13 14 maybe it's a minim [ __ ] man I got some new designs actually that I'm working on so it's gonna be some new [ __ ] coming in I'd say probably Annabelle maybe give it two weeks three max but I got some new designs on [ __ ] with so I'm gonna get that [ __ ] done so uh anyway man Smokey's I it's a pretty good edible from what I've heard I don't think I've ever had these and if I did I might have had a sample but I don't think I've had any of these to be honest with you man but people come in I got this one cat he'll come in and he'll get no joke like 20 of them were some [ __ ] he gets like a [ __ ] ton of them and a lot of like older people like them a lot of ladies like them but also here a lot of dudes like man um motherfuckas tastes good you [ __ ] around and eat all of them so I think that's a pretty cool thing the flavor I have right here is the blue raspberry so it's more of a fruit chew versus gummies and the reason this is a fruit chew I think it's because it's vegan so it's kind of hard to get like vegan things to be like gummies so usually they'll use like a agar powder or something like that I'm not sure what this one used sugar and corn syrup though they use pectin okay yeah so it but it's hard to get it to be like more gummy so it's more so of a chewy type thing so still good though you know and they also use a distillate in it for their infusion this one is actually I think there's a slough pack if I'm mountains yep Wow pack this one is a lau pack so they get their flower for the distillate from from lau pack Smokies has like different I guess they're sponsored by different peanut sponsor but they're flour is produced by different companies depending located so they have California they have Oregon I think Washington and I think Oklahoma working yeah so I think it's like Oregon Oklahoma Washington and Cali I have a Sam in Cali so I got the Lao backward it's only 20 milligrams I'm 20 milligrams the 20 calories per [ __ ] gummy ten milligrams per gummy 100 milligrams and the whole goddamn package so I guess that's pretty much it man I mean that's the most we could say I heard that they use real fruit with it it says natural and artificial flavoring so you know not sure what all that means like I say they're gluten I mean they're vegan and they're gluten-free and I believe that's it let's open it up hopefully if he's ain't all melted to get okay man oh that is been in my closet so hoping these [ __ ] like me just one big mesh or mesh ball all right so circular about the size of a quarter roughly so [ __ ] man they also be having like sour flavors and stuff like that but this is just a normal Flav so let's make this [ __ ] happen dude it's to ten milligrams of THC and two milligrams of CBD per serving we got to talk about the CVD so anyway man that's it bottoms up [ __ ] and [ __ ] gets [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] yeah I can see why comes our bomb honestly these are probably the best companies I've had that are infused I doesn't think these AVX gummies that I had before was probably the best or now the Kaunas is pretty good with these [ __ ] right here hang on front these guys are vomits [ __ ] dude yeah these it is it they get these right to it don't you just disintegrating you know in your mouth yes it is like it's digging it is chili he did they think these things are bomb Victor's life is normal but again you need the plug around to eat the whole bag of these [ __ ] yeah man so mm-hmm this isn't good now someone asked me how come I don't do like how I feel on them and how effective they are and things of that sort there's a few reasons why I do that and I think I've explained it on a video but I'll explain it on this one too the reason I don't do that is because eight how high I get has zero to [ __ ] do with you hi our tolerance is different so I could say oh I took 30 milligrams and I didn't feel anything you could take 30 milligrams and be on the [ __ ] moon right I could [ __ ] around and take 40 milligrams be like man I'm high as [ __ ] you can take 40 milligrams and that fella goddamn thing everybody's tolerance is different so it's to me it's a waste of time to sit here and come back two hours later and be set my camera back up boy okay that's how I feel because everybody's high is gonna be different I just think that's like a big [ __ ] waste of time as far as I'm concerned and then also I don't think it's fair to the company like let's say I hit I eat something and I'm like I didn't really feel anything from it but yet I've been smoking weed all day or something like that and then I said I didn't feel nothing I mean you [ __ ] don't go [ __ ] with them all over I just had too much weed that day and it didn't affect me so I don't like [ __ ] what other people's companies and taking money out they Pike it over [ __ ] like that so that's why I don't do that if it was a shitty tasting gummy I just wouldn't do the review like I wouldn't release it like that was my first time eating that [ __ ] is good but if it tasted like dog [ __ ] and feet I just wouldn't [ __ ] release the video but honestly that should have actually really really bombed so I definitely say if you can find some Smokies go look for that [ __ ] of your own one of those four states I mentioned Cali Oklahoma Washington and Oregon definitely go get them shits them shits a really really dope you can check them out on a website and share the things just Smokies calm and the Smokies would Izzie so it's not a half Smokies so I'd definitely go check them shits out man but I got to give it to him the [ __ ] badass so uh this weekend I'm gonna pop like four or five it [ __ ] and see how they do but I yeah man [ __ ] I got a lot of cool [ __ ] coming I got a gravity bar i'ma show you [ __ ] a [ __ ] so I'm just getting some [ __ ] together with that but I got some cool [ __ ] I got some hash then I picked up man I got a lot of different [ __ ] that I got now I got iced up with all kind of different things so of course I'm gonna show you share that with y'all so anyway man that's the end of this video y'all make sure that y'all love each other keep the love going be peaceful to each other keep the peace go on go over to Canada mink on get yourself some terpenes shirts that i'ma holla let you [ __ ] a [ __ ] ass later I'm out this [ __ ] peace [Music] we in a jungle smoking legal", "89BV6rVYOBI": "and what's gonna be J it was good

patients experience persistent pain and breakthrough pain and why it takes two different types of medication to manage them if you have pain that lasts all day we call that persistent pain your doctor has prescribed a long-acting or around-the-clock medication to treat this type of pain and he or she has probably already adjusted your dose to reduce side effects such as sleepiness or confusion however no matter how effective your around-the-clock medication is you can still experience sudden severe pain flare-ups pain that breaks through the around-the-clock medication this is called breakthrough cancer pain and traditional medications for persistent pain are not designed to treat these sudden flare ups if breakthrough cancer pain is treated by increasing your daily dose of around-the-clock medication you may suffer the typical side effects of traditional medications called opioids constipation sleepiness and confusion the goal and managing breakthrough cancer pain is to give just enough medication to manage the pain as soon as possible while minimizing troublesome side effects when your prescribed medication for breakthrough cancer pain remember that it is important to continue taking your around-the-clock pain medication every day for your persistent pain acting is a very specialized medication it is to be used only by patients with malignancies who have breakthrough cancer pain and who are already taking on around-the-clock opioid medication such as Sturridge eASIC dilaudid methadone morphine MS Contin or oxycontin every day for the persistent pain if you are already taking an opioid medication such as one of these for your persistent cancer pain and your doctor says that you are opioid tolerant then acting may be right for your breakthrough or pain it has been available for years now and is being used by thousands of patients like yourself today when you take your active prescription to the pharmacist you will receive one or more of these

absorbed as soon as the drug enters the bloodstream it is carried throughout your body including your central nervous system the brain and spinal cord where it works to relieve your pain plan to finish the Attic unit completely in 15 minutes if you finish acting too quickly you will swallow more of the medicine and get less relief many patients use a clock to time themselves so they can finish within the recommended 15 minute dozing period when you use active pain relief may begin in 15 minutes it may even begin while you are taking active but you may not experience full relief for up to 45 minutes after finishing the Attic unit if for any reason you cannot finish an entire act akyuu 'not in the recommended 15 minute dozing period you should put the unfinished unit in this

molten hot sugar lollipop sticks also tempered candy molds for the diamond door Jolly Rancher shaped candies you'll also need sweet bags to put through their beautiful lollipops and once you are completed you also need flavoring each bottle is one dram you'll want to use one to two jams of flavoring for the recipes that I am using food coloring and some high-grade eh-oh to make it real tasty you will be putting all that into the pot you need a candy thermometer it goes up to 350 degrees for hard crack stage in the pot you'll want to put two cups of sugar one cup of corn syrup and one cup of water slowly bring it to a boil and then let it cook until it reaches the 350 degree hard crack stage then you will have to instantly pour in your cherry flavoring your food coloring and your pho and you will have about one minute to pour your candy into all these molds before it hardens so you will need to be quick and probably need help as the popsicle lollipop stitch will move around a little bit I'll update this next video after the candy is made", "gzRQsDEe6mk": "don't bring anyone love into this I got megadose this weekend what yep [ __ ] Diaz I'm such an idiot I am such for

the way when I talk to him he's like oh I got these little he says it in like a week earlier he's like I got these 10 milligram like little cookies I go oh great oh that's my favorite just so you know everybody has different tolerance for smoking for edibles everybody knows or if you don't know Joey has an inhumane tolerance for both yeah I've always been a lightweight with edibles I'm happy with it though because for me a 10 milligram cookie is like having a glass of wine or something like I have like a mild buzz yeah it's nice yeah that's how I like to roll and there's no calories that's the best part I just I have exactly and I have it and I can I can watch TV I can be social I enjoy it I enjoy that dosage he tells me this is what he's got whatever so we do my show in Miami at the Olympia which by the way beautiful plays thank you everybody that came I had a beautiful time there as well as in Melbourne at the King Center with mike cronin swede great shows wanna go let's go see Joey I'm sitting here like he's so much fun he always makes Bella tell everybody stories about Joey we get there and I get to his show his Late Show is about to start and I'm like hey man you know

like the wording on it is confusing on the on the bottle I'm like what is this he's like the 10th and I go really he's like yes and I keep looking I goes it's 10 okay I showing it I'm like confused but I'm also asking him I'm like is this at the cloud I want some wild ride he's like it's Ted Jesus Christ he opens it pours four into his hangouts well I go oh okay like this can't be like a megadose right so then I give one to Mike I take one put it back and I go cool I'm gonna go watch your show now like I met Joey's show it's gonna be so fun I go out there my sisters at the show my older sister we're watching the show and like you know I'm enjoying it he's [ __ ] just annihilating and crowds going crazy it's fun it's a fun environment but like 30 minutes in I start to feel here's the thing if some if you take a light doses like I do sometimes those really mild doses will affect you a little differently like sometimes you barely feel it sometimes it feels like it normally does and sometimes it feels a little stronger you know I mean yeah and it's the same dosage so I was like I'm feeling it very mildly and I'm like you know what I'm gonna do for the last 10 minutes or so of his set I'm gonna go back to the green room because in that way it won't be all chaotic when everybody stands up so I go back to the green room I'm starting I feel it I'm like oh okay and then like a few minutes later I feel like it's a little bit a little bit stronger I'm like huh this is I'm I'm just feeling and you know I haven't I haven't eaten one in a while and then the show wraps up I still feel like just kind of hi and then he comes back and we're talking I still don't know anything yet and then I text my sister I might come back to the to the green room she comes back I start talking to her and then I'm like [ __ ] like I'm [ __ ] I could feel it like my I could feel it like and I could also feel that like the the task the burden of talking to someone feels heavier yeah I mean like I'm talking I'm like yeah I can you wrap it up like and shy could she's like she's saying things to me and I can tell she's looking at but she doesn't know what's going on yeah she's like you seem tired I'm like I am tired and then I go I got to sit down so I sit down and like you start to feel it more yeah thank God I got Shawn with me he's been shooting like a lot of those behind the scenes things in the videos and he's like you want to get out of the green room I was like yeah yeah I walk outside and then I'm just talking to people and I can feel it and I go I go we got to get out of here man we gotta get out of here we get out of there Joey comes with we're [ __ ] I'm just out of my mind we get on a flight on the flight I [ __ ] wake Shawn up because I had passed out iPad thank god that's what I mean I could feel my eyes pulsating oh my body vibrating I wake up Shawn and he's like what's up I go how come like how come we don't why don't our existence exists wide like what is the point of our existence and if we're not examining that question then why aren't we examining that question and then I go like what are words words just come out he was being like I got to tell you I was okay I was high I was that high like freaking out I for like six eight hours I was high for another twenty six thirty hours mmm like the entire next day going to bed I went to bed then following night hi and then I'm call him I'm like the [ __ ] did you give me he's like he's dead I go no it's not he's like yeah it's 10:00 and I go the [ __ ] is wrong with you he's like are you home I go yeah he's are you with your family I go yeah he goes what's the problem like what kind of [ __ ] criminal logic is that you know that's like the guy who you go who's like can you come pick me up and then you pick him up and he pulls a gun on someone and like robs them and you look the [ __ ] was that he's like did you get robbed yeah everything's fine look what why did you bring me on this [ __ ] trip man like he just here's what's crazy on top of him definitely [ __ ] misleading me and I fell for it I don't understand what goes on in his brain where he can pop four of those right I go how are you [ __ ] functioning he's like oh I started to have panic attacks on stage before he went on stage oh my star to panic and I go is that fun he's like yeah you know you know you're alive you've been hanging out with too many more loops that were on the same God what that would devastate me I be so messed up I haven't been too high in a long time but nothing is worse than being too high I called my sister that I had to tell her because she didn't know I was like hey I didn't get to tell you because I was so paranoid yeah like what's happening I got so paranoid and she was like oh she goes yeah I cook like when you're when you're sober somebody goes like hey why don't you say something you're like alright right you know I'm sorry I'm just like but when you're high like really high she's like why aren't you talking to us I was like ah yeah can't even you know you feel like people can like see you or something you know what's so funny is that cuz you came home super late that night and I was asleep and I swear to God I was like he's high cuz the way you came in and you didn't say yeah I mean it was super late yeah but I was like hey babe wasn't you know like I was awake and you're like mm-hm like you just were totally shut down and you just went to bed I'm like oh he's I you know well I know you're with Joey too something he's [ __ ] up right now that's uh there's nothing worse than being too high you know what helps me though when I'm too high is eating yeah I'm pot like when I'm high too high on pot yeah if I eat it'll take it down this was a pretty sight you're [ __ ] yeah I mean he still has not come as to what I took he told me it was hash oil with pure THC and he's like I'll get you that's what it gets you I'm like okay like I know it was it was just like a 100 milligram dose which by the way he took me 400 before his show then I would kill me if I told me that earlier that day I mean I don't know I don't know by the way how he's not like a paranoid schizophrenic though like wouldn't that add a certain number of doses just re havoc on your brain yeah wouldn't you just be like oh like break I thought I was gonna see her at one point I could feel like my eyes were don't don't and I could just you know my thoughts were going I was like I'm gonna have a seizure right now oh and I'm to think that he's like quadruple dosing that well he also weighs a lot more or doesn't he is the outweigh you bet a little bigger meaning her body can probably know but he's got a higher tolerance he's got a high tolerance ya know people would commit themselves if they took what it took I don't like the panic of being to hire drunk that's only does that all the time yeah I don't like the panic he says you got to counterbalance it with what xanax why y'all freaked out like okay Oh sounds horrible nobody knows not what I'm a doctor I'm like okay yeah I had oh you know an intrusive thought I had last week's sure I forgot when we were listing intrusive thoughts yeah every time I ride in nuber and if I'm in the backseat I have the thought of like throw yourself out of the car yeah and I go like no you don't want to do that by the way yeah he also I'm his ID no Joey he let mike cronin a guy he just met take that 100 milligram oh who was who thought he was taking it then was like oh yeah there should be a nice night so I I call him the net I'm like how you doing he's like I slept on the bathroom floor hotel I just had horrible night just freaking out he said he started to have intrusive thoughts of like don't jump don't jump off the balcony oh my god that's like what they would tell you and the DARE program when kids take LSD they jump off of buildings and [ __ ] let's see if we can get Mike on because I want him to relay to you what this felt like no this is never take drugs with Joey Diaz no this is the point of story never eat bread that's laying around near Joey don't eat candy and also when we tells you it's mild it's not right forget that don't take anything around Joey ever I remember he wanted me to do his podcast when I was pregnant and I was like no way I'm just gonna get a contact high in that tiny room with you I'm like I can't go do your show he's like what's the problem he goes look I just I reset your batteries and everything straight I'm like this is all crazy talk you realize right like no here's my right I gotta go none of that no hello hey Mike you're I'm recording this call I'm doing the podcast right now I was just recalling the fun fun night we had with Joey so you were given by me I handed you what Joey said was a 10 milligram pill yeah will you tell me like what your night was like just so that the audience knows that it's not just me start to go down you're talking to Maria and I could tell she was just too much for you and and I felt fine I took an uber back to the hotel and was hanging out for a good hour and then it just all hit me at once what if you like it's like the highest you've ever been mixed with a panic attack and just the general feeling that you're gonna die yeah yeah it's not a fun high right it's not a fun high did you really have that thought oh my god that's hilarious today did you you remember you said this because I didn't notice this you said that when you took that pill that Joey stopped talking looked at you and laughed see if I would have caught that right then I would have [ __ ] made myself throw up I would have known what it was I totally missed that this guy I just met I'm gonna ruin this guy's night completely that I just met yeah Jesus Christ man it was do you have did you have fun chill thoughts all night when you were that high dude I you know what made me laugh really hard was you said you you went from Miami you drove to your parents place and you had to have dinner with them and I know how you were feeling because I was still high the next night and then you had dinner and I guess went to your room and your mother texted you [Music] yeah yeah but that's just Joey doing us a cool favor he just he he he told me the next day he goes are you home you with your kids what's the problem like you know like like a known felon logic when they're like we got the money no one got shot what's the problem yeah so all right well I'm glad you're okay I'm glad I had somebody to share this absolutely terrifying experience with and yeah Oh can't wait to do it again soon he [ __ ] robbed us of our evening alright man I'll give you a call later buddy all right okay that's set so he wanted to fight vomiting all night yeah he went to fight and also yet don't jump off the balcony thought oh my gosh and then he said that he thought he was gonna die which I definitely thought I was gonna die at parts too but that that he was also thinking that I would get blamed because I was gonna he was gonna die in the in a room that was in my name oh what a nice friend I know he's like charged that's so nice I know Mike's a good guy oh you just watched a highlight from your mom's house and if you want to see more just watch one of these videos or highlights here and definitely subscribe here that way you can be kept abreast of all the brand new yes I said the word time don't judge me with you try it out [Music]", "H6cYs4ZcSv8": "[Music] revue show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and I've got my Nutella here pancakes love Nutella and I love Nutella too so I've got my Nutella so you know what that means it means we are taking a look at another gummy that's right we are breaking the cardinal rule here on weeds don't be a dude don't be a dummy and buy a gummy we are taking a look at a very very popular gummy brand may be the second most popular gummy brand behind cushy punch and that is the gummy brand from Chiba choose themselves Green Hornet I had a lot of people asked me to review the Green Hornet's and we're finally gonna be doing it this is their 100 milligram indica variety love everything on the back it's got all the stuff you want to see the batch number from the lab testing nutrition information all that good stuff ingredients it's all they're so good on them for putting all the information on their Bravo to you Chiba chews now if you've seen my reviews in the past you know my Chiba chews I'm really feeling them to be sending my world on fire I found them to be good but not great more okay however I picked this one up for a very affordable price just 10 bucks for a hundred milligram edible which is a pretty good deal so it's a little bit cheaper than most of the Chiba juice and so I'm I'm more excited about this one and I'm an indica fan so let's uh let's give it a go I do have the uh oh looks like my dogs have come back from a walk welcome dogs welcome dogs low hello hello goodbye dogs farewell dogs sorry about that guys so yes back to the Green Hornet really excited about this one because it was more affordable and I've heard a lot of good things about the Green Hornet's now if you know as you know I'm not a big gummy fan really only flourish and tiki killers the only gummies that I've really really loved and cushy punches I find to be OH a so Green Hornet is fighting an uphill battle there but let's give them the benefit of the doubt open this bad boy up and give it a taste so if you've never tuned in two weeks before the way our reviews work it's very very simple I'm gonna eat this whole thing and then I'm gonna come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I am feeling because that is the most important part of the edible review so uh it tells us to cut the gummy into ten ten milligram servings there's it's little cut guide where of course not gonna be doing that I guess that's how they're gonna get compliant with the new regs whatever so here is the gummy The Green Hornet fruit punch flavored and again I picked this up for only ten bucks at my dispensary which is a very good price for these Green Hornet's so let's let's break off half here and give it a taste I forgot my I brought my Nutella to have some fat whoo wow that is woo that has a heavy heavy heavy cannabis taste but that is encouraging hopefully that means it's going to be as potent as advertised and seeing this lab tested results in the back gives me faith so let's add a little bit of chocolate to it here just to give ourselves the best chance of making sure we can get high mmm that Nutella makes that a lot easier to go down alright guys well that's gonna do it for this first half of this review for the second half and the most important part will it get me high I'll come back to you guys in two hours or for you just a couple of seconds through the magic of editing so I will see you guys in just a bit to let you know peace [Music] help I've been stung by a Green Hornet welcome back to wheat skies it's been two hours since I've had that Green Hornet and it's pretty good it's up there with good gummies like flourish I actually like it better than Sheba chews period I think it got me where I want to be some pink there I'd say I'm at a seven and a half somewhere in there not to put too fine a point on it uh yeah I I like The Green Hornet quite a bit uh the indica variety at least is muy bueno uh muy bueno bueno bueno way down yeah I'm really pleased with it pleasantly surprised I like it better than any of the other cheapo cheese I've tried so far a really a nice little edible nice discreet package it tasted like barf but that's to be expected for something that's so small and so potent so I don't really hold out it against it but it does taste terrible so if you're really sensitive as a taste no this one is this one's got a pretty intense weed flavor but on the whole if you can get it as cheap as I got it because I got it for ten bucks but I sometimes see these go as highs like seventeen or higher maybe I don't know the that's why I don't really screw that she would choose that much is there crazy expensive but if you can find this for around that price it's uh I'd say it's worth it I really had a good time with this one that's the Chiba choose Green Hornet's a fruit punch flavored one hundred milligrams indica give it a shot if you see the dispensary near you and before I go guys I want to share with you a little cherry on top something a little extra something that's not reviewing weed just something I like in my life that I want to share with you guys that isn't necessarily weed related and on this review my little cherry on top is let's give it up for the air pod I hope there's not too much earwax on that because that'd be really embarrassing the air pods they're really good I hope I'm saying that right air pods that's the name of them the names dumb but they're actually really incredible little wireless headphones earphones I had a pair of Plantronics wireless over-the-air ones noise cancelling ones that I had for two years that I adored and have been using the air pods on and off for a while and and really come to appreciate them and they're discreteness in their ease of use and the just pull it out pauses the music all that good stuff really enjoy it if you have an Apple product if you have an Apple phone give the air prodigious shot if you haven't already I know they seem a little expensive but I think they're worth the the the Apple tax in this case so guys that's gonna do it for this cherry on top and that's gonna do it for this review here on wheats that's gonna be a thumbs up for the Green Hornet thank you so much for sticking around at the very end of this review guys and we will catch you on the next one peace", "UfXchhtG5NY": "[Music] hello everyone and welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary we help you decide what products are worth your hard-earned dollars at your dispensary and which ones are utter junk and today we are talking about one of my favorite companies when we haven't had a chance to review a product from in a while because they haven't had anything new coming out but now thanks to the new regulations here in California that make edibles be a hundred milligrams max and ten milligrams per serving Korova one of my all-time favorites has come out with a brand new line here they have the Korova Saturday morning mini cookies ten milligrams per cookie at it for a hundred milligrams total so ten cookies in here at ten milligrams each it's a huge package it's so much bigger than their normal packaging which is crazy its its massive and it was only ten bucks but then again that's a bit that's more expensive than their one hundred and fifty milligrams cookies that they used to have that were just single cookies but it's big packaging because it is holding ten little mini cookies in here I really like the packaging it's very handsome I really quite like it a lot it's got the new props on there keep refrigerated bla bla bla bla bla but shows you know it's compliant with them new regulations and then here on the back it's got it finally has nutrition information corroded before I don't believe actually had nutrition information on their packaging but they do now and it's got like the ingredients and all that fun stuff on there and now they have this child resistant packaging that is very tough to open because I've tried opening one of these before and they're quite difficult to open especially if you've not encountered it before I'm super excited to try these it actually I've been wanting to review them for a while they've taken me some time to find they're not in available and a lot of dispensaries yet which is odd because you know supposedly next month is when these regulations take effect although I believe you have until July to like get rid of your old stock of stuff but yeah I assume you'll start seeing these everywhere soon but I've been wanting to review these for some time because I assume they'll be as ubiquitous as kirova in no time so here's that obnoxious child-resistant packaging you have to place one thumb in the middle of the zipper and place one thumb into the back panel zipper and pull gently apart it's easier said than done you know what I'm just gonna cut into it because I hate it I hate the child-resistant label packaging I'm a child I'm too down for it dumb child here we go here are the mini cookies ooh they're handsome quite like them aesthetically they look a lot like the full-size versions don't have very much of a weeds odor chewy and kind of crunchy but good nice pretty good very little canvas ace if any at all I'd like it just as much maybe even a little bit more than their 150 milligrams Saturday morning cookie it's great it's got the rice krispies in there good cookie good cookie taste it's a little bit chewier and crunch here than I was expecting it to be but it's not bad it's not bad not a bad combination at all i I'm not dreading having to eat nine more of these so guys I'm going to finish the rest of this bag off I've got a lot more to get through and then I will be sure to let you know how I am feeling because that's the most important part of the edible review process I'm probably about two and a half three hours or something on my way to go see a movie and as soon as I get out of there I will let you know how I'm feeling thanks so much for watching wheats guys and I will see you in just a bit peace [Music] alright guys I am back it has been two hours since I had the kirova mini cookies medical cannabis Saturday morning cookies 100 milligrams THC 10 cookies and I am more than pleased to report that kauravas unrivaled potency is in still intact this is a strong hundred milligrams in these 10 cookies here in fact my only complaint about it is and it is a complaint well I guess my two complaints there the packaging sucks I don't like this child restraint and packaging because I'm I'm stupid I'll fully grot to that and you know I'm not I'm an intelligent person but it's annoying it's hard to open even trying to follow the directions it's not like the childproof pill bottles that are very easy to take off that's a minor complaint the big complaint is it's a lot to consume for one person I know these are designed for 10 servings and they really are because it's a lot to consume it's I mean you can see how big this packages and it's packed to the brim with those cookies it's for our calories of cookies which isn't a whole lot but at the same time ten of those little mini cookies it's not a insignificant amount it certainly feels like more than one of the normal size but still I'm gonna recommend it especially for this new wave of products that are coming in that are going to be these ten milligrams servings of ten servings each this is probably going to be really great III heartily recommend it if you cannot find if the any of the other Korova still lying around if your dispensary is only prop to 1/5 compliant grab these you'll be happy you did if not go ahead and stick with the original batch because that's gonna do you better but but these are a fine replacement it's not the end of the world for edibles but you know it's not it's not going to be the same same world we remember anyways guys that's gonna do it for this review here on wheats I appreciate you watching thank you so much and we will check you out on a later review peace that's okay", "JEJb0IvOlc4": "I'm just getting warmed up here no this is an adderall or something that's just like adderall Oh how's it going everybody welcome back to the show called Joey answers your questions the show today we're answering your questions porcupine asks I would like to know porcupine asks I would like to know whether you have have or have had a mentor or role model on your way who influenced you a lot and how role models I would say the obvious answer to that question is my father my mother and my siblings growing up I have a lot of siblings a lot of older siblings that have showed me the ropes and inspired me in one way or another my parents are also extremely smart and deep thinkers and they have definitely taught me pretty much everything I know actually that's that's false not everything I know but they definitely formed how I think about things and they taught me how to think rather than what to think which I am very thankful to have had parents like that I've had a lot of role models growing up some fictional and some non fictional the fictional ones I was really inspired by manly men like James Bond and Indiana Jones just guys who were capable and could get stuff done and didn't back down to anybody they knew what they believed in I don't know if that's true for James Bond but they're just alpha and I was really I was really inspired by that alpha stereotype now obviously it's it's a little extreme and there's a reason why they're fictional but I think seeing strong masculine figures Aragorn from Lord of the Rings growing up that really helped me set the tone for the kind of and I want to be as for non-fictional role models I definitely been inspired a lot by Chris Hadfield's which is a Canadian astronaut he was one of the commanders of the ISS the International Space Station kind of a local hero I read his whole book an astronaut's guide to life on Earth and it's one of my favorite books of all time and it really gives you a glimpse into the life of an astronaut and how much work it takes to become an astronaut and it's really really fascinating stuff and I'd highly recommend it I was also influenced quite a bit by Jordan Peterson as sort of like a modern-day thinker I really like the works of CS Lewis and GK Chesterton and jr. are talking all the Inklings yeah so there's a lot of people who I really respect intellectually and that have inspired me and the way that I think and the way I solve problems and the way I just conceptualized the world so that's an excellent question thank you very much holy I'm just bloated I'm gonna be the burping this whole time and I barely even eaten anything today what's going on I think I pronounced this guy's name Comfort ahi bola last time and he says you just murdered my name Joey it's pronounced aji bola I'm Nigerian I'm so sorry I don't know it's it's a pretty difficult name you almost can't blame me Camilo jos\u00e9 Camille Camille Oh see now I'm like super nervous to pronounce anyone's name Camilo jos\u00e9 says hey Joey I'd like to hear your take on weed slash psychedelics greetings from Colombia also your Spanish accent is on point are you fluent in Spanish dude I'm not fluent in Spanish at all like not even close I took two semesters of Spanish and University and I've dabbled with duolingo so I'm pretty good at pronouncing Spanish words and I know a lot of Spanish words but in terms of piecing those words together yeah the skill is not there at one point I like the bridge of communication was there at the end of my second semester of Spanish I could understand like it finally clicked where people would speak in Spanish and I could understand what they're saying or at least piece together 90% of what they're saying and respond and it was really exciting but I didn't keep up the habit of practicing and that's just a darn shame because it'll take me a lot to get there again now to go it I'm just drawing a blank there's a bright light here there's a microphone here there's a camera there there's a laptop here there's another light here and one behind me and when it's go-time sometimes I have all these exciting things to say and then the camera starts rolling and my mind is just like you think I'd be good at at this point but I'm only human sorry not sorry as for weed and psychedelics I don't personally partake in weed or psychedelics I would say if you are somebody who has not had weed had wheat have smoked weed or taken psychedelics I would say don't you know like if you've come this far and you haven't dabbled with it you probably you don't mean to just don't it's not like drugs aren't a good idea like I drink alcohol with my friends socially so weed it's starting to come to light that it has a similar you can treat it similarly as you can alcohol you can have it in moderation with your friends like Joe Rogan there's like tons of people who smoke weed and are successful but just with any vice or drug or alcohol or anything like that any substance if you're not taking it don't take it like it's it's not going to improve your life I don't I don't buy into the fact that like you're guaranteed to have some sort of spiritual awakening from taking psychedelics because a lot of the time it can just mess you up for the rest of your life you can just like crack and you have crazy depersonalization crazy anxiety because of it it's just not worth it if you've managed to have some sort of enlightenment from taking psychedelics before that's great and maybe you can use that for good but I feel like there are better ways to kind of break the fourth wall and really see the world in a new light mainly by studying the works of different philosophers or existentialists but yeah I feel like we'd just like alcohol is fairly useless it's not going to improve your life at all for most people obviously if you have some sort of medical condition and you're prescribed weed to deal with you know crazy anxiety or you know pain or something like that then that's obviously a different story but I think in the majority of cases it's not going to help you so yeah if you've managed to come this far without taking are doing weed doing weed I'm saying it again I sound like the biggest white guy ever if you've managed to come this far without smoking weed or doing psychedelics I would say just continue to not smoke weed or do psychedelics I have some crazy parental energy going on right now Julia oh man is this a Polish name Julia I'm so sorry how to stay consistent with a goal or project like keeping up a YouTube channel the biggest thing with staying consistent with any goal or project especially a YouTube channel is to not fall prey to perfectionism because perfectionism is what kills my consistency you hear all these youtubers who make great videos people love their stuff and then they kind of disappear for a while it's almost always because they get intimidated by their past work and they don't know how to make a new video that doesn't scare them or they feel it like they need to outdo themselves in the next video and that's just perfectionism what you need to do is realize that when you're putting out great stuff it's because you have a certain amount of talent or skill and that skill or talent isn't just gonna go away in your next project even if you don't give it you know a hundred percent of the effort that you gave the last video it's still gonna have a certain level of quality that people will want to watch you almost just need to trust yourself and just start working and trust that if you've been able to make a hundred videos that were good before the 101 video is gonna be pretty good 100 first video one holy [ __ ] really beatdown that voice inside of you that's the perfectionist and realize that I don't want to sound all Disney but you have it in you to make great things so trust that harsh digital says I struggle a lot with social anxiety currently I'm directing my first feature documentary and I am always doubting myself in the middle of meetings I'm confident in my skills as a filmmaker but I struggle a lot in getting the team to work together interpersonal communications make a fun and relaxed environment at the same time it's funny I sometimes feel like Michael from the office because I want to be friendly but I am also the boss combining that with my social anxiety my mind just goes blank during meetings please help me understand how I can control this by the way love your videos bro and each of your videos constantly exceeded my expectations keep doing what you're doing man thank you very much harsh digital really appreciate that that sounded that that whole eyebrow raise made it look like I was insincere about that but I'm not thank you sometimes my face just acts against my own will I totally get where you're coming from sometimes conceptually you can understand the game plan and you can trust in your abilities to get something done but in a group environment it's really hard to remember that there's so many different voices going on so many different opinions and you kind of lose your mental clarity or your ability to communicate what you had previously inside your head when you were all alone one thing that's really helped me deal with social anxiety in general is to find different tactics to enter my body like out of my mind and into my body you know that's what mindfulness is all about so you're supposed to like sit there feel your breath come in and out and you're supposed to focus on your breath and the reason why you do that it's not just some sort of like pseudo scientific breathing exercise or something like that the whole point of that is so that you can redirect everything that's going on in your mind all this crazy noise and all these random thoughts bouncing around your social anxieties etc and redirect it to something very simple and very real because in a way what's happening to your body is a lot more real and substantial than that crazy [ __ ] that's going on inside your head it kind of calms the noise of your entire existence I don't want to sound super deep I don't want to sound like I'm trying to be super deep or anything but if you have meditated successfully or practiced mindfulness successfully then you know exactly what I'm talking about and that calmness can invite mental clarity it can invite confidence it can invite just being yourself you know rather than being the anxiety so I'd highly recommend trying to find ways I mean you can't just sit there and meditate and close your eyes when everyone's in a meeting and you know start breathing people be like you okay bro oh everybody's on the floor you can do things like focus for a couple of seconds on you know your fingers moving and like the fact that there's when you sit down on a cushion or on a chair there's pressure on your butt you can feel the pressure and the in the way it feels for your feet to be on the ground and really just observe this kind of sensation and redirect all your focus to your feet and scan upwards in your body feel the pressure of your butt on the cushion below you and you can do this kind of thing when you're in a meeting and it takes a couple of seconds you know maybe even thirty seconds when somebody's on a long boring monologue that you don't care about this I know activity can really help you just gain mental clarity and get out of your head and into your body and then you can just be instinctive with what you say you can just say what you mean you can be yourself and it really helps so I don't know if this will solve all your problems but there's one little tip that has really helped me deal with social anxiety in group situations Gabriel Kovack Kovach says what aspect of life at large smoothes your gears and I've never heard of this phrase in my entire life but I'm in the last video I think I said that the word know what am I saying in the last video I said something like what the hell did I say work hard play hard I hate that one sorry not sorry oh yeah sorry not sorry and work hard play hard those phrases grind my gears so I think you're referencing that like what if that grinds your gears what smoothes my gears so if that's what you're asking there are some things in life that really smooth my gears so on of course I need a burp again that's a sick burp [Music] it's not covin one thing that definitely smooths my gears if you will is playing hockey specifically playing in this little three-on-three hockey league that I have with a bunch of older guys and it's just shinny it's just dropping hockey it's really casual but being on the ice is almost a form of meditation for me you know just kind of letting loose trying to dangle score goals be a good teammate in an environment where I'm not really super competitive or anything I just love the game of hockey and it really clears my mind and smooth my gears Eli Schweitzer says what's your love language also hello from your own is it the Bliss also hello from your hometown hey UI how's it going somebody below says are you his brother hey it's me your brother yeah Eli's my brother what's my love language physical touch and words of affirmation those are my two big ones gift giving it's alright I can do without it what are some other ones quality time it's alright it's fine but physical touch and words of affirmation that's my happy place that might already why would you ask me that why it wasn't okay Edison you out of zan says my question is drumroll how did you meet Matt dia Vela and thomas frank i met thomas frank by asking what question on Twitter I think I sent him a DM wondering something I can't exactly remember what it was but I was a pretty small channel then and he was really well-established but he took the time out of his day to respond to me in detail and my mind was kind of blown I'm like holy smokes what a nice guy and then after that you know is sort of back and forth on Twitter over the you know next couple of months and then as format D Avella thomas frank started a slack channel with a bunch of guys a bunch of youtubers and then Matt and I like we had watched each other stuff but we had never officially talked or anything but through that slack channel yeah we were able to just like catch up and you know we've played call of duty together and stuff and it's great Thomas Frank being a beauty is the reason why I met him and Matt Diavel Oh words of affirmation but I heal at three I'm not laughing your name I'm laughing at my inevitable mispronunciation of your name hey Joey Thank You Man for making the subreddit I honestly think it's gonna be a great way to connect with one another in the community and love seeing these AMA style videos what is some advice you would give to people who want to get better at filmmaking now this is a question I love to answer but first the burp what am i eating that's making me burp so much it's all the protein probably first of all if you if if you're watching this video and you haven't joined the subreddit yet it's looking pretty dead someone post a meme in there something I know my brother has a bunch of better ideas memes he's just hoarding away waiting to release into the world there is one posted on the Facebook page that was absolutely hilarious which was the chef's hat one where I'm going like this in the rut video it was great made my day so yeah hop on the subreddit the link will be in the description and start contributing stuff because I once there's enough posts on there I'm not gonna really look at them until I do a video like this and I want to react to a bunch of stuff on the subreddit so there is a golden chance that you're going to be on the next video or the subreddit video if you post the subreddit now because there's like no content there so the chances are pretty high as for how Raheel can get better at filmmaking the number one I mean you probably heard this a billion times but you just have to start making stuff and making weird stuff and making stuff that's outside of your comfort zone so Hank green is part of the vlogbrothers famous youtuber he put out a video about his work ethic and like how he puts out so much content and his philosophy really changed the way I viewed putting out content so he talks about this idea that when he makes a project and he wants to make it a hundred percent perfect it's like the first 80% blows by really quickly you can get to 80% perfect really really quickly but it's trying to get that last 20% perfect that takes the most amount of time exponentially longer than that first hundred percent or first 80% so what he started doing is just put out videos at 80% because at 80% they were already pretty good and you know people like his videos at 80% so that the next time he makes a video he makes it at 80% effort and he keeps on putting videos like making crazy amounts of videos after video month after month year after a year at 80% but what happens is you get really really good at making videos the more videos that you make and that 80% effort three years down the road is far better than the a hundred percent effort that you tried to get three years ago that makes sense I'm explaining this really confusingly but basically with volume you get better quick I don't know if I explained that like an absolute whack job but basically make as much videos as possible make as many videos as possible don't care if they're perfect just keep on making it make something move on make something move on yeah don't let perfectionism stunt you Johnny guy says if you had the chance to portray a character in The Lord of the Rings trilogy reboot which character would it be by the way this question is all the way from Fiji moolah Jonny guy that's the weirdest question anyone's ever asked me but I love it who would I be like alas we some Daktari says do you see yourself making videos in general when you get older it's just weird to think that youtubers are gonna be 50 years old at some point and it's interesting to see what would change how would you picture that I'm probably not gonna be making videos when I'm 50 I feel like YouTube I'm really enjoying it so far it's really meaningful for me right now and I got really really lucky with my channel I'm going to try to use it as a launchpad for projects that I'm really really passionate about I know that I really want to get into long-form documentaries on certain topics maybe some of those documentaries I can even post in on the better ideas channel I really want to get into feature films I really wanted to do some meaningful projects and hopefully my youtube success can help me you know launch that career as well and maybe if it's like the perfect storm I can take you guys along with me on that journey but I feel like being just a youtuber especially if you're just a self-improvement youtuber it's almost hard to take yourself seriously or for anyone else to take you seriously because if you're not doing anything else with your life then how can you instruct people to live successfully all you do is YouTube right that's how I feel sometimes I'm trying to keep busy with other projects being as artistic as possible at least putting in a great deal of effort into my main channel videos and seeing where that effort takes me maybe I can move on to more meaningful and artistic projects maybe I can educate myself more because life exists outside of YouTube and if I can succeed at life outside of YouTube then maybe I can be qualified to instruct people on YouTube but if I'm just doing YouTube it's like it's almost paradoxical I'm abandoning life itself to make advice about life and that's just stupid yes touch must beget says I seem to lose my motivation for working out way too easily I used to hit the gym 5 to 6 times a week for two years that I stopped due to work and since then it's on and off I just spit now it's on and off it's an on and off relationship there's the burp again do you have any tips so I can get back at it strong love your videos by the way well thank you yes touch my spaghett I would say get past the two week mark seems simple I mean make an effort to go let's say five days a week I wouldn't say go three days a week because I find that if you only go three days a week the amount of off time that you have makes you lazy again so try to put in a five-day week of going to the gym and get a habit tracker app make sure that you click off or like check off the habit after going to the gym you don't even have to have a good workout just go but I find that it actually helps you to try to have a good workout because then you can feel good about yourself and if you do that for two weeks in a row I find at least for me that is the threshold in which I start to become a gym rat again if I can go five days in a week two weeks in a row then all of a sudden I start to notice that my muscles are feeling more firm again I feel more energy again and I really want to make it that third week and it really helps propel me so I would say rather than try to just be consistent at the gym forever and ever and ever just try to be consistent in the gym for two weeks five days a week two weeks in a row and get the habit tracker check off the habit and you'd be surprised how setting the bar not criminally low but fairly low like that really helps just project you into the future and you might become a gym rat again it means setting small reasonable goals for yourself one day at a time one tiny step at a time baby steps but I'm kind of struggling with the same thing to be honest like I ever since the quarantine ever since the quarantine I've been not as stoked about going to the gym as I was before the quarantine my brain had this association of just loving being at the gym but since I hadn't gone to the gym for what four months because of quarantine I forgot that feeling so I'm trying to also develop that positive association with going to the gym again and I'm getting there but yeah it is tough so just stick with it and you and I are in this together so let's do it oh sweet our e-news says I have a question what is your most fabulous memory of all time it's a very simple memory I remember I was in grade 11 and I rented a campsite at a place called haywire Bay with my friends and it was the first time I'd ever rented a campsite by myself it was a taste of Independence it was a hot summer there's a hot summer weekend and I just remember that was like one of the first times I felt like a man rather than a boy you know I was there with my friends I booked the campsite myself I invited them over we had a good time and the single moment that felt so nice to me was I was on the beach with my friend Joseph and it's a nice sandy beach hot summer and I remember just laying in the sand and I felt complete and it's like a hard it's a weird thing to describe but I remember just lying there in the sand and not wanting or needing anything else I just felt really at peace and it's funny like looking back on that it's a good reminder that sometimes the best things in life aren't you for Accor crazily stimulating or super exciting sometimes it is just forgetting your worries or your anxieties and just soaking in the peace of the waves hitting the shore or something yeah I was just totally calm and that's one of my best memories of all time Eli again says who's your favorite white sir and Sarah says obviously me my favorite Schweitzer is me thanks so much for watching catching the next one this will be a hit up the subreddit this is gonna be a fun little series that I am looking forward to doing more of because I have fun doing these I can just kind of kick back and relax and answer some of these questions so if you want to be answered in the next one just comment below and I will answer them and the next one what more is there to say see you later", "ie_dbbtQls8": "thank you for choosing ABC 15 at 6:00 I'm Steve Irvine and I'm Kim Tobin in for semi Hockridge tonight where did it come from it is the question goodyear police are asking tonight just over 24 hours since five students got sick from candy that may have contained marijuana while the police focus on that parents are asking how do you talk to your kids about this right ABC 15s Mike Pelton live in Encino schools in Goodyear and Mike how are we supposed to teach our kids what is safe when it actually looks just like candy yeah and even today goodyear police tell me it appears the candy involved in all of this was a gummy covered with sugar so today we talked with a local dispensary about how to tell the difference between edible marijuana and real candy headaches were the symptom marijuana candy possibly the cause so say good year police looking into where a student got it on Tuesday before giving it to four others a typical like Apple ring you know you name it it has all different types of forms we talked to Anthony Harrington the CEO with all greens dispensary which is not connected to the incident in Goodyear and even though it comes in a form of a candy it needs to be treated like medicine so it's on the patient to put it in a safe place based in Sun City Anthony says there's a big appetite for candy infused with THC the types of patients that we're seeing that are buying maybe a little more elderly or those who are just who can't smoke maybe it's too harsh for them when they're smoking according to state law when dealing with medical marijuana products need to come with a label and warning keep out of reach of children it appears some manufacturers put it in different places this one it's on the back on another a warning comes right up top you can see the clear a distinction of the medical marijuana plant Anthony tells me these bags of candy should never end up in the hands of kids to parents he says find a case and lock it up it's medicine you would not keep aspirin now you would not keep ibuprofen out if you have underage children who may who may who see it and may take it as candy you know it's the same type of thing now that dispensary holds weekly educational classes meanwhile back here in goodyear police they are still working to determine how and where the student got the candy we're live in Goodyear tonight Mike Pelton ABC 15 Arizona developing tonight the investigate", "gjxxUI-BCTg": "[Music] let's

we're going to review a product that i need a little bit of help making sense of myself so that's why we're going to review it we're going to be taking a look at the thc vitamin shot that is what this product is called from tonic tonic they have the tropical citrus cannabis infused thc vitamin shot they come in a variety of flavors they are a hundred milligrams of thc in this a tiny little vial of liquid there you can see it kind of at the bottom uh it is not a whole lot of liquid at all one fluid ounce uh 25 calories in total uh so not a lot a hundred milligrams in this whole thing in the whole ounce only 24 only a hundred excuse me in the one fluid ounce 100 milligrams to sort of tincture strength uh they do suggest uh shaking it strongly i'm not a hundred percent sure what to expect here i don't know what a thc vitamin shot is it doesn't really shape say much about the vitamins that it has it does have an ingredients list but uh those ingredients not that i need to show you don't contain a lot of things that i would call vitamins maybe more chemicals but who knows um and uh it doesn't really have it has the uh qr code for lab testing results but does not actually contain them on the packaging themselves uh which i thought they had to i guess not um this is a very very affordable edible uh 12 bucks in total from a dispensary in long beach so on the very lowest end for a full strength hundred milligram edible this is um it's conflicting they say that this is both one serving and also like they have to by law 10 individual servings at 10 milligrams each but everything else sort of suggests that this is a single serving vitamin shot that doesn't let you know what vitamins are in it tropical citrus flavored shake well here is our twin twelve dollar tonic tropic tropical citrus vitamin shot let's make sense of that dispensary together today as we find out exactly what we've got here so it does not require refrigeration beforehand if you don't drink it although they suggest that you do uh it does suggest that you requires refrigeration not suggest shaking well one more time just in case let's open it up give it a smell it doesn't have really much of an odor at all it was surprising it was both expecting to smell a lot of citrus and a lot of weed and mostly a lot of nothing uh it is a glass bottle uh nice packaging not a lot to it i kind of uh like the sort of spartan nature of it not incredibly wasteful well uh let's give it a go um i will try to do about half of it i guess to start i will do the whole thing for the review however let's try this top tonic tropical citrus the yuck ooh oh that's disgusting i know we're near half oh boy oh you can barely tell oh wow that is truly truly truly disgusting i was not expecting it to be that bad it burns um has an intense intense weedy taste i mean it it tastes a lot like uh some like a weed tincture really um but instead of some kind of oil it's some other kind of i don't know uh vaguely s syrupy sweet liquid it's disgusting uh that is way worse than i was hoping for uh all right well i will try to do uh another one of those let's get that down oh crap oh well uh oh that is just beyond belief revolting thankfully uh it's done there's like just a teeny tiny tiny tiny tiny bit left maybe less than five percent i'm just gonna leave that i may come back to it at some point i've taken enough punishment for now and enough to know whether or not [ __ ] wow that is so incredibly way way worse than i was expecting yuck and it's still there just like coated my tongue well it's not about how it tastes it's about how it makes you feel that's an old wheat slogan we pulled that one out um oh and i hope it's going to make me feel pretty good because it tastes really bad but for that guys it's going to take a while to let in or kick in so like all our wheat's reviews i will be back here in two hours to let you guys know if this tonic citrus tropical citrus is worth the uh oh whoops my bad is worth the uh pain uh it's just already scrambled the vein disgusting anyways uh until we see you then stay high stay healthy see you soon bye [Music] welcome back to wheats guys it has been two hours since i choked down our tonic tropical citrus thc vitamin shot here uh and this is an unexpected little bit of a treat i am substantially higher than i originally thought i might be then again for that taste because let me reiterate it really was as gross as i made it out to be that taste stuck around for a while it's gross it really is but it's not a lot to have to get down it's only one fluid ounce uh and then it provides for a pretty uh nice high i am again higher than i originally uh expected to be which is always uh fun and only 25 calories it's not a whole lot of um sugar and all that junk to go in your body uh or hopefully not at least uh but the high that comes out of it pretty strong this is not a bad product from tonic uh substantially substantially improved over initially initial impressions uh and again only 12 bucks with the like bottom price point for those 100 milligram full strength edibles um yeah i'm gonna give this one a thumbs up on unexpected surprise uh really really really happy to have uh to give this one a review so uh anytime we get something that we really like that like that especially if it's a little bit of a surprise we like to do a little cherry on top a little something extra a little something you can enjoy with or without weed um you know just a little something uh that isn't weed related just to help you uh you know give you something extra to enjoy during your week so this time i want to give you a suggestion for a surprise for me uh and that's a twofer that was hey if you've got an apple product anytime in the past year if you've purchased anything new apple i think iphone ipad max well you have apple tv apparently um you've got a whole year of it just with purchasing an apple product um i uh bought an ipad not too long ago had that apple tv subscription i have the actual apple tv tv too uh and just happened to get it right when the uh documentary boys state was coming out uh which i then promptly watched after seeing all the reviews it's a documentary about a uh once a year texas high school political cluster [ __ ] free-for-all uh thing in austin the capital of texas where like 2000 something like that boys go and do politics uh for a week it's a one of those documentaries that you're like how the hell did uh they get access to do this how the hell did people give them permission uh it's great and then uh apple tv plus you may even have it you don't even know it might be a surprise just like this tonic that's gone on long enough uh happy to have reviewed it again now i'm just repeating myself it usually happens when i'm high which again should be an endorsement tonic i'm sorry i i shat talk you i mean you did you do taste bad let me reiterate you really do taste bad but you're pretty good so with that guys that's going to do it for this review here on wheats i appreciate you watching here to the very end that's going to do for the cherry on top as well until we see

(laughing) - Cool. - I'm generally very angry, and filled with hate. And, I also like to get wavy, and weed makes me paranoid. So hopefully this will be a good remedy for all of those things. (laughs) - I was picturing like a Monopoly piece size. - The thimble, yeah! - Yeah like the thimble. - These are like, I don't know, the size of like, a large thumb, like the tip of a large thumb. - I really thought of CBD gummies as something that rich people who love Goop and The Wing are into, however, it comes in this sort of fancy cigar box, which makes me think that they're french. (chill beat) - It's like slime, kind of. (techno beat) - You get that sort of undertaste of weed, like when you eat a regular edible marijuana. - It's more flavorful than my antidepressant. - Okay - Which I don't chew. (all laughing) - I feel pretty much the same as I did before eating the gummy, but I also just ate a lot grits and pork, I think, so I feel a little tired from that. - I feel like my normal self. My normal self I think is like, everything is fine because it has to be. - I also can't tell if it's like, oh am I just feeling the effects of something, and feel more relaxed and having a good time, or like, maybe I'm just having a good time being around all of you. - [In Unison] Aww, yeah. - But it could just be like the gummy I ate, yeah. - Oh, interesting. Cool. - I kind of felt a little light outside the studio, I had a bagel before this, so, the results might be skewed, I don't know. My results might be different, 'cuz I didn't eat it on an empty stomach. I wonder if that's better or worse? - I think that this is gonna be a video that's partially about Jezebel understanding how we react to food, because I think that some of it coincided with the lunch that we just ate. - On a daily basis, I usually feel very anxious. Constant anxiety every second of the day. I'm not feeling anything right now. - I do feel something that sounds like descriptions of people, almost when you're like, coming up or something. Almost like something's mounting, just like, very subtly or something, there's like a slight tingliness in my feet. - Sometimes with edibles, I can't really tell if I'm high, either, but then some of them I feel it like, 10 minutes after, and I can like really tell. This is more like, I can't really tell. - It's subtle. I mean I feel like, slightly different maybe, but I can't tell if that's just because I want this thing to work. - It doesn't compare to most of the other drugs that I've done, in any way shape or form. However I would actually, like, I do feel very relaxed, and I would say that it is akin to my SSRI. I did feel like actually pretty tightly wound, and quite angry, I do not feel that way anymore. So maybe it is working. My arms feel slightly weird. They kind of feel like... - Like jigglish, like kind of loose? - Kind of just loose, yeah, and it's not like when, don't do this at home, kids, it's not like when you take like MDMA or whatever, and you're like, \"Ah, I have to put my arms over my head!\" - This works more than I thought it would. I think. For sure. - Yeah. Yeah, like I wanna take the leftover box. - Yeah yeah, like, we would split the, yeah sure. - Yeah I'm not sure yet, I might just like, stick to my SSRI, but I mean, again, obviously I took my SSRI this morning and felt rage, and now I don't, so maybe I should. - Maybe you could supplement your SSRI with this. - With CBD, yeah. It just seems like, a little bit, like it's more expensive than my SSRI. It seems like a little pricey, and so perhaps the CBD industry should think about making it where it's more egalitarian, so that more people can use them. - I think these gummies might be good for people who don't want to go full-on into weed, or they maybe don't feel like vaping, or having an edible. And they just want to like, feel something nice, or calming. - I definitely think that it works, and I feel like whereas before I was very Daenerys Targaryen with my rage, now I feel more Cersei with it, where I'm very like, sort of removed from the rage, and then therefore I can use it more as a weapon, which is exciting to me. - I think it reduced my anxiety, in combination with lunch and friendship, and I think that the pain of being alive is a permanent condition. - I must agree with Katie, actually.

unknowingly handed out to more than 60 families at a food bank at the First Baptist Church in Roy this morning the church partners with the Utah Food Bank Fox 13 Sydney Glenn is in Roy tonight Sydney what are police saying about this well let's ask them ourselves right now I am live with sergeant Gwen and they are responding right the second you can see all of the officers behind me talk to me about the latest several children accidentally ingested this candy today yes a little after 3 o'clock this afternoon we were notified that a five year old girl was in the hospital for a THC overdose and we learned that the candy she ingested was provided to them through a Food Bank donation center here in Roy and so what you're seeing now was our officers are actively reaching out I believe it's 72 different families to make contact with them to ensure that we can recover as much as we can make sure those children who have ingested are seeking medical attention so you said to me earlier five children and told so far you have confirmed have ingested there's two of them in the hospital how successful have you been in reaching out to those families so we're looking at reaching out to 72 families and I think so far we've contacted I believe it's 44 families and we haven't been notified of any new victims probably within the last couple of hours let's talk about this huge response that you have right now for something that has never happened here before it's never happened here before and I can say probably for the first time in my career here we've actually called out half the department for an incident such as this you know and it's just a mistake and this is what it turns into you guys learned so far well we've learned so far that we need to be able to respond to these with haste to make sure that no other children are injured or two maybe notify those who aren't aware of what's in their donation that they need to be looking through them probably more carefully to ensure that this doesn't continue and we unfortunately have a bunch of volunteers who are trying to do a good thing and unfortunately this is what a yeah such an unfortunate situation I also spoke with the Utah Food Bank earlier today the CEO says she's just absolutely horrified about what happened the president and CEO of the Utah Food Bank said they were absolutely horrified that this product went out she went on to say she can easily see how volunteers would not have known what to look for a spokesperson for the agency said the THC candy donation came through a bulk commercial donation the CEO of the Utah Food Bank expressed her apologies and said they are changing their procedures to make sure this never happens again so if you are one of those people that did get that THC infused nerds rope you're asked to call the Roy City Police Department if your child has ingested that you should call the Utah poison control we have all those phone numbers for you on our website Fox 13 now calm for now live at the Roy City Police Department Sydney Glenn Fox 13 News Utah", "qu-99YgAp0I": "heyyou Pennsylvania patience it's me again medical Mary and I was thinking we could melt down these ring pops and make a little edible ring pop so we're gonna crush these down I think in the bag we're just gonna break them all up it broke already so we can keep the Ring Pop and make a mold so we have a THC ring puff so here's the plan melt these down add the RSO to the melted mixture I think I can use this as a Ring Pop mold and pop it right out but let's be honest if that doesn't work I have some backup molds we'll make it work let's melt this down also I might add a little weed oil as well I know all of you guys love working with are so or distillate and just putting it right in the mixture but I love a good flower oil so we're gonna put this and then here's the weed oil obviously we're not gonna put all of this in we're gonna put some of it in the biggest thing that I would stress is to have everything all set up and ready to go you don't want to be fumbling for it and like [Music] adding some powdered sugar to the inside of the bigger who you so that we don't have the biggest lollipop ever I don't know wish me luck all right I just came up with a better way to make my mole put the powdered sugar in here [Music] made a mold always heat these up I like to put it under hot water in a cup it needs to be warmed up before you open this you just don't want to break the plungers in they're done [Music] I have the RSO sitting in hot water well that RSO is soaking in the hot water so that it blew in [Music] we can still use it well I still think we can make sure it comes to the plan one more time to ring pops we're gonna melt it on the stove medium-low more towards low watch your stone once it's melted down that's when we're gonna get that are so I'm gonna put it in open maybe just a little weed oil no once this is all melted all mixed together all the THC added I'm gonna try to pour it into those molds we mean then we're gonna try to put the ring pop back on them this will kind of take a while to melt down so I'm gonna speed it up [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] I think it's freaking working [Music] I mean it's ugly but it is a ring pop I have to quick run though the dispensary but when I get back we'll do a taste test all right now it's time for the taste test so we have our ring pop [Music] [Music] so it may not look exactly like a ring pop but it also doesn't not look like a ring pop happy medicating meltdown your candy do it [Music] this was a lot less suspicious if you're gonna bring it somewhere to say [Music]", "MewQRwSYdiM": "[Music] hi there buds and welcome back to my kitchen I've been looking over the comment section of the edible videos that I've done recently and I've noticed that the most requested thing that people want are how to make weed gummies so I thought it would make weed gummy bears with you guys let me show you guys what you guys will need to make some weed gummies so the first thing that you're going to need are some type of gummy molds I chose little gummy bears and it came with a dropper which this is really convenient for transporting the gummy mixture into each of these little molds I'll have a link in the description of this video with all of the materials that I use next you will need an ounce of gelatin which is all four envelopes in the box you'll also need a pack of your favorite flavored jello I chose strawberry and you also need 1/4 of a cup of cannabis coconut oil if you don't know how to make cannabis coconut oil click up here and I'll show you how and then lastly you'll need a large saucepan and a whisk let's get to making some gummies in a saucepan on high heat you want to add your 1/4 cup of cannabis coconut oil and 1 in 1/2 cups of water to your saucepan and you want to whisk that together and let that boil and incorporate together all right I've had this boiling for about five minutes and it seems to be pretty well incorporated the next step to do is to start to add your gelatin one packet at a time and whisk it thoroughly in before adding the next packet [Music] when you first add the gelatin it starts to clump off but then as you mix it in you will see that it will fully incorporate that's when you should add the next packet of gelatin [Music] once you've added and incorporated all four packets of gelatin you can go ahead and add your packet of jell-o mix [Applause] now you're going to want to let this cook for about five to eight minutes until it fits to a rolling boil so that is what a rolling boil looks like and as you guys can see it is super stringy and it has changed consistency it is like really really goopy really sticky really thick turn your heat down to low and then we'll get ready to put this into a mold next you can go ahead and fill each of the individual bear molds be sure to continue mixing your mixture to ensure that it doesn't get clumped up it's also good to check on your mixture every few minutes because it can burn and you don't want your mixture to burn [Music] [Music] once you get it completely filled go ahead and use a paper towel to clean up the edges as much as you can as you guys can see I was a little messy but this should be fine I'm gonna go ahead and pop this in the refrigerator you want to keep it in there for about 30 minutes they should become firm after that and we'll go ahead and try these out all right I just got these out of the refrigerator now let's go ahead and plot these out and then we were taste [Music] or actually guys so here are my gummy beggars they actually turned out really cute I don't know if you guys can see that but it is a little bear Cheers I can't taste wheat in it at all it kind of just tastes like jello but they're like really firm you're definitely the right consistency they're coming I would describe it as like a gummy candy it's very sweet [Music] not weedy at all these are really really good if you liked this video give it a thumbs up leave a comment down below on what else I should make as far as cannabis edibles go because honestly taste wise I would go cannabutter cookies and then this cannabis coconut oil gummies as far as taste because these are actually like really good don't taste me at all but yeah this is cannabis gummy bears hope you guys make these because these are good and subscribe to my channel because I normally do green and we do videos every single week I'll see you guys around for whatever Shoni activity or video I come up with for next time boom you have some fun eating these companies for a while see ya [Music] [Music]", "4lBu59N17Vs": "recreational marijuana edibles coming to a store near you as of now you can make them at home but it is illegal for anyone to buy and/or sell them to the public Canada's proposed edible pot regulations have been made public and the 60-day consultation process has come to an end under the proposed federal rules a single serving would be limited to 10 milligrams of THC the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis and each serving must be individually wrapped this is considered a low to moderate dose of THC this dosage limit is sugar than in Colorado Washington or California where multiple servings are allowed per package so for example in a chocolate bar each breakable square can contain 10 milligrams each for a total of 100 milligrams pot meant for ingestion cannot have alcohol have limited caffeine and come in a plain child-resistant package the draft regulations say the products must not be appealing to youth and the packaging can't advertise dessert or confectionery flavors so no gummies shaped like bears one of the problems which were legalizing edibles were kids so kids came into the kitchen saw this wonderful nicely colored marijuana edibles and as kids to try it out the proposed rules are an attempt to address one of the main issues with edibles making sure they don't cause risk to public health especially for those who are underage but some are worried the black market will continue to thrive which are strict regulations a major cannabis edibles manufacturing California says it's been difficult to navigate within the legal market because there's still so much competition in the illicit market people that are heavy consumers of cannabis and like to ingest it can ingest you know hundreds if not thousands of milligrams of THC in a day and so if they have products that are available in the illicit market that are much cheaper and have a much higher potency they're gonna tend to go towards that so a problem with edible marijuana is that people are not used to it with edibles the effects can later and the people's oh I have now done this edible marijuana and there feel nothing and they'd more and more to avoid putting people at risk it would be better to start with low dosage and once we have clear evidence the black market is still thriving then we can reevaluate Health Canada confirms they've received 7,000 responses from Canadians industry representatives the provinces and the public health community on the proposed draft regulations Health Canada says cannabis products will be permitted for legal sale no later than

night bye", "pvply1CNh9Q": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary today we are looking at another product from cannabis quencher I know what you're thinking if you're a fan of my videos but wheats you're saying you've already reviewed the strawberry lemon-aid and that is correct but I've only reviewed the 200 milligram variety I have not yet reviewed the 100 milligram bretty in fact I've never reviewed any of the 100 milligrams from cannabis quenchers and the strawberry eliminated was my favorite flavors so far so I thought I'd give it a go if you've ever tuned in two weeks before guys the way our show works is I'm gonna take this edible or drinkable consume a bowl here finish it and come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how we're feeling cuz that's the most important part of any edible review but without further ado let's open this up and give it a smell give it a taste see how it tastes and smells it's got a strong we do der just like the other cannabis quenchers but that's okay because the the taste isn't that bad if it's like the others I assume it should taste even better having less THC in it but let's find out [Music] and yes that is the case he's just like the other one except with a slightly less power potent wheat aftertaste which is great because the that's the worst part about this is the sort of lingering marijuana taste in your mouth is sort of oily weedy taste the initial taste is great it's just that aftertaste can linger a little bit but this is less potent than the 200 milligram variety in terms of that aftertaste so that's something look boy - it's good the gondolier said Strawberry Fields and cannabis fields equals are sweet and refreshing strawberry lemonade forever again don't know what the gondolier has to do with cannabis winter at all can't figure it out but I'm glad he's there to tell me all right guys well I am going to finish this off and I will see you in two hours to let you know how we're feeling thank you so much for watching wheats chasm we'll see you soon peace guys half the price half the THC but not half the potency man I gotta say pleasantly surprised with the cannabis quenched your 100 milligrams I am pleasantly stoned for something that it's only advertised as half the strength as it's a hundred milligram brother and I don't feel half as high I feel you know not as high but but certainly not significantly less and the price is uh it so this is all this is I think it might dispensary half the price of the other one I think I would go with this one unless you really really really want to get knocked off your ass or if you have an incredibly high tolerance stick with the two hundred milligrams but I gotta say the hundred milligrams gonna do you the job probably and it's gonna do it at a more affordable price and I really really have enjoyed my reviews with abbis quite sure I will probably try some of their more exotic flavors just as an excuse to keep drinking them Wow yeah a plus um this gets uh well say an a because the the flavor isn't perfect and that's the first time I've ever given anything a letter grade before and probably the last time I ever do that so enjoy that and thank you cannabis quencher this was a great beverage and thank you guys for watching we'll check you on the next review peace hello and thank you so much for watching weeds if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment below and I'll be more than happy to try to find the product to review it again thanks for watching and we'll check you guys out on the next video", "1ZFWCKptfyw": "[Music] hi welcome to diving delight animals my name is Liz if this is the first time you're joining and the regular guys welcome back so today I am going to do a very quick video for you guys on how to do tincture since I've kind of moved over to tincture using it for can't sugars and syrups and flowers and so on and so forth so for those of you who don't know how to make tincture there's two ways of you can do it there's the old-fashioned way of using a mason jar and your plant material and your vodka or if you've got one of these handy-dandy puppies the magic butter machine or another type of machine like that that does infusion or that does t-shirts then you're much better off to go this way so this method takes four to six week or sorry six to eight weeks and this takes four hours so if this is something that you want to do just as a one-time do you can go ahead and try that but it tinctures is something that you get into for your edibles on a regular basis I highly highly recommend trying to get one of these things it's gonna save you so much time and effort and yeah so that's it for that so I'm just gonna get right into it there's not a whole lot here we're talking vodka a jar or the machine and the biggest thing is your alcohol so for your alcohol mainly vodka is the best one now you need to make sure that it is at least a 100 151-proof or at least seventy-six percent or higher in the States you can get Everclear which I believe is around a ninety four ninety six percent in Ontario or and I don't know about the rest of Canada however in Ontario if you can find spiritus this is 76 percent you can buy it off the shelf if not we have what's called alcohol that is ninety four percent however you have to contact the LCBO the I don't know what was it I'll put the link in for you just to make it helpful quality control that's it you have to send them a request as to exactly what you want to use it for how much you want to use it a year and if they agreed then they'll send you a letter and you take that to the LCBO and while off they will give you the the alcohol alcohol so or it come back way easier get right off the shelf and so that's about it this is more than the difficulty is getting the higher percent alcohol now a trick for you if you cannot obtain the 76 percent alcohol you can do the oldest method of distillation so get your 40 percent alcohol put it in the freezer wait till the water that's all completely frozen once it's frozen you will take it out and put it over a strainer and and you just take the lid off because the alcohol does not freeze it will work its way through the ice and drip out and that is going to almost double your percentage in your alcohol by taking out that water that is the oldest method of distillation is freezing so there you go or an easy trip an easy trick for you then you can do the second time to increase it even more so that I said waited should do it if it is difficult so I'm gonna just back up the camera a little bit here for you so we can see everything and show you how to put that together alright so to do a t-shirt now you can do a tincture for any type of plant materials so this goes for your herb if you want to do rose petals so if you've got a garden and you do all kinds of herbs you can do this is the exact same way that you would do those type of textures as well if you're into herbalism and things like that this is that exactly the same way you would do it so you are going to first of all deke are pure plant material if you don't know what the garbage decarboxylation which is converting your THC a to THC you do that by putting it in the oven in a glass oven safe pan or contain here hold on one sec something like this hourglass food would be better for you if not covered with tinfoil and you put it in the oven at 240 degrees Fahrenheit for 40 minutes and then you take it out and let it completely cool to room temperature once you've got that you will place it into a mason jar if you were doing it the old-fashioned way you will pour I've got three cups here of my 76 percent spiritus alcohol shoot well hopefully your partner is not all over your counter that's it you will place your lid on for a minute and you're gonna give it a good shake then you're gonna place it in your cupboard in a dark cupboard for the next six to eight weeks and every day every once or twice a day a couple times two or three times a day whenever you happen to go into your kitchen take her out give her a good shake up put her back in the dark and I said about six to eight weeks later that tincture will be ready you will strain that material out and you're good to go now if you're doing it with the herbal magic holy mackerel the magic of butter machine sorry if you're doing it with the magical butter machine the magical butter calm it's just a simple it's actually simpler you will take everything now you have to do at least a minimum of two cups to a maximum of five cups so I am just gonna take this because I'm not doing the six to eight week method and we just pour it right into our magical butter [Music] let's go scrape the rest of that out well it's easier said than done just give that a little bit of a stir up there put your lid on Luger in and you are going to set the temperature to 130 degrees Fahrenheit or I can't see what it says in the cells if he says 94 Celsius and you are going to set it for the four-hour t-shirt that's it lights are gonna come on it's gonna do the grinding in that and after four hours we are going to strain this and that's it we'll have our texture so a lot of great reasons as I said we're making tincture is that you can make so much from your tincture as I said you can do the can of sugar check out my video on how to make kin of sugar there's the other one on canna flour powdered sugar Cantus syrup and simple syrup how to cover those so you can pretty much make all your base ingredients now with your tincture and it shows you how to do it to dehydrate it so it evaporates all the alcohol leaving your good stuff and you can then use all these ingredients then for your base cooking so you're no longer having to put butter in two places butter has no business being like jello so I'm pretty sure we could get a million recipes enough one of those recipes is going to call for butter so that now lets you eliminate the most of fires and things and lets you make things more in their natural state as well as being able to better control how strong or weak you want to make your products so you can either just use a little bit of sugar so 1/4 because sofa for example if a recipe is 1 cup you can either use a quarter cup it would be pretty mild or you can use a whole cup of can if you really wanted to render people unconscious so it's that it gives you far more versatility than using the butter or the oil you're going to get the same type of strength and yeah I definitely love using that I have a lot more oh and one thing also when you are if you are using the machine I always make sure to either have a fan if there overhead fan going or Stan fan or have the window open you want to always have air circulation whenever you're working with alcohol especially alcohol that is so highly concentrated all right and one other thing that I know a lot of you are gonna ask me which I probably should have said earlier about the D card would I would de carbon so generally on average people again it's all how personally strong you want to make your base your t-shirt so I've included the a link for a calculator so you can calculate your own but my route what I generally do is a half an ounce to one cup or one pound of butter so that's generally my rule of thumb of how the strength that I like to make mine as I said use the calculator and then you can figure out exactly how much you want to add of your plant material in order to get the strength of the dosing etc of exactly what you aren't personally and so once your your texture is done if you're using the machine after four hours you can then just strain it well with your handy this bag is awesome if you guys have this machine you know this bag is almost worth but getting it for the machine so yeah just straight around if not if you've got if you're doing it HR method then you will strain it you can use a strainer and a cheesecloth or a coffee coffee filter and for those of you who don't know what a cheesecloth is it is a fine fine mesh cotton cloth that you double and triple up to to get it as fine as you want it to and they're awesome for straining you can get them in any grocery store any dollar store they're really easy you easily two pot they're very easy to find story and yeah does it said and they're really inexpensive they're like a dollar and they're huge and you can just use whatever size you want but so that's it once you're done you will you will store it in a mason jar secure the lid on tight and keep it in a dark location and that's it for textures alright so my infusion is now done they got the lid pour it through this handy-dandy strainer just gonna get out

douglasville and Fulton County police want to know the true extent of an alleged drug operation that targeted Metro students the drug marijuana edibles hidden-camera fox5 i-team investigation first exposed the home-based company it's called trill treats and Foxfire i-team reporter Randy Travis returns with why authorities are so concerned about well think about its today in Rus how many parents are teachers would be immediately suspicious if they found brownies or fruity pebble treats wrapped up in a kids book bag not only are these marijuana edibles showing up more and more in local schools they become so profitable it's leading some to kill in September two men shoot to death Steven Mayer stealing cash and boxes of pot laced brownies from his life though in your home that's the newest trend right now edibles they sat out and camped out for up to two hours in April kids at two different Rockdale County Schools are hospitalized after eating pot brownies offered to them by other students it's more dangerous in a traditional way and just this month a de Simmons is busted in Douglasville after a fox 5i team hidden-camera investigation caught him running an edibles manufacture and delivery service out of his Fairburn home you're selling drugs to kids you realize that don't you how much money did you make from this he named his company truehl treats this is what undercover does the police officers bought these alleged infused brownies with icing on them in the backseat here and this is what else was for sale apparently being delivered to another location also in the front seat a box of these goes for about a hundred dollars imagine how many of these trays mr. Simmons sold through the time he was in business a lot of the Fox the night team earlier paid him a hundred bucks for this box of a dozen edibles we made sure authorities took possession after a lab show those brownies tested positive for the active ingredient in marijuana at levels three times higher than the accepted dosage in pot friendly states like Colorado according to his trill treats Instagram page this 19 year old entrepreneur is quite the Baker quite the salesman a fox file item employee became one of his 4100 followers and just like douglasville police was able to see samples and the price list for his product line brownies Fruity Pebbles cinnamon toast crunch treats guaranteed to get you geeked he even posted a video what appears to be bags of marijuana and ingredients needed to start the baking process read the comments and it's clear Simmons had people pushing his products in Metro Schools you need more people selling at Westlake a customer complains one person keeps selling out in the morning need to get some of these guys at Banneker writes another I will eventually and to another student customer meet me by the gym before second period oh you like you know the colleges and everything right well has myself yeah that all this is going on up under the teachers and the principals and the security guards and the the the police officers that are there on the grounds these three moms asked us not to show their faces they say their high school kids told them they bought marijuana laced treats from Simmons one girl wound up in the hospital after eating too much you're getting kids to sell drugs in the school not when you go out to the school on the street not when you go to the store but in school where we have to send our kids but trill treats isn't the only game in town never to this day that I would have ever imagined that now we're worried about animal drugs just this year his deputies arrested two students who brought homemade brownies in the heritage high school another faces charges for sharing this professionally baked marijuana edible with a fellow student at Edwards middle school for a sheriff who started off his career as a school resource officer this new form of drug trafficking is frightening what was your reaction when you heard they were that young it was very alarming because if he can get into the middle schools then it can get into the hands of the elementary school meanwhile the mastermind of trill treats faces five felony counts and remains in the Douglas County Jail without bond since Simmons arrests that true treats Instagram account has disappeared but not before allowing investigators to see how a 19 year old put together his own thriving business from manufacturing to packaging to marketing sales and delivery right up until the day police decided this sale was final now as for that homicide over cash and edibles in Lithonia dekap police say they still have no solid leads but it really shows how valuable this stuff can be to some people of the criminal element yeah and how worrisome it can be because these young people don't realize how potent these edibles are right and that's why the Rockdale County Sheriff says that he's gonna have to educate his community to make sure that parents and the kids know that that yeah that if you eat some of this stuff it doesn't give you an immediate high it takes awhile and you wind up eating way too much of it what really bothered him was that it showed up in middle schools we're not even in high schools now we're talking middle school kids and as he pointed out if it's middle school what's stopping it from getting to the elementary schools as well right the sheriff even mentioning that this form of marijuana can be actually more toxic than smoking it if you eat too much of it and what kid is not going to eat a lot of brownies or anything sweet yeah Brody pebbles right thanks so much Randy ok thanks", "9EUFCgxEVYs": "[Music] hey everybody jay ping here checking in live respectmyregion.com back with another west coast we tour review 2020 edition today super excited because man i visited steezy downtown la the other day picked up a nice group of items these little assorted bits beets i'm not sure 20 pieces a bunch of different colors bunch of different flavors i'm super excited hundred milligrams in this container are you guys ready it says low calorie gluten free let's see what else what else what else 4.78 milligrams of serving this package actually only has 95.54 milligrams of thc so always read the packaging because you're not actually getting a hundred it says total 100 milligrams on the front on the sticker 95 milligrams dhc take a view of the colors of these gummies i'm pretty excited got the green pink orange blue purple red look got a bunch of these here look at that red one oh almost dropped it so you know an assorted colors here super excited let's check it out one i'm gonna eat two of these today one bite i'll talk about the first one two bites we'll give it the official score you guys know what's good and the rules here we go first one what color should we go with chris what do you think purple i like your style i'm a grape guy so this is perfect this is a great way to start i'm really judgy about grape flavored [ __ ] it's really it's really sticky like it tastes good it's light it's not a great flavor at all unfortunately i don't know what flavor it is but it's really sticky it's slightly sweet it's berry something i don't know if it's grape does it say can just say what the flavors are peel here let's see let me see if let me see if there's something here peel here ah here we go here we go here we go here we go oh yep it has the flavors oh it's not grape it's black cherry interesting okay so the flavors black cherry orange green apple strawberry watermelon and blue raspberry cool now that i know that just ate the black cherry that was pretty good it's a sour black cherry against your sour so it was slightly sour all right that makes sense way more sense second color blind taste test don't tell me don't tell me what i get all right now you guys see here we go what'd i get chris i can't tell you oh all right so i have no clue what [Music] strawberry okay hmm all right so very chewy it's stuck in my tooth it makes me think of the consistency between like the dots times starbursts and chewiness and like stickiness and like how you have to get it off your teeth it takes like some effort but also there is a very much like a uh uh what is it the uh sour patch kids yes there's a very much a sour patch kid aspect to this it's not quite sweet enough i can't give them that these are slight these are definitely tart i wouldn't say they're sour though at least for the black cherry and the strawberry uh those two again let me see do these they don't really have individual smells let me see what we got here presentation beautiful front label sticker there that was in the top of the lid i love it they've got the warning labels on it all appeal you know i gotta say the steezy does a great job of presentation i'm going to give these a solid 10 out of 10 appeal um sour gummy cubes i'll give it a 9.5 there's nothing that makes me feel like this is healthy whatsoever um color super wonderful branding the colors of the gummies are all super on point like i feel like that's all good 10 out of 10 smell definitely don't get me if these gummies had individual smells with each of the gummies i'd give it a perfect score but they don't and because of that that's ah man to me that's like a 7.5 on the score because there's just no smell to this jar whatsoever so it's just smells like sweet candy although that's what candy should smell like that's why they get a the 75 because it's like okay cool they get the candy smell right like that's it but like i really needed like five different flavors of stuff uh potency let's see uh total of 100 milligrams thc but this pack specifically only had 95.54 a little disappointing right but to be expected right it's hard to get this 100 dialed in if that's not your model so it's tough um potency i gotta give you guys you know it's not a hundred milligrams it's five milligrams less i'm going to give you guys an eight out of ten that's kind of hurting there taste i did like the black cherry i thought the strawberry made sense afterwards it was nice and light and kind of tart uh taste uh uh you know to read the full to get the full taste score i'll have to eat a few more of these and then make sure you guys check back into the written review or in the description that'll kind of help that but for now i'll give it a give it a i'll give it a 7.5 out of 10. um not not that sour and not a very strong flavor that made me know exactly what it was if that was grape would have been hyped but it wasn't um purple usually goes with a grape flavor let's see let's see let's see experience experience so far is around a 7.5 to an eight out of ten again i wish there would have been a smell i wish there would have been greater flavors kind of hard to identify what all the flavors are unless you peel the sticker off i was always bad at reading directions i assume lots of other people are makes it going to be tough for them to figure out what these flavors actually are so in my experience i'll give it a i'll give it an 8 out of 10. more information there is a lot of information on there i notice again steezy does a great job of uh you know educating and teaching and they're good with pads and vendor days that they stop all out of their stores so i give it to them for that it's tough i'll give them i give them the information was there it was peelable i'll give them a nine i'll give them a nine out of ten what i recommend i would recommend probably some other different versions of these gummies i've had better ones than these from them but i definitely would recommend this 8 out of 10 solid recommendation the only time i would recommend switching away from this is if there's a specific flavor you want or if you feel like price point it's kind of that kind of choice for you or you know maybe get a better deal so that uh overall i'm going to give them an 8.5 out of 10 but we'll cut we'll also see what our slider method kind of aggregates it to once we enter in all the exact scores so stay tuned i appreciate you guys for all the love we've got the steezy bits here 20 assorted flavors a lot of good ones a nice sour candy look at all these cool colors that we've got here um i love the experience man stevie you guys do a great job i look forward to doing some more work with you all please stay tuned for more reviews facebook instagram twitter

seeing trends of the oils for vaping the market has changed in reference to some states being legal so the way they market their products and all are different so it just puts a whole lot of different things out there on the street this past summer Baldwin County deputies intercepted a shipment of drugs bound from San Francisco to Florida more than a hundred thousand dollars worth of marijuana was accompanied by dozens of vials of THC oil and colorful THC gummy candies THC is now commonly infused in flavorful vaping liquids as well as candies this creates an appeal to a younger population one who may otherwise not use marijuana and a traditional fashion such as young children he also have the case of parents that may be doing it lit or older siblings that may leave it around and then you have the younger smaller children that don't know what they're getting into that may get into it see it as candy and then next thing you know they have been exposed to it with more states legalizing

[Music] today I'm going to show you guys how I make the clear hemp lip glosses using the hemp oil which is like extra moisturizing but yeah so yeah I'm not really gonna see my face like that in this video but it's okay I like to play music here is Apple music just play so everything is set up I wash my hands and dried them now I'm gonna put a mango lives on and a was struggling I don't know why I still had for me to put gloves on they was telling so anyways so I take the bowl and I'm gonna go and measure it now I'm weighing the bowl because I'm trying to only do half of this day a full bag gets you about like 20 glosses and I'm not trying to make that much cuz I'm really just trying to like test out products and stuff like that so how it is bag would be 2.25 this bowl is 15 point 15 ounces so su-25 close to 225 thank you I don't know babe right now [Music] so now from here basically the oil is I'm used to this our coconut oil and then hemp oil this is my first time China so I don't know yet how because it is orange so now I'm gonna take up three pipettes for the three different oils okay you start with the hand there's a way to look like uh she looks like weed she's like right in the middle like she thick but not too thick you feel me slim thick [Music] [Music] [Music] so y'all understand what's going on basically the make sure wasn't too thick it was really that the glitters were like getting stuck the consistency was a bit thick but at the same time it was mostly just the fact that the glitter is kept getting stuck so basically I couldn't find a way to make it work because I really wanted there to be a couple glitters in every single gloss that's kind of like the key to this gloss like the fun part about it or whatever so basically I squeezed back the glosses and to my mixture and I added in the rest of the verses uh which ended up making about 15 tubes which is not as much as me about 20 but because I wanted this boss to be very big I feel like it what is it in bother me as much because I really just wanted it to be a very big applause for those girls that like that but it's still very very so yeah I basically did this and next time for you guys doing if you guys are putting into the glitters like I did just make sure you cut more of the pipet so you have a wider hole for the stuff to like come out from that sounds weird pause but yeah it's a little close to see this consistency and I mustered a is great so basically basically it got harder to put in the glitter and stuff and then I was like looking over at the consistency was a little thick so I added the rest of the versa gel in and I added some more oil I can't tell you guys how much order to put I feel like bilious like up to you like everyone has a different preference but this is the consistency so this is a whole bag of versa gel all the links are in the description as well so you guys can make it dear subs were at home and I better fill up the tubes now so I cut the bedpan I put it on and everybody also has different ways of putting the gloss and suited to a syringe [Music] [Music]", "-YYmyGDT2OQ": "what's going on everyone this is the news here Sriman clip

I microdose marijuana to\ntreat pain and anxiety, and I have no problem admitting\nthat makes me a better mom. I do want to preface this by saying that I'm not a medical doctor. I'm not in a position\nto advise anyone else on how medicinal marijuana may help them or make their lives better. I can only talk about\nmy personal experiences. I have stage four endometriosis, which is a chronic pain condition. It started about 10 years ago. I've had five major abdominal surgeries. Pain has been kind of a constant in my life for the last decade. As a single mom to a six\nyear old, that's hard, especially when my period\nhits and I'm stuck in bed. - Hello.\n(laughing) - What's your name? - Josie. - Josie, who are you? Are you my daughter? - Mm-hm, mm-hm, mm-hm. - Are you my best bud? I was not the person anyone\nwould have ever expected to be advocating for\nmedicinal marijuana use. I grew up in a family of police officers. My father was a narcotics officer for many, many years of my childhood. My whole life I've heard\nthat drugs are bad. I was 25 years old before I\ntried it for the first time and honestly, I hated it. Smoking marijuana made\nme wanna sit in a corner and not talk to anyone, which isn't a great thing for an introvert who already kind of is drawn that way. And I was pretty sure marijuana\nwould never be for me. So when a friend suggested\nI try microdosing, I was pretty against it, but I happened to be\nvisiting her in Seattle for another friend's wedding\nwhen my period started. And it kind of seemed like my period was about to ruin what should\nhave been a really fun time with people I cared about. So we went to a pot shop, and we discussed all the options and I bought a couple of mints that came in really low doses, and I followed the instructions\nof the employee there, to basically do no more than about two milligrams\nevery one to two hours. For most people getting high\non a medicinal marijuana edible would take five to 10 milligrams. So I was taking much smaller doses. I found that it really did\ntake the edge off the pain, especially the cumulative effect. So it didn't necessarily\nkick in right away after the first pill, but as I continued going\nthroughout the day, I was able to be more and more functional without really being high. And that was the key point to me, was that something was\ntaking the pain away without taking me out of commission. When I got home to Alaska,\nI started experimenting with marijuana more and more, and I kinda found that my ideal dose is about 1.5 milligrams,\nagain, every one to two hours depending on how bad my pain is. But another benefit came out as well, and that was that I started to realize the anxiety I've dealt with my entire life was leveling off on the days\nthat I was microdosing as well. And that was huge. You know, as much as pain\ncan knock me out of my life, anxiety can as well. If I'm having a high stress day or I'm just not in the right head space, I have a hard time working. I have a hard time being\nthe friend I wanna be, the mom I wanna be. What is that? - My tooth fell out.\n- Yeah. - [Leah] Can I see your mouth? Did it hurt very bad or\njust a little bit bad? - Just a little. - [Leah] You pretty brave? - Yeah. - So for me a bad pain day\noften means being stuck in bed, which is hard as a single\nmom to a six year old who wants to be going\nout and doing things. It's not really fair to her either. She can sit in bed with me\nall day and watch movies, but why should she have to? I do a lot of things to manage my pain. Marijuana is really just one tool in a great big bucket of tools I have. But in terms of pain\nmanagement in the moment, microdosing helps me, not\nmore than anything else, because honestly, prescription\npain killers I've been given knock out the pain better, but marijuana helps to\ntake the edge off the pain while still allowing me to be functional, whereas the prescription\npain killers I've been given knock me out too and, as a mom, that's not an acceptable solution. So these are some of the products I use. These are really small mints, and the thing I like about these is they come in the small doses I prefer. It's like 1.6 milligrams a mint, which is usually my preferred dosage. So this is my favorite product. I also buy chocolate bars. These chocolate bars come in 5\nmilligram dosages per square. The thing I like about this is I can get even smaller doses if I want, just because I can take a small bite and I could break one of these squares up into five or six pieces if I wanted. All of these are kept in my freezer, in a special box that my kiddo\nknows is mommy's medicine. We've talked about it\nand discussed the fact that these look like candy,\nbut that they're not. Hey Josie. Oh, did you just wake up? Thank you for joining\nus, little sleepy head. (laughing) Can I ask you a question? What are these things? - Mommy medicine. - And are you ever supposed\nto touch any of this? No, how come? - Because.\n- Cause it's not for kids? Love you.\n(lips smacking) I think at the end of the day, we're all kind of just trying to survive and that may be especially\ntrue for those of us with chronic pain conditions or mental health struggles. We just wanna be the best\nversions of ourselves. For me, microdosing helps me to be the best version of myself. After years of trying\njust about every solution and every option available, it's one of the best that I've found, and like I said before, it's just one tool in my toolbox, but yeah,\nit makes me a better mom because it helps me to get\nout of bed in the morning when I'm having a bad pain day, and it helps me to clear my head when my anxiety is spinning me out. It gives my child the version\nof me that she deserves, a mom who is functional and happy and able to get through the day. I think a lot of people take for granted that not everybody has that\nwithout the additional help. Whether I were taking a\nprescription medication or this medication that I'm\nable to buy at the store, shouldn't matter. It's something that helps. It's something that gives me\nthe version of me I wanna be. It allows me to have relief and it gives my daughter\nthe mom she deserves. (gentle music)", "vu1RKWQtN-M": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today I have a very exciting video that's been highly requested and I'm sorry it was taking so long I'm going to be showing you guys how I make my extra strong green dragon picture this photo has one cup of liquid and 10 grams of wheat and then I reduced it to 1/3 of a cup meaning that now there is 5 tablespoons in 1/3 of a cup so every tablespoon is 2 grams of wheat you're gonna need the carbs wheat for this recipe and I'll post a link of how to do that below here's what you're gonna need alcohol that is 95% alcohol or higher some coffee filters or cheesecloth a funnel some mason jars and 10 grams of the carb to read the first step is to freeze your Dakkar bleed for at least 24 hours I have already done that and now that it's been over 24 hours I'm going to pour in 2/3 of a cup of vodka that has been in the freezer for at least 24 hours the instructions for this can still be followed even if you're not using the same amount of wheat that I am which is 10 grams all you have to do is pour enough vodka to fill just to the top of the weed now you're going to shake it aggressively for 5 minutes then you'll put it in the freezer for at least 2 hours I ended up leaving mine in the freezer for about 20 hours there's no need to leave it for long within 2 hours I did that simply because I ran at a time now I'm placing a funnel into my mason jar and I'm going to poke some holes into my coffee filter so that it flows through a little bit quicker if you don't have any coffee filters you can also use cheesecloth then place that into the funnel now you can take your weed and vodka mixture out of the freezer and shake it aggressively for another 5 minutes pour your mixture into the filter and try to avoid spilling it over the edge like I do here then wait for it to filter through this can take a while sometimes even up to a half an hour you can see how slowly it comes out of the bottom and then once almost all of the liquid has gone through I'll move the weed around to try and facilitate more of the liquid to be filtered through I put some gloves on because if your fingers are touching the weed and vodka it can absorb some of the THC and we obviously don't want that because that would be a waste now that all the vodka has gone through the filter I'm going to scoop back the weed into the jar you can see how much weed is left in the funnel because I spilled it when I poured it in so again try to avoid doing that if you can [Music] now I'm going to pour in 1/3 of a cup of vodka that again has been in the freezer for at least 24 hours and then I'm going to pour it into my jar weed that I had already filtered once now again if you're using different proportions just use enough to just cover the weed you can just pour it straight into the jar I'm just using the funnel so I can try and get some of that weed that's stuck to it the first time now once again I'm going to shake that jar aggressively for five minutes now using that same jar and same filter that I'd use the first time I am going to pour in the mixture that we had just shaken into the jar that we first used [Music] now this step is optional but I'm going to pour in a little bit of that very cold flash-frozen vodka to get the remnants out of my jar again you don't have to do this but I don't want to waste anything so every little scrap I can get I'm gonna take now once again we're going to let that filter through and it is going to take a long time just like the first round did [Music] once that's all dripped through we're going to place a clean funnel into a clean measuring cup or mason jar as well as a new clean coffee filter and we are not going to poke any holes now we're going to pour it in and we're going to wait for this to drip through this step is not necessary but I like mine very clear so I like to filter out any imperfections if you like you can do this step twice but it does take a long time so I only do it once and I find that the one time is sufficient to get it very pure and clean I'm also going to take the filter with the weed that has been filtered already and press it out as much as I can of course make sure you're wearing a rubber glove so that your skin is not absorbing at all yeah and just try and squish oh as much as you can and then that little bit of leftover that is on the parchment paper there I mean if you're just using this for yourself you could just lick it up I don't know if you don't want to waste it anything works yeah so just squeeze out as much as you possibly can it's been about a half an hour and almost everything has filtered through and we have a total of about a little bit under a cup of liquid because some of that vodka is lost in the extraction process [Music] now we need to reduce our tincture to a smaller amount and we're going to use that by using a double boiler thing which I don't have so I'm making my own version and I'm just using my instant pot so that I can do it in the living room where I have better lighting so I am wrapping some tinfoil around it so I can contain the heat as much as possible and I'm just going to put my measuring cup on to the side of it and then wrap the tinfoil kind of around it that way not too much water and heat is evaporating all you want to make sure is that your bottom of your mason jar or your measuring cup like I'm using is not touching the water so same concept as a double boiler so I both to put it in there but I just have to show off how beautiful it looks it's so clear so golden absolutely beautiful I hope you guys appreciate how wonderful it looks because a lot of my friends and family don't really feel the same way as I do so I just love being able to share this stuff with you guys online please make sure you do this any well-ventilated area so I have all windows and doors in my house opened as well as if your dreams on the stove have your hood fan on there is no smell at all so unfortunately my instant pot broke part way through I don't know what happened so I moved it to the kitchen and I made this sort of contraption thing because I could not put the measuring cup on the edge of the pot because I don't have anything deep enough where the bottom of the measuring cup wouldn't touch the water so I just put a metal strainer on top and then created some insulation with the tin foil kind of like how I did it the instant pot so while you're watching it when it's bubbling a lot like this that's a little bit too much so turn your heat down a little bit you do want a little bit of movement but not that aggressively now I reduced it down to one third of a cup and that took me about an hour and a half I believe you can reduce it more or reduce it less it just depends on how strong you want it to be now it's ready to pour into a jar to save you can use this with a dropper or you can put into your gummies or into your drinks there's so many different ways to use it hopefully you guys will check out some of my gummy videos and try it out in one of those recipes and here's the finished product which is absolutely beautiful thank you so much for watching with the measuring cup I didn't want to waste any possible tincture so I heard some iced coffee into there and now I'm drinking that so that's a good way to make sure you're not wasting anything if you guys enjoyed this video please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe and please let me know if there's any videos you would like to see me record because I would be happy to do that thank you guys so much for watching have a great day [Music]", "ct13uGTrFlA": "new weed is more powerful and dangerous than the classic the doctor is in it's on call with dr. Howard Smith recreational cannabis use is on the rise as more and more states make it legal we can learn a thing or two from our neighbors to the north as weed for fun is completely legal throughout Canada and medicinal marijuana has been in widespread use for years I just published report in the Canadian Journal of Cardiology reminds us that the new cannabis versus the classic variety may be risky the case report recounts the story of an older man with stable coronary artery disease who decided to try a THC lollipop to relieve some pain and insomnia it contained 90 milligrams of THC and triggered a serious heart attack and reduce cardiac function now compare that 90 milligrams of THC in the lollipop to seven milligrams in a joint or the usual 2.5 milligram dose of THC used for nausea in cancer and AIDS patients cannabis heart toxicity can be due to three things number one directed effects of THC on cardiac muscles number two effects of the various inhaled and toxic gases released when marijuana burn and three the cardiac effects of weed induced anxiety and hallucinations over the past 20 years the THC in marijuana plants seized by authorities has risen from nearly four percent to over 13 percent as marijuana use increases in the general population any and all users must be careful of overdosing due to potent new edible as well as smokeable lead and the possible adverse interactions of cannabis with current medications and existing cardiac problems that's health news you should use thanks for listening until we next speak I'm dr. Howard Smith reminding you to keep a smile on your face your brain active and your body in motion these are the best medicine [Music]", "-fWfip8_nkA": "hi and welcome to Kara basics today we learn five easy ways to use cannabis vegetable glycerin tincture marijuana vegetable glycerin or VG tincture is a thick sweet and usually golden to dark brown color tincture which has the amazing capability to allow THC to mix easily into water-based liquids there are several ways of making vegetable glycerin tinctures some involving the cannabis and VG sitting for months on end others use heat to speed the extraction and sometimes alcohol is used to extract the THC which is then combined into the vegetable glycerin we'll put links to some of these methods at the end of the video and in the description but no matter how you make or acquire your tincture here are five easy ways to put it to good use one of the easiest ways to use your vegetable glycerin tincture is to make jello with it you can use it one small package of jell-o and make it just for the directions and once you pour your jello into your boiling water you want to mix that make sure it's thoroughly mixed and then go ahead and add in your vegetable glycerin tincture for one small package of jell-o depending on the potency of your tincture one tablespoon is probably enough next step is to go ahead and make sure that you've fully incorporated and by that I mean really really mixed the hell out of it and makes your VG in there and then now you're going to go ahead and get a cup of cold water ready I like to do that by pouring a water over ice and then using the ice to water and then combine the one cup of cold water with the one cup of hot water and again mix it very thoroughly and making sure that we get that tincture mixed all the way through as much as possible and then as per the directions of the jello put that in the refrigerator for about three or four hours and you're gonna have a nice marijuana infused dessert treat that you can hardly at all even taste the cannabis in this if you use that ratio it's very transparent a nice way to get a small dose of the vegetable glycerin tincture and it really helps if you have a sore throat of anything and that jello next up we have fruit juice because the vegetable glycerin tincture allows the cannabis to become soluble in water you don't really even need heat or anything like that to be able to mix it into a water-based drink such as this is a watermelon drink here but you could use pretty much any kind of drink that you want or a smoothie and just simply take the cap off depending on how much you're gonna put in you might need to take one drink out to make a little room but I've only put about a teaspoon in this and I didn't need to take any room out but just make sure you shake it thoroughly and again now you just want to make sure you incorporate it good so you don't get all of your tincture in one drink so you don't want to shake it a minute or so and then if you let it sit for very long between drinks you'll want to shake it up between each each sort of session okay and conversely as well as you could add it to cold drinks you can also add it to hot drinks so the third method we're showing here is to add it to a cup of tea but of course you could also use coffee and you could also even use a cup of hot cocoa but especially if you're using tea what you want to do is you want to make sure that you go ahead and let your tea steep fully and then go ahead add in your any other flavorings such as honey or lemon or whatever you're adding in and then add the tincture and last and you certainly don't want to add your tincture in first because it's gonna absorb into your tea bag so make sure that you've taken your tea bag out squeezed it out added anything else and then add your tincture and last again mix it thoroughly I like to use the dipping spoon to mix it when it's hot it'll melt all the takes you right off there you've got a nice marijuana infused cup of tea or coffee or cocoa [Music] okay and the next method is to make silly syrup and what silly syrup is is basically taking any kind of syrup or honey I would recommend real maple syrup but I'm just using kind of just cheap breakfast syrup here which has a very similar consistency to the vegetable glycerin tincture and not adding in a ratio I would say at least two to one but you probably want to go maybe even four to one for parts syrup to one part of the vegetable glycerin texture then once you have it combined mix it well again and you can store it just like it is for on the counter for as long as you could store the syrup usually but the one thing is you wouldn't want to make sure that you thoroughly shake or mix it each time before you use it but once it's made you could use it just like you would any other kind of syrup I'm putting it over some waffles here with some melting butter and it's delicious again the artificial maple flavoring and this syrup totally disguised that a pretty large amount of cannabis tincture that was in there you didn't even notice that at all and it's a really effective way to to get your medicine into you on a daily basis without smoking or causing any further harm to you and it's a nice subtle way to do it the only thing about this especially in the syrups or anything like that you want to make sure you label it and keep it out of reach of children if you make any of these kinds of recipes that would sit around and then she could use on in and then our fifth and final method here is to use it as an e-cig juice a lot of people don't know that this vegetable glycerin tincture will just vape perfectly right inside of your ecigs cigarette device and you just however you fill your device normally you just put in the tincture I use a little syringe with the the big needles which is used for that and it's perfect and it vapes good it tastes good you could add in some flavorings some lemon or some pine or whatever flavor you might want to flavor up your tincture but it's great just as it is this episode of cata basics is brought to you about the roughhouse studios

marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and it's old-school today guys cuz we are taking a look at an edible just like good times good times I mean old times but the old times aren't necessarily good times anymore because here in California we are fully in the new recreational world which includes this ridiculous hundred milligram cap on edibles not just that but makes absolutely crazy packaging requirements for all edibles here in California so what edible are we talking about that is ridiculous today what we are gonna take our first look at Plus gummies that's right another gummy review I normally tell you to avoid the gummies but I have heard a lot of good things about Plus and I am a little curious I'm always hoping to find another gummy I like cushy punch or flourish or Tiki killers that's actually worth something so I'm definitely looking forward to reviewing these plus gummies first thing you're gonna notice is how crazy this packaging is so here it is here is our plus gummies I believe they are sour blueberry blue in case you don't know is objectively the best flavor of everything if there is a multitude of colors and blue is available always go with blue because blue is much like a like a law of thermodynamics or whatever the case may be blue is always the best fruit flavor even though I don't know of any naturally-occurring blue fruits other than blueberries and blue tasting foods are hardly ever blueberries usually blue raspberry or something it's always the best trust me on this though so we have a sealed bag with you know all these insane requirements on it batch number this that and the other I mean it's great because it has all of those wonderful serving sizes and ingredients and all the testing results all this stuff you know I like seeing but it's a bag and then a fancy 10 on the inside I think all edibles now have to be bagged in addition to whatever kind of thing holds the edibles they have to have these sealed maggots it's insane it just boosts up the cost because this uh 100 milligram 20 piece edibles so I believe it's 20 gummies each worth 5 milligrams of THC cost me 20 bucks at my dispensary which is outrageous of course but that is the world we now live in and we shall review it as if it's the world we want to live in who knows I don't know what I'm saying I know I'm sad I'm disappointed that the edible world has changed so much and so for such and in such a shitty direction over the past year but let's stop the bitching and get straight to the review of the plus gummies cannabis infused sour blue berry so we're gonna open up the first layer of the packaging here it looks like it's got a little tear thing nice Oh and then then we got our second layer the zip sealed bag on side of the tear bag and then we gotta figure out how to open this the childproofing I think you ground push down and that breaks the seal yes there we go so second layer of security through now we're finally to our chin on the inside and to the gummies in here ah so here are our blue raspberry or blueberry gummies whatever they call it blue flavored the best 20 gummies in there give it a smell oh definitely a cannabis e odor which is not a bad thing I I'd like to know that there's some cannabis in these but also a hefty flavor and aroma of blue but certainly in a cannabis aroma there as you can see just a bunch of little squares dropped one there and let's pluck it into our mouths but before we do in case this is your first week to review the way they work when we do edibles we reviewed the whole experience I'm gonna eat all 20 of these gummies and then I'm gonna come back to you guys in about two hours to actually let you know how I'm feeling because it's you want to know how have it tasted like [ __ ] but you what you really want is it gonna get you [ __ ] up it's gonna get you high are you gonna get what you paid for it and that guy's is what you need to stick around for but first the taste test so here we go first cube in the mouth um very spongy gummies very very spongy almost hard to bite into because they're so Airy um a surprising cannabis taste them it's not awful but there is a 4 what is 5 milligrams of THC in these cubes definitely a cannabis taste to it but the blue the blue sciency flavor counter sex but if you don't like cannabis taste maybe you don't stick with these because you're gonna taste it again not terrible not overwhelming but it is surprisingly noticeable for what is just 5 milligrams of THC so guys I'm gonna eat me about what 16 more of these and I said I'm gonna eat me which is very back woodsy and folksy way of saying I'm gonna eat the rest of these so guys I'll see you in about two hours I'm gonna scarf these down and I'll let you know then if they're worth your money or not so thanks for staying tuned this far sticking around this far sorry guys this is really my second video back here on weeds and this will probably be another video between season 3 and between season 2 and season 3 so forgive my rustiness see you guys in two hours thanks for sticking around 2 hours since I have had the plus cannabis infused gummies looking at the camera for the first time now since coming back the fuse but I also see now I'm saying the word let's just start over one more time BAM I'm back guys it has been 2 hours since I had the plus cannabis infused gummies and I think there was an even yeah it says create on there as well there are a lot of nouns and adjectives and verbs on that packaging I'm really not even sure what it's called I'm just gonna call it plus gummies plus gummies uh guys I am genuinely pretty impressed uh for a gummy and for a hundred milligram edible this brought the heat um I'm not outrageously high but I am at like maybe a 6 somewhere in that range which is way higher than I expected it to be after a hundred milligrams and especially after a gummy I am pretty pleased with this now that is in the relative scale compared to you know this new world of edibles because this is a very expensive product you don't get a lot for your money here compared to the old world but in this new world this is a pretty good little solution um I found myself not maybe quite as high as if they were like akarova or a Kanaka mini cookie situation but for a gummy and for how much less you have to eat then which is very important to me you have to eat a [ __ ] ton of those cookies from like all you know Pete's and Korova and Kanaka all those ones you just mentioned you have to eat like 20 of those you know many cookies to get the hundred milligrams the gummies here were a hell of a lot more manageable that 10 was no problem to eat by myself I didn't didn't feel like a gluttonous badass after consuming that whole thing at all so really really pleased with that aspect um have a cannabis taste for sure but not awful um I didn't feel like retching after eating that not even close there was a cannabis taste but it was not the primary taste and again didn't have that just incredibly bitter kind of almost you know a cynic that Pacific we've tasted no no just the taste is there but then again for as potent as these came you know turned out to be you would expect that so guys this is a a nice win I think I'm I'm pretty impressed with Plus cannabis infused gummies and then also that were to create for some reason on there as well so I'm really happy with this I think I'll be reviewing some more stuff from plus in the future and if you see these in a dispensary near you and you guys want to eat all of something to get the hundred milligrams Jesus it's it's almost easier to recommend this then which is hard to say which is hard to believe actually then like the Kanak o or the kirova because it's just such it's so much easier to do and they're they're sort of equivalently priced you don't get quite as high but it's it's it's easier to it's easier to manage for sure so really surprised me on this one guys and what the [ __ ] let's just shoot the moon here guys I'm gonna throw a cherry on top - my little cherries on top here just little things I like to add that aren't necessarily we related something you can just do to enjoy throughout your week and I'm just gonna throw this one out because I am having an ever-loving blast playing spider-man on the ps4 from insomniac holy [ __ ] guys it's so great to see insomniac get this win I assume this game it's going to be an amazingly huge hit it seems to be it's only a couple days since it's been out but reception seems to be great and it seems to be doing really well sales wise I'm so happy for insomniac I love these guys since the ps1 days back in like Spyro loved them on the ps2 days Ratchet and Clank so my favorite you know 3d action platformers ever even love the resistance franchises back on the ps3 days and then they have been one of the greatest VR developers as well and I'm a big big fan of VR so you know what [ __ ] it I'm going to this endorsement is not for spider-man which is an awesome game I am having an utter blast with it it doesn't rewrite the rules anyway it's it's not a you know changing the genre it's just a hell of a good video game you know it's not rewriting anything but it's it's wonderful I'm having a blast with it but instead this cherry on top is just for insomniac in general they make great great games they've been making great great games for like 20 years I love them as a studio I'm so happy to see them having this huge success with spider-man so insomniac you'll never see this video but great job guys really proud of you and that's gonna do it for this cherry on top and that's gonna do it for this review what a great time we had great gummies that were so good here's an extra piece of packaging we had [ __ ] spider-man and insomniac on our cherry on top woohoo this guy's has been a [ __ ] good review let's just acknowledge the fact that everything went aces this time which doesn't often happen so great job plus great job insomniac and great job weed thank you so much for watching this review it's gone way too long and I will see you

inside of these can also be used to dip your suckers into to eat by itself and if you add a lot of citric acid you can get it so sour that it's even more sour than warheads which is kind of how i like mine in this video i'm also going to be showing you guys how to infuse the sugar but if you already have infused sugar or don't need to know how to make it you can skip to six minutes in this video to get right to making the pixie sticks [Music] to make the infused sugar you're going to need half a cup of tincture and one and one quarter cup of granulated sugar start by pouring your sugar into a large dish and then pour your tincture on top and stir it all together i felt like mine was too liquidy so i added another quarter cup of sugar and then stirred that some more after i added the sugar the consistency was much better you could definitely still see the grains instead of it being mostly liquid like it was before um if you guys aren't sure about how much sugar to use if you find it's too liquidy just keep adding a few spoonfuls of sugar until you get a consistency closer to something like this then we need to evaporate all the alcohol off of this sugar so we're going to preheat our oven to the lowest temperature that it can go for me that's 170 degrees and we're going to place it into the oven leaving the oven door open and i'm also having a fan just to help with air circulation because you are having alcohol in the oven you have to be very very very careful to make sure to never close the oven door and to always have good airflow then i'm going to set the timer for about 10 minutes and every 10 or 15 minutes i'm going to come back and stir the mixture this is what mine is looking like after the first 10 minutes so i'm just going to stir it and try to kind of scrape down the sides and i'm gonna have to do this quite a few times like i said every 10 to 15 minutes just come and stir it so because i am making pixie sticks um i want to flavor my sugar so i want two different flavors so i'm just going to get another baking dish and pour part of this mixture into it and then i'm going to add a flavoring oil to each dish now we want to do this earlier in the process so we can help with the evaporation of the liquid but it doesn't really matter if you put it in the first 15 minutes the second 15 minutes or anything like that just try and put it while there's still liquid in there so that it can evaporate with the rest of the liquid then we'll just put it right back into the oven for another 10-15 minutes again we're going to have to repeat the process of in the oven for 10-15 minutes take it at a stir put it back in the oven for 10-15 minutes take it out to stir until it has returned to its original grainy sand consistency so at this point the sugar has been in the oven for about 45 minutes i think and is still a little bit too liquidy so again we're going to stir it and then put it back in the oven for a bit and continue to do this until we get a nice consistency so after about an hour and a half it was pretty much all good i did leave it sitting out um for a couple hours just to dry off any extra moisture and then here is what it looked like you can see it definitely made some clumps so we are going to break those up and each of these dishes are different flavors for me but um one is bubble gum and one is watermelon so i don't really mind if i'm using the same utensils because the flavors kind of go together but yeah so i'm just going to scrape all the sugar off the bottom of the dish and then we are going to put it in a blender to um make it nice and refined so i'm just pouring some of this sugar into my blender and we're going to try and grind it down into a finer texture unfortunately i don't know if it's because i put too much sugar that might be the problem um i it wouldn't really grind like the the blender wouldn't really get it to um like mix i don't know it just it wasn't working very well for me so i decided to use a food processor instead but i have a feeling if i did smaller amounts in the blender it probably would have worked a little bit better so using the food presser helped a ton it was coming out very very nicely you can see the texture is beautiful and i just continued to do this for all of my sugar until it was all ground down nicely i do want to mention that humidity plays a very important part in being able to make this sugar properly i luckily have air conditioning in my apartment so i set it really high so we could dry out the space as much as possible if it's too humid your sugar will clump so just try to avoid that if you can otherwise maybe just use extra sugar where i live in canada is not very humid at all so it's not something that i've really had to worry about but for those of you who do maybe you can leave some advice in the comments to help others out as well so at this point the sugar is pretty much done if you're going to use it for other purposes just store it in a airtight container um but for us we're going to be making pixie sticks so let's move on to what we need to make that our first and most important ingredient is the sugar that we just made we're also going to need some icing sugar some citric acid some kool-aid packets or some flavoring oils and some food coloring so this is 24 hours after i made the sugar and even though i did grind it down to a fine texture you can see it clumped up once again probably due to the moisture in the air i'm not sure um so we're just going to reprocess them i separated them into three bowls because i'm gonna do three separate colors and then we're going to start with the first one and place it into a food processor so i'm just pouring it in there and i'm going to grind it down first just to see how it's going to look and then we can add our other ingredients so it looks beautiful you can see it is so fine and not clumpy at all and then we're going to add our citric acid if you want to be sour just start out with um a teaspoon or so and blend it together see how it tastes and then add more as desired you can make it as sour as you like i'm also going to be adding some food coloring to mine i'm adding blue this is gel food coloring and i do have some issues using this as you will see as the video goes on at this point you can also add some kool-aid packages for your flavoring if desired i've already flavored mine with flavoring oils when i made the sugar but kool-aid packages work very well also and they have citric acid in them so if you don't have citric acid at home it'll help to get that sourness so you can see here my food coloring is not mixing at all it's just kind of clumping so i'm not sure why it's happening just yet but i have a suspicion that it's to do with lack of moisture so i'm just going to continue on with how i'd make these regularly and just see if maybe it binds so i'm just adding some icing sugar and this helps with the texture it kind of gives it like that baby bottle pop fine sugary texture that's really nice you don't need to use icing sugar um but it does help with the taste the texture and it also helps for people who live in more humid climates at this point the food coloring has still not properly mixed in so i decided it's due to the lack of moisture so i added my gel food coloring to a couple drops of water to create essentially liquid food coloring just a regular kind of kind you'd buy at a grocery store which i'm assuming most people that's what they would be using anyway so you probably shouldn't have this issue gel food coloring is just what i usually have on hand um but yeah adding a couple drops of water to the gel food coloring definitely really helped because clearly it looks very beautiful um and it mixed very nicely so i'm very happy with that now i'm just scraping the bottom to make sure everything is properly incorporated as well as adding some more citric acid so that it's extra sour and then i'm going to mix it a final time and then once that's done i'm going to pour it back into its bowl and set it aside until we have our other colors now i'm starting on my next one so same process adding the sugar adding some citric acid if you want to add your kool-aid packets you can do so now and then adding the food coloring for myself i am adding some water with my food coloring before i add it so like i said i'd let this sugar sit over 24 hours after i made it before i added um the food coloring and this whole process here today um but after i made my initial batch of sugar i did make some pink and i used my regular gel pink food coloring and i had absolutely no issues getting it to bind which is why i think it was because of the lack of water because the sugar still had a little bit of moisture in it yesterday but 24 hours from then which is now it was dried out more so that little bit of water added with the food coloring helps to restore that moisture now it looks like some of the food coloring got stuck on the bottom with the sugar so i'm just scraping it around to get everything mixed and then adding some powdered sugar the measurement is not really um well i didn't measure it i just kind of put spoonfuls into my taste but if you are looking for a measurement i would say use about half the amount of regular sugar for the powdered sugar so if you used one cup of regular sugar maybe use half a cup or less of powdered sugar but again it can be to taste or you don't even need to use powdered sugar if you don't want to [Music] now i'm just adding in a little bit of yellow food coloring just because i want to be a little bit more neon looking and then mixing it together you can see i have to scrape the bottom a little bit there um but yeah i think that the color turned out a little bit too green i kind of wanted to be more of a lighter green but that's okay anyway it still looks cool i was hoping i'd be able to lighten it by adding in some more sugar to dilute the color but it didn't really help that much and then that's done you can add in more citric acid or more sugar you can just adjust it to according to how you like it so then i'm just pouring that into its bowl and then i also have the blue one that i just made and then a pink one that i made yesterday and now it is time for the fun part which is filling up our pixie stix [Music] now we're going to prepare our pixie stick straws and we're going to seal the bottom of them using this bag sealer thing that i just bought i'm also going to show you guys later how to close them without one of these um i did just get this egg sealer thing but it works really well like look how great that straw looks um i think it was like 10 or 15 on amazon i'll post the link um but i am new to it like i literally just got it so you guys can probably see i will struggle a little bit but after the first few straws i got a hang of it better and then they were very easy to quickly seal now we're going to fill up the straws with their sour sugar powder dust whatever you call it um and i'm using this squeeze bottle to get it in there so i bought a tip that is slightly bigger than the size of my straw and i just put the straw in and hold it inside of that tip and then just shake it up and down and it comes out really nicely um the easiest way to do this would to just be buy bigger straws and then you can just use like a paper funnel to get it into the straw but if you already have these tools at home this works like the best it just it's not really worth it to go and buy it if you can just do bigger straws in a paper funnel then i just filled up all my straws using a variety of colors it was kind of annoying because i had to switch the tip every single time i did it if i want to change colors yeah just fill them up to however you like they can be all one color all different colors um and mine are flavored sour watermelon and bubble gum but they actually taste really good just with the sugar and citric acid like they don't even need flavoring okay now that all of my straws are done i'm just going to take my little sealer and close the tips of all of them now i'm going to show you guys how to seal the straws without a bake sealer so you're going to take an oven mitt or a folded dish cloth and then put a piece of tin foil on it put your hand inside of it sorry i didn't get this in the camera that well um put your hand inside of it and sort of shape it into like a little mitt like that with the dish cloth underneath to protect your hand now you're going to place the straw in your tin foil mitt hand and use a lighter to quickly light the other end then once it's lit you're going to quickly switch it over to the other side and squish it down holding it to seal it and then take it out see that looks pretty good so you definitely don't need to go and buy the sealer for this you could just use a lighter and some tinfoil and it seals very nicely the blue powder reminded me so much of baby bottle pops and it really like had that taste too i don't know i think it just because i used more powdered sugar in that one but i thought it would be really good dipped in or to dip suckers in there so i took these little bags and filled them up with some of each of the powders and then put a sucker in there these are just regular suckers because it's what i had on hand but if you really wanted to up them you could use a infused sucker and you can clearly see i'm thinking very hard about what color would go best i chose the dark one i hope that was the best color combination um i really like the way that the the red contrasts with the pink powder but yeah i think they all look adorable the green one's a little bit too green for me but i also really like all the colors mixed together so i did a mix of all the colors and then i'm just putting them into this little container because you don't need obviously those little bags to enjoy this you could also just put it into whatever you want and dip your sucker in there and i absolutely love how pretty all those colors look together once everything is done try to store it in a dry area so maybe keep them in a sealed bag or container to keep any excess moisture and they should last for quite a while i hope you guys enjoyed this video please let me know if you did and please leave a comment give us a thumbs up and subscribe thank you guys so much for watching have a wonderful day [Music]", "izWDdT2XfP4": "[Music] welcome back to the edible kenzie show i'm edible kenzie and today we'll be reviewing infused cannabis infused gummy blueberry okay so get your weed get comfy and let's get started so good so good usually on my channel i'll test out an edible about 25 milligrams which is typically my threshold and then if it's not up to snuff i'll take the rest of it but today we just have a little sampler pack well little taste here which i love i love sample packs they're always so cute and it's only 10 milligrams i haven't had any weed substances today yet so i feel like i'll be okay i feel like this might tickle my threshold if it's up to snow if it's up to snuff i got this from kushagram delivery and they were on sale it was only two dollars so you know a girl had to cop it i love it i love the little sampler pack i think it's so smart because sometimes you want to test out an edible without fully committing so i just it's so cute i'm excited the company that makes this is infused and fused makes a lot of thc and cbd infused gummies um they're also known for their inhalers but i'm not trying that today i will try that eventually i'm excited about that but today we're just trying the little sampler blueberry gummy all of their gummies are made with a thc distillate and that's how they get their edibleness okay ingredients glucose syrup sugar glucose powder food additive and then parentheses gelatin acid treated starch d sorbitol solution citric acid dl malic acid ditarteric acid blue want chc distillate artificial food flavor okay i don't know what a lot of those things are but i'm sure they're delicious okay now it's time to taste it oh in honor of the blueberry i even wore my blue sweatshirt shout out pop-up james for the sweatshirt he was also a dentist [Music] so this doesn't have like a tear open thing so i'm gonna go tear it open with some sizzles because if i use my teeth i know my pop-up's gonna be rolling over and it's great snip snap we got that i'm looking in it you see that it's got little sugar crystals on it it doesn't say oh i'm stupid it does say it says it's a sour gummy i was upset i hope it's not sweet with crystals yum i have a feeling i'm gonna like this but you know we'll see bam check that out check that out damn damn yes please and thank you ma'am okay we like that that's a beautiful blue green it looks like avatar it's like a nice squishy gummy it's a gummy that bounces back you know what i mean it's not too gelatinous oh my gosh oh my gosh i love the sour crystals on it but that's probably just citric acid right let's give this a taste okay [Music] i'm trying to keep it keep the flavor in my mouth mouth feel exquisite okay was it sour for blueberry maybe but not really maybe to a less mature palette but to me not really it was just kind of like blueberry with like the tiniest bit of tart ness was it good the texture of the gummy had the same yeah it had the same kind of texture as a trolley gummy that was good i don't usually like opt for blueberry gummies but if i would opt for one that would definitely be it you don't taste the weed i got like like like a millisecond a millisecond of weed after the fact and it wasn't like a bad weak taste and it was just like gone in a second it was a nice little sampler i kind of want another one but you know it's just a sample bag but now i'm going to i'm going to wait i'm going to shave my legs and yeah see if it kicks in once again always you know do some sort of physical activity don't take an edible and then lay out on the couch because then when you get up that edible's gonna fat hit you this said it's about a two hour activation time before you take another edible sometimes gummies take a little bit longer to kick in we're going to time it out see how long it takes to kick it if it kicks in at all we'll be right back after this length shaven break [Music] that was a cute little devil [Music] ignore the stain it's not a stain i got naira on my sweatshirt so i'm just waiting for it to wash off the legs the legs though good it's two hours after the fact i knew that i would have to think about whether i'm feeling it or not check back in with myself um after the fact because it is less than half of what i usually would take to know that an edible is true to milligram but two hours later only 10 milligrams i i can tell my body is more relaxed you know it's there it's not a dosage that is tailored for me but for somebody else at 10 milligrams is your threshold you don't feel this it did take my threshold so i will mark it as true to milligram for the gummies i thought it tasted really good blueberries not your flavor they've got an array of flavors okay you can find what's good for you i thought it was a really really good gummy i thought it was yummy if i were to pick a flavor i would probably not pick blueberry just because it's not for me okay but flavor-wise i thought it was like it was really good for a gummy it's like what you expect and it didn't have that kind of burnt weed taste that sometimes edibles do have you couldn't taste the weed at all to be honest this edible would be really good for people that don't want to taste weed i don't know how good it would be for somebody who wants to get smacked in the face by an edible because it's a very responsible dosage [Music] responsible so if you're looking for an edible with high milligram and like low amount of food this won't be for you but this is a very reasonable edible it tasted good i could see myself eating more if i needed to it wasn't too it wasn't too rich it was really good it was delicious i really i loved the packaging because it was like a little sample size you know just for people that want to try it they don't want to commit i just want to give it a little little taste it wasn't resealable but since it's a sample thing i'll let that slide i'm sure on their bigger things they're usually syllable flavor-wise i would give it one and a half out of two need leaves packaging i would give it one out of one absolutely and for trunus to mg i would definitely put two out of two so i'm reading this edible four and a half weed leaves out of five wheat leaves just because you know the flavor was there don't get me wrong the taste was great but was it like five stars you know not for me just not for me okay that's okay it would be great to get like multiple flavors as a gift it would be a great little stocking stuffer i don't know if you know how old your kids are but you know i would love to get that in my stocking mom if you're watching this but overall i give it four and a half out of five bead leaves thanks for watching my show my name is eda mckenzie and join me next time when i'll review a different edible i don't know what yet you know but it'll be something until then stay high so good so good so good even though it just very lightly tickled my threshold i probably shouldn't have done that why did i do that um", "nJt5gBwKnBI": "did you know that there's many types of edibles in this episode we're going to talk about different kinds of edibles out in the market right now [Music] today we are at sfvpc with our friendly neighborhood budvender chanel she is here to show us some edibles there's so many different ways to consume thc i'll start off with cookies they're chocolate chip they're individually wrapped so that's really awesome you can just grab one on the go there's also chocolate there's dark chocolate there's white chocolate there's chocolate caramel this is just a dark chocolate one which is really really good and the cool thing about the chocolates is they're already divided it's easy to break off a piece and know how much you should consume there's gummies just like the gummies that you would get at a grocery store or anywhere else every kind of flavor every kind of texture so if you wanted to take a smaller dose so these are really good because they're just they're 25 milligram pieces as opposed to 10 10 milligram pieces it's pretty much micro dosing yeah yeah they're really easy to do that with these ones are my favorite it's 10 milligrams a piece they come in this little cute little cup then you also have different types of drinks it's almost like a little shot it's 100 milligrams and it's like a little fruit punch shot almost there's also like lemonades that you could do so you're hot you could also get stoned while you're getting refreshed and then there's syrups which i like doing this one with frozen yogurt like you just pour it over ice cream and you're filling your sweet tooth and your munchies while you're continuing the greatness beside these kinds of edibles are there any other kinds of edible stews that you don't have at the store they're like mocktails they're thc beers and wines there's the topical sprays you spray in your mouth that are like minty or fruity flavored there's mints sublingual strips there's capsules so pretty much anything you can think of that you can cook yes you can eat you can yes you can cook with so many of them eat them put them on your tongue there's so many ways to do all of them so thank you very much chanel for showing us all these wonderful edibles and now that i know that this is your favorite we are going to try this one next thank you very much hope you learned something new today please like share and subscribe for more content about cannabis with filipino flavor thank you what's your favorite kind of edible please let us know write in the comments below do you want to know how edibles help people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease watch this episode", "nxqDA2gOybg": "let's talk about weed baby let's talk\nabout you and me let's talk about all the THC all the CBD that baby gets us high\nhi welcome back to the busy budtender I am the busy budtender the girl who\nsometimes likes to smoke weed online but also likes to educate you about cannabis\ncannabis lifestyle and how to integrate it into your world if you're interested in\nmore and learning about cannabis cannabis products in cannabis lifestyle\ndefinitely make sure to subscribe like this video hit the bell do it ever you'd\nlike to do to make sure you don't miss any of my videos without further ado\nthough let's take a look at the product that I'm actually gonna be talking about\nin today's video which I'm assuming is why you clicked it is the chowie wowie milk\nchocolate edibles as per usual with my reviews the first thing I want to look\nat is the brand and the licensed producer who actually makes the product\nthen moving into the product attributes unboxing my own tasting trying of the\nproduct itself and then finally my own recommendations and opinions so make sure\nyou stick around to the end to find out what I actually think about this product so chowie wowie the brand that we're looking\nat today who actually makes it chowie wowie is owned by a company called High\nPark which I recently spoke about in one of my videos they're based in Toronto a\nbig company that owns a lot of different brands and then above high park is of\ncourse tilray the big multinational corporation now Tilray as a licensed\nproducer my own opinion not my favorite licensed producer, not\nmy not favorite I don't really have any strong opinions on tilray yet I do\nknow that they're in multiple markets which is pretty cool cuz I'm always down\nfor bringing cannabis to more people but aside from that I really don't have any\nstrong opinions about tilray if you want to learn a little bit more about tilray\nor their brands I recently did a review about Canaca which is another one of the\nbrands that high park tilray owns which I pretty much enjoyed if you want to\ncheck out that video of course the links are gonna be wherever the heck I put\nthem so definitely check that out if you're interested\nso as for chowie wowie as a brand specifically chowie wowie exclusively does\nedibles so they don't do any dried flower no vapes but they do have two\ndifferent types of milk chocolates and some gummies today though we're gonna be\nlooking at the chowie wowie milk chocolate balance between 10 milligrams of CBD and\n10 milligrams of THC if you guys aren't familiar with the\ndifferences between THC and CBD they're pretty interesting\nyou're not like big cannabis nerds like me but THC is the stuff that makes\nyou high it's the thing that makes you uplift it it's the thing that you feel\nin your head and in your brain and does a lot of fun things for you\nCBD on the other hand is the more well on this side to the cannabis industry\nit's really good for inflammation and the really interesting thing that I\nwanted to talk about specifically with this product and CBD is that CBD is\nknown to counteract some of the effects of THC so THC sometimes can make\nyou feel anxious or paranoid or also in general just increases your heart rate\nCBD kind of like pulls the crank a little bit back which is why this\nproduct will be pretty interesting to try so in comparison with their other\nproduct which is a 10 milligram of THC exclusively I would likely expect a\nlittle bit more of an intense high rather than this one which is going to\nbe a little bit more balanced you can get the chowie wowie milk chocolate edibles\non the OCS which is Ontario's cannabis store for seven dollars and 20 cents so\nit's pretty affordable if you want to just try out some edibles it's not a\nit's seven dollars as for the packaging itself before I open this up I think\nit's pretty cute I I think chowie wowie's doing a decent job with the restrictions\nthey have with packaging in Canada that being said I don't see like a recycling\nsign on this so I'm not sure if this can be put in your curbside recycling\nprogram the alternative is I'm pretty sure that with every piece of cannabis\npackaging including stuff like this you can return it to stores that have\nrecycling programs but I'm not really quite sure about like specifically this\ntype of packaging I don't know I'm I'm a sucker for sustainability so\nit kind of sucks to buy cannabis and this kind of packaging but I'll talk a\nlittle bit more about the quantity of this product and the packaging a little\nbit later in the video anyways enough about that let's actually open this up\nand see what it looks like and smell it all right so let's get into the unboxing\non the front of the package we have our cute little chowie wowie logo milk chocolate big ass THC thing and then the total amount of THC\nand CBD which again is balanced at 10 milligrams and 10 milligrams and our big\nwarning about how it can take up to four hours to feel the full effects from\neating or drinking cannabis on the back we have our beautiful excise stamp\nwhich is the Alberta one because I'm currently in Alberta and then I actually\nreally like this on the back they wrote these balance chocolates are made with\n10 milligrams of THC and 10 milligrams of CBD per piece each piece can be\neasily split into two squares to enjoy with friends I guess friend\nwe've recommend starting with just one square then waiting to feel the effects\nbefore having more while you wait you can invent backstories for strangers try\nnot to think about capybaras watch clouds done I think that's cute\nobviously cuz it's an edible this is unfortunately not a zero calorie product\nit has 80 calories per container and then you have all of the important\nnutrition facts over here the packaged on date is late December so December\n17th so right before edibles were actually released in Canada so it's not\nto to old and of course the ingredients which it just looks like it's kind of a\nmediocre chocolate with whole milk powder and blah blah blah whatever and\non cannabis extraction of course anyways enough about that let's actually see how\ndifficult this is to open all right and then normally with these\nkind of products you can see it's like a zip a zip lock issue thing close a zip\nlock type of closure so with these I'm pretty sure you're supposed to like yeah\nOh first try baby did you guys see that oh yeah you're supposed to twist it I\ndon't let's check this puppy out cute the interesting thing that I noticed\nwhen I was unboxing this is that it doesn't say anywhere on the packaging\nwhat type of strain the extracts have come from whether it's a indica sativa\nor hybrid according to sources online this is supposed to be a hybrid strain\nso something in between which is my favorite type of strain but it's pretty\nweird they wouldn't put it on the packaging anyways aside from that when\nyou open it up firstly as for the smell I'd say it smells like 80% chocolate 20%\nweed which isn't bad at all it does have a very slight dankness to it but it's\nnot overpowering and then as you can see from the unboxing it comes in these two\ncute little squares sorry cute little rectangles that you could split it with\na friend and then the chowie wowie thing on the front let me talk a little bit about\ndosing edibles and how they're different for everybody\nof course we as we metabolize and consume alcohol differently 3 beers is\ngonna be something extremely different than 3 beers is for someone of a\ncompletely different weight and height the same thing kind of goes with\ncannabis and edibles so what everyone recommends is to start low and go slow\nso with something like this where you have 10 milligrams\nit's recommended that you take ok let me see if I can break this open it's\nrecommended that you eat one of these wait like 2 hours I'd say before you\nhave any more as for me I'm actually gonna be taking both of these because\nnumber one my tolerance is probably a little bit heavier than that of most\npeople consider I consume a lot of cannabis throughout my weekly day-to-day\netc and also because I want to show you guys what taking both of these would be\nlike whether you're someone who has a higher tolerance like me or you're just\ncurious as to what that kind of experience is and if you're a beginner\nconsumer or have a lower tolerance in general my somewhat assumption is that\nmy experience taking both of these is going to be somewhat similar to what it\nwould be like are you taking just one alright let's\ntry it out hmm it tastes like like a Hershey's\nchocolate or like any other kind of cheaper but fine chocolate and then it\nhas like that dink aftertaste II presence it's not bad like I'm not like\ndisgusted like it's fine I think I'm just a snob when it comes to food and I\nwant us to taste good the flavors not bad it's really really not bad once you\neat more you can't taste the cannabis as much as just very much chocolate so\nmaybe that helps all right bottoms up and now we wait while I'm sitting here\nfor the next two hours and waiting for my edibles to kick in so I can give you\nguys the full spectrum of opinions that I always do have I do want to talk a\nlittle bit about cannabis 2.0 and how Canada made some mistakes in my opinion\nand maybe you guys can agree with me or let me know what you think in the\ncomments down below if you guys are edibles people if you enjoy the cannabis\n2.0 products in general what you think about the rules and regulations I'd love\nto know down below specifically what I'm talking about is this package which is\nthe 10 milligrams of THC 10 milligram CBD that is the highest legal amount\nthat you can have in a cannabis package in Canada in the legal market\nspecifically what I mean is the ten milligrams of CBD and THC in an edible\nproduct is the maximum amount in a package in Canada the reason I think\nthis is kind of bullshit is not only because of course I come from a\nbackground of experiences on the black market and when you purchase black\nmarket edibles it comes in a package roughly the same size but it's gonna be\na hundred milligrams or even 200 milligrams or more that being said it\ndoesn't mean that you should take a hundred milligrams of cannabis or 200\nmilligrams of a cannabis edible unless you want to do that what it means is\nthat you have multiple gummies or multiple pieces of chocolate that are\nbroken down into 20 or 10 milligram pieces or five milligram pieces and then\nas long as you have the information that you're giving the consumer that hey\ndon't eat this whole frickin package they're gonna be okay I think it's\npretty ridiculous that the government feels like they need to babysit\nconsumers in making such tiny packages for edibles it's it's like buying one\nbeer you don't want to buy one beer want to buy a 6-pack or you want to buy\na bottle of Smirnoff and it's not like and it's not like the government\nrestricts the amount of Smirnoff because they don't trust the consumers it's that\nthere's enough education and in society to know that you're not supposed to\ndrink a bottle of Smirnoff unless you're pretty wild the same thing goes with\nedibles I personally am under the belief that\nnot only would it be more sustainable in that this type of packaging could have\nway more uses to it rather than just a single time use for someone like me\nbut in addition yeah it just doesn't make sense it does make sense to have\nsuch a small package if you want to share a bunch of beers with friends you\ndon't bring one beer and then split it into small cups you bring a six-pack in\nthe cannabis realm in Canada you can't bring a six-pack and I just I don't know\nI think that the Canadian government is really really handicapping itself with\ncannabis 2.0 I hope that things will change in the future\nbut those are just my thoughts and opinions again I love to know yours I'm\ngonna get comfy I got my switch I got my animal crossing and I can tell you guys\nupdates as they come... guys look it's me I don't wear glasses in real life but\nI thought it looked cute this is my house tell me it's not just like a chill vibe\nI like it so update number one as you can see\nKingdom Hearts is playing in the background because I'm at my parents\nhouse and I thought why not be 14 again anyway so at the 15-minute mark what I'm\nstarting to feel is I'm definitely started to feeling something in my head\nand then I'm not sure if I was just hungry or a spurt of the edibles\nmunchies kicked in but I had a couple pretzels and I'm feeling a lot better so\nstay tuned for how the rest of this goes welcome to the 30 minute ish checkpoint I\nam definitely feeling quite baked and having a really really fun time I'm\nfeeling really uplifted my heart rate is a little bit fast but it's not too bad\nyeah I'm having a really good time honestly that's pretty much it but I'm\ndefinitely feeling a very very strong high at 30 minutes which is pretty good\nbecause a lot of times with the edibles that I make it sometimes at home or have\nhad in the past it can take like an hour or longer than that to feel the effect\nso feeling under 30 minutes is quite enjoyable\nthe downside of it is I do have some dry mouth which is like fine\nand I've been a little bit hungry but other than that I think this is a really\nreally fun time hello and welcome back it has been roughly three and a half\nhours since I last sat down here specifically and was talking with you\nguys I just wanted to tell you my entire experience what I think and my star\nrating so I personally really really enjoyed it I will say if you're an early\nuser do not take two of like don't eat the whole thing because that's probably\ngonna be too much for you but for me it was like a great time I really really\nenjoyed it I thought that the high was very uplifting very fun at times I felt\nlike my heart rate was a little bit high but that just might have been me and\nthat's not necessarily because of the strain and aside from being uplifted I\nwas also feeling quite chill so like a mix between it was a hybrid essentially\nwith the CBD I do feel a very nice body relaxing\nfeeling my body feels like I just did a nice hour-long yoga session with like a\n15 minute shavasana at the end which if you don't know what that means it means\nlike taking a nap after yoga essentially so it feels like I took a nice nap but\nI'm still feeling quite uplifted with the hybrid-ness of the strain so the\npros and the cons of the chowie wowie is in my opinion the negative side is that\nfrankly I don't think there's enough of the product in here because I think that\nit's actually pretty good and then on the positive side I think that the high\nwas really enjoyable and fun especially with the THC and CBD aspects to what I\nfeel like I almost come out of here feeling better than I was before yeah\nthat's it it's a pretty solid product so what\nwould I actually pair this with if you're gonna watch something well I'm\ngonna say that because for me the high was a little bit more intense with the\nentire chocolate bar chocolate Square whatever is I would watch something that\nI've already seen before so for me that would be like as series like Gilmore\nGirls or maybe community or if you wanted\nsomething new something like haikyuu is what I would be watching right now so I\nthink that kind of chill TV show that you've already seen or maybe are okay\nwith seeing and that being said something that's still gonna be\nuplifting to encourage that part of the strain I think would be perfect\nso what star rating should I give this mmm I'd say a 3.75 am I allowed to do\nthat it's my channel to do that I'm going to give this a 3.75\nout of 5 the reason I'm gonna give it a 3.75 and\nnot four is because I'm like it's good like I really enjoyed it and like the\nprice points pretty chill but it's not like incredible and I think as of right\nnow the industry frankly only has things that are around the four star mark for\nlike their top I'm hoping that in the future in the next year or so can it'll\nbe able to push it a little bit and give us some five star products but for now\nwe're gonna aim for four stars so that's why I give this a 3.75 anyways that is\nall for me thank you guys for joining me on today's review and let me know have\nyou guys tried the chowie

Diamond delight animals my name is Liz and this is the first time you're joining and if you're a regular welcome back so today I am going to show you how to make these awesome Jolly Rancher gummies from actual Jolly Ranchers that's right so I make these with canister up you can also do them with the can of sugar if you want to know how to make those I do have videos they're made from textures there is a specific one can of sugar and then the other one for the can of syrup is can of flour powdered sugar and syrup not well show you how to make the syrup if you'd like so from the actual gummy art from Jolly Ranchers I've made these gummies and I'm going to show you just how to do that so it's usually I'm going to jump right into those ingredients and what we need to put that together and get it all put together for you so you can make these awesome candies well one thing I did I want to tell you so in the recipe I used three and a half tablespoons of unflavored gelatin I would recommend using four tablespoons of unflavored gelatin to the same three quarter cups of liquid so I I will put the correction in the ingredients in the comments I do sorry I'm they turned it a little bit softer than probably what I like so I would go with four tablespoons of the unflavored gelatin all right so now we'll jump into those ingredients and get right to her alrighty so for our Jolly Rancher gummies what we're going to need is about twenty of your preferred flavour of Jolly Ranchers so I'm going to use the blue raspberry and peeled of course take off graphics you're going to need a quarter cup of can of syrup that we're going to mix with this then for our candy syrup we are going to need one cup of white sugar regular sugar and 1/4 cup of can of syrup and a quarter cup of regular light corn syrup 1/2 a teaspoon of citric acid and a quarter cup of water for syrup then we're going to need three and sorry three and a half tablespoons to four so if you've got the packages of the gelatin you can just use the four packets they got a little bit off one you'll be good and 3/4 of a cup of water for your gelatin cold it needs to be very cold and then for our equipment we are going to need a candy thermometer a double boiler if you don't have a double boiler just use a pot where another heat safe Bowl will fit on top and that will suffice another pot for your candy syrup a couple of spatulas and then your bottles if you've got the bottles for dispensing your syrup if you don't have these guys these are great things if not you just use your eye droppers you've got those and of course your molds and that's everything we need to get started so let's jump right in and get it going alright so our very first step we want to do is bloom our gelatin so you are going to take your three and a half tablespoons and you're going to sprinkle it over your liquid you want to kind of get it all mixed around and then you're gonna get that you're gonna mix this in your gelatin into your liquid so you don't have any lumps and while you're mixing this this is a good yet to know whether your gelatin is a good strength or that it's not too old while you're mixing this it should already start to gel and while you're mixing it it should how to get turns to about the consistency of applesauce and that's how you know your gelatin is good and then we're going to just put that aside to bloom or total ready to loot till we need it now we are going to melt our our Jolly Ranchers and our corn syrup so we are going to melt our Jolly Ranchers and a quarter cup of our corn syrup all on our double boil just don't forget to put water in your bottom of your double boiler I've done it how come I plug it in hold on alright so we're gonna turn our heat on to medium medium or medium-high and we're gonna get our candy put your Jolly Ranchers into the pot mine got a little stuck in the bowl here got a lot of humidity too don't want to give it up gotcha and we're gonna put in our quarter cup of corn syrup our can of corn syrup and that eats up everything will begin to melt the Jolly Ranchers will start to melt you just want to try and get the candies covered and covered in the syrup just start getting things moving around but just going to continue to stir and this until the until your candies though the Jolly Ranchers are completely melted so it does take a while for the candies for the Jolly Ranchers to melt just be patient it does get kind of goofy and glumpy don't you can see that but just be patient it will all nose what I do is I let it sit for about a minute or so let it get heated up and then I stir it around breaking trying to break it up mush it down you just don't want to really overwork it does that just continue to do that your lumpy mess will turn into a nice syrup will see very shortly all right so now my candy start my Jolly Ranchers are all melted so you can see that a little better so we're just gonna set this off to the side for about five minutes to let that cool down before we add in our gelatin because if we add in our gelatin now it'll be too hot and it can break through gelatin that's a lot of problems that happens with with it so the next stage I'm just gonna let that cool down and we'll add in our gelatin and get that melted in and then we'll make that by the candy syrup and get it all put together so now that my syrup is cooled down it's time to add in the gelatin and I like to just do this and cut it up into smaller pieces and then we'll just plop we're all in and get that melting now you'll find if it's not melting you can turn your heat on to low put it back on the double boiler auctioneers probably enough heat from the water still from the double boiler to to melt the gelatin if it's not hot enough right still Cece was started melting because we have the cold temperature and the warm you can kind of have a separation here but once everything comes to the same temperatures and everything will mix together so you may find that your candy is kind of is starting to solidify getting a little clumpy well the gelatin is not really is not fully melting if that's the case then turn your heat on to low or just want to gently heat the reheat that up you just have to be patient with this because it is gonna take a few about five or five minutes or so for everything to come together properly you might think oh no it's not working but don't worry be patient so you're going to continue to gently stir this over the low heat until everything your Jolly Ranchers and your gelatin of all melts together in one even uniform syrup and there's nothing sticking to the bottom of the pot yeah once everything is melted together and everything's one uniform texture and color and there's nothing sticking to the bottom and now if you find here you may want to add a little bit of additional food coloring because the blue with the green it's gonna muddle that blue a little bit so if you do want that with more intense blue like your Jolly Rancher go ahead and add a little bit more blue food coloring it's just exactly what I'm gonna do here so you took the one out of much just one drop will make one to two drops at the mouth you can see the difference there with one drop me get that mixed in so that's a much nicer blue how well you can see that so I skip it too much then it's gonna I'm gonna spill it and not like we haven't seen me see me do that before so we want to see what the color is gonna look like you just drop it onto something white there and I'll just see what it looks like so I'm happy with that color goody-goody I'm just gonna set this off to the side and we'll get our candy syrup started alright so for our candy syrup part portion we're gonna pour in our 1 cup of sugar our quarter cup of cannister up our quarter cup of light corn syrup and our quarter cup of our sorry our half a teaspoon of citric acid and our quarter cup of water and we're gonna get stirred together so you just want to get it mixed together so the water and Evert the sugar in the syrups are all incorporated and then we're going to turn our heat on to medium high forever this pillar so we're going to continue to stir this until until it begins to boil then if you have any duty sugar sugar sugar sugar crystals are so acceptance I just want to scrape that off or get a pastry brush and hot water and just wash down the stop then as soon as your syrup begins to boil you're going to stop stirring and we're going to watch your candy thermometer and we're going to cook the syrup to 260 degrees Fahrenheit and that's it just the letter go now periodically don't forget about your jelly the gelatin and your candy syrup you want to go around and stir that because it we can do start to solidify around the edges if it's like to pull off too much solid once once go around and just make sure that it's all still doing good but don't worry it'll get remelted once it gets out we added into the hot candy syrup whose life my candy almost up to temperature once you hit 260 you want to remove it from your meat immediately keep the candy thermometer attached because you want to wait until the syrup comes down to about 240 before we add in our other mixture the best is that you have a stone or marble surface to put it on is the best thing it draws the heat out quickly and and it doesn't get the surface doesn't get hot at all if not just put it off to the side burner and wait until your heat comes down to 240 all right so now my temperatures come down remove your candy thermometer grab your can you stir up your gelatin and your Jolly Rancher syrup and now we're going to gently pour it into our candy pot candy syrup here it'll probably bubble up a little bit and then you want to gently mix this and and continue stirring until it's all combined and you want to try to stir it gently to incorporate as little air MIDI as little air bubbles as you can but we need to make sure everything gets stirred there we go and once you're all good with air we're gonna get this poured into our bottles or you're just gonna use your dispensers your little eye droppers so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to pour it through a little strainer this isn't necessary if you've got one great if not don't worry about it so because it gets so hot these gelatin may break a little bit you get that little bit of whiteness I can't really turn the pot that way for you but if you do you can run it through a strainer just so that doesn't get in and if not no worries it'll all kind of go up to the top I'm just gonna pour this in I don't want any left in here now one thing you can do is you can fill up if you want to know if your gelatin it's gonna set correctly is you can just set up one or two cavities in your in your candy mold put it in the fridge and it should start to solidify very fairly quickly within about five minutes or so it should start to set so you'll know if it's still really gooey and tacky then you may have difficult study let it leave it for twenty if after twenty minutes it's still not setting then the gelatin has gotten too hot or it is not it's not some notch Ellington's are all the same strength so it may not be strong enough you can remelt you can add that back into the pot and add in about another half a tablespoon more of gelatin so this way it saves you a lot of time and this has got to cool down anyway because it the bottles are too hot to handle even if I use the oven mitt you don't want to do it when it's super hot because what will happen is it'll warp your bottle and it'll screw them up so one of those will end up leaking on you so you don't want to do that so while my bottles are all that while I'm waiting for my syrup to call I threw a couple into the fridge so I'm gonna see how they're gonna set up now I wasn't setting you may find your bottles because the bubbles will start to come to the top and instead if any gelatinous broke them out White's gonna come to the top as well so what you can just do is get a little spoon and just scrape that tops kind of skin right off of there oh yeah that way it's not gonna end up into your candy and make it muddled want to have a nice clearer looking syrup all right so I did check my candies they are starting to set up nicely because the syrup is hotter it's taking them longer and I don't want to leave this get too cold so yeah so the velocity is really you just distribute it into the molds if it's still a little hot for your hands full you can use paper towels on it which is exactly what I'm gonna do cuz that's too small just hold up some paper towel to put around it I thought I don't go with the oven mitts because I find that they're heavy and clunky and that's it just disperse it into your molds and put them in the fridge for about two hours for them to fully set and I'll come back we'll pop these out to see what these bad boys looked and chase like I tasted the syrup and oh my god it's so good it tastes just like a jolly rancher now if you find that your candies don't set you put them in the fridge for two hours they come out and they're still sticky you can't get them out of the mold don't panic put them into the freezer let them freeze up for a couple of hours let me get good and frozen and then pop them out so I don't you have to do one mold at a time take them out one at a time pop them into a double boiler remelt it add another half a tablespoon to a tablespoon will be good enough bloom gelatin and that will fix that problem and the same thing if you you've gone you've made them set them up and they're just way too jelly they're very very jelly to sick you can still you remem and add in a little bit about a quarter of a cup of liquid and that should take care of that all right so I will be back when these are set and we'll pop them out and see how pretty they look all right so welcome back here so my gummies I have them sitting in the fridge just over two hours and now we're gonna take them out so as you see first it looks like they're gonna be sticky but you just got to pull around the sides and we'll start to pull away as long as they're doing that and you can pull them out you're good you're gonna slay them on your parchment paper or stand them up if you can some of your candies molds are able to stand up others won't so I bought these guys on their sides and then also when it's warm especially it's warm I only take out one or two molds at a time to take them out and leave the rest of the fridge so that they don't warm up too much if I don't have a hard time getting them out of the molds and then I'm just gonna let these little guys dry for 24 to 48 hours and they'll be good to go yeah if there is still a little bit sticky once you've dried them you can toss them in a little bit of cornstarch so you don't want to do too much usually what I'll do just coat my hands in them and then run my coat my hands and cornstarch and then just run my hands through the candy and just kind of get a very light coating on them the other thing is you could do the same thing with oil so if you want to just take some cooking water olive oil coat your hands to them rub it in and then just gently go over your candies look at a little bit of an oil that will help them to stop from sticking as well and there you've got it Jolly Rancher canna gummies look at that baby and these guys taste so good oh I tried one earlier I don't know if I'm gonna get these to drying time get them fully dried they're so good but anyway guys that's it for that tutorial I'll be back to say goodbye and yeah that's about it oh one thing is gonna tell you so if you tried taking them out of the molds and they weren't coming out they're too sticky as I said don't panic put them in the freezer let them freeze up for a couple of hours pop them out put them into a double boiler let them melt down again and then bloom a quarter or sorry a half a tablespoon of unflavored gelatin to a quarter cup of liquid blue matte add that in and that will take care of that problem recast them and you should be good that's awesome thing we working with gelatin and the either if there is a mistake you can usually fix it as long as you haven't burnt it oh and remember that this version of the recipe is just for playing gummies we are not going to sugar or citric acid these if you do they're going to melt I will do another version of the Jolly Ranchers of the sour version for you okay so don't add your sugar and citric acid to this they will melt so that is my tutorial on a can of Jolly Rancher gummies I hope you enjoyed that and if you have any questions as always please don't hesitate to put them in the comments and as I said in the beginning of the video in case you just skipped right over it use four tablespoons of gelatin versus three and a half it'll make that little bit of difference or a little bit softer than I probably would have liked but if you like a softer gummy go the screen 1/2 but if you want that more firm gummy go with the four and you'll be good to go check out that baby's its see-through ish it's got that clear candy looking it tastes just like a jolly rancher it's so good so please let me know if you give this a try I'd love to hear from you on which flavor you prefer and once again thanks so much for watching you have an awesome rest of your day [Music]", "kklrpXakawk": ">> MY NAME IS JEFF ROSSEN.

box textured with an almost rubbery field inside there is a small recyclable plastic spoon for dosing and the bottle itself the spoon that is included is helpful but somewhat useless the design is very small and geared more toward measuring powders as such the honey ends up getting trapped in the corners of the spoon this measuring spoon is beneficial to use the first two times you dose just to get an idea of what you will need after I figured out my optimal dose though I found that a standard tea spoon would easily catch the honey without any loss and I could eyeball the approximate amount based on the amount I would use and the old scoop but be warned do not take a full teaspoon on the first go this honey is very potent so be sure to pace yourself in terms of flavor there isn't much to say here as the honey tastes exactly like honey sweet and delicious with gentle clover notes I noted a mild green cannabis flavor every so often especially when this Honey was mixed into foods I found that this nectar was at its tastiest when melted into a warm herbal tea or taken orally as is I do wish butterfly effect had offered some idea as to the source of the honey there are a lot of Ohio honey farmers it would have been nice to see an organic Ohio honey used for this product medicinally this edible was recommended for relaxation euphoria and stress relief the honey takes about an hour or so to begin working but once it does you will be treated to a gentle headband effect and waves of potent euphoria as this honey reaches its peak it creates a relaxing sensation throughout the body spreading from your toes to your head in fact I found this honey to be a terrific sleep supplement used about an hour or so before bed preferably mixed in a nice bedtime tea this Honey was also recommended for its versatile dosing a patient could potentially take one scoop 5 scoops or even 10 if needed one bottle of honey equals roughly 5 days of your 90 day ohio medical marijuana overall this honey is easily one of my favorite edibles and since this bottle is cheaper than many products on the Ohio market around 70 to 80 dollars this makes butterfly effects honey a rather great option for penny-pinching medical marijuana patients not only is butterfly effects honey a great deal for an Ohio edible it's also an incredibly versatile with dosing making it a great option for newcomers as well as heavy weights and that's without mentioning this honey's potent medicinal effects which keep you relaxed well into the night and possibly into the next morning do not miss out on this one final rating 4.9 out of 5 be sure to LIKE and subscribe below or share this video on reddit or social media and don't forget to visit WWF or 2000h io for the full review of butterfly effects honey as well as other ohio medical marijuana strains and products thanks", "oONRHdBHFfY": "hey love Sistani here and today I'm going to be talking to you guys about a new company that I was recently introduced to and all about how it helped me relax more so this company is called diamond CBD and you know a CBD is and you already know what I'm about to talk about my basically CBD is a what is it it's a component that's found in green and that's the component that makes you actually relax and feel better that's than what's actually helping a lot of people with their illnesses and pains and all that stuff so this company actually just done the work to actually take the CBD out of lead and separate it and put it into different products and all of that so you can actually they have a variety of products so depending on what you prefer you can get whatever so I got this candy cuz I'm obsessed with it means like I don't know why lately I'm in love with these rainbow gummy so not even gonna lie to you guys when I first saw this company I thought it was leave like we'd have just food food and I was like don't do drugs I don't know how that's gonna work but but that company like they explained it to me and then they have a video on the front of their site that actually explains all of this so you do not make you high they don't get you high at all you're not going to be like tripping or anything like that they literally just make you relax and feel more I don't know like say you have back pain like I normally no back pain it helped with that if you have issues sleeping if you have just a problem like with anxiety whatever and you just need to be relaxed this is for you it also helps with a bunch of other things okay so you do need to be 21 to use this or to purchase this and so on the front when I got this package I actually did not review this bottom part here I just saw this and then I went straight to the back because I started reading you know the serving size and it said four pieces so I'm like eating eating and I ate three pieces right to eat my fourth and then I see on the front and it says do not exceed more than one to two pieces every six hours so I took three like I said and I'm a small person I'm only buckling and I don't weigh that much like I'm pretty small so I took that and I promise you like the rest of the day and then it was just around around like maybe four or five o'clock for the rest of the day like all the way through the night I was like I don't know I felt so tired and I don't think these are supposed to make me feel sleepy but that's just how I react to a lot of things in general like whether it's alcohol and I've never really I've never done weed so I didn't know that this is how I would react but I just got really sleepy you know supposed to get sleepy per say but and it's got really sleepy like it helps you sleep better but that means that like your body will relax it doesn't make you like sleepy it's not a sleep aid so you're supposed to be able to take these any time of day so I got really really sleepy I wanted took a nap and then just the rest of the night I was like really tired and drowsy but the next day I took the regular dose I just took one piece of candy it's like just to help me relax before bed or whatever and I didn't really feel any more tired because of it but it definitely did help with my back pain and it helped me relax so I will definitely say these work like these are like probably one of my new favorite things because it's natural one and it's just it's just a good alternative to taking pain medication all the time and all of that now I do wish the serving size is a bit more because I like eating candy but I just I just probably need to get it in another form other than candy so they told me they have it they have drops that you can put in stuff they have well so they have they have it in other foods they have they have a bunch of options you just have to go to their website and see and then you can use that to make whatever you want and put it in whatever food or you can take it directly under your tongue whatever you wanna do now these in here it says the serving like if we're going based on what the back says it says serving it's four pieces so there's about two servings in here so if we're going based on the front and there's about four to five start rings in here so I think it's that's great these cost 15 dollars that's before shipping and these cost 15 dollars this back and they have variety of products all different prices if I if you're saying like I can get like maybe five pieces out of this that's pretty good that's actually pretty good and I would definitely get this again I'm probably going to get this again because like I said I do have back issues like I'm spine and stuff and so it did actually help with that a lot I recently got a desktop computer so the flora would often work off my laptop and so I got my desktop and so a lot of times I have to use it because a storage is better and all of that I have to use it sitting at my desk and that is always been an issue for me for years and years and years because I've you know even in high school I was home-schooled and so working at home you know doing my schoolwork I'd have to sit up and then at my desk and all of that it just always been an issue because my back hurts so I prefer to work from my bed if I have to do like you know stuff on my laptop or whatever because it's more comfortable and I can prop up a pillow and all that but yeah so sitting at my desk often time really hurts my back and I don't enjoy it at all like I will do everything I can so that I don't have to work at my desk because it's not the most enjoyable for me but this definitely helps I don't know if I should be taking it every day so I'm not gonna do that but I think it's safe like to you know do it every day it's not gonna be addictive or anything like that but yeah I'm probably gonna use it again and I would suggest that you guys check them out gonna link your website in my description box this is like a really cool product that very happy I was introduced to so

[Music]", "a61vjUPxcFc": "hello senior stunt fans is the real senior stunner back at you today we're gonna be discussing powerful edibles this is non liquid mostly chocolate but let's talk about starting at the top with my WoW brownie remember edibles are to be used very carefully this in particular is some of the strongest edibles I've come in contact with the WoW brownie 500 milligrams bottom line even though it's not that big one bite and you got to put it down and wait an hour and a half two hours because I found it to be almost too strong so be careful with while brownies they're very strong mostly a sativa / hybrid on the upside there Delta which is a more traditional Delta nyan edibles this is a classic 250 milligram milk chocolate that for people it's scored into nine different pieces for people who just want to have it casually this one is much more intense for the experience usually this would be something even a beginner could eat into over here let's move on down to our pj butters assortment we have two today that we're gonna look at on the right is a traditional Belgian milk chocolate double dose with 300 milligrams that means you can take it to a movie or a concert pop it in your pocket it's real small look how small it is and it's very discreet here it is in Belgian chocolate with cappuccino flavor also PJ butter 300 milligram Sheriff with a friend please I bought this because I thought it was gonna be really exciting I'm looking forward to it this is a hive I've talked ilat Belgian chocolate flavor came a lot of different flavours what they do with this 400 milligram puppy is they score it they score at a number I think they score at 20 different pieces he bought you cut out a little piece for yourself and / - so you're in 40 milligrams apiece take two of those and you'll be very very happy let's move over to bang this is medical cannabis pretzel chocolate and this is one for one person that says double strength but for me 120 milligrams really is gonna be for me now I want to take this and go into detail the Wow 250 bar is made by the same people that make the Wow brownies and you have to be very very careful some reason I don't know what they're using on inside of their edibles because it doesn't tell me if it's distill it or cannabis oil for weed it's incredibly strong their brand let's move to something that I've experienced with I've tried the G bar before the 500 milligram buy lol edibles very tasty this is done really nicely it's a pretty package but it's also a very tasty bar because of that I purchased some 1000 milligram bars they're the same size but more potent so yesterday I attempted to take a piece of one of these were the day before oh my goodness I had a piece of one of these and I had a bite of the brownie no drink during the day and oh my god so I think what has to be said about edibles especially edibles with this type of power because these are really powerful animals is you need to go very slow and in small small pieces you're not like me don't think you are with edibles most people I've been doing edibles for a very long time if you have and you understand what I'm saying they can overwhelm you very quickly so you don't want to turn book could be a great experience and have it be a pain in the ass because you don't feel good so remember go slow but go bold or go home right this is a fine assortment of edible high potency edibles I wanted to take a look at from the real senior stoner everybody have a great day thanks taking a look", "TEwuw77fFYI": "apparently they

herbal infuse er you can save money on my favorite herbal infusion machine with the cove ruff house at the urban futurecom here's what you need to make infused lollipops you need 1 cup of granulated white sugar I have a cup of light corn syrup or a quarter cup of water and 2 to 3 tablespoons of infused tincture you can use alcohol or glycerin tinctures 2 teaspoons of flavored extract such as orange lemon mint or whatever flavor you like 6 to 8 drops of food coloring which is optional you'll also need some lollipop molds and a candy thermometer the first step is going to be to make your tincture if you don't have one already and you can use a vegetable glycerin or an alcohol tincture either way though you're going to need to deke are you for 250 degrees Fahrenheit for 25 minutes then put them in the hopper of the mighty fast if you're using that machine and then you're going to add in about a liter of 151 proof alcohol you don't want to go to the hundred ninety or any stronger with the herb oil infuser machine it will burn it up and then you choose the mighty long cycle that'll give you the right temperature so that four hours later you have a nice tincture just like this then you just need to strain it through the provided hemp cloth or whatever cheesecloth however you want to strain it out put it in a jar and then you have your your infused tincture that you can use for any kind of recipes such as this here now we're gonna proceed along now with the rest of the recipe we're gonna take our two sugars our that's both the corn syrup and the white sugar or put those into a very small saucepan I'm gonna put that over a medium to medium-high heat and just let it start melting and you also want ahead and add your water and at this point what we're doing is we're just making all this syrup turn into sort of a simple syrup and then we're gonna bring it up to a boil it won't be long all of yours Sugar's will be cooked together it'll turn real clear and start boiling and at that point you want to start monitoring the temperature make sure you have a candy different a candy thermometer that will go up to over 300 degrees because that's we're gonna do we're gonna boil this it'll take a little while but watch it very carefully because it can get hot really fast once it starts getting hot but as soon as it hits 300 degrees exactly we're gonna take that off of the heat [Music] and then that part we're gonna let it start cooling down now you're going to also monitor the cooling process because when eight hits to 250 degrees Fahrenheit that's where we want to start adding in the rest of the ingredients so I'm adding I'm using orange because I want to orange flavored lollipops here so magadh about two teaspoons of the orange flavoring then I'm also I'm heading in some yellow food coloring a little bit of red food coloring to make the orange lollipops and now I'm adding in the tincture you can use two to three tablespoons here I'm adding two I don't want to be too strong but you can add in two to three and you can evaporate it down if you want to first but it's gonna be okay but you can see now when I start mixing anything together it's still 250 degrees so it's going to start evaporating and bubbling out the remaining water for you already we're just going to continue mixing that down by hand very carefully it's still very hot until you see it'll all incorporate together and become very sort of translucent and sort of unified in color and you need to move pretty quickly here because you don't want to the candy to harden up which it does pretty quickly so you can put the lollipop sticks into the molds in advance and you won't have to be rushing through it like we did there but then we're going to pour that carefully pour the candy into the molds until you cover up the sticks of the lollipops and then after you have all your molds filled up you're gonna let that chill best in the refrigerator or freezer for one to two hours till they get fully hardened [Music] and once they're fully hardened you can pop them out of the shells really easy you can use these silicone molds that I used here they're perfect for this this recipe had filled up three of the molds that came with four in the pack but just filled up three of them came with the sticks if you like that mighty fast herbal infuser and these kind of recipes please

"[Music] uh what's up guys welcome back today we're going to do a little experiment with gummy worms and tincture so i just bought some like these are from walmart just walmart brand gummy bears or gummy worms this should work the same for gummy worms gummy bears um anything with this type of gummy texture um so we're gonna do an experiment and we're gonna soak them in tincture i don't know how long it's gonna take i don't know if it's gonna be like a few hours that we're gonna need in there or 24 hours but we're going to see how that's going to turn out all you're going to need is some gummy bears or gummy worms and some alcohol-based tincture [Music] so here i just have some gummy worms like i said they're just the walmart brand i have my tincture and then a little container that we're going to put our gummy worms into now i'll just line up the gummies trying not to overlap them too much and then i'm going to pour my tincture over them just enough tincture to cover them all or at least the most of them and then whatever tincture isn't absorbed you can just pour back into a jar and use it as you would have previously so as you guys just saw i pretty much just pour tincture over these gummy worms i did add one or two more because i was taking a thumbnail for it but that's how they look we're going to leave them uncovered and we're not going to put them in the fridge we're just going to leave them open on the counter and then i am going to check back in when i feel like these are ready so we'll see how long that's going to take and we'll see if they work out hi guys so it's been about 24 hours a little bit under and here is what the gummies look like so they don't look that much different so far but it's kind of hard to tell they might be swollen a little bit um but yeah so i'm just taking these out and i'm gonna set them out to dry and then once they're mostly dry but not completely dry we're going to cover them with some sugar of course that's optional it just because extra sugar is nice and then plus the sugar on the outside will help with that tincture flavor like as soon as your tongue touches the gummy now that they've dried so they're pretty much completely dry except for a little bit of stickiness i'm gonna cover them in sugar so i just have a little container with just plain sugar you can add citric acid if you want but if you use citric acid just please use a small small amount like one quarter teaspoon for like one cup of sugar type of thing because too much citric acid will draw out the moisture and then they'll get wet and they'll never dry so yeah so i'm just shaking those and it's kind of weird how um they're coming out not completely coated in sugar or at least that um orange one did but then this one here is only like parts of it picked up on the sugar so i'm not sure what's going on there um but here is how you want them to be sticky wise so if you put your finger on it it like kind of sticks but you can pull it off pretty easily still and that's a good consistency for it to be when you're adding sugar to it um but yeah so some of these the sugar attached properly and then some of them they didn't and i'll show you guys how we can fix that though it's not exactly the most efficient way but i mean you got to do what you got to do when you're playing around with these things i'm thinking for those spots that aren't filled with sugar i'm just going to use like a regular paintbrush i think this is just from the dollar store whatever it doesn't matter um and then i'm going to dip it into the tincture which i should have got a separate container for my tincture so the sugar wasn't going back and forth but um and then i'm just going to lightly wipe it on the areas of the gummy that didn't get any sugar attached to it and not too much you just want like a light light coat and then i just put it back into the container of sugar and shake it up and then take it out and leave it to dry and it came out very well it was all covered it just would be time consuming to have to do this for each gummy [Music] and i'm going to try one of the gummies that we're soaking so far they don't look like they've soaked up that much like they don't look much bigger than how they looked before so just doing a comparison here the ones on the parchment paper are the ones that were soaking and then this one my hand was not soaking so for size difference it looks like the soaked one may be like a millimeter bigger but i don't i don't know it doesn't really seem like it um and then with this one over here um which one is bigger the soaked one definitely looks bigger for sure but also looks skinnier and the other one looks wider so it's hard to tell i'm not sure if the gummy bears maybe just aren't all consistent or sorry the worms okay and then for this one the one on the bottom there is the not soaked one and it's significantly bigger than the soaked one so that leads me to think that the gummy worms are just kind of have some variance in size and that they didn't look like they've gotten bigger and expanded or absorbed anything so let's let's try and see how it tastes and see if we can taste the tincture you can definitely taste like the strong tincture on it right away i kind of got like weird texture on it it's like from i don't know if it's just the brand of dining rooms that i use but like kinda like slimy i don't like that well i don't not like the gummy worm i just don't like the slime it's kind of like a weird texture so far like but i don't know i feel like that you're i can only taste the tincture on the outside i don't feel like it actually soaked up anything so i'm gonna try it rinsing one off and like washing wiping it down really good with some water so that if the if it is just tincture on the outside then we'll be able to find out because if i rinse off water it should still taste like tincture on the inside right so i'm gonna go do that and i'll be right back and we'll try and see how that tastes okay so here's the gummy i just rinsed very well i taste exactly like the original gummy worm did so it does i have no taste of tincture in it at all which is proving that it didn't soak it up which is really weird because if gummies soak up alcohol to make alcoholic gummies why wouldn't it soak up tincture so i'm very shocked and i'm like wondering if i did something wrong like why didn't they soak it up i wonder if it was the brand should i try this same thing on a variety of different brands of gummies like buy a bunch of different brands of gummy bears and see which one soaks up the most would you guys be interested in me doing a video like that but yeah since um essentially they didn't soak up anything it's kind of a waste so i think a better way to be going about it is to just put some tincture on them like put them in a container and mix it up or something and then set them out to dry a little bit and then cover them with sugar i'll try that and we'll see how that works as well so here we're just gonna place some fresh gummy worms into a jar of tincture then we're just gonna close the lid and shake it up so that they all get covered in the tincture and then we will take them all out with a fork trying to be careful not to waste too much tincture um from holding them from the jar to the drying area so just kind of shake them off a little bit so there's not too much dripping and then just leave them to dry until they're just slightly sticky and depending on how much airflow you have it can take anywhere between 20 minutes to a couple of hours so once they're not wet anymore and they're just a little bit sticky you can put them in sugar you don't have to but it's nice so that you're not having that direct tincture on your tongue so i'm just shaking these up and then i'm gonna put them back out to dry but these were not dry enough when i did this so you guys are gonna see what happens so i could tell immediately as soon as i opened it you see how the sugar is almost like chunky on there i don't know if you can really see it but um so it chunks up in i kind of shook it off there but you can still see it's like the sugar crystals gather together so that's what happens when there's too much moisture and these are not going to dry so yeah they're nice and chunky um even i can try leaving them out but they probably will very likely not dry they'll just keep pulling out moisture so you guys can see this is what the sugar looks like because now it's been contaminated with moisture i guess you could say so you can see it clumped up immediately just from that little bit too much of moisture and i'm gonna get some regular sugar so you guys can see a side by side of what it should look like so there's a regular granulated sugar and then i'm gonna pour the one that had a little bit of moisture in it and you can see those clumps that it's made and how it has a less fine of the texture so just when you're making your gummies make sure that before you put your sugar on they're fully dry because this is a very common thing people their gummies get all like wet and moist and it's because your gummy was too wet when you coated it in the sugar so here's one of the gummies that was coated when it wasn't wet and just only slightly sticky and you can see the sugar looks perfect there's no wetness and it's not clumpy and then if we pull up one of the ones we just did where it was too wet you can see the sugar is starting to pull out the moisture and the whole thing is getting that wet look and i'm just gonna continue to keep doing this um in this case i'm just going to eat them like that because they're not really salvageable because rinsing them off will remove the tincture that we dip them in so you want them to be just sticky like this so they're not wet at all just only a slight stickiness we're not going to use that sugar that's been contaminated with the moisture because it's going to not give us nicer so i'm just dipping these little sticky ones into a dish of fresh sugar and then again leave them out to dry and it'll probably need about 24 hours to fully dry before you package them up overall i think the best method for trying to infuse store-bought candies is using my sour patch method um i'll post a link for it in the description box and i'll try and post one on the video as well um but yeah check this out this is a lot easier they're gonna be a lot stronger it's just an all-around better option the only difference is that you definitely need a candy that already has a sugar coating on it thank you guys so much for watching this video i hope you guys enjoyed it please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe i hope

peace [Music] you", "VWwR8qiHKbo": "time for something super with a lot of charm today on walking the candy aisle hey everyone I am Jeff and today I am excited because I am bringing you a review of charms super blow pop that's right the most popular lollipop in the world finally being reviewed here this is the super version of the blow pop so it's like think that means it's just a bigger version this is the blue razz fiber and yeah yeah so I've done a couple of lollipop reviews not not too many but a few here in there this is of course the Bubblegum filled pop of course so charms the company terms candy company 1912 out of New Jersey and they became famous really I mean they you know they did well for themselves I reviewed one of their other regular charms which are mini pop I think in the late 60s though they invented this the blow pop the bubble gum filled while a spherical lollipop and it became the best-selling lollipop in the world I wonder though like Tootsie the tootsie roll company and Tootsie actually in 1988 bought charms so Tootsie owns charms in terms of the imprint now because he may they create this day on this lollipop but tootsie roll industries but Tootsie invented the Tootsie Pop in like 1931 32 so it seems weird to me that it took from 1931 all the way until the likes 1969 for someone to say oh well let's you know you've got the technology to put something in the center of a lollipop why wouldn't why would you why would you take that long before you thought about putting gum in the center anyway that seems kind of odd to me but whatever so yeah like I said Tootsie Roll industries now owns the charms brand and and yeah that's okay though they they own they own this they bought this in 1988 and of course like I said it is the best-selling lollipop I think it's about something while up up in the world still but who knows you know it was certainly at one time the blue rads and this is a pretty big lollipop I hope I can get to the center here right what was the how many licks does it take to get to the center that's a Tootsie Pop guys not the Charms blow pop you can actually kind of almost see it right like if you look at this you can kind of see can you guys see he's sort of inside that there's like a little it's hard to tell I feel like I can kind of see through it all it's like semi-transparent that there's a glob of something in the middle hmm well the blue Raz it's obviously blue raspberry a classic flavor one day someone's gonna make real blue raspberries you know and hopefully it'll taste like candy hmm someone like um Haribo should make a blue raspberry like you know their hair bow was it hair bow the hair bow got raspberry gummies they should do that anyway it's a good flavor really good flavor mm-hmm yeah I like that a lot now I'm not convinced if I should actually try and crack this open I probably should you want to get to the gum see if I can get to this give me two seconds okay sorry guys just took a little bit to really get to the middle here but it's gonna really destroy it that's okay it was pretty tasty and I got just to the point where I was about to crack it open mm-hmm mm-hmm and there the gum there's the gum boy oh boy yeah I'm sorry guys I just can't I can't do it anymore it's not great on my teeth okay watch out for yourself hmm and there we go I was like that last part of the Turkey pop and the blow pop are you chewing off the last of the candy to discover the treat on the inside mmm so my recommendation take your time with this don't do what I did not a great plan I'd do it in the effort of like making this not up 25 minute long video the gum once you sort of chew off all the candy is pretty um mediocre I gotta say it's like somewhere between actually it's probably similar to your like bazooka bubblegum like it's like it's bubblegum here's all blue colored so but it's bubblegum but it's like it's not like high quality hubba bubba bubblicious bubble gum it's like kind of gum you get with like you know your baseball cards right says the old guy who had baseball cards with gum in them um yeah it's not like super high quality but that's not the point the point is like you've reached your goal you've reached your treasure and you've earned that gum you got there I of course cheated but you know normally get there the long way and it's not about even getting there it's the journey it's the journey that's the best part it's not even the reward guys you learn that as you as you journey through life while you eat your blow pops and whatnot but this is the kind of gum you're gonna chew for five minutes you'd be like yeah okay I've had enough but that's alright because seriously you've just had a huge bunch of candy to get to that come so for me it does the trick I gotta say even though the gum it's not great the candy is fantastic and that there's an objective and there's kind of a goal to it I find really nice so I am gonna recommend terms blow pop the super blow pop technically thrown blue razz good flavor Wow yeah and I like it just overall it's a great concept so walk in the candy aisle is gonna rate terms blow pop I'm gonna read it and read it a four out of five um you know maybe not like like a Tootsie Pop in terms of quality the Candy's good but maybe it's not like not quite as good as like a dum dum or a chupa chup but you know you're not going to go really wrong with the soup with the blow pop so give it a shot and let me know if you have as much trouble as I did getting to the center okay guys I will talk to you later oh there's

pinkish color packaging as well let's try to smell it first before trying and this is a nice creamy pink color smells nice like um double bubble gum but in a lollipop form let's try it it's got a nice good old classic old school uh bazooka slash double bubble slash uh hubba bubba gum taste like a classic tutti frutti gum got two left uh black cherry and um birthday cake flavor and that's the black cherry the packaging is nice black obviously because it's black cherry and then the good illustrations of the cherry let's open it and try it let's have a sniff first um you get a mild cherry smell

silverish waiting on top let's try it let's have a smell first before trying nice uh creamy white color get a slight hint of a frosting smell let's try it takes a while for the flavor to come through

year and a half local 12 news reporter Jeff Hirsh spent nearly a week in Denver and he shows us how one small business is getting bigger with marijuana edibles at first glance this looks like any other bakery so she's making some caramels talented and trained pastry makers like Executive Chef hope frog that works for Wolfgang Puck Las Vegas turning out treats and sweets but it is a bit different here at loves oven than it is at your typical corner Baker so this is marijuana trim that's right the secret ingredient here is actually no secret it's pot love's oven makes marijuana infused edibles so people ask me all the time how would I describe kind of the high that you get from a marijuana edible and how is that different than smoking marijuana the honor of love's oven Peggy Moore looks nothing like your stereotypical stoner this is a business venture which started with one person a few years ago and now employs thirty love's oven began after Colorado voters approved medical marijuana and the shop made about fifty thousand dollars a year but when recreational pot stores were allowed in 2014 love's oven got a whole lot of love from consumers last year we grossed one six million dollars we expect to double that this year they make a dozen different bakery products here at love's oven they have a gluten free product for example and they're going to go with a vegan product also but like most other bakeries anywhere else the most popular items are brownies and chocolate chip cookies here's a container of chocolate chip cookies but it also says cheezy Skywalker which is the strain of marijuana infused into these particular cookies Colorado requires recreational marijuana edibles to have no more than ten milligrams of THC the stuff which gets people high per piece-- or per cookie ER for brownie this is about 4,800 milligrams of THC and we'll cut them into 480 pieces there is worried in Colorado that children being children youngsters could gobble down a cookie or two or three with potentially disastrous results it's not just little kids I mean there's certainly a concern about what happens if the cookie gets out of the package because they do look like so the packages here have seals to show if there's been tampering their child resistant tough to open and the individual products inside are also sealed and have warning labels love's oven sells to retailers who then sell the baked good to the public average price between 20 and 35 dollars for a package of 10 cookies or other items but do not try to get any of this love shipped out of

another video today we're gonna be going into a little bit of a life story and as you can tell from the title above or below depending on where you guys are watching this we're gonna be talking about the first time I ate an edible it was at school and I gave all of my friends a weed sucker so this starts back in the day of good ol I think sophomore year and actually it might have been freshman year it's been a while but yeah this was actually an old story on my old channel but anyways guys it was back in high school and I had just got back from a New York trip with my choir for those of you who don't know I am a choir kid I love to sing I was a tenor 1 I could hit some no Alto 2 notes but yeah I just got back from going to New York and I had a little bit of money on me and all the while I had been talking to this girl for about two months and you know we'd been talking back and forth she put me in her phone as a panda with lollipops next to her name next to my name and so I had this like really good idea to you know kind of like finalize things with you know asking her to be my girlfriend so what I like to do is on my trip to New York in New York I was sending her pictures of all this cool stuff I was saying I sent her a picture of a cute little panda I said hey look it's me she said all that thing's so cute I wish I had it so I bought it for her and right as I got back from New York my homie who was also the plug had some weed lollipops some really nice edibles so I got the idea to combine the two to you know you know break the question to her so I got the weed lollipops and I got the panda bear and I was going to give them to her and we were going to you know become boyfriend and girlfriend it was like some it was so cheesy and like kind of like I was anxious I was so nervous like I had never like done something like that for a girl at the time so you can imagine how I was feeling but lo and behold she said yes we dated for like a year after that it was amazing I shout outs to her but yeah during that time at the school when I passed out the sucker to her I had bought me for one for myself one for her at the time but yeah we were all chowing down on them during lunch and when we got back I almost got caught so what had ended up happening was I ate the entire sucker during lunch and it was kicking in so I wanna be holding my breath smell to kinda you know dank so somebody had commented about that on English class you know a little bit here and there rumors were spreading already my name wasn't really singled out they went through a couple of people that they suspected were stoners but luckily at the time I didn't really look like a STONER I looked like a preppy kid like I used to have a pompadour I didn't have long hair I just had a little bit of hair I'll comb it up and back and I look like a preppy kid I always wore button-up shirts skinny jeans and bands like they didn't really know but when it was my turn to be investigated we are pretty much just came to the conclusion that I was because my English teacher said that I was really enthusiastic and super energetic very like so when I come into your class feeling really good and you know really ready to learn and you know I'm really here and I'm really invoke a-- stand invested you want to call me out on it and say it's a bad thing so when I pointed it out like that she was like okay are you sure you just seem a little bit too like ready like it just seems a little out of place and I was like yes I'm sure I'm perfectly fine and I'm not gonna cause any interruptions I'm I'm perfectly fine shoutouts to Miss doke I'll never forget you but uh yeah she was a really cool teacher and she kind of let me slide back in high school people just let me slide like it was like I it was like they knew something was up because I have a bunch of stories about going to school [ __ ] Oh like they knew what was up and like they knew me as the person sober so like they could tell that there wasn't really big as a difference like in terms of attentiveness and stuff like that so most of the time people were just like not [ __ ] with me as long as I turned in my work like it was chill like very fortunate to go to a high school like badly you know guys after that I got out of class so I my homie cash that I had given a sucker to and we just started dying laughing it was one of those moments where you know when you're so high that everything is super [ __ ] funny those are the best moments like I swear this way but yeah like we just started dying laughing in the hallway and we're like bro I thought it was a placebo I thought this [ __ ] wasn't working my dogs and we were just like Dawg this [ __ ] is nice like I was like I kept saying like who would have thought that we could really just you know get you high by eating it like that's actually amazing to me you don't have to combust plant matter you don't have to vaporize it in your lungs you don't have to do none of that none of it that's really crazy like it's such a good medicine and that's to everybody that checked out this video because you thought the weed suckers we're gonna be

"it's time for some charm today on walking the candy aisle hey guys Jeff here with another quick lollipop review for you today I have charms mini sweet pops and this is a maybe a more interesting lollipop than you might just expect at first glance here the charms company of course we should know you should know them well because they are the company behind blow pop of course but they started out the terms candy company in 1912 well they were actually called the tropical charms company but that's sort of neither here nor there they shortened into terms making hard candies there were that one of the first companies to make hard candies wrapped in cellophane and then in World War one they're popular flat lollipop they didn't have round lollipops or spherical lollipops for quite a while actually but they're flat lollipops they sent them out to the to the troops yeah and after after World War two they became instituted or sorry during World War two the flat lollipops charms sweet pops became became a part of like a field ration pack for the soldiers you know quick shot of sugar and and you know restore some of that vitality and energy that you need so and I'm not sure exactly where the spherical sweet pop came in because most sweet pops you get are are the flat ones those are sort of the traditional ones but some time or other they invented this I know in this late sixties they meant to the blow pop which was the first which was the first bubblegum Center in a in lollipop and that quickly became their like their huge huge celery they actually became the best-selling lollipop in the world the blow pop was and then in the moving to jumping forward into the 80s late 80s 80 1988 the charms company was bought by Tootsie so Tootsie owning both cookie pops and the blow pop became the biggest lollipop manufacturer in the world so this is a Tootsie product this is charms mini pops as I said and it's the fruit punch blast flavor Oh artificially flavored fruit punch blast okay sure there we go nice it's like a rich red coloring on it huh yeah I'm excited to try this this comes in the the mini sweet pops this this sort of spherical sweet pop comes in about eleven different flavors eleven twelve flavors I think it is and yeah it's a pretty sort of standard lollipop that you're gonna see you around let me get a try here mmm it's good it's good flavor um I don't you can see there's some real scoring on the pop here and below I don't know if I'm so keen on that in general I mean it's nothing that like you couldn't make with your you know a couple of teeth marks ours are eating a lollipop but something about the manufacturing process when it's done right and you have just a perfectly spherical or perfectly shaped hard candy the way it's supposed to be right like you know that's all you're doing is making a hard candy like I get a little turned off when you when when the manufacturing process goes wrong you know like who wants a big like to gouge out of their you know hard candy would you eat a Jolly Rancher if it was well yeah I'm sure you would still look but you know what I mean like this is what you do let's do it right is that too critical maybe it is maybe it doesn't really matter what's in your mouth it's in your mouth I like this it's a good size it's not too big I do find that there are times when sometimes you get lollipops that are just just too big just certainly a good size the fruit punch flavor is pretty good maybe could be a little bit stronger but I certainly taste cherry and is it raspberry let's to say here on them what's it what's this a picture of that looks like a raspberry right strawberry raspberry said a banana hmm I thought that was cherry maybe no maybe it's strawberry raspberry banana anyhow it does taste like a fruit punch that's the key I really like the coloring on this nice rich red that's good hmm there's a good treat good snack I definitely recommend the charms mini sweet pops worth picking up worth trying if you're looking for a lollipop I don't know there's gonna go to wrong lollipops that are not good I know there's a lot of them but they don't stay on the market right they come and then they go if it's not good chocolate bars are sometimes bigger products can stick around for a live like longer where they hope it'll turn around but lollipops I think they're so quick to make that a company will produce it put it on the shelf if it sells it sells but really like there's only a couple big names in the lollipop market in a lollipop game today and Tutsi are are the biggest for sure so sweet puffs are dig'em Walken akkanee I was gonna give charms mini sweet pop terms mini pop this just says mini pop here it is this it is part of the sweet pops line though gonna give charms mini pop I'm gonna give it a strong three out of five um it could be a four but probably depends on what flavor you're getting anyway that's my take you guys let me know what you think in the comments below click the links to subscribe stay tuned tomorrow gonna have another lollipop review up and I will talk to you guys later have a good one bye bye", "5OFj2UuZV8I": "what's up

what you need to know in order to enjoy legal THC infused food [Music] cannabis or hash can be added to almost any food or drink including baked goods like brownies and cookies chocolates candies and gummies granola mints and juices finding the right dose is essential to having a positive experience with edibles we recommend starting with no more than 5 milligrams of THC for new users if five milligrams doesn't result in noticeable effects slowly increase your dose onset time for edibles can be two hours or even more the most common rookie mistake involves eating an edible waiting just 30 minutes becoming impatient and eating more resulting in overconsumption in an unpleasant experience make sure you go slow and wait for at least two hours to feel effects before eating any more cannabis infused food never drive or operate machinery after consuming edible cannabis make sure you have a designated driver or use a rideshare service don't mix edible cannabis with alcoholic drinks eating edibles along with alcohol can make you feel very disorientated responsible adults must take action to protect kids and pets from gaining access to cannabis products lockup edibles to prevent underage kids from experimenting with these substances with some common sense education any responsible adult can enjoy cannabis infused foods remember go low and slow start with a low dose and wait 2 hours and you'll have an enjoyable edibles experience every time [Music]", "bwbZTN4fMGM": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today i'll be showing you how to infuse starbursts so delicious and surprisingly was one of the easiest edibles i've ever made and i feel like i'm going to make these many times in the future they turned out so well [Music] to make these starbursts here's what you're going to need some starburst candy i wish i could have had the all pink kind but we don't sell them in canada so i just got the original infuse coconut oil and optionally you can also use a concentrate or extract to make them extra strong and some lecithin to help with absorption first i have the top part of my double boiler and then i'm going to peel the wrapper off of some starbursts and place them in the bowl i use 30 pieces here but the amount you use doesn't matter too much the recipe is very forgiving then you're gonna heat up a pot to a light boil and place your double boiler container thing on top and then using the spatula you're going to use to mix everything together add a scoop of some lecithin and then mix that in they do take quite a while to melt so just keep an eye on them and for the first five minutes or so they probably won't melt that much so you can pretty much just leave them be but then after five minutes when they start to melt like this um just keep stirring them and watching them until they melt all the way down then once everything is pretty much melted like this we can add our coconut oil so i'm going to be adding one tablespoon of coconut oil but you can add for this amount of starburst up to three tablespoons of coconut oil and to make it stronger i'm also going to be adding some concentrate now we just have to mix everything together so i'm having some trouble getting the starburst and the oil to emulsify together you can see um the oil kind of just doesn't really blend into it at all so i'm going to grab a whisk and see if that'll help us emulsify a little bit better so using the whisk aggressively actually turned out very well everything mixed together and it worked better than i expected honestly now i'm just going to put my starburst mixture onto a baking pan that is covered in waxed paper and then i'm just going to place another sheet of wax paper on top and kind of roll it and shape it out to the thickness i want in the end i feel like i wish i would have made it a little bit thicker so it would have been the exact same thickness of actual starburst but next time i'll do that i guess and then i just use this sharp utensil to kind of just shape it so i could have nice corner edges and then i placed it in the fridge now while i'm waiting for it to cool in the fridge i'm going to heat up my double boiler again because um i don't want to waste any of the starburst and the coconut oil mixture that's left in the pot so i'm going to make a little drink out of it so i have a whole video on how to do this and to be honest that video is going to give you a much tastier result than this one because this is just like a little makeshift one i did and i'll post the link of how to make that drink below pretty much you're just going to add some water and heat it up so you can get all the mixture combined and then you're going to add a drink mix to it and then cool it and serve it over ice but check out the video i have on how to make an infused starburst drink because it's like literally one of the most delicious drinks i've ever had and you can put quite a bit of coconut oil in there and you can't taste it which is very surprising considering how much i put in it okay so now that our drink is made and our starburst has cooled down a bit i actually left mine in the fridge a little bit too long it was about a half an hour and i felt like it was a little bit too hard for me to cut easily so i just took it out of the fridge for five ten minutes until it was ready to be cut so i'm just going to start by cutting these little edges on the side which i'll probably just snap on while i'm cutting and then i'm going to cut all of these into squares after i cut them i realized that i feel like the size was not accurate to the size of a starburst so when i make these next time i'm going to actually place a starburst on there and measure it out now they're all done so i'm just going to throw them into their little container and that's it they are ready to eat [Music] these turned out so well i'm so so happy with them this is probably going to be my go-to instead of gummies now they just just everything is amazing thank you guys so much for watching i hope you enjoyed this video if you did please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe thanks so much guys have a

But not all pot is going up in smoke. Welcome to the brand whole new world of cannabis-infused\nfoods and drinks--edibles. Medical marijuana dispensaries, like the Have\na Heart Collective in Seattle\u2019s U District, have been serving them up for years to patients. Cupcakes, chews, candies, sodas, and of course\nthe candy bar. Quiwaan Little: This is the Evergreen Herbal\nchocolate bar. They come in an array of flavors. This one right here is the dark chocolate\npopping candy Marco Hoffman: We\u2019re talking about 300-400\npercent increase in sales overnight. Marc Hoffman, owner of Evergreen Herbal. Hegg: Across town, Marco Hoffman\u2019s company\nacross town in Sodo, Marco Hoffman\u2018s company, Evergreen Herbal, is converting a medical\nmarijuana processing facility to make goodies for the recreational market. The two operations have to be completely separate. Hoffman: This is our Strawberry Quencher,\nits strawberry lemonade. These are our 65mg bars. We\u2019ve got green tea, sleepy time tea, black\ntea and chai tea. A wonderful accompanying product is our honey\nstick. We can basically put cannabis in just about\nany product. The possibilities are endless. Hegg: But eating pot is a completely different\nexperience than smoking it. Mary White: You\u2019ve got to know actually\nmore about edibles than you need to know just about pot. Hegg: Mary White grows pot for medicinal use,\nmakes her own edibles, and gives classes on how to cook deliciously with marijuana. Mary White, a medical cannabis user and cook,\ninspects her personal plants with producer Stephen Hegg. White: The thing about eating pot, of course,\nis that you have to wait at least a half an hour or forty-five minutes, and if you don\u2019t,\nthat\u2019s when people eat too much. You eat a cookie and go \u2018oh I don\u2019t feel\nanything\u2019 and you eat another one and an hour later you\u2019re sucking your thumb in\na corner. If you are thinking about using cannabis in\nan edible form you have to really ask questions. Hegg: Questions the state liquor control board\nis trying to answer with regulations, Rick Garza: It\u2019s important than anyone who\nis an adult user understand the product that they\u2019re consuming, and then I think a real\nconcern for us is keeping it out of the hands of children. Hegg: It\u2019s a new world of product safety. Garza: What does it look like, what should\nthe serving sizes be, what should the concentrations be, how much THC should you allow be in a\nserving size, in a product? Hegg: The liquor control board started with\ndosage--controlling levels of THC-- tetrahydrocannabinol-- marijuana\u2019s main psychoactive ingredient. The levels are tested and reported, from raw\nproduct through the different stages of oil extraction, and product infusion. Washington\u2019s rules limit any one product\nto a THC maximum of 100 mg. Solid edibles, like candy bars, must be sectioned\ninto pieces containing no more than 10mg. Marijuana infused chocolate bars, from Evergreen\nHerbal, labelled with 65mg of THC. Hoffman: Holding a chocolate bar that has\n100mg of THC is the equivalent of holding a fifth of whiskey. You would not consume it all at once. It would be insanity. Tim Moxey: I think there\u2019s a degree of responsibility\nthat the consumer has to take on about having some awareness as to what would be too much. And passing that onto the consumer is helpful\nadvice. It is education. And if you know what 10mg is, 10mg should\nbe okay for a lot of people. Hegg: English entrepreneur Tim Moxey moved\nto Seattle with his young family to start a cannabis bakery business. Moxey sees huge potential in single low dose\nservings. Moxey: Small cookies or brownie bites that\nare low in THC dose, so for about 4mg up to 10. Then experience would be similar to a glass\nand a half of wine. Cherylynne Crowther: We really are opening\na brand new world. We have to be really careful and recognize\nthis is a drug packaged in a sweet. Hegg: And the enticing world of edibles is\nnot one Cherylynne Crowther is ready for. She\u2019s a mom and a volunteer with a community\ncoalition addressing underage substance abuse. Crowther: The more access adults have, the\nmore access kids have. Seattle Public Schools are for the first time\nseeing edibles that they\u2019re confiscating them, and they\u2019re in the form of highly\ndesirable to kids. Hegg: That\u2019s the liquor board\u2019s other\nmajor concern as it regulates products and labeling. Garza: As it relates to edibles, nothing can\nbe especially appealing to children. Nothing with cartoons, nothing with toys,\nnothing that depicts children. Hegg: Banned are any \u201ccute\u201d products\u2014gummy\nbears, jelly beans or product knock- offs. Hoffman: The edible market, in general, or\nI-502 actually, is one of the most regulated industries in the country, so it\u2019s going\nto be a safe, you\u2019re going to have safe product line, you\u2019re going to have consistency\nin the products, you\u2019re going to have people who really know what they\u2019re doing. So I think it\u2019s going to be a very well-received\nby the end user, absolutely.", "2MAQJidqxFA": "what's up everybody welcome to the channel today we're gonna be making cannabis pills using Keef

these is ten milligrams and there's ten of them in there so each one of these right here is ten milligrams so I'm gonna go ahead and give those a try I'm gonna pause the video wait till I start feeling the effects and then I'll start the video back up again and we'll see where we go from there are these it's been about 20 minutes and yeah they're pretty effective you can feel it right off the bat I'm sure as time goes on as time progresses they get stronger and stronger but about 20-25 minutes in boom you can definitely feel that they're definitely there it's you know I mean it's definitely very very very effective no indica I don't know how you're going to feel the difference between indica and sativa when you're eating when you're eating edibles I don't know because it affects your body so much I don't know how you would be able to feel the difference between an indica and a sativa but these are in different shoes so yeah I don't know you know I'll be able to tell but um yeah these are pretty effective the price point for these ten of these gummies which equals a little over a hundred milligrams cost $17 they were on special for $17 I think they were normally like $19 or $18 so they weren't special for $70 I think it's well worth it for seventeen dollars you get blasted out in your brain basically 100 milligrams is pretty good thousand milligrams is insane

eating a marijuana cookie in Denver last year 7 News reporter Jennifer Kowalewski talked to the report to author in djenne the CDC is hoping this report will serve as an example for other states when it comes to edibles and the tragic death of a college student did spark change specifically with how edible products are packaged and labeled take a look you can see they're now required to be in childproof containers like this one they also have to have warnings for how long it can take these edible products to kick in cookies colorful drinks and candy marijuana edibles come in all shapes and sizes I think it's important that CDC get into the medical literature and now for the first time the CDC is warning about the dangers of consuming too many edibles it's an incredibly sad case we want folks to learn from that so we don't have cases of overconsumption going forward Jessica Hancock Allen published the new report it focuses on a tragic case from 2014 19 year old levy Tomba jumped to his death at a Denver Holiday Inn after consuming an entire marijuana cookie a college student on spring break he ate a cookie with six servings in 65 milligrams of THC in less than an hour this was the first marijuana related death that we know about in Colorado after it was legalized in 2012 the report says a clerk did tell Tomba to break the cookie up into six he ate a small piece first and consumed the rest if they're not feeling the effects right away a common problem with edibles you eat marijuana it kicks in anywhere between two to four hours as opposed to smoking that can be within minutes and recreational first became legal you could buy cookies like this one that have 65 milligrams of THC this is the exact same dosage that the 19 year old was able to purchase now you can't buy a cookie this strong you can only buy single servings like this one that have 10 milligrams of THC that's a very important difference from what we saw last year his death led to new packaging and labeling requirements for edibles changes the CDC hopes other states can now learn from other states who have legalized marijuana's looking to Colorado as a guide now this is a the first time that a government agency has published a report about a marijuana related death in a medical journal live in the newsroom Jennifer Kowalewski Seven News", "1l5Zadm1MHE": "what we can tell you is that this twelve-year-old kid is now charged with seven felonies felonies that only 12 years old and if they find a person gave the kid the gummies well that person is gonna be an even bigger trouble than the kid himself here's the bottom line investigators say the boy handed out the gummies this morning during gym class he told detectives he didn't eat any himself but at least five other kids did as a matter of fact they ate more than the recommended amount school officials figured out something was wrong when the kids became nauseated and dizzy and one almost collapsed they were taken to the hospital but we understand they're all going to be ok you can buy these gummies online from California where they're legal for adults but they are illegal here in the state of Florida I don't know that he bought it online he's told us at least two different stories of how he came to possess it and we are working through that now so let's think about this for just one minute you can order drug laced gummies drugs over the internet now so if you can order them that means your kids can order them if you order them and get caught in the state of Florida you're gonna be prosecuted if a kid orders it and he or she gets caught you just saw what happened here that kid is gonna be prosecuted as well so that's really kind of a warning tale for all of us mark kids who are s reporting for scan

and again they did said the day how they I don't know they always say there's probably bad thing about living in the small town you do get a lot of stuff that is just kind of fancy name thrown on it and how we get our stuff from the bay when in reality they get right here in this area and they don't want to it's it's dumb but it's a justify 60 and 8 type stuff so anyways this is a group called candy care this is stuff was called sweet and sour this is 400 milligram these are gummy bears are not gummy bears but it's like you know like the sour patch kids that when I was a kid when my grandma or one of them I get a quarter or whatever I know I'm probably showing my age but why not get a quarter I'd run down to the penny candy store and to pick up sour patch kids or sweetest fish or you know that cost if I select the dots you know the ones that came on the piece of paper she could rip off that kind of stuff anyways this right here these DS of this little off they got the leg game warning on them but in the back it gives you the main ingredients so the way the ingredients work is the most ingredient that's in it is supposed to be number one ingredient so the number one ingredient is to sugar invert sugar which you know I'll look that up in my next review I'll explain it what that even is corn syrup which is well not good for you but high fructose is worse so this is the third ingredient so but probably to keep the sweetness in it and then the next is cannabis extract my friend corns probably tartaric acid citric acid by the natural and artificial flavoring yelling number six red number 14 number five number one so this is supposed to contain about 10 to 12 milligrams per candy and I was okay so I the most I've ever ate of these is five and it was a very good relaxing a few hours well if I probably ate more I couldn't even got more medicinal up I'm sure of course duh but as far as again as far as taste goes these are very sour which is awesome there's been a couple ones I've gotten in from larger companies who this this sour was there so much so that's why show you looking get it real close you could see it's got those crystals all over it so I'm sure that's why the sugar and the invert sugar if sure that's probably what the invert sugars but very sweet very sour and they also have you can vary in certain pieces you can really really taste the cannabis enema so this is for sure something that I've wanted to pass along if you're a cup if you can by chance get these than I would for sure get these because the medicinal effect is pretty good

different methods of ingestion or uptake or effect whatever you're comfortable with chances are we've got it for our first edible I want to talk about gummies gummies are the most popular edible and we've got the kiva camino gummies today they're cannabis infused gummies but they also add terpenes which is unique that gives it more of a indica or sativa feel just really nice tasting Class E gummies these are wild berry it got a pineapple habanero flavor a blend I'm apricot and my personal favorite the sparkling pear Prosecco next we've got sublingual strips sublingual strips are a small tab that you put in your mouth and let dissolve on your tongue you may know cookies and brownies as your typical ingestion method but what's unique about these is that those other edibles take up to two hours to take effect whereas sublingual effects you can start feeling it in 15 to 40 minutes you don't run into that this isn't hitting it's been an hour and nothing's working I'm gonna slam some more and then two hours it all hits and you're done and finally we've got tea now cannabis and tea have been a match made in heaven since time immemorial I find that this slightly caffeinated green tea is a really nice chill but focused way of ingestion it's absorbed through the stomach so this is another faster method than digestion and what I find with tea is that as you sip it it comes on in sips as opposed to like a boom there are different types of tea this is a caffeinated green tea there's non-caffeinated herbal tea this has a little blend of CBD as well really nice for chilling out

its brothers once I get it open that is just a second here and as I said I've reviewed the other two I reviewed and found them just to be really surprisingly good both in terms of taste and in terms of potency so I've got lofty expectations for this guy here even loftier pike ah there we go got it open here's our second layer of packaging here cut through this bad boy maybe there's a little tear and like all the others it is put into four little triangular pieces for easy consumption with a little 60 marker on there letting you know it's 60 milligrams of THC let's go and popper in our mouth

kiva espresso the key Vitara espresso beans both excellent tasting products now the most important part though guys is how is this gonna make me feel and for that it's gonna take about two to three hours as I said and I will let you know for sure thank you so much for watching I'll see you in just a bit [Music] all right guys it's been oh let's see two hours and 40 minutes for so since I last checked in with you I have had the whole delta-9 edibles espresso crunch and I gotta say I'm just as impressed with it as I am the other two these two hours and 40 plus minutes later still feeling pleasantly high for a 240 milligrams at a bowl and that's after being burped shell-shocked by the movie dunkirk if any movie could knock a high out of you it's that one and there were times where I wish I might have been a little bit higher or maybe a little less high or maybe in a different movie or maybe just at home or maybe on a different planet or maybe not a human being altogether but I totally recommend delta-9 espresso crunch and I think I recommend Dunkirk so that's gonna do it for this review here on weeks guys thank you so much for watching and we will check you out on the next

haven't had a cigarette for like three days if I really start craving I got this CBD sucker I've been smoking off of this thing like kind of crazy I'm using what is this the cheap [ __ ] 1.2% nicotine it's ten milliliters of that crappiness cherry lime it's kind of gross well whatever that's like the bargain-basement stuff you know what I'm saying like three of these for $10 kind of grab bags type [ __ ] they're trying to get out the door cuz nobody wants it that's the kind of paper to use I'm buying but anyways yeah it's been like three or three days of four days and I haven't had a cigarette so you're still there's still like three cigarettes in my ashtray though so I'm gonna empty those out right now cause no more cigarettes almost there", "1iIENII-lVo": "everyone is talking about CBD and THC which are two important chemicals found in marijuana with marijuana legalization becoming mainstream what is the actual difference between CBD and THC inside you right now there's a biological pathway at work called the endocannabinoid system that helps regulate your mood appetite memory and pain sensation THC and CBD though hijack this system this is the chemical structure of THC also known as tetrahydrocannabinol if you are feeling fancy and this is the chemical structure of CBD also known as cannabidiol what you may notice is that their chemical structures seem almost identical they have the same molecular formula which is C 21 H 3002 and both of their masses clocking at 314 grams per mole but there is one extremely important structural difference where THC contains a cyclic ring CBD contains a hydroxyl group and this difference in biochemistry actually controls whether or not you feel high in order to fully understand why you need to first know about the cb1 receptor in your unstoned to sober body your cb1 receptor is affected by a neurotransmitter called an and amide which controls generation of pleasure motivation and feeding behavior in your unstoned body and manda mine is released after exercising and it's what causes a runner's high THC structure is so similar to Ananda mine that it fits in perfectly to the cb1 receptor therefore causing you to feel high CBD on the other hand because of the hydroxyl group is different in shape and does not fit into the cb1 receptor therefore it doesn't make you feel high but CBD does bind to other receptors in your cannabinoid system affecting you in other ways a lot of excitement came around a 2011 study where a few dozen people with social anxiety disorder were asked to speak in front of a large audience some were given CBD some were given a placebo those who were given CBD reported significantly less anxiety there are also many animal studies showing CBDs anti-anxiety and anti-inflammatory properties which can explain why some people say it helps with their anxiety and with chronic pain research is also discovering that THC can actually a head Grove eight psychotic symptoms while CBD on the other hand may help with psychosis so what happens when you consume them at the same time one study found that due to CBDs biochemical shape it can actually bind to the cb1 receptor and turn it off in a binding pattern known to biologists as allosteric inhibition this means that CBD actually makes the THC unable to bind as well and therefore decreases how high you feel if you vaporize marijuana with 25% THC and 0.1% CBD you will feel high as the THC is going to bind to the cb1 receptor with little interference from CBD if you consume marijuana with 25% THC and 12% CBD this more CBD will inhibit the THC from binding to the cb1 receptor decreasing th DS effect and leading you to being less high where marijuana is legally sold likely they will indicate what percentage of THC and CBD is in the product you are choosing which will help you to understand the effects that will have on your body in the end THC is a chemical found in marijuana with a chemical structure that makes you feel high CBD is a chemical found in marijuana with a different chemical structure that doesn't make you feel high but it can affect your body in other less obvious ways there is still conflicting research and a lot more to understand about both chemicals with more states and countries legalizing marijuana hopefully increased research can uncover more details about how these two chemicals affect us because weed is now legal in Canada we created a new series called stoned science where we make comedians get high and try to explain complex science concepts our first episode is about the respiratory system so click here to watch it and let us know what you think as we continue to evolve this new idea", "pRUcYVvUkBY": "hello stoners and stoners welcome back to stone alone today we're going to be talking about some [ __ ] today we're doing a strain review on a blackberry kush so i picked up some of those humboldt farms this still wasn't cheap but in california i would say this is on the more affordable end of things before you know there was top shelf but now there's exotic shell [ __ ] it's just getting crazier and more and more expensive with delivery and everything came out to be about 60 dollars this is in indica i gotta say the nose on this the smell was amazing in the bag it lingering out you know i would say this is a blackberry smell but i don't think blackberries smell very much you know like i've seen them in the wild and this is a very kiefy flower like i said i only have crumbs left but it's a [ __ ] on a keefe so i'm gonna blaze that up real quick [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] very much this uh this tasty taste maybe i should search up this strain so lethally says herbal peppery and citrus pain management thanks to its body high effects it's a combination combination of afghani and blackberry nice it says it has a hashy jet fuel taste and aroma that is balanced by sweet berries nice nice nice relaxed happy sleepy euphoric and hungry i will agree that uh i got this hungry feeling from it i'm still feeling a little cerebral high i'm feeling a little goodness up there but it's not making my mind a race i'd say very good balance definitely been getting very high off it it's crazy seeing this level of weed again seeing just the [ __ ] ton of trichomes that is on here it's completely keefed up so many little pestles all right listen we gotta pay the bud tender so we got a sponsored segment the ganja berries wait a sec seriously thank you to ganja berry because otherwise i would not have been able to afford this weed these right here are actually made out of real goji berries from goji berries you can pack up to a gram and a half in here it's tasty and it'll have that slow burn best part these are actually pretty cheap i'm gonna open one right and you can use code stoned alone for another 15 off devlin check him out show him some love because that is how we acquired the cannabis for today's room jumping back into the blackberry strain cannabis infused dark chocolate bar with a hundred milligrams of blackberry and i'm gonna pull up the effects on that because it is a different strain blackberry is a mother strain of the blackberry kush so this is cool because i don't even realize ah it is raspberry cough crossed with the strain black domina and it's a buzzy and relaxing my tolerance has been pretty low and when i ate this hundred milligrams of course it started off a bit by bit like you know i'm really i'm just gonna eat one piece it's like i'll eat a few more pieces i'll eat the five pieces and then i you know eat the whole [ __ ] thing so before corova a different company used to sell thousand milligram [ __ ] bars and it would be like this giant scotch-a-roo thing i guess that's what you would call it and uh the whole thing was super strong so that [ __ ] was definitely the bang for the buck but i do understand why they cap it at 100 milligrams because i ate the whole [ __ ] thing you know and with munchies it's like you know it's a chocolate bar like obviously i want to eat the whole [ __ ] chocolate bar it's like really hard to just stop at one that [ __ ] is strong and there's so many memes about it that's the classic [ __ ] like oh these edibles and these edibles ain't gonna do nothing and then you know getting laid out by it it kind of tripped me out because again this is described as a relaxing high as a euphoric high but at just the highest dose like this it feels so strong in the head is like it doesn't really matter what strain it is it feels like this kind of sativa meltdown what's funny to me is every time this happens it's like getting too high or like you know even tripping or something it's in the moment i almost don't realize what's even happening because i was hitting my delta eight cartridge and i was just like damn i'm so [ __ ] hot i'm like this is crazy and then i was getting so high that i wasn't even thinking that i wasn't even realizing i'm just like what is happening like am i dreaming right now and like i just completely forgot that i even ate edibles i just wasn't even thinking about that i'm just like what happens like am i in between days am i in yesterday am i like about to go into tomorrow it was just uh it was really funny like being on that level so i just took a nap and kind of waking up during the nap and being like oh [ __ ] right i'm [ __ ] on edibles and i feel like psychedelics are almost easier to ride because in a psychedelic it's like it's crazy but you kind of ride with it and it'll change into something else it'll kind of like you know turn back around it'll loop but with an edible it's just like oh [ __ ] cause you know of course it's still just weed but it's just like a lot of input in the brain it's just like i wasn't able to just ride with it you know i was trying to go with the flow which is kind of like super powerful like trying to just sleep through it but then you know it's like halfway between the dream world it's a good time but it's just uh it's strong waves it's harder to just kind of like you know dissipate into it it's more just like definitely the blackberry edibles are very good smacked i was chapped i was very [ __ ] high and then i picked up some weight afterwards my uncle and i are convinced they're like is that edible you ate that weed and that's why you know like you got fat tasty stuff when i didn't know what weed i was getting and you know it still happens for sure that is one annoying thing is when it becomes super racy and you don't even know you just hit it it's like oh [ __ ] i like the strain because it is not that i find that sometimes with sativas it'll kind of like burn me out and then i'll actually kind of crash from the sativa and be very tired later later on so i'll pick a sativa because i'm like oh it's very energetic but then it kind of has a crash to it i like this indica i'm not feeling you know the gear is turning super fast i'm just feeling a good body high i'm feeling you know baked i'm feeling warm and generally that's what i'm looking for what i want to smoke you know as close to that as i can get that body and kind of hot great one i feel like for just chilling watching movies and [ __ ] for me like doing the editing not going too wild with it blackberry crossed with afghani kush well again shout outs to ganja berry they're the sponsors show them some love it's cool seeing these new companies pop up and this is definitely a fresh thing let me know if you want to see more strain reviews it is fun to delve into it because otherwise you know maybe i wouldn't have specifically looked out and tried some blackberry so i'm glad i did and this was a fun little experience especially having both the herb and the chocolate also yes this is the herb that has appeared in the stoned alone movies the upcoming detective trip as well as back in usa and this is a strain that i would recommend and come back to because it's very chill i'm feeling fantastic and i just finished it all so i would definitely love some more i enjoyed smoking this weed eating this uh chocolate i'll be seeing you around in the next time ciao and uh you know maybe hit that subscribe button if you will stay tuned for the movie", "_pg1lPaeQaA": "in your words tell me about the very basic difference of ingesting marijuana via and edible versus smoking or vaporizing it sure so so the first thing is your body deals with cannabis very differently when it's ingested it if you're eating something it's actually processed by the GI tract and processed by the liver it changes from Delta 9 THC to hydroxy 11 which is more potent and the biggest thing is that takes time right we when we drink wine with a meal we don't get drunk like that right we let it kind of prickly and enjoy the experience so edibles are very similar when consumed there's other uptake or delivery systems right your oral mucosa is a very efficient delivery system our mints for example are dissolved in the mouth or tinctures right go under the tongue those are quicker one of the hardest things about edibles is the delay and getting consumers to understand that you have to be patient we are not a patient people so there is a learning curve there right education we have to talk about it we have to talk to tourists we have to be able to have a dialogue and not be afraid to ask questions especially because if we do have history with marijuana maybe smoking marijuana it's kind of an instant gratification thing we know if we're at a six or even an eighth about five minutes in edibles it can be anywhere from what an hour maybe sometimes more than two yeah so the the state language is this will this product may be delayed by two or more hours what we see is depending on the product type really you're looking at 30 minutes to an hour and a half depending on a lot of things right are you eating an edible and then putting a meal right on top of that that will get the THC into your system much faster than if you eat a meal and then take something that is a slower process the state changed some of its regulations regarding labeling just earlier this year on February 1st and and and part of that was being more explicit about this could take more than two hours but I know before you guys were before that regulation took place the Dixie had some really creative activation illustration on the back of its products and and I'm wondering have you guys tweaked those since the states regulations have kind of caught up with you guys on that level yeah you know we always continue to tweak those as we get feedback on on how long products are taking to affect someone we will adjust our barometer right it's a strength time scale and one of the things we believe really strongly is we can have a whole paragraph of warnings that no one's going to read or we can make a visual icon that someone's going to see and get information from quicker so when we say that a serving size is 7 milligrams or 10 milligrams and we'll take 60 minutes that is a easier way for a consumer to understand faster what they need to do and and everything we do on our labels as much as possible is to get consumers to understand how to take that product and how to dose that product", "EQV0_UTvA44": "so what do we got here all right okay oh you see the whole thing this is America Wow yeah all right and that is cannabis infused jello okay thank you ma'am", "cil7w-094aw": "what's good everybody oh welcome to my channel i hope

10 milligrams if you got a medical card you can get them in 50 milligrams so it is 150 milligram pop i like how they do uh their little thing right there um they they do it like ski slopes like the recreational ones they're actually they're 2.5 milligrams the gummies they make they have a green circle then they have um then they have uh a blue square which is when they're like 5 to 10 milligrams and then they got the black diamonds for ones that are like 20 to 50 milligrams i've got uh these little hard candies too which are really good the canyon suckets um they're tight they're tiny little hard candies i'm really a big fan of these let me show you how small these things are right here they're tiny me see just a little tiny hard candy and that's a little thin and that's 20 that's 20

say my last little second to uh chew during the movie and uh i'm also gonna eat me a lollipop um these are good man i've had them before i'm not gonna lick this right now because i have a uh hard candy in my mouth but you see it's nice and sour it's got the thc uh diamond right there on it [Applause] and uh you know what's cool is your colorado they're thc dot it's a diamond um that's totally from from ski culture um it's the reason why they made a diamond like black black diamonds um and uh it's just great because you know washington's got a different center symbol california's got a different symbol um now this actually most of these you know they're usually about 50 milligrams this one has 45.5 milligrams cbd it has close to three milligrams of cbd 2.56 milligrams two and a half milligrams of cbd um so yeah man it's a good product canyon i like them um they use a really good what they call cannabis essential oil which is a co2 oil and um you know i like the hashier edibles the more like full spectrum edibles definitely with the oil they use is um has a has a tiny bit of a hashy flavor but it doesn't betray the whole thing it's not distillate it's a co2 um cannabis oil which it has other things in there like the terpenes and the um you know it's the full it's a full spectrum oil it's not just a not just a clear distillate but like i said these these are very good um so yeah i suggest you try one um i've tried them before it's got a good very good sour grape flavor i'm not even a huge fan of the of uh grape but i like it i like it a lot and um i always tell you the the this batch is made with box sativa hybrid they always make it with a bulk uh hybrid or indica hybrid usually um this one right here you see it's just uh made with just bulk hybrids so sure they get like a whole bunch of untrimmed um good good bud to make their oil out of but yeah man canyon good good company and um they also have gummies too their gummies are uh tiny like these and usually they're only 2.5 to 5 milligrams they're small doses but they're little so you eat a bunch of them at a time anyway thank you guys for watching my channel um i hope y'all have a good rest of the evening i'm gonna watch my movie get do a few dabs and uh eat a cannabis lollipop so take care peace", "NuHTkPXyaUU": "it's four o'clock and you've had one of those days you sit down for a cup of

medications out of reach you'll have plenty of time to do that once you know that your munchkin is okay so first things first don't wait for the symptoms to appear remove anything that's thought in

When these crabs were alive,\nthey didn't even know this would be\ntheir future. These crabs didn't know\nthey would get shot up with weed and get... -Full of weed, man. ...eaten on Viceland. I don't know how\nto open crab legs. I should've watched\nmore Rick Ross videos and I would know exactly what\nthe fuck I'm doing right now. We got some --\nNow we've got some -- Is that crawfish? No, baby, we got\nsome lobster tails. Oh, lobster, see, man,\nI don't know my seafoods. This mother fucker\nsaid crawfish. I thought it was just a big\nass crawfish with a God damn -- That's lobster, man! And one lobster right here\nis about $525. -This? -Man, hell no, shorty. For real. -$525. -This right here is $600? $525, you rounding. That was a big round up. -$500? -Very nice. Very tasty. $500 for a lobster tail. A small ass lobster tail,\nbut it got the dope in it. How much is in that? That one has\nabout 25 milligrams. Shorty,\nthis shit good, shorty. I feel myself\nbecoming different. -Can you feel it? -Yeah. Oh, yeah. Absolutely. I ain't going to lie, I think\nI'm feeling a little something. Do you feel pressure to wear\nmultiple chains all the time? Shut your high ass up. 2 Chainz. I think chicken and waffles\nis overrated, over-hyped\ncombination of food. So is your heart rate\ngoing up, as well or is it just\nyou're talking crazy? The chicken is Alvin. The waffle is the Chipmunks. How long have you\nbeen smoking, Tommy? Over 50 years. Have you ever been eating\nchicken and then like, \"Yo, I wish I had\nsome waffles with this shit.\" You back on this waffles. What's going on? I never left. I'm a real player when\nit comes to eating delicacies. I remember back\nwhen my chicken wings was between 30 cents\nand 50 cents. Now they're 20 bucks. -You know lamb chops. Since '71. When the Northridge\nearthquake hit. -And I'm eating, getting big. -Sea bass, halibut. And then\nthe earthquake hit. What's your favorite\n2 Chainz song? 2 Chainz. I was in a urinal,\nI took a piss, some of my pee splashed up\nhit me on my lip. Ruined\nmy mother fucking day. [ Laughs ] Gave you pee breath. All right, look. [ Applauding ] Thank you. Oh, wow. Thank you, guys. [ Cheers and applause ] Thank you. -Can I get a doggy bag? -Absolutely Yeah, we're about to\nget some take-home boxes. It's about that bacon. -Right on. -Bacon, bitch. -[ Laughs ] Thank you. Is it good marijuana? What up, what up. It's your player partner\n2 Chainz checking in and this is \"The Most\nExpensivest: High Roller. My boy, Adam, and my boy, John,\nwe're about to get into some real weed lingo\nand some real prices, y'all. Adam: All right, Chainz, we have\na few very special things for you to try, here. -All right, what you got man? I'm ready. Let's give this honey badger\na whirl. I want to show you\nhow this works. [ Roars ] John: It's got a ceramic tip\nas well as a bubbler. Its like a warm straw. It's essentially\na portable dab ring. Pretty cool. I think we should start\nwith the NBX King Louis, we've been waiting\nfor that. Now, what John is doing\nis he's actually mixing the King Louis\nconcentrate, it's sauce. All right, we're going to wait\nuntil that heats up and then you're going to hit\nthat nozzle. So what do I smoke,\nthe end right here? Yes, sir. As soon as\nI start touching, you're going to\nbreathe in, okay? There you go. \u266a\u266a [ Coughs lightly ] [ Coughing ] Pretty good,\nright there. \u266a\u266a Beautiful flavor profile. Nice and tasty. I'm gonna hit --\nI'm gonna hit it -- I'm --\nI'm gonna hit it -- Yeah. one more time. \u266a\u266a We've got to get it now,\nI like this. Welcome to the club,\nmate. All right. For real, how much\ndoes this stuff cost, man? So the honey badger itself\nis about $250 retail. The sauce itself roughly\nbetween $50 to $60. What makes it special\nis the high terpenes. They've probably got four\nor five different terpenes, like limonene,\nbeta-caryophyllene, myrcene. They're testing around\n13-15 milligrams per, as well as\nyour cannabinoids, so the cannabinoids,\nthe THC is testing probably around\nbetween 75-85%, so you're getting some really\namazing pure stuff there. Cool, so how much does\nsomething like this cost? [ Record scratches ] It's $250 retail. Should we try the buggy? This device here\nis our showpiece, though. Our friends over at Ziggy\nhave been kind enough to provide us this rig\nto be able to play with. Took 14 glassblowers\nseveral hundred hours of work. It's a $150,000 piece. They want\n$150,000 for that? -Yeah. -That's right. You think they would buy it\nand use it or just buy it and keep it\nas an art piece? Typically we wouldn't allow\nsomebody to smoke from this, but, obviously,\nthis is a special occasion. Let's load that up\nwith the King Louis and let's give him\nwhat he wants. Yes, sir. You're going to have to\nput something on that, man, you're going to have\nto put a real boog on that mother fucker\nfor me. -Yeah, I got you. -I've been smoking a long time. All right,\nlet me try this shit. Come on. \u266a\u266a Mm-hmm. \u266a\u266a [ Coughs ] What do you think of\nthe taste and flavorings? [ Smacking lips ] [ Coughs ]\nI like it. Excellent. That's what kind of\nmake this sauce so special. I think\nwe should also try, which one\ndo you want to try, Adam? [ Coughs ]\nOoh. [ Laughs ] -The Alien Bubba. -The Alien Bubba? All right,\nlet's do that one. [ Laughing ] [ Mumbles ]\nI like that flower. You like the flower? Yeah, all this shit\ngets you too geeked. He's too geek --\nIt's too geek -- It's \"2 geeked, 2 fast.\" We've got here a cannagar\nour friends provided for us. This thing's worth, roughly,\nretail side, $500-$600. It's 1,000 milligrams-plus. They're amazing. They made it especially\nfor you, my friend. What they've done is\nthey've ground up the flower, wrapped it\nin palm leaves, and then they dipped it in oil,\nthey've got kief in it. It's a super joint\nis what it is. Do you want to\nlight it up? Sure do. That was\ncustom made for you. It's not a for-sale product\nhere in this market yet. Mmm. So, it's, uh... So you're one of the first\nto have it. You could\nblow it out and... I know. It looks cool for TV. $500, man. This shit. \u266a\u266a \u266a\u266a I tell you what. To be able to experience this\nand get paid for it, I can't even lie this is\nlike what dreams are made of. Man, I'm going to be rapping\nlike a mother fucker tonight in the studio. Man, that's the vibe\nI was looking for. Know what I'm saying? It's that real vibe\nI was looking for. -Hey, 2 Chainz. -What up, man. How you doing? What's your name? -Good to meet you. Chris. I'm with Club M. \u266a\u266a I hear you've got a delivery\nservice or something like that. Yeah, we do\na monthly delivery service for a cannabis\nsubscription box. Marijuana, munchies, music,\nand merchandise. $200 worth of it\nevery month for 97 bucks anywhere in California\nand soon in Las Vegas. -How much marijuana? -A lot of marijuana. -Is it good marijuana? -Really good. -That's cool, man. -Thanks. So what made you come up\nwith that type of idea? I really, as a kid, loved to get the encyclopedia\ndelivered to my house, so I designed my box\nto kind of look like one. -That's some geek shit. -It is super geek. So, tell me more about\nthe box and everything. -This is a monthly box. -Are these pre-rolled? -These are all pre-rolls. -Let me try this out. This is all different\nkinds of flowers. Man. Topicals, vapes,\nconcentrates, waxes. I love the presentation and it don't look\nall hot in the mail and shit when it comes. It looks like\nsome encyclopedias. Oh that's where you get\nthe idea from you was\nencyclopedia boy. So what I displayed here\nis something special nobody's seen\nbut you yet. Okay. -This is our $24,000 box. -Why would it be $24,000? First, we've got\n24 1/8th worth of flower that are delivered\nwith it. -So three zips a month. -Then cannabis cigar set. Got cannabis leaf, I've got\ntobacco, and I've got gold leaf. Three months aged,\npressed, and with rosin and sap\nin it, as well. Then we've got 24 vape pens,\n24 edibles, 24 topicals\nand tinctures and then each one will\ncome with a custom... -Gold tip. -24-karat gold. 240 diamonds in it. You got to let me\nkeep this, man. This right here is\nsomething special, man. The other product that's part\nof the $24,000 box is this. It's our vape exhale. That's a $3,000 easy bake oven\nand a bubbler all put together. That looks too expensive. I don't want to be\nresponsible for that. On the plane\nthey might mess with it. We've got this vape pen\nwith the gold. This is nice. How do you use this? So this one will do\nvape oil or the flower. -Really? -Yeah. So we just open this one up\nand you grind the flower. I love this. I want you to see one\nmore thing before we go, here. This is my custom box that would\ncome with the $24,000 box. What kind of wood\nis that? So this is\na reclaimed wine barrel. That's dope. That's how I need to get one\nof my floors done, wine barrel. -Somebody locked it on me. -Did you lock it on me already? There it goes. So you open it up... -It's nice, bro.\n-...it's all gold inside. Got your flower all ready,\nloaded up. This stuff\nit'll keep you fresh. It's my box? Is this for me? -That's yours.

nuxmaster mini there's really the unit was designed to do two different size smashes um it's really designed for travel personal use trade shows um to go and set up heat up quick and uh then extract either a gram nug or three quarters to a gram nug in a piece of parchment paper with no [Music] bag that's one of the presses that it's made to do which we have here in the back some dosey dough and then in the front we have some chronic kush it's also made to do a three and a half gram smash in a three and a half gram bag like this bottle loaded bottle textile um we advocate that extraction method so all of our surface area to pressure calculations on all of our units have been done assuming that you load the bags bottle textile like i said the mini was made for two two different smashes a single nug smash and a piece of parchment with no bag or a three and a half gram bag smash loaded bottle textile now both of these different uh ways of extraction the different weight of extraction are going to require the same pressure because at the end you're going to get the overall same surface area on the extracted material so if you're up to a one gram nug with no bag it's probably gonna be a little bigger so it'll be a little less pressure that you're applying you know um if you go closer towards three quarter of a gram nug with no bag uh it's going to be uh more pressure on that surface area because it's going to be smaller so you'll learn that as you get a unit and you start to extract you'll see the different different results in and out from the different product and whatnot especially if you're on the growing side so we're waiting for this oil to melt over here we thought it'd be a great time to read off some of your youtube comments on the latest videos believe it or not we actually read all of your comments so let's try to keep it positive um latest video was the bubble hash let's see what you guys are saying so connor 4k hey what do you guys do with the already pressed flower as you can see this is exactly what we do we like to make potent thc oil with it and it actually comes out really clean and really high quality don't recommend smoking it i would personally do the oil 10 times out of 10 with the pucks let's see what else we've got here shady 580 cop watch nug smasher is by far the best on the market you'll get your money's worth and then some my small one is paid for itself many times over i really need to get a bigger and bigger one now production is up well shady 580 we got the nug smasher pro ready for you here just give us a call and we'll get this sent over whenever you're ready what else we got better than watching porn nick garden i'd agree with that porn for stoners i dig it complete wash 86 i could see there's a some similarities there so jared stallman how much material did you start with to get that much bubble hash at once was it nugs and trim or just nugs um for that i don't know the exact amount because our friends over at 11 11 cannabis company uh provided us with the bubble hash but it i do know that it was a fresh flower trimmed right off the plant it was still live so if that answers your question let's see what else danny thompson it's like watching da vinci paint i'm seriously considering picking up a nug smasher at harvest time this year i used to be into the whole backyard blasting thing but figure now that i'm growing the garden of my dreams with all my favorite strains why half-ass it when it comes to concentrates that keef was beautiful i'll always have a soft spot for keith full melts i definitely agree with you blasting is cool but rosin is a lot cooler all right i think that's enough for now let me know you guys thought of that we can keep reading them off like i said we read all of your guys's comments so try to keep it positive if you can [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] hey guys make sure you check us out at nugsmasher.com to check out all of our awesome products we also have tons of great information on our site including calculator tools and terp files be sure to check us out there at [Music] nugsmasher.com", "T7cyZzpyQJ4": "I actually kind of like the spoon yeah there you go okay it's me that you like I'd the way for you like alright now I feel like super self-conscious man I got thought about it for a second that's delicious let's make some cupcakes I'm in legal Washington and I'm leaving Seattle behind to head to Vashon Island where I'm gonna meet a woman who runs the cupcake game here and also has her own line of infused edibles she's gonna show me around a bunch of farms on the island and then she's gonna teach me how to make cannabis infused cupcakes from scratch it's gonna be another weed full day on Bon Appetit so let's find the kitchen and get baked [Music] I hear that you're the cupcake queen of Seattle wow what an honor that's great yeah I have a company called cupcake Royale and we actually work with a lot of local producers we like the idea that we can support local agriculture local economy and create a better Seattle I mean I'm sure you big all kinds of different things what is it about cupcakes that's so special I think there's a nostalgic thing about cupcakes and it's kind of a food around celebration I've heard you also make a line of edibles is that right yeah I have a company called the good ship company so we make chocolate products and cookie products and other confections that we're getting ready to launch wow that's amazing and do you use all like the local ingredients right that's it absolutely and that's why we're here today because we're gonna make some cannabis cupcakes we're gonna use the cupcake RL recipe to make a chocolate buttercream but instead of the usual chocolate reuse we're gonna use good chip chocolate so first stop we need to get some butter and I want you to meet my friend Natalie who has this lovely farm that we're okay great so let's go check it out you know hi baby how are you doing are you doing very well I'm Natalie nice to meet you natalie has a dairy farm and we're going to pick up some cream and we're going to take that cream and turn it into butter and then we're going to infuse that butter with cannabis for our cupcakes and these are your milk factories right here huh exactly so I'm LT eat it this morning and I got her mouth and I have it in the farm stand for you if you like to taste something else that edith made i have some cream on one here this is the savory this has olive oil and salt and freshly ground pepper on it and this is just the fromage blanc with a little drizzle of local Vashon honey actually Natalie I have something to share with you as well some of Washington's finest but I don't know if you'd want to give this a go okay I can do it go yeah we can try okay great and it is from Washington it's called laughing Buddha and it really just one of my favorites on the market in Washington from a flower perspective all right I've never hot box before I'm standing before pretty great I gotta say let's let's get into that cheese okay so let's start off save that's your savory Wow really really creamy texture of it it's just amazing Wow so you guys are all about doing stuff from scratch yeah is that part of food culture here in the Pacific Northwest yes it's almost like a religion yeah I mean you can really taste the difference I'm going honey mmm Wow mmm holy crap okay here's your milk great what do we owe you for that that's okay you can have it oh really yes my gift to you in that case here's my gift to you it's this really fine bud you seem like you enjoyed that Jay I have to say I did excellent so enjoy the rest of that bunch and we're gonna go put this to good use I've got my jar of fresh milk that I picked up from Cornerstone farm and I've headed over to Vashon velvet where one of Jodi's friends an amazing cannabis farm where she grows some really banging buds we're gonna pick our buds and I'm gonna go put this thing down cuz my hands are freezing right now [Music] before we do anything everybody needs a name tag state regulations excellent want to be in full compliance how did you guys get into the cannabis business when the state announced the rules for getting a license to grow cannabis they said there was a 30-day window and they might never have another window open so I thought chance of a lifetime we went for it and never looked back enjoyed every minute of it Bravo that is fantastic awesome and are you a cannabis enthusiast yourself I never know and then if it's a Saturday night I'll try some of the Laughing Buddha yeah so I wanted to show you the strain that I think would make some really great cupcakes this is our platinum blueberry this is a really space-age looking grow right here go ahead and stick your fingers in and take a sniff wow there are so many different flavors going on there I mean beyond just that tart blueberry aroma there's so much else going on like a maple syrup or yeah I can't get enough of that smell and as you can see we use exclusively LED lights which use about a third of the energy of regular standard HID lights so we're trying to reduce our carbon footprint as much as possible so Patrick how far along are these guys right here these are about two to three weeks from harvest at this point oh that good karma is paying off because I mean you've got these incredible looking buds so Jody do you think this is gonna go well in your cupcakes I like the sweetness I'm excited to see what it tastes like when these guys said they make stuff from scratch they were serious I mean every single ingredient comes from the source I met the cow that we got our cream from and I met the cannabis plant that we're gonna get our buds from and now I'm hanging out with the chickens we're gonna get our eggs from and then we'll be ready to make cupcakes [Music] we have all the ingredients right here to make cupcakes and it starts right here and we're going to skim the cream off the top how do we turn that into butter we have to churn it and this is a butter turner it's crazy steam punk jar that looks pretty arduous for one person but here check it out I have an idea if you just hold the jar and I'll go like this Wow don't hit this a little bit how long does it actually take it's gonna take about 30 to 45 minutes yeah that looks like butter all right and what we're gonna do is we're gonna put this butter into this bowl and we're gonna press it against the side to kind of squeeze out more of that buttermilk all right I think we are ready to melt this up and to infuse it with our canvas okay Jody how much weed do we have decarboxylate in here this is one gram of platinum blueberry from Vashon velvet threw it in the oven at 290 degrees for an hour and that allows it to decarboxylate which means it releases the THC what we're going to do with that we're gonna put this in this 1/2 cup of delicious butter we've been working so hard on and infuse it for 30 minutes from super low heat we're starting to smell good already so you're ready to strain it we got some cheesecloth in a strainer here with the bowl underneath it we're just gonna pour this straight through the cheesecloth there's all our spent weed flowers okay so what goes into a cupcake batter we're gonna put in the dry ingredients I have two cups of flour here then we have 1 and 3/4 cup of organic cane sugar so one teaspoon of baking powder and result is this gonna give you a little mix to combine them just a little make them next step we're going to add our cannabis butter yeah we put a lot of butter we get last wrap alright that looks good I like how it's breaking up we're going to take some of our wet ingredients and mix them together we're gonna start with four egg whites so we're gonna add to that a half a cup of warm water we're gonna add a half cup of sour cream we are doing in this recipe one teaspoon of vanilla paste and this is Madagascar per bone vanilla so we're just gonna whisk this together and now we're gonna incorporate this is going better let that mix a little and now we have a nice smooth delicious looking manner that is looking super creamy these are ready to go into the oven huh this is this is exciting as soon as we open that door back up we'll have cupcakes let's put them in the oven 325 we're gonna start with eight minutes and then we're gonna rotate it after eight minutes and do six more minutes or 14 minutes oh yeah those are perfect it's like beautiful awesome alright so while those are cooling let's open some good chip chocolate and get ready to make our buttercream this is our deep dark chocolate bar the Washington state serving size is 10 milligrams Wow tasty there's no plain tea flavor and I can barely taste it yeah you really gonna talk about it - yeah yeah I like it alright so what we're gonna do is we're gonna melt eight-pitch of chocolate bar so this is gonna be 80 milligrams of THC spread across 12 cupcakes that's about seven milligrams of cupcake we did the math on the cannabis cupcake batter and that is scene or so a milligrams per cupcake so you add that plus the seven and rectory all right great pretty potent cupcake we're gonna start with putting 2/3 cup of our delicious hand turn fresh butter so we have two and a quarter cup powdered sugar we're gonna add a pinch of salt blend it all up slowly so you don't get the cup cloud we're gonna put three tablespoons of fresh milk going back to the Madagascar I'm going to put one teaspoon vanilla and we're gonna add the cannabis infused good chip chocolate yeah that was amazing we're gonna let that mix in we're so close to having cupcakes so I'm a big fan of a hand swirl instead of piping on although you can do the other and grab a little dollop and then you do a very magical thing to kind of Pat it and then you give it a little loop right I swirl on that one Cheers thank you so this is the best cupcake in Washington State huh let's see what you think mm that's a good cupcake oh my god experts you know what they do they go like this they break the bottom up and you put it on top super easy get out of town I wish I knew that point but into this thing this thing is double infused we infused the butter that went into the cupcake batter and we melted a bunch of your delicious medicated chocolates and put it right into the frosting boom boom this is a strong guy this cupcake right here is a representation of the adventure we had I had the fortune of seeing where all the ingredients are a lot of the ingredients that went into this came from really I mean it all just came together in the best cupcake I've ever had excellent truly thank you so much thanks for coming out to Vashon Island today barring out the beat thought about defeat mmm that is one good cupcake", "xoDYHfKn23g": "welcome to wheat skies the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of

on the moon certainly not on the moon and back it's not terrible I don't want to suggest it's terrible I'm at probably a for me maybe a 5 somewhere between a 4 and a 5 you know like that kind of level of high this was a $15.00 edible so you know you can't complain too much for that price that's a little worse than average but not substantially so I did like how it tasted tasted great there was just like cannabis taste but the rest of the chocolate was nice and smooth and creamy and had a great cappuccino flavor but I'm just not as high as I was hoping to be with the moon megadose chocolate bars

overall 2020 is our year [Applause]", "X87mfquF1u0": "gotta give a quick shout out to my boy annock he also goes by the name headpie here on youtube he wrote this trip report my man had an absolutely terrible experience on edibles so without further ado we're going to jump right into it as i recollect the events of this story and remember the various emotions and thoughts i was having i get reminiscent feelings of embarrassment guilt and some dread the embarrassment being as simple as being known as that guy that thought he was having a heart attack from edibles while the guilt and dread are more lingering and complex this experience was a first for many things for me but consuming thc was not one of these i'd been smoking moderately since i was 16 and been rarely knocked on my asses too high which is a lie this man i've seen him i've seen him in action before he's lying but even in such circumstance i would either get a headache or an upset stomach this man would be [ __ ] laid out this entire ordeal is completely different in what i had ever experienced in the past and has left me with some harrowing memories that seem comical in retrospect as far as i can remember i've only been seriously concerned about my life a handful of times one of the most notable was almost crashing while riding with some friends during my sophomore year of college it was raining and we were driving to indianapolis on the massive hundred mile highway when my friend let's call him adam had a lapse in concentration adam was going about 90 miles per hour in an attempt to let us arrive on time to my show where i'd perform a song that another friend and i had written funny enough my other friend calm david is also connected to my edible story anyways adam wasn't paying attention while smoking the blunt we were sharing and drifted from the left lane to the left shoulder he noticed and proceeded to over adjust then kept steering back and forth until we lost all traction and began spinning out on the slippery pavement as soon as i saw the car that was behind us appear in view the car was enveloped by an eerie silence i think the radio was still on in full blast but i only remember the screeching of the tires on top of this everyone in the car including the two women in the back seat didn't make a sound the entire time similarly to hiding from a beast that clearly sees you and hoping staying quiet doesn't agitate it we spun approximately four or five times before coming to a stop on the right shoulder miraculously we didn't flip over hit any cars barriers and even ended up facing the right direction while being safe on the shoulder adam was understandably freaking out that he couldn't get the car to move but it seemed the brakes were just locked either from the spin out or some security feature he restarted the ignition and we were back on our way as we passed some cars that stopped on the shoulder to see if we were okay we weren't about to let cops come and find the weed in the car plus there technically was no collision so we left albeit driving under the speed limit the rest of the way overall i considered all of us extremely lucky that we got away from the incident completely unscathed even if adam still bears the guilt of almost seriously injuring the lot of us i wanted to bring this story into light as it helps me connect some emotions and points to my other story so my edible story actually begins a few months earlier than the car incident i know both of my life or death stories come from the same brick of time what a delightful year it's safe to say my sophomore year of college has considerably been the most stressful only my senior year being overshadowed by the pandemic coming in as a close contender it was a thursday afternoon i just finished my classes and was playing darkest dungeon on my computer my classes were fairly easy so i treated any day of the week as a weekend when it came to recreation david my friend that i would later perform with in indianapolis was also my edible plug at my college i still talk to him to this day and have even made more music with him i already had multiple brownies from david in the past and got comfortably high from them i had just gotten some more from a fresh batch and decided to have one of them while gaming my roommate jim wasn't in the room yet and didn't want to ingest weed since he wanted to be a cop after graduation that however didn't stop his rampant alcohol consumption anyways i pull one of the brownies out of the fridge about two inches by two inches in size nothing abnormal from what i've already had from david i ate the brownie which i could more noticeably taste the thc from and went back to my computer jim soon comes back and i'm waiting for the effects to hit 30 minutes later i start feeling my heartbeat get persistently faster which i'm expecting of at this point however i don't get the feeling of being high instead i start hyper focusing on my rising heartbeat notice some electrical jolts in my chest and upper back in a sense that something isn't right i decided to get off my pc and lay down to get my heart rate to calm down but even when i was lying down i thought it was still increasing in tempo whether this was the actual case or not it made me more paranoid so i decided to get up and shower to relax i get into our bathroom and begin to take a warm shower after a few minutes the jolts in my chest don't stop so i set the water to cold to see if it change anything now in correlation with my car crash story this section deals with my psychology and what was going through my mind after about what felt like 10 minutes i get out now starting to panic i think back to when i got the edibles from david and remember that he was very slumped from having one of the brownies to someone in a reasonable state of mind you'd probably make the conclusion that this batch is significantly more powerful and you just gotta write it out however at this point i couldn't keep my thoughts coherent i remember thinking about david being stupidly high instead start making random conclusions in my head that the brownies are laced with something like fentanyl and david's only alive because he somehow built up a tolerance to it keep in mind all of us only smoke and deal with weed this was merely abstract paranoia i was trying to ignore these thoughts that i knew were at least somewhat irrational and proceeded to make the mistake of using webmd to check my symptoms surely enough when you google chest pain symptoms you'll be immediately directed to the heart attack page i went through all of the heart attack symptoms and realized i had 13 out of the 16 on the page the symptom that really sealed the deal for me was the feeling of impending doom as soon as i read that i started getting thoughts that almost felt like voices in my head that were repeating things such as death i am dying and even impending doom the phrase impending doom the impending doom really shook me to my core it made me feel like there was an apocalypse underway and it was only a matter of time before my passing very similarly to my car accident i recall having so many different thoughts in a short period of time with my friends in the car i remember thinking about how we're going to roll over if we come out fine how adam will get in trouble for the weed and booze we had in the trunk how we might get significantly injured by crashing but i don't think the thought of dying necessarily came into my head it was more so anticipating the car flipping anyways i get the idea of lying down in bed again and trying to sleep as one of my symptoms was also significant fatigue however i rationalized that i would end up dying in my sleep and my roommate whom slept five feet from me wouldn't notice until it's too late i come out of the bathroom and say to jim that i think i'm having a heart attack he knows i ate one of the brownies and reasonably tells me that i'm just high and need to calm down however i didn't feel high my heart rate kept feeling like it was rising and the electric jolts in my chest were too much for me to dismiss as only being high i feel sorry for jim he knew i was fine and told me i'm not going to die but i just could not think straight i knew something was wrong he realizes i'm just going to keep being paranoid and says that if i really think i'm having a heart attack i can call an ambulance he also says that he'll have to leave the room if i do as he doesn't want to be connected to the pot brownies i completely understood this and didn't blame him for wanting to leave in fact it ended up helping my case that he left later on anyways i make the decision to call 9-1-1 have jim leave the room and flush the other brownie i call and talk to the dispatcher telling her i think i'm having a heart attack and i need an ambulance at my door she says that they're on the way and i just need to sit and wait a few minutes go by after i hang up and i start getting even more paranoid about how long it's taking so i call 911 again i tell them i just called and probably told them another phrase or two like please hurry or something from this point on my memory started to become very hazy surely as a result of both being overwhelmingly high and going through a lot of stress the campus police and one of the paramedics came to my dorm and walked me to the elevator i go outside and tell them i had an edible and think i'm having a heart attack the emt says i look completely fine and just need to take a walk to calm down however just like my roommate also says if i really think something is wrong they could take me to the hospital i think it over and decide to still go as i know there's something wrong with me even if it's not immediately life-threatening i get into the ambulance and my symptoms really start kicking off my heart feels like it's thumping against my rib cage and the electrical jolts are starting to hurt the paramedic checks out my heart and makes a note to the hospital that my heart rate is pretty high hearing this maybe confirming myself that i was going through some cardiac event and may have made my symptoms even worse we get to the hospital with me in the stretcher and i go into a big room and get hooked up to an ekg over the next half hour i'm visited by a doctor and some nurses i tell the doctor what happened and one of the nurses says to me oh baby you're high out of your mind they all leave to run some tests as i sit alone in the room the ekg occasionally makes rapid beeping sounds which only stress me out more the whole time i'm waiting i'm freaking out still thinking that something's wrong with me and wondering why no one's watching or checking up on me the hour i was waiting there was probably the most stressed i'd been in my entire life still feeling my chest jolt and now thinking i'm gonna die in the hospital while no one's looking eventually i start calming down and a doctor and nurse come back to tell me i have high blood pressure and i've had an anxiety attack i was immediately relieved and embarrassed but glad nonetheless some people came from my university's public safety telling me i could call them if i need a ride back to campus when i get discharged more time passes and i finally start feeling high instead of anxious i had eaten the edible around 5 pm and got discharged from the hospital at 9pm i would like to give better time stamps and estimations for the previous events but i can't correctly portion how long anything was i get a ride with one of the campus officers on the way back i don't remember much of our conversation but there's something along the lines of have you learned your lesson with edibles i make it back to my dorm and pass out immediately which was strangely one of the best sleeps i've ever had what followed this event was nothing short of luck in a culmination of the years i've spent becoming a good liar i get a summons to student conduct since my incident was related to consuming weed i have to call my parents about what happened both because of the student conduct meeting and they need to tell our insurance company about my ambulance ride i gave some half truths to my dad basically saying i recently picked up smoking from being stressed and had an unrelated panic attack my excuse to him for the disciplinary meeting was that they found thc in my blood at the hospital and notified a university about it thankfully my dad understands and decides to help me get out of trouble with student conduct we construct a plan where i say a friend from home pranked me with a weed brownie which is why there's thc in my system by the way that's that's that's a good way to get your friend in trouble this is uh my boy head pie is a novice mode man we were all trying to convince him to do acid a few years ago and i can see why he didn't do it bro because if you thought it was an apocalypse man you do a few types of acids [ __ ] it she knows me who knows brother but you know we love you dude uh we construct a plan yeah yeah he's he's lying saying his friend dosed him so [ __ ] bad bro that's like i swear to god he could get your [ __ ] expelled okay i had to slightly alter this plan since student conduct knew i had eaten an edible i changed it to where i had a panic attack from eating unbeknownst edible which seemed believable this is where jim leaving the room helped since i claimed he was never in a room and therefore didn't have to back up my fake alibi a few days later i go to the meeting line my ass off and the people ultimately buy and completely throw away the incident so all in all i have an embarrassing reminder of what anxiety attacks are like it's also worth mentioning that since this happened i still have a lot of paranoia and anxiety if i get too high i have had a handful of panic attacks since then all of them occurring while i was high i was able to control most of them and can now enjoy smoking weed again albeit being from a smaller amount than before so that's why when i was like shoving the bong in your face at one time with uh you know all the boys over you were like i'm not hitting it i'm not hitting i like to harass this man but this i mean it's like one of my best friends i really appreciate you taking the time to write this i know it's a lot of trauma and you know i'm just poking fun at you you're my homie uh you know that's another trip report hope you guys enjoyed it and i really can't talk because back in the day when i wasn't smoking weed every [ __ ] day for years uh dude i [ __ ] i hit some weed bro i'm not doing [ __ ] i can't do something [ __ ] incapacitated it's like when you hit a roach with a some [ __ ] rage spray you know i was worse than that bro and then the [ __ ] acid man if you if you ain't familiar with that [ __ ] yeah but you'd be thinking you're having [ __ ] health events happening and [ __ ] but anyways [ __ ] all that [ __ ] again uh head pi really appreciate it and that's the end of the video thanks for watching", "_9GRtUCa_II": "[Music]", "i3oUc6F0rUw": "[Music] hey guys this is Leon and you have reached the vibe tribe today we are gonna be making a Tincher with cannabis infused alcohol we have it right here this is called Everclear it is 190 proof and just to say how strong it is vodka is usually 80 proof and this is a hundred and ninety so it's very strong it is illegal in most places I believe in Canada the only place you can get it is Alberta but I will put a link in the description of where you can order from I've heard of people having success getting it that way so the first thing we have to do to make Tincher is we have to deke our VAR marijuana which I have done in a different video I will put it also in the description ok so after you have D carved your marijuana you're going to measure out 7 grams you just need to get a little scale like this you can get them from a 420 shop on the scale here it's 7.0 which I have already done for all of my jars so I have 3 separate jars here there is a lot of people that say different things on about how long you should have it sitting with the alcohol and the marijuana so I'm going to do a little experiment and we are gonna try out three different ones to see which ones are stronger they all are the same lead so let's begin so the first thing you're going to need to do after you like I said after you D carve your marijuana the first thing you're gonna do is break it up and put it in one of these jars you're just gonna break it up and smell their little pieces like this breaking up the weed before the tin sure helps release the trichomes faster which are the resin glands of the pot plant so that's where the THC and the CBD and all the other active cannabinoids are so you have to break it up to fine it's not going to be oxygen exposed for very long interesting fact tin sure actually dates back thousands of years and is in the Guinness Book of World Records ever clears and the the Book of World Records for being the strongest alcoholic drink in the world so that's pretty interesting [Music] so I'm not breaking this up very much just a little bit just to expose all the trichomes that are inside okay so this is a very effective way to extract the cannabinoids out of marijuana alcohol does really well with that so you're just an open up your every clear from the reading I've been doing supposedly you can't smell anything but I can smell things so I'm not going closer I'm not a big fan of alcohol myself but I do like the gummies made from this alcohol so you're gonna do it at 240 mils we're just gonna get close everything doesn't have to be perfect we're just gonna get it as close as we can that's good enough and you're just gonna pour that right in there [Music] I've already broken up all this weed that are in these bottles everybody is different with with alcohol and with with marijuana everybody reacts differently with it I personally get really sick when I drink alcohol but for some reason I can handle eating the gummy bears that I'm gonna make from this no problem so you're just gonna seal those and also if you can't get the Everclear you're not able to find you can always use Bacardi 151 proof which you should be able to find in your local almost or LCBO or wherever you go you're just gonna shake it so there has been people who think a couple hours is long enough to be able to get an effect from this Tincher and there's other people who think longer the better or longer the stronger so whatever and you want to do we're gonna do a little bit of our own experiment to try it out and we will see what happens there I really think my opinion longer the better because with even cooking oils if you let them sit for a little while not too long because they do go bad I find what the cooking oils but if you leave it in there for three months it is better than when you just make it so I guess we will see after this is all done so for now we will let you guys go and we'll be back in two weeks one eternity lay down alright guys we are back it has been two weeks and we have let our Tincher sit in a cool dark place I shook it three to four times a day as you can tell it looks very green it did get greener the longer it sat in there I noticed after a couple days it was not really too green but then it changed a lot darker as we got closer to the two weeks so you just gotta take off the lid and you can get one of these little strainers probably from likening the entire there's anywhere that sells kitchen stuff and some people use coffee you know coffee filters but i i've always used this for everything so i'm fine with this so you just put this little guy in here like this and you just pour it in so the reason why it turns green it's actually the chlorophyll which gives the plant to the green color it helps the plant out in a whole bunch of different ways but that was why the teacher turns green and chlorophyll is actually very good for you it has a lot of health benefits including like helps you with aging and increases red blood cells and it is a very good antioxidant so you just want to try to get out as much as you can [Music] okay and then I just want to take one of these little guys and just push it out so for me the alcohol smell is still very strong but I'm very sensitive to the smell of alcohol so that's probably why and if you do have any issues with alcohol if you've had an addiction with alcohol in the past I'd probably make gummy bears with coconut oil instead because you don't want to have a relapse and I will do another video about how to make it with coconut oil as well so just let that drip much you want even leave it sitting on there for a little bit make sure you get all of the teacher out of there and then all you have to do is put the lid on it and store it in a cool dark place until you want to use it and that's how simple making teacher is so I'm gonna make something out of this and I'm gonna come back to you guys and let you know how at two weeks it turned out and then I'm gonna come back with another one or four weeks let you guys know if there's a difference between the two and four weeks and then I'm gonna do another video on the six weeks to let you guys know if it does matter the longer you leave it so we will see okay we'll be back tomorrow I'll let you guys know how it went see you guys later eventually alright well I went ahead and I tried might intro and I have to say at two weeks it turned out really great I'm very happy with it so I'm really excited to see what the four and six weeks turn out like because if it's stronger I probably won't want to eat a whole gummy bear I found one gummy bear was fantastic which I will make a video about how to make gummy bears the best way to use Tincher is actually putting two to three drops underneath your tongue and just leave it under there for about 30 seconds and then swallow and then it goes directly into your bloodstream so it is the best way but you can actually put this in you know a couple drops in a cup of warm water you can put it on your food you can put it in gummy bears anything you really want you can use your drops for so I hope that helps you guys with any pain conditions or just if you want to relax but I'm very happy with it so I hope you guys enjoy the video and I hope that you have no problems making it if you do let me know and I will be more than happy to help you out so comment like and subscribe to the vibe tribe see you guys later peace", "w38dtFM1Pdg": "kush burst starburst edibles they're [ __ ] big bro this video is for

the next one have a great [ __ ] day [Music] dream", "RcVOWaIsDes": "today I'm gonna be doing something really fun for children and this is my version of jell-o gummy bears so let me set up with all the ingredients that we need and I'll be back in a second so now that I've set up I'm gonna show you exactly what we need I have a silicon gummy bear mold a measuring cup for our water we're gonna be starting off with cold water but I'm gonna get to that step in just a second you're gonna need one tablespoon of gelatin that is equal to 15 milliliters and if you buy your gelatin in little pockets this is what it looks like it's a standard package and this holds one tablespoon or 15 milliliters and also a regular sized box of jell-o and this here is 85 grams so for our first step I'm gonna get my water ready and I'm gonna come back in one second for my first step I have added 1/2 a cup of cold water from my kitchen sink that is very important you need the water to be cold I am now gonna take that 1 tablespoon of gelatin and I'm just gonna sprinkle it over the top of the cold water and I'm gonna let this sit here for about 5 minutes because I want this to completely dissolve in that cold water you can already see that it's dissolving quite quickly so I'm just gonna let that go for a few more minutes and then I'll come back so this is 5 minutes later and I've just taken a fork and just stir this around everything is nicely dissolved and now I'm gonna take my last little bit of water 1/4 cup and dump that right in so in here we have a total of 3 quarters of a cup of water I am now gonna take this put this into the microwave and just microwave it for about a minute until it's hot so that was 1 minute on high and you can see now that it's much clearer that's because heat has been introduced into the gelatin and water and now we are ready to add in our actual jello mixture so I've opened up our little box of jell-o and now I'm gonna get that right in there and because the liquid is hot all of the jello mixture is gonna really just dissolve that much easier in there well I smells good too and I am using a cherry today I'm just gonna mix this around so you don't have to worry about the exact temperature that you heat this to in your microwave just make sure that it's hot does not have to be boiling just hot and that will help all the you know the actual package contents mix up in there really well and that's good and now we are ready to fill our mold so I've just put my mold on a little cutting board because this is very very flexible and if it's very hard to lift up when it's full so we're ready to pour it just give that a little bit of a stir just to make sure that all the contents are completely mixed but nothing has settled to the bottom and then I'm gonna start filling our little mold and that looks good just like that okay I'm just cleaning this up and now we are ready to pop this into the fridge so you want to put this in the fridge not the freezer just into your fridge and just let this chill down for about four hours and you're gonna have a really really nice gummy bears so I'm gonna pop this into my fridge and I'll come back much later on and I'm gonna show you the final product and they are really fun and they are full of flavor a few hours later once your jello has completely set you can just peel out your little gummy bears that's what's so nice about the silicone is that you can get right in there and just peel them right out so I'll continue doing this so I'll be back in a second and our last one and there we have them let's get them around the right way look at that really nice let me zoom in so I've zoomed in just a little bit to show you how nice these are and there we have it our jello gummy bears and look at how really gummy these are really really nice you can see that extra gelatin will really set these up really well and these here are super super fresh hmm a burst of flavor right in your mouth super super fresh hmm YUM I just zoomed in a little bit more because I think I heard some of you say zoom in a little bit more I want to see a little bit more detail in those gummy bears and here we have them aren't those cute made with jell-o and gelatin a little bit of water there we have them really fun really really delicious that's it for this video I hope you enjoyed it if you did please give me a thumbs up subscribe if you wish I really do appreciate that and that's it for today I'll see you next time you", "2l3xFaS8vOY": "I'm gonna get stoned first thing in the morning hi welcome to and anything show and today I'm going to show you how to make homemade wheat chocolates that's right folks it's time that we bring leads to the forefront people I mean it's legal basically everywhere except for I love and I recently came into possession of a large quantity of marijuana so when that happens my favorite thing to do is make cannabutter 500 milligrams of THC right here folks making chocolate at home doesn't appear to be that difficult it's basically just a cacao or cocoa powder a sweetener butter and whatever else you feel like adding in this case we're gonna use some hemp arts you can make it in between like plastic bags so that's like a bark or even better you have ice cube trays or like these silicone molds silicone molds that was weird so I'm gonna put some in here and then I also have these awesome weed ice cube tray molds my boyfriend actually got them from his office as a Christmas party because they all think that he's like this huge pothead meanwhile the kid hardly ever smokes weed he just looks stoned half the time so if any of you are watching this I'm calling you out and you do not smoke pot you are not some pothead that everyone thinks you are and the only person that is using these is me I'm concerned slightly that they're brave when they pop out so we'll see what happens I'm gonna do a few in here and a few in here I'm also going to use this maple syrup which is from New Hampshire keeping it local I'm gonna use some vanilla extract with Jam and I just got a Mexico if you haven't seen those vlogs to check them out so this is local to Mexico and I'm gonna use this wheat butter that I made and the weed my frame grew and its local to Western man so sourcing maybe we are sourcing local we're sourcing regional or keeping them heavy in this kitchen the first thing we're gonna do 1/2 cup of coconut oil which is okay and next we're gonna add in 1/2 cup of cacao now with this recipe I'm gonna try to make 10 chocolates with it so I did have to do a bit of crazy calculations but each serving is gonna be about 50 milligrams of THC so this is not for beginners of edibles but I'm no beginner you know the reason I'm mixing everything in this mason jar making a [ __ ] mess already it's because I'm gonna use this immersion blender so we don't have lumps I thought mason jar be the easiest way of course they always thank you underestimated what a slob I am and now I'm annoyed [ __ ] [ __ ] my hair now [ __ ] is this how do people make like measuring stuff looks so easy I always make a mess they just pour out the powder into the half cup and just [ __ ] pours right now but when I do it the whole house needs to be cleaned we are coconut labor cacao now we need our half teaspoon of vanilla I'm really excited to use this stuff it's supposed to be very high quality I had to check my bag to bring him home and everything smells mmm smells like sunblock and vacation 1/2 teaspoon oh we're gonna need three tablespoons of maple syrup it's so good I guess that's it so now we blend much easier than whisking that's for damn sure they're never gonna get all this [ __ ] off the sides because I'm on every last drop hmm how I shouldn't be doing this probably gonna get pretty high by the way I cancelled my dentist appointment this morning I'm not like a counselor of things but we got snow last night it was for two fillings but like they're very small cavities and that's totally not an emergency and I really didn't like spending $200 so you know what I cancelled I felt guilty about it but then as soon as I did it I was like that was the best decision I made hopefully don't charge me okay so now comes the interesting part we want to weigh these out evilly because I want each chocolate to be the same amount of THC so I'm gonna use this 1/2 tablespoon and I'm gonna try to make 10 of these okay we're gonna do a few in the weed chocolate mole because I just think that will look really cool but it might prove to be too difficult and you might have to give it up let's see how it goes in here oh yeah much better - you're gonna add a little bit to each once they're all the same size so now I just want to get you know my place this is gonna be to hide right here well use my hands like I'm getting aggressive right now I'm definitely going after this one mmm just gotta get in there verified me I'm gonna get stoned first thing morning so I also have these hemp parts which you know hemp is also derived from the cannabis plant how'd you get these from Canada because as you know it's still illegal here no plant that like basically does everything let's make it illegal so I'm gonna sprinkle some of these into some of my chocolate just to add like a fun crunch a little bit not every single one but and it just uses chopstick to cut us the world I have into the chocolate a little bit yeah if these come out well the next ones I make I'll probably add like walnuts or something all right so all that's left is putting these in the fridge or the freezer and they're supposed to harden within an hour the next time you see them though it'll be like when I'm going to eat them for the night so I'm gonna keep them in there all during the day I have to do work now let's start my day so we'll see you guys later when it's time to test these bad boys out okay guys it is hours later the day has passed I have popped the chocolates out of the molds as predicted Lee we the mold it was mostly for aesthetic purposes because it really didn't pop out that well my definitely won't do it like that again but it froze them and this is what this one looks like it's very cute you know this is like very gimmicky but in reality in terms of like consistency and uniformity the silicone circular molds were the move anyway I just ate one of these scouts honor scared what is this scout the scouts honor I just ate one of these it's the Shocker oh I just any one of these Dan can attest to it I'm not gonna eat another one because that will be a hundred milligrams of THC and that's something that we're gonna save for another day by another day I mean tomorrow I'm gonna store these in the freezer I think they'll heat for like at least a month they won't be around that long but I love it I'm so proud of myself what an easy way to make weed chocolates at home and a lot more affordable than buying them at the stores now you can buy them in the stores here anyway you have to be on your deathbed one of these days anyway thank you for watching this episode of add anything show and I will see you next time goodbye Nana you don't want these okay if you had like pointing up but I can't see anything [ __ ] meatball go [ __ ] yourself okay guys", "vLm9VAXFl6I": "and so I'd still take my life in it a fruit roll-up what's up guys welcome back today I have yet another gummy video for you guys and I'm very excited about this one because I think it's going to make a lot of people's lives a lot easier and it is going to be delicious today we're going to be doing a little experiment making gummies out of two ingredients store-bought gummy bears tincture or coconut oil so I just bought some gummies from bulk barn any gummies are fine and what I'm gonna do is I'm going to melt these down and I'm gonna add to some of them tincture and to some of them coconut oil and we're gonna see how they're going to turn out I think the ones with tincture will turn out amazing the coconut oil ones I'm not so sure about so let's try it out and see how it goes PS these are like the best gummies ever they're the Albanese brand you can buy them at a lot of places and they're so good they have like the best flavors the green ones and the white ones are my favorite so I'm actually not going to use them for this recipe so I'm probably gonna eat them while I'm melting them first step is to sort your gummies you don't have to smoke them if you don't want to but I want all my colors to be separate all right let's do this so I separated my gummies into yellow and orange purple and then my favorite ones just to eat while I'm doing this and we're gonna melt them and then add in our ginger and coconut oil and see how it goes I have no idea how long it's going to take us to microwave them so I'm going to start with like 15 second intervals and just check on them and then we'll find out how long it takes to melt them without over putting them I don't know so start with these great ones here there's a total of 13 gummy bears in here and they're just regular sized right there I mean they're a little bit bigger than like kuriboh gummy bears um but they're pretty standard so I was going bears and you guys can even see that okay so I'm gonna check on them in about 15 seconds and see how warmed up and melted they are so that's 20 seconds and they're starting to melt but they still need a little bit more so I put it in there for another 10 seconds okay so this is a total of 30 seconds pretty much melted and good to go I'm gonna add my tincture into here for this amount of gummies I'm going to do 1/2 a teaspoon of tincture so it's just room temperature you don't want to have it like really cold or frozen because it will affect the heat from the gummy so we'll just put that half a teaspoon in so there it is and let's see how well this stirrer is in if it doesn't stir it hopefully you guys can see that can you oh you guys can't even see that there we go so hopefully that stirs in well and if it doesn't we are going to add some lesson and lecithin into this to help combine it but I think that there's enough things and the gummy bears to start with that we shouldn't have any issues getting this to emulsify or combine or whatever you want to call it so that looks pretty good and then we're just gonna put these into a mold the same way you would with homemade gummies and let them sit and we will move on to our next batch so this is quite a bit thicker then they're coming mixtures so it seems like it's kind of hard for the little syringe to pull it up so that's one a little bit of an issue here so let's see yeah see we can't really soak it up so our options would be to microwave it more so it gets more liquidy or to add more liquid but I do not want to add more liquid so I am going to put it in the microwave for another 10 seconds okay so that was another ten seconds for a total of 30 are sorry a total of 40 seconds and I think they should be good enough to be able to put into our molds so I have about half in the mold then it's being a little bit trickier to put in that I thought it was going to be I'm having some trouble like getting the the dropper to like suction it up and that's because it is really thick so again I'm going to put it into the microwave for another 10 seconds and warm it up some more now if you had a lot more going there zero melting I'm like I did it this won't be as much of an issue because the heat will contain itself because there's a larger amount because there's such a small amount that's getting cooled off quicker and thickening faster and also like my dropper is like has a limited stuff to suck up so that won't be if you're doing a larger amount but it's not hurting anything by putting it in the microwave for just like 10-15 second intervals you just have to make sure you work kind of fast so let's throw that back in okay so looks a little different now I guess it just melted a lot more it's a lot more liquidy and put these interim moles okay so I put the purple ones into a molds now let's try some more but with the coconut oil let's do the yellow ones one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen so we'll do thirteen of them just like we did last time and then we're gonna microwave this I'm going to start it with 40 seconds okay here's our 40 seconds melted they're nice and liquidy still might be a bit of an issue with the syringe dropper thing but if you have like one of those bottles you can dispense them with that'll be like way easier but let's add in the coconut oil so I hope you know what nut oil is what I expect to be the most difficult but I think that there's already less lecithin in the gummy bears so the oil should be able to emulsify pretty good but we'll find out so let's have it half a teaspoon of coconut oil okay we got our half teaspoon let's mix that in so so far it's actually mixing in really well that's all something I do for gummy bears with tincture instead of coconut oil because they I think they taste better but I know that most people you should just have coconut oil on hand the texture is a little bit different with the coconut oil I'm going to put that back in the microwave for another like 15 seconds alright so I did another 10 seconds I thought 15 might be too much all right now let's put these in their molds it looks like it's a lot harder using these so I'm gonna use one of my squeeze bottles which will be a lot you hear well I guess I should say hopefully it will be a lot easier you can see that like the coconut oil's making it like that doesn't like stick to the sides of the bottle that much I'm actually very surprised how well the cup oil mixed in oh my god that's so hot oh god it burns okay so don't touch hot melted candy because it is really hot and it hurts okay and this is cooled off a bit now that I've changed the bottle so hopefully it comes out okay if not I'll put it until I got a hot bowl of water or something look at all that gelatin or gummies sitting on the top there and I gotta get him down I'm just gonna leave this to sit upwards to get this to come down guys it's just it's it's too sticky this didn't really work that well either I'm gonna take the metal cap off and I'm gonna put it in the microwave just like this hopefully that works okay I did it ten seconds in the microwave it still doesn't look like it's gonna come out like this No okay this is not working either see another way that we can get this into the mold I mean like it's still gonna taste delicious I'm probably gonna have to eat a lot of this like just peel out of the bowl and stuff okay my plan was to cut a hole and squish this through but I don't think that's gonna happen well let's let's try see oh it's working okay I mean it's a little hardened now Oh No okay this is not working very well okay so the melting of the gummy bears and adding coconut oil didn't work very well I don't know why it seems like it almost got like harder like I now I'm just wondering if I like I microwaved it too many times like I don't know it just it won't come out really it's too thick to come out of anything so I'm gonna make another batch with the tincture just to test that out um again and see it's like it's definitely going to work or if it's user error and I mean it still I'd still take my get it a fruit roll-up it still tastes good if you wanted to you just melt them and then I mean this is really good little easy to get through oh look but you could just melt it and put it onto like parchment paper or silicone and peel it off after and just cut it into strips it's like the same thing it just won't be in the molds the actual gummy product mixed really well - coconut oil it tastes amazing of course you just they just happen to make sure it's pretty making the mold so still work very good I'll be snacking on this later okay let's do some more with the orange gummies and let's put some more tincture and then this time 1112 where do we do 13 or 12 I remember 30 I think and you don't have to do 13 so it's just the number I'm doing I don't know just - just what it is I'm doing and yeah you can just use whatever amount you want obviously you're really good okay let's microwave this you've got 30 seconds we're gonna do double the tincture so one teaspoon instead of half a teaspoon see this looks like it might have been too much tincture too much liquid and they might not set but you could always add more gelatin but I have a feeling these will set they'll just be a lot softer but if you want them to be able to firmer you could just add a sprinkle of gelatin a little more liquidy consistency as will definitely be easier to put into our moulds hopefully this one works a bit better I think it will we just got to act fast I mean using a dropper I probably would've been fine I don't know why decided to use this because it's such a small amount coming out already there we go oh yeah that's perfect oh and also just FYI if you buy these bottles which are really great for gummy making when you're making larger amounts not like this much died by making the tape it comes with like this I don't know if you can see that it's really really small and the gummy mixture is usually too thick to come out so I just put a different tip that's a little bit wider on there to make sure it can get through this was really difficult to use with such a small amount that I had so use a dropper if you have one this is usually my go-to option to squeeze things into molds but because there is such little amount when I squeeze it it's not really doing anything whereas if there was like this much gummy make sure when I squeeze it the pressure would push it out but because I made such a small amount obviously it's gonna be a little bit trickier I will just eat this out of the bottle later I'm just going to put the gummies that I need into the fridge probably for like 20 minutes alright guys I'm back but it hasn't been 20 minutes it's been two days so I took the gummies Oh after 20 minutes and they were not nearly hard enough I couldn't even really get them out of their molds so I put them in the freezer for a little bit like about half an hour and once they were hard enough I popped them all out of their molds and just left them on some parchment paper but they still were a little bit too squishy and too like corn syrupy so I left them out for a day and they were still a little bit too squishy Tomo for another day which is where we are now so it's been two days and they are perfect so if you guys make these just leave them out on a piece of parchment paper for a couple days depending on how humid it is wherever you live it might be a little bit different like it's not very humid where I live at all um so they dry up pretty quick but if you live somewhere very humid they might take a lot longer to dry or they might even not work for you in the first place so I'll show you what they look like so both the purple and the orange ones turned out very well you can see they're sticky obviously because they are sticking to my fingers so they are a little bit stickier than like a regular gummy but they're they don't really stick together in the bag because I've let them dry out for a few days so the purple ones had half a teaspoon of tincture in them and the orange ones had double that amount so they had one teaspoon of tincture and I thought they were gonna have a lot of issues but they're totally fine yeah they turned out very well and they taste just like the gummies did before I remoulded them last thing just to clarify um my gummies with the coconut oil didn't turn out only the ones with the tincture worked for me I don't know why the coconut oil ones didn't work if you guys know why please let me know because I'm very curious so yeah guys these turned out fantastic I'm super impressed with the results I definitely am gonna use this method many times in the future um going forward what I would do is for every 10 dummies I would do half a teaspoon of tincture so you can just multiply that by however many you want to make in total but based on what I've seen with these with half a teaspoon and the regular teaspoon they both turned out so you couldn't probably get away with using a little bit more but if you're looking for a starting point I would go with ten nine bears and half a teaspoon all

spices all right we're gonna add a little bit of this pineapple Keith Keith has an interesting history right it's one of the oldest extraction methods just agitation and screens people recently have really been kind of elevating it to a new level before it used to have a lot of plant matter and it was kind of a less clean product but now people are getting it to the point where it's like 99% of just the gland heads which is like what you want in a concentrate this is the coconut sugar with the THC and I think we should toss the chicken in that to just be fun so you get this nice like almost our Encana hue from here we put equal parts salt the wings right when it comes out of the oil instead of hitting with just regular salt we're gonna hit it with this thanks the first time they've ever been fried chicken wings tossed and Keith is it good we could have more of that beef flavor how do we impart more that we could just like grate it in let's do it let's try the og I think it's good to

chewy buttery caramels now this is a great recipe because it rme the recipe calls for one cup of butter so it's wonderful because you can use different amounts of cannabis cannabis butter depending on how strong you want to make it so for myself today I'm going to be using 1/4 cup um however you can go half a cup three quarters of a cup of can about this canna by no cannabutter and and then you just use regular butter to make up the difference so as I said today I'm gonna be doing a quarter cup of can of butter will do 3/4 a cup of regular butter and it's a really simple recipe and I'm looking forward to showing it to you as well as I'm going to show you how you can make turtles so you can just have the caramel pieces or you can turn them around you can make some turtles for for yourself or for the holiday season alright so we're just gonna get started and thanks for joining is a heavy a medium heavy saucepan and what it means by a heavy is it's got the heavy bottom this allows for even heat distribution to make sure that your candy cooks properly and evenly a rubber spatula or wooden spoon and a tray what I did is I just made a tray from a wooden frame and lined it with parchment paper obviously you can use any kind of baking tray line it with parchment paper a little trick that I do is to make sure to get it to fit in properly as I make a little slit into the corners and that way they can do it you just they're able to tuck in nicely you just tuck the corners in and that way it sits nice and flat and you'll also need a candy thermometer and so I'm gonna get into the ingredients and we're gonna start cooking you're gonna need 1/2 a cup of brown sugar packed 1/2 a cup of white sugar now I've used I said 1/4 cup of my can of butter and three coins three quarters of a cup of regular butter make sure get it all in there don't want to waste any and you're gonna need a one can of condensed sweetened milk not the regular milk not the regular evaporated milk it has to be the sweetened condensed milk you plop that in there and one cup of light corn syrup now you should be able to use the regular corn syrup I've never actually tried it with it I prefer the light corn syrup mainly for taste I don't really like the molasses taste in regular corn syrup but in this recipe I can't really see what difference is gonna make other than making it a bit darker as I said I haven't tried it so I'm not sure so you want it to start to mix all the ingredients mixed together here now is very important was doing this recipe is once you start cooking is that you never stop stirring you can't stop stirring for even just a minute or reduced even a couple of seconds because it will start to burn and you'll start to see little brown flecks appearing in it so you said the whole time you've got a stir so you're gonna be doing about a half hour of stirring time you're gonna turn your heat onto a medium and a medium or medium low and you're going to continue stirring until the bitter end so we're gonna be cooking this to a 234 to 240 so 234 is gonna give you a nice chewy but a very softer caramel the 240 is gonna give you that that chewy but really stiffer caramel so depending on what texture that you particularly like is the temperatures are gonna go to I'm gonna be cooking it to 237 because I wanted a little bit firmer than that really soft but I don't want that really really firm almost break yourteeth firm caramel so 237 is what I'm gonna be cooking it to and you're just gonna continue to stir clean off the sides of your pot and yeah enjoy put some tunes on and dance away so continue stirring until everything is nice and melted and there's no more lumps and everything is nice and smooth and at that point you can add your candy thermometer and then I said you're gonna cook it to between 230 to 34 to 240 and don't ever stop stirring so we've been cooking now for about 10-12 minutes and you're gonna see these candy the caramel is starting to darken up getting more caramel looking and it's also getting thicker you may not be able to see it but trust me by my arm it is getting a lot thicker and we're almost a temperature and so as I said continue stirring until you get to do your desired temperature alright so we're just coming up onto the 234 so at this point if you want that softer chewy caramel you would pull it at this point submerge the bottom of the pot in cold water that's what I've got sitting beside me there and to stop the cooking process right away otherwise so the heat will continue to rise for another moment a minute or two making it a little bit firmer than maybe what you'd like so if you want to stop the cooking process right away somewhere at the bottom of the pot in some cold water alright so my temperature now is 237 I am going to pull out the candy thermometer and submerge the bottom of the pot into cold water beside me to stop the cooking process so as I said you just want to stop put it in the cold water to stop the cooking cooking process and then you're going to immediately pour it into your pan that you've set up with your parchment paper earlier all right so for this I'm pouring half of my mixture into my pan there so that I can make caramel pieces and then I'm gonna be poor than the rest into a funnel so that we can make the pecan clusters or Turtles whatever you like to call them and I'll show you how to put those together now we're gonna put our turtle together so just get a whole pecan break it in half and that's gonna be the main body part and you take the other half break a piece in half and that's gonna be the front legs and then get another half break the break it in half and that's going to be the back legs and then you're just gonna take your caramel with the funnel and you're gonna plop some caramel right on top in the middle and you're gonna do that for for all of them or if you don't want to make the little turtle shape which I wouldn't really bother with because by the time he gets a caramel in the chocolate you don't really see that it's a turtle so I just make some pecan clusters and top it off with caramel and then we are going to coat them up with chocolate once the caramel sets so it's gonna take about 20 minutes half hour for the caramel to firm up enough so that we can coat them with the chocolate so at about the 10 minute mark while they're still warm what I like to do is to form them into into more of a ball because they flatten out when they're warm and you poured the caramel they're kind of flat so what I like to do is kind of push them together so that it creates more of a I'll be it more of a shape that you want more of a cluster instead of it just being flat so I've gone ahead and I've already melted out my chocolate I've got that ready I like to use the candy melts they're really simple to use and there I just call them pretty much idiot-proof you melt them you dip them they dry it's great so you just take your cluster and you dip it into your chocolate and use a fork to be able to get off the excess chocolate so you just want to tap it remove any of the excess chocolate and then you're gonna place it on to the wire rack and I'll let it dry and what you want to do is to put a piece of parchment paper underneath your drying rack to catch any of the excess chocolate that drips off so it's not dripping on to your counters [Music] [Music] I've taking my um Turtles out of the refrigerator after 20 minutes if they're a little bit stuck to the tray don't worry just use a flat knife there to pry them off or if you just let them cool warm up a little bit they'll come right off and there you've got it PK clusters or Turtles your friends and family are sure to love these for the holidays they make a great gift idea sark caramel now is completely cooled is about two hours and we're just gonna remove it from the parchment paper so just take it out of the pan and remove all your parchment paper from it comes away really easily and just remove any little tiny pieces that may be remaining now I had a little wet spot for some reason in my mold so I'm just gonna cut that out and what I like to use for cutting is I like to use a pizza cutter you can use you can use either scissors or a butcher knife is really handy as well now usually I use a ruler but I couldn't find it today so I'm just gonna eyeball it for us here it's not gonna be very accurate but it's gonna give you the idea and I'm using a piece of parchment here just to be able to hold on to the caramel while I'm cutting it cuz otherwise it's slippery and I don't want my handprints all in it so you just press down and firmly roll the blade through [Music] once you have them all cut up into pieces you can wrap them up in parchment paper or wax my backs paper I prefer wax paper I don't have any today so I'm using parchment paper as you can see it's not the easiest to work with but the caramels not going to stick to it so I kind of wrap it like a little present just tuck the ends in and if you want you could add attack a little piece of tape on but as I said if you use wax paper it's great it just wraps up really nicely [Music] [Music] [Music]", "n8cpiP_lURA": "and we have an intro and we also have the [ __ ] Road mic going on this time and record there too we're on we're recording alright we're back it's still [ __ ] Friday I'm having a good day i hammered out a bunch of work it's still the a.m. but I got something up next and it's an edible bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang so we're looking at bang chocolates powered by Endeavour indivi just because uninterested let's see let's pull them up on the old Weber site here of course we have the begin age gate day 20 month April and year whatever makes me old enough 1933 enter ok here we go in Devon in diba who knows we don't really care it's just a company it's just a brand sometimes we care I'm not sure about this they're doing pre-rolls they're doing cannabis salt interestingly like Emma the salt it's an interesting one here we got dark chocolates gummies White Russian Bud cannabis sugar okay so I got a variety of edibles let's check out their packaging cuz that's part of it nowadays it's interesting they have for this this is milk chocolate this is dark chocolate the packaging is different sizes that means they just had a whole bunch of packaging lying around they're trying to make it work right they're making it work they're doing it alright so here we go ten milligrams in each bag total THC per unit is one piece one piece of chocolate in here I can see that feel that this one's milk chocolate also one piece let's see their package date this is their package date March 10th 2020 it doesn't even say package date I don't know what that date actually now I'm confused this is the package date it doesn't say package date and then this is the expiry date the date that's in the future that's what makes sense there to me alright package date on this guy is April 6th April 6 so very relatively close I got both milk chocolate dark chocolate to see what the [ __ ] is going on in here do you like chocolate I love chocolate I like milk chocolate sometimes I like dark chocolate ingredients we've got the sugar bittersweet chocolate whole milk powder just a bunch of chocolate stuff I'm not [ __ ] reading that but I do like the expiry date the cookie I had from Aurora I never had an expiry date very weird to eat have food without an expiry date it's open these up alright let's start with milk sugar dark chocolate because I like it less so boom we're tearing that open like that you see and we're also going to there's a childproof sort of seal on here and this is how you open these is a little flap here you want to grab that then you want to open this flap up in here you just pull that side and the shoe opens right up that's how if you're a child don't watch that that's the key to open a hotel group and here we have chocolate it can be broken up into four sections that's what that one looks like let's just bring out the milk chocolate as well so we have it both out here much smaller package on this one even how they have directions on the back of it - how to open children can understand pictures - just let me point that out there and then we have the milk okay bang-bang all right let me get in here we're gonna try this one first let's snap that one snap that one dark chocolate mmm very dark now what I'm looking for is the percentage of cacao usually when you deal with dark chocolate or chocolates - milk cow is there like percentages of cacao so that you [ __ ] know what you're in for once you're so high in in [ __ ] cacao darkness it can be really bitter this is too bitter for me it's cotton it's a really dry chocolate it tastes like nothing but chocolate she's bitter but if you like that go that way let's try the milk chocolate it's not like your just your standard regular old chocolate not like your Easter Bunny milk chocolate there's that's a little better there's a little pop I'm actually quite happy with that good job so ten milligrams per four pieces that's 20 milligrams total between the two bags of chocolate I'm just gonna eat the rest I'm a mix of chocolate and the brook toggle together Laura price right 4:49 great price actually that is some of the that's me a second so four dollars and fifty cents to get 10 milligrams of THC in some pretty good chocolate bang bang on bang on good for you you're making it work so you got some extract and you managed to put it in a chocolate and put it out to the consumers at a good price this is just a regular ol edible and if you're looking to dip your toes you can get as small to 2.5 milligram dose even 1.125 found $1 whatever 1.25 dose - if you want to break those little cubes in half if you wanted to bite that now you've got a one point two five milligram dose great for beginners cool for beginners this is a 2.5 milligram dose when it's broken down but for four dollars and fifty cents yeah if you're just a beginner in a lightweight yeah let's go these are fighting just get more ever give up that's a win I got these that spirit leap bang-bang tasty little chocolates spirit leaf West Kelowna shout out go grout that's cheap especially if 10 miligrams works for you five bucks boom grab - 10 bucks boo boo it's time to smoke some weed now that's it [Applause] yeah chuckle it stop guys stop [ __ ] with the guns [Music]", "L2EvOegVsN8": "hey guys welcome back today I'll be showing you how to make peach ring gummies I am including a recipe in this video but you can use any recipe you like you could even buy orange and yellow pre-made store-bought gummies and just melt those down and that will work just as well and this video is going to include some troubleshooting because I had quite a bit of issues making these I had to remould them multiple times I'm gonna show you guys how they started which was like this but eventually I got to them to come out like this here's what you're going to need 1/3 of a cup of water three and a half tablespoons of gelatin 1/4 teaspoon potassium sorbate mixture which I will link how to make below 1 teaspoon citric acid 1/2 teaspoons of peach flavoring oil 1 tablespoon of Tincher 1/4 cup of sugar 1/4 cup corn syrup 1/2 a tablespoon lecithin white food coloring and yellow and orange food coloring the first step is to bloom your gelatin so just pour your gelatin over your dish of water as well as your citric acid your potassium sorbate mixture your flavoring oil and the lecithin no need to stir this just leave it to bloom for about 5 minutes now pour your sugar and your quan syrup into a saucepan and heat that up once that begin to melt you can add in half of your gelatin mixture and then stir that in you're going to add in a candy thermometer and you want to keep stirring and heating up this mixture until it reaches between 200 to 210 degrees once it's heated up to that temperature you can add in your remaining gelatin mixture and stir that in then turn off the heat now I'm just going to pour in my tincture and stir that in and then because I'm going to be doing three different colors I'm going to separate this into different dishes I'm going to be coloring one yellow one orange and this one here is white and yellow I filled up a pyrex dish with very hot water to keep my mixtures warm while I'm not using them and then I'm going to pour my first one into a plastic bag that I have sprayed with cooking spray so it doesn't stick and then I'm going to fill up the first half of my molds alright so you can clearly see I'm having a lot of issues pouring the mixture into the molds it's too sticky it's making a mess and not coming out smoothly so I try to warm it up again and that is not working so I am just going to have to figure out how to fix these and what I decided to do was to take them all out and remelt them with some more water and a little bit of gelatin so I added a couple tablespoons of water a few for the microwave for about 30 seconds and then now I'm going to add in half a teaspoon of gelatin and just mix that in I decided instead of a plastic bag I'm going to put it into a squeeze bottle so I'll have better control of how much is coming out and you can see how amazingly it's coming out it's absolutely perfect I was very happy I also added a little bit of water to each of my yellow and orange but not extra gelatin as there wasn't a large enough amount for it to matter I wanted to try and see if I could put the yellow and orange directly on top obviously I couldn't so that means I needed to leave it in a freezer to cool down for a bit and then after all of that work I realized something very unfortunate and that is that I did everything in the wrong order so the curved part of this mold is on the bottom meaning that I needed to have the orange and the yellow on the bottom and the yellowy white color so once again I am pulling them out and going to warm them up and remould them and then I just threw it in the microwave and poured it back into my little squeeze bottle and everything looks like it's gonna be perfect third time's the charm right let's hope so well after this was done I put them in the freezer for about half an hour and they were good to come oh they look beautiful well after all this hard work I am happy to say they came out very nice they have a beautiful texture they look wonderful hopefully if any of you guys try this out some of my mistakes will help you guys not make them and then I want something to have sugar on them so I'm just gonna throw the ones that have a little bit of imperfections into a container of sugar shake them up and then lay them out to dry and just a reminder that before you cover your gummies in sugar you need to make sure you have let them sit out for at least 24 hours so any excess moisture evaporates otherwise they will become watery thank you guys very much for watching this video if you enjoyed it please leave a comment give us a thumbs up and subscribe also let me know do you guys prefer shorter videos that I don't include any troubleshooting or errors or you prefer videos like this where I kind of talk about things that can go wrong and how you can fix them let me know in the comments below", "vEDDlXLorHk": "yo what's going on people a lot of [ __ ] Bangor today so I'm gonna be trying edibles for the very first time is you already know quite a heavy smoker I'm used to smoking familiar with different concentrates edibles never before so this is gonna be my take on it try to the video out a little bit I'll let you know how we're gonna do that shortly but before we get into what I do need to say this videos were intended for people that are 18 years and older and they're also intended for educational and entertainment purposes only right what I'm gonna be doing is I'm gonna beat this on camera and then I'm gonna go away and come back every 30 minutes and we're basically just gonna see how we feel I'm gonna go over whether or not I'm starting to feel anything or how strong is coming in for the first couple of times probably won't feel anything I'd say you know the first two times that will come back after about 90 minutes or so 90 minutes to two hours that's when I really expect this to start kicking in so that's what I'm expecting stuff we didn't anything but you never know we've got this cookie off of edible euphoria if you saw my last video the dreamcatcher strain we also got that from him he's amazing everything that he does is phenomenal so if you haven't already checked him out on Instagram go check him out now please at edible under school euphoria that's why his Instagram is everything he post on that is unreal some of the photos on there are just mind-blowing he does Oreo brownies Lotus bisque off brownies different gummies cookies chocolate chips capsules everything so that I should definitely mention as well as everything that he makes is completely vegan everything is all plant-based now for me personally I'll tell you now I don't currently work as one but I am a fully qualified chef so I'm gonna be judging these cookies I'm not gonna be giving it you know I'm not gonna kiss no ass butter that way but first impressions man these things are [ __ ] good it looks like a shawl a shop ball cookie and it's already breaking apart which is a good sign because I like soft cookies all right that's how I'd like it to be soft and chewy and I can already feel that that's how it is so let's give it a go hmm as a [ __ ] nice cookie it's soft it crumbles a bit it's chewy but not over chewy this is good nice and caramelized round the edges I've lost a chocolate chip I'm not sure what would have gone in here to substitute butter or eggs but whatever used good [ __ ] [ __ ] it tastes amazing well I can tell you night you wouldn't think that these were made with no animal products because normally in cookies you're gonna use butter you're gonna use eggs you would not be able to tell the difference with these they taste [ __ ] good man Wow Wow okay so overall impressions that tastes too [ __ ] good that one quite nice with a glass of milk and then I kind of defeats the purpose because these are because of Regas itself probably and all that but or than all that is a [ __ ] good cookie regardless of if you've got a restricted diet or not you'll enjoy these yeah I mean these are [ __ ] good so mister euphoria if you're watching that's off to you you can cook so now I'm gonna wait 30 minutes only come back tell you our feel and I'm gonna do that every 30 minutes for the next couple hours until I'm [ __ ] basically it's been 30 minutes since I ate the edible the only thing I can really say is that I could still taste it it still tastes good I'm not feeling stoned at the minute I'm expecting to over the next two times that I'd come back and see you guys but we'll just see how we are want to come back oh we are an hour since I ate the edible 30 minutes from the last clip I'm definitely starting to feel it a little bit it's definitely sitting in slowly subtly eyes are starting to feel a little bit heavier I'm just I can feel it just creeping on me you're not I mean I'm hoping that it's going to be a little bit more intense after this but realistically because I'm quite a heavy smoker it could be the case that it's going to be another one for me but regardless I'm still feeling nice so yeah after an hour we're looking good I'm feeling good sorry and yeah we'll see you in another 30 minutes and let you know if there's scripting any stronger so it's been nearly two hours since I had the cookie I feel good it's completely set in now this come in very subtly hasn't been like a punch in the face which I like is really good for relaxation you know a slice it's good you want a proper chill vibe that's what's done for me at least anyway I spoke to edible euphoria and he said that it would be like a melty height that's what he used to describe it and I agree fully like that's the perfect word to describe these things I will be trying that the brownies they're a bit more of a punch in the face at some point but for my first edible experience I want it to be a nice chill one just to see how it is I must say I'm thoroughly thoroughly impressed the cookie itself was gorgeous he also throw in a little starfish too which I forgot to show on camera I ate half of it I've saved half of it for somebody else but that was gorgeous as well it was lemon lime just like a regular sweet you know I mean but it tasted amazing imagine they packed a little punch as well so all in all thoroughly thoroughly enjoyed thoroughly thoroughly impressed I can't say anything bad about everything that I've received from edible euphoria again I'll say it if you haven't already checked Matt on instagram at edible underscore euphoria I'll leave a link in the description or in a pin to comment not sure which one yet but either way go and check I might go follow them go check out what he does speak to him on snapchat do what you can do for you with that being said guys I'm gonna in this video here it's been amazing doing this one I've really enjoyed it I hope you enjoyed watching it and having this experience with me you know how your first experience with edibles were and I wasn't that hopefully I'll see in the next one soon", "ZPXrNozK7ro": "you guys ever get so drunk that you forget how alcohol works like at all you know I mean when you get to that bar never you never to get to that part like here's the thing I get to that part in the night where I'm so hammered that I'm like now I could just have seven more shots of tequila because I couldn't possibly get any more drunk right like that's you know you think that way right I had one of those nights recently where I came home and I was drunk but I was like I'm gonna have a nightcap because you know it's never enough and I go into my fridge right and then I reach in the back and I go to reach for a beer but instead I found a pot edible in my fridge here's the thing about this edible a normal marijuana edible could be anywhere from like five milligrams like a hundred it's like a lot it's like on the high end right this was a 1000 milligram edible not like they used to be legal in California and I bought one out there took a bite of a corner and then just saw God for six weeks I was like I'm all the days are gonna take the rest of my life to eat this but then again now I'm drunk and I'm like ah the thousand milligrams I can fight off the effects of this this is I'm drunk you know so I bit into it and I was like oh this is actually kind of delicious because it was a brownie and then I just ate the rest of it yeah I went to bed at like 2:00 in the morning drunk you know and then I woke up at 6:00 a.m. too high to sleep that was what that was like an adrenaline needle into my heart as a guy I just straight up but I wasn't even in bed I was just floating above it you know so like I gotta go to the bathroom cause here's the thing I was like coming down from being drunk so I'm like hungover and sweaty and stuff but I'm like I gotta get to the bathroom but I didn't walk there I just floated there like a cartoon character who's multiply you know I mean just [ __ ] nose-first [Laughter] and I get to the bathroom and here's like the embarrassing part is my body wouldn't let me pee because it was so unsure of reality in that moments they're like we don't know if you're awake or not so you're gonna have to prove this man because we're gay we got defense mechanisms working here some like splashing water in my face let me come away come away c'mon he's like okay because you know we've been burned before so he had to be sure then I started peeing turns out I wasn't bit the entire time I was just pissing everybody yeah my wife was pissed we're all pissed pissed and Waggin called her unhappy", "ao56bUmUs5c": "again really like chewy delicious brownies you should actually like undercook them a little bit so they turned out so good but I ate too many of them and I probably shouldn't have and they're like super sweet and chocolatey I think we should get a taste tester Vittoria you would think on both of you were you Ray Oh ten nine hey guys welcome back today I'm going to show you how to make the og stoner snack infused brownies this is literally the easiest recipe to make I do a lot of baking at home myself but brownies are one of the things I always use a box mix for there's something about a store-bought brownie mix the honestly is just so good I'm also gonna show you guys a couple tips and tricks on how to make your brownies even better I hope you guys enjoy this video now let's get to baking like I said this is the easiest recipe and you can use any cake mix you can find I happen to have this giant cosmos icebox of RW brownie mix so we're going to use this one when it comes to making this the ingredients you're gonna use are gonna depend this on the back of your box so it's gonna call for like milk water eggs and butter or oil just the ratio would be different so you follow whatever is on your box and for my mix I need 1/3 of a cup of water 1/3 a cup of vegetable oil and one egg so what you need to do is wherever it says butter or oil you just replace that with your infused butter oil I have my oil here that I melted I do think you'd be better with butter than it would be with oil but I'm using what I have this says to preheat the oven to 325 degrees I already that force my oven is ready to go so the instructions on here say and these are going to be very similar for most box mix it's placed water oil and eggs in a mixing bowl and stir it until fully mixed so water oil and eggs and we need 1/3 of a cup of water just a little tip here some of these call for water someone call for milk and some him call for milk or water this one specifically calls for water and usually if it just calls for water it's because there's already a milk powder in here so we don't need the English additional amount of milk but it never hurts to add milk as well we only creamy value ingredients make everything taste better the end but these guard le ones are like super rich so we have our 1/3 cup of water will pour that in there we'll crank our 1 hag into there and then our most important ingredients are butter or oil like I said I have already warmed mine up so I can measure it out better and it calls for one third of a cup so on that for one third of a cup if your recipe calls for 1/4 cup or whatever cup you use whatever is on the box so I poured a little bit too much I'm just going to force them back a jar there we go so 1/3 of a cup going in to the mixing bowl and then we'll just mix that a lot let me add in the brownie mix it smells so good I love cookie dough but I really loved round batter too there's something about raw baked things that well before they're baked that is just like so delicious it'll of scraping off the raw batter off after now a little like extra tip is if you want things to be like extra rich and extra chocolaty you add a little bit of espresso or instant coffee I have a stress up here I'm going to add a tablespoon of this hope it's not going to be too chocolatey by adding this because these are deli ones are already so chocolatey to start with but the espresso just helps bring up the notes from the chocolate just like adds of a more complex layer to it so now we're just going to mix that all in there's so many trunks of like there's chocolate chunks in here already but if you're going to have that you can add America like you could throw in a bunch of chocolate chips at this point you could add in I'm M&Ms or Reese's Pieces or what love Reese's Pieces I'd be so good but yeah you'd be having anything you like sure and you want to add something like Oreos I would add them once this is fully mixed and then just like fold them in so they can get to chunked up I don't know and that's literally it that's all you have to do then we just have to pour it into our baking dish and cook them with the same amount of time that's been recommended on the box and they're good to go now we'll just line our dish with some parchment paper and we'll pour the brownian directly in this box says to cook them for 45 minutes that seems kind of long but I'll check in on them so I'm just going to talk this into the other and set a timer to check on it in 30 minutes to get really like chewy delicious brownies you should actually look under cook them a little bit but if you go overboard they'll be like really gooey and gooey which like I don't really mind it's like brownie batter but if you're ever trying to decide how long to cook it for always take it out a little bit before you think it should come out because it probably will taste better when it comes out the oven it dries a bit and then it will be like the perfect texture so the brownies are done I ended up cooking them for 45 minutes so I actually did do as long as the recipe said to do here's how they look they kind of came out a little bit lumpy because the way I put the parchment paper in there but that's all good I'm thinking of doing Detroit what you think I can do edible cookie cookie dough for the top layer before you eat the cookie dough 100 cooking the brownies I already did that these are gonna be really good I'm talking to you not like I'm talking to you but like I'm just like saying these are gonna be like tasty so they turned out so good but I ate too many of them and I probably shouldn't have and they're like super sweet and chocolatey I think we should get a taste tester Vittoria oh fast we got the try brownie oh I would they look good feed me well I wish when should I have well that one's just taking vitamins you can eat the rest after yeah I think that one you would take on dog with you send it back hmm what's a boy were you Ray a 10-9 mmm what we did have you don't want it Oh Toledo is what to me is it peanut butter cookie oh no but it's like coconut oil video it's good compost the links with the cookie dough edible cookie dough delish well what I got a hair in it homies obviously mine", "LMD5aAC9wAk": "hi welcome to diamond delight edibles my name is liz if this is the first time you're joining you're a regular subscriber welcome back thank you so much i really do appreciate your support i really do mean that i love you guys so today i'm going to show you how to do the sour version of a gummy uh gummy candy so this has got includes the gelatin and a cooked syrup candy syrup you combine them and we then apply the sugar sweet and sour sugar right afterwards so we don't have to wait for it uh to dry uh or to figure out when we need to add it we add it right afterwards and um all right so i'll just get right started we'll get into the ingredients the equipment that you're gonna need and then how to put everything together all right well thank you so much for joining and i hope you enjoy the video okay so this recipe is done in two stages well technically three because we cook in two different stages and then we combine everything so for the first gelatin for the jello half you're going to need three tablespoons or three envelopes of unflavored gelatin one box of your favorite jello flavor a quarter cup of light corn syrup a half a teaspoon of citric acid a half teaspoon of gour gum and a quarter of a cup to a third of a cup of your can of butter and for the liquid you're going to need um a quarter cup that we're going to heat up to boiling and then a half cup that we're going to be using to bloom our gelatin and you can use any liquids that you like i like to use these um kool-aid or the kool-aid jammers these ones are good because they're a water-based and they're clear so you don't have to contend with color and they're also half the sugar so again you're not going to it helps cut back on the sugar since we got a whole ton of it in it that totally up to you though you want to definitely stick to a clear type liquid those powerades if you like those type of things those vitamin waters if you like them i don't like them they do not add the greatest of taste but if you do add juices like with it have real fruit juice in it then you're going to want to use a mold inhibitor because mold will develop very quickly and if you want to add additional colors or flavors uh we can do that i'm going to be adding 2d fruity and so i'm going to kind of make it pink and purpley i don't know tutti frutti colors and if you want to have a nice solid uh background you're going to need white food coloring so that's for the gelatin part the jello side gelatin side for the cooked candy syrup you're going to need one cup of sugar a half a cup of light corn syrup and a half a cup of water so for the equipment that you're going to need you're going to need a double boiler so you can use any pot and metal bowl i like to try and use a thicker thicker metal so that it doesn't get too hot you're going to want something to disperse your candy i love using these bottles they work great and they've got the piping tip which makes it really nice or you can use an eyedropper now this recipe is a little bit thicker so i'm not sure how well an eyedropper is going to work with it you're also going to need an oops timber you're also going to need a smaller pot for your sugar syrup and a candy thermometer two spatulas you're also going to need a hand blender and if you're going to be splitting your syrup either by doing different colors or flavors you're going to need a measuring cup to split that out if you're just doing all one you don't need that or in in lieu of a hand blender you can use whisk in a very strong forearm so the first thing that we want to do is we are going to bloom our gelatin and we are going to heat up that other quarter cup um you may need a little bit more liquid if you do you can just add it in later on if needed so we're going to heat this up in the microwave for about a minute and 20 seconds and we're going to sprinkle three tablespoons of gelatin unflavored gelatin onto our half a cup of liquid you want to kind of evenly spread it and then you're going to mix it in so that it is thoroughly mixed and that there are no lumps so you want it to kind of look like light up you want to look like applesauce and then you're going to just set that aside for five minutes and we're gonna add our boiling liquid to our jello mix and you're gonna stir that oh and you're gonna start you're gonna put your heat on to the lowest setting we just want our water to get hot we don't want it boiling gelatin melts at just hot water so we just want a hot water bath and we're going to stir that in and we're going to add in our corn syrup that's our quarter cup of corn syrup and we're just going to stir oh sorry and we're going to add in our half teaspoon of citric acid and we're going to stir that i said until it's dissolved it takes about five five six minutes or so for all of that to melt and in order to get this stuck gelatin off the side you can use some very hot water and a brush and it'll just you can wash that off otherwise if you don't it won't it doesn't melt and then it you'll get bits and stuff in your jello then you also want to make sure when you're stirring is to rub your spatula across the bottom because the sugar and the gelatin can stick to it and you don't want that so you want to make sure you'll feel it you can feel it smooth on the bottom if there's stuff stuck you'll feel it kind of rough you just kind of want to work it off scrape it off then once your gelatin or sorry your jello is fully melted we're gonna add in the gelatin and what i do is i just kind of cut it up into smaller pieces just like this and just in she goes and you're just gonna gently stir that until it's melted and if your water is hot now if the um your pots nice and hot you can turn off the heat you don't gelatin required doesn't require much heat at all to melt and if it gets too hot the gelatin will break which means it's not going to have that it's not going to your candies aren't going to set that well and the sign that you'll know that it's too hot is if you start to see white foaming stuff white foamy stuff happening on the top of your mixture here on your syrup now that everything is melted we are going to add in the can of butter and our gour gum and the reason that we have to use gour gum is it is an emulsifier and it is going to allow your oil and your your water to come together as one as one liquid versus being oil and water you know don't mix together an emulsifier allows them to come together as one solid solidified unit in short it basically mushes the oil and the water together to live happily we're going to pour in the our can of butter and i've used a third of a cup so as you can see adding you're adding the can of butter or oil to our gelatin you can mix and mix and mix until the cows come home no matter what those two are never going to blend together now you might get the appearance if you kind of whisk really really quickly you have the appearance that it's combined right that kind of looks like that's all combined however if you go and you set that and if you want to set that up now all of the butter would raise to the top of the mold now if you've got one of these little strainers or a strainer it's great for doing the guru so we're going to use a half a teaspoon of gargum and you're going to gently sprinkle evenly sprinkle it over the top if you don't have a strainer you just want to make sure to try and get it evenly over the top there this will adhere to the oil and allow it to mix in with our with the jello and i'm going to let that sit for a minute and now we're going to get our trusty hand blender [Music] and you'll continue to mix that until it is completely all one color all one unified color you don't see any kind of streaking or any kind of any difference whatsoever that's when you know it it is fully blended and emulsified and you're gonna be how about that texture and once that's done we're just going to let that set to set aside and leave it on the hot water but turn off the heat and then we're going to do our candy syrup all right so for our candy syrup we're going so for the candy syrup you want one cup of sugar a half a cup of corn syrup and a half a cup of water you're gonna mix that together until it is blend till it's all mixed up and your sugar starting to dissolve and we're going to turn the heat on to medium-high and you're going to stir the syrup until it begins to boil so as soon as it starts to boil then you are going to stop stirring that's when we add the candy thermometer and we don't stir it again and then you're also going to want to grab a jar of hot water about whatever something of hot water and a brush so you can wash down the sugar crystals off of the side and that'll prevent your syrup from crystallizing once it begins to boil there we're going to add our candy thermometer i'm going to try to add the candy thermometer now if you ever wonder why i kind of have this weird looking thing the one that i have said it setting on it that thermometer doesn't always work for me it occasionally will fail um this i like the digital but the digital um doesn't have any way of holding on to it it's more meant for just kind of sticking it into checking a temperature and then i have to use the tin foil to protect the digital from the heat so that's why i kind of have this weird makeshift candy thermometer and we're going to cook this syrup to 208 280 degrees soft crack now you can go a little bit if you want your candies a little less chewy you can go a few degrees less you can go to about 275. if you want them a lot chewier then you can go to 300. i seem to find the 280 is perfect for it well for what my liking anyway so we're going to continue to cook that syrup until 280 degrees just remember to wash down any crystal any sugar crystals that may form on the sides just to let you know you're doing this at the medium high it will go fairly quickly so don't leave the kitchen normally you do the sugars at a lower temperature so you have a little bit of time this doing it at the higher temperature it will go very quickly so i'm traveling you don't leave your kitchen and then you also want to get a pot of just cold water or a bowl of cold cold water stand by uh we're gonna put the bottom of the pot in that to stop the syrup the cooking process so we're at 276 270 see how quickly it starts to go 278 279 280 leave the candy thermometer on because we want to bring this temperature down to 240. you can turn your heat off leave it in the water until the temperature starts coming down and then we're just going to set it on the side here until that temperature comes down to 240. so once your temperature comes down you can remove the candy thermometer and we're going to add in ow be careful the syrup is still very very hot you're going to get your gelatin mixture and you're going to have a look and you're going to make sure that you don't see any green or anybody butter separation now you might see a little bit of cut like see how that color there difference that suggests your jello that the air is coming out of so don't worry about that what you care is if you see any kind of green or oily looking so that's good we're going to pour this into this candy syrup and be very careful when you're stirring this now your gelatin is going to be a lot more liquidier than the liquid liquid ear i know i come up with my own words uh then the candy syrup is going to be thicker it's also going to start to solidify as you can see on the spoon that's why you're going to gently stir it and we're going to turn the heat on to bury it to the lowest temperature and you want to make sure to take your spatula and go all the way around the edges the syrup will has a tendency to stick along those edges see so i like to use the hand blender whoops to make sure that everything is fully uh mixed together and blended and emulsified [Music] and then you're just going to gently stir to make sure that it's all nicely mixed so now at this point is when we're going to add in our flavor and additional colors if you like or as i said if you want if you're not doing that you can just go ahead and put this into your bottles right now and get ready to distribute into the molds so i'm going to be adding one of my newest favorite flavors tutti frutti love this flavor i usually use about a cup and a half and again you just want to gently get that all mixed in now if you are going to be splitting uh if you want to do two different colors this is this point you're going to put it to the transferred over to your measuring cup and split it in half or if you wanted to do two different flavors then do that before split it in half add your different flavors but i'm just doing one flavor base two colors okay so i have got now whenever you look at a um a measuring cup always look at it straight on get down at the level and look at it straight on if you look at it from a down level you see you don't get an accurate reading that looks like two and a quarter cups however it's more like two and a third cups so for this one i'm going to do i'm gonna add some more red and i like to use the no taste red i hate the taste of red dye i can always taste it and everything so i like the no taste red the one thing about it however is it doesn't have quite the intensity of red that the regular does but i'd rather forsake a little bit of the intensity on the color versus the intensity on the flavor there we go that's a nice red and the other side i'm going to do purple i'm going to add in some pink i want a more pinky purple versus a dark purple and a couple drops of blue now mix that up see what we get now right now because we did i didn't add the white into it and it looks like it's a solid color it's actually it'll come out kind of still a little bit translucent so if you want to get a solid background and that it's not going to lighten up or get that kind of clear or translucent look you want that solid opaque then you need to add in the white so i'm going to add a couple drops into white on both sides so we have here when we add in the white it's going to dull down our color a little bit so that i'm just going to add in a little bit more of the red and add a little bit more to the purple purple i think i'm gonna leave i like that color but the red i wanna looks kind of orangey and see how much nicer that color is now it's a lot richer and gives you more that solid background makes it opaque versus having that translucent look to it and now i'm just going to get ready to pour it in the bottles and distribute it into the molds all right so now we're ready to distribute into the molds and you can go do half and halves now don't fill up your mold all the way to the top if you do it ends up leaving a sharp edge on your candy that dries out and it doesn't make your candies very pleasant so don't fill them all the way up to the top and it's also when you're trying to pour try and keep it to the middle and just let it distribute it out once you have your mold set up while all filled up you put it into the fridge for uh two hours sometimes it may take a little bit longer basically two hours or until they're set all right so it's been a couple of hours and our candies are ready to come out of the molds and we're gonna make up our sugar sour mix so you're going to add one cup of sugar and to that you're going to add a half a teaspoon of citric acid cut it and you want to make sure to thoroughly mix that in so you're going to get even citric acid on everything not just get like a big hunk of it on one candy that's kind of gross so you want to make sure to thoroughly mix it in now the nice thing with this recipe is as soon as we take them out of the molds we're going to put them right into the sugar this sugar mix you don't have to worry about waiting for them to dry or partially dry before we can add it and the reason for that is citric acid is water soluble so when you do the other gummy recipe when you just take them out they're still wet and gummy bears are essentially water and gelatin so as soon as there's any moisture on them the citric acid will begin will automatically begin to melt it doesn't do it on this because you have the sugar coating or the sugar candy syrup in there that helps protect the gelatin and that's why they don't melt as soon as you put it on and that's why this recipe is way better for doing sour or sugar coated candies now these guys are going to be a lot stickier than your regular gummy recipe so you just kind of pull it and they'll start to peel out and then you just work them out and then just pop them right into your sugar sour mix and as they warm up a bit uh they will start to get a little more tacky so no worries as long as you can pull them out of the molds they're good and they do stick to your fingers they do just kind of put it down into the sugar you can just kind of rub it in and it'll get them off that's nice once the your sugar or your sugar sour mix is on they no longer stick together see look at that and then you just put them on the rack to dry as per usual now what i like to do is i like to put holes in my parchment paper so that way you're getting air from both sides it helps with drying the other nice thing with this recipe is it doesn't take anywhere near as long for these to dry as the regular gummy recipes they're pretty much dry in a few hours to overnight now if they do start to get a little too warm and too hard to get out of the mold just put them back in the fridge for a little while if you actually keep a little bit of sugar on your fingers once they get a little bit sticky it'll help with them not sticking to your fingers a little aid with them coming off see if they stick they will fuse just pull them apart now if you're taking these out and they're just not coming out they're way too sticky um they're too gooey you can put them back in the fridge for a couple of hours or um and if you take them out and they're still not going to come out what you can do is uh put them in the freezer for about an hour take them out put them back in the double boiler on low re-melt them and add a half a tablespoon to one tablespoon of bloomed unflavored gelatin and that should add enough a little more gelatin there that'll fix that right up and if you find that they are too gummy oh sorry not if they're too gummy if they're too chewy they're like rubber bands again same thing just put them back on the double boiler on low remelt them and add a couple of tablespoons of um liquid to it and mix it all in until it's all melted recast them and that should take care of that problem if you've taken them out and there's um your butter is all risen to the back same thing just put them into the double boiler re-melt them add a little bit more gargum and re-emulsify make sure to use the hand blender or your whisk really really well like i showed you earlier so again if they're stuck like that uh check first to see just gently work around if they come away then you're good you can pull it out of the mold but if they're doing that they're not coming it's not coming away at all then they need to either go into the longer go into the fridge longer or to add some more gelatin to them they are a little bit more work but they are definitely worth it in texture and flavor in everything i've pretty much abandoned the other gummy bear recipe personally i just use this recipe now i'll just do either sugar coated or the sweet or the sugar and sour mix option is if um they are being really sticky um they are kind of coming out they're set but they're just really sticky um that can happen because it gets it picks up a little bit too much moisture in the refrigerator you can just let them sit in the molds for a couple of hours on the counter before taking them out that'll assist in drying that out a little bit now if you can stand your candies up it's a good idea some of them won't stand up though too small to whatever decides so if you can stand them up great if not you just want to flip them over every couple of hours until they're dry and as i said before this recipe and the drying time is it's a lot less time and that's it for them so just leave them out and enjoy some awesome sweet and sour gummy candies so that's my tutorial on sweet and sour gummy candies these are the little bad boys they haven't dried yet but you can see they're really nice they're little that little squishy now because they're still wet tastes awesome so i hope you give this recipe a try whether you want to do just sugar coated or the sugar sour it's a great recipe i'm sure that you'll love it if you have any questions at all don't hesitate to put them in the comments i'll always get back to you and i think that's everything i've got for you today well thank you so much for joining time diamond delight edibles wish i could get that straight um thank you for joining diamond delight edibles it's been a pleasure have a wonderful day [Music] you", "gQKQOLJBrUI": "Andavolu: Today, Kim is getting\na sonogram to check on the development of her fetus. Doctor: Baby's head's down,\nso that's good. I want to know if her pot use\nwhile pregnant is actually cause for concern. So I'm going to go talk\nto Dr. Ira Chasnoff. He's a pediatrician\nand researcher who published\nan alarming medical opinion about the dangers\nof pregnant pot use. How are you, Doctor? Hi. Welcome to the Children\nSmart Center. A lot of the children here, their mothers used alcohol\nor drugs during pregnancy, so the children need\na specialized workup and, you know,\nevaluation. [ Ultrasound whirring ] How bad is it if you smoke\npot while pregnant? Anything that affects\nbrain functioning is not good. Babies born exposed\nto marijuana have higher rates\nof low birth weight, higher rates\nof being premature, higher rates of difficulties\nwith executive functioning, the ability to plan\nand complete a task, but the difficulty is that\nthe findings can be very subtle. Right. There are no randomized, controlled studies\nfor marijuana use, much less marijuana\nuse during pregnancy. It hasn't been studied,\nbut at the same time, physicians need to be aware\nthat there are probably risks associated with marijuana\nuse during pregnancy. While Dr. Chasnoff's current\nfocus is marijuana, it isn't the first drug\nhe's warned against. Alcohol, marijuana,\ncocaine, anything, so you have to stay clean. In 1985, his findings\nof behavioral differences of just 23 babies\nwhose moms used cocaine set off fears of\na crack-baby epidemic... Cocaine kids, infants born\nto cocaine-addict mothers. Andavolu: ...the policy\nimplications of which were disproportionately punitive\nto poor black mothers. While prenatal cocaine use\nmay cause complications, 20 years later, follow-up\nstudies show that children born to women who used cocaine were in no worse health\nthan other children born in similar\nsocioeconomic conditions. Crack babies were a myth. Are pot babies\nthe new crack babies? No, I hope not. Uh, we, in all naivet\u00e9,\npublished findings in the midst\nof the War on Drugs, and the War on Drugs was always\na very racially biased... Yeah, but Dr. Chasnoff,\nthe War on Drugs isn't over. You know, I cannot assure\nthat any of this is not used to punish people,\nbut we work very hard. When you have the legal system\nmoving ahead of public health, that's when you\nget into problems. Mm-hmm. And that's exactly\nwhat's happened to marijuana. The legal system has said,\n\"Marijuana is legal.\" From a public health\nperspective, we don't fully understand\nthe implications of legalizing marijuana. If you could sort of\ndesign the way that a medical marijuana\nsystem might work... Mm-hmm. ...how would you, sort of, uh,\naddress this phenomenon? If you're having sex,\ndon't smoke marijuana. who confessed to using cannabis\nduring their pregnancies. I know, right? Hi, nice to see you. Nice to see you. Nice to meet you. -Come on in. Thank you guys for having me. Let's take a seat. Oh, sorry. Absolutely. [ Indistinct chatter ] All of you guys have had\na serious medical condition, so it's not like\nyou're smoking weed to have a good time\nwhile you're pregnant. You're not doing that. That's not what\nyou're doing it for. That is where it's\nso hard to explain. Like, I'm not doing this\nto get stoned. Like, in a way, you got to,\nlike, kind of prove yourself to your doctor, you know,\njust hope that they understand. Andavolu:\nAnd what about the hospital? How do they treat you? Just, um, like a, like a --\nlike a drug addict, but the Child\nProtective Services was the ridiculous\npart for me. They put a little bag that's\non your child's private parts, you know, to, whether it's\na girl or boy, to c-- collect a sample from them,\nand that made me feel horrible. Woman:\nI refused to let them put the bag on my son, and I told them. I was like, \"You want to know\nhow much I smoked? I smoked all day,\nevery day.\" Yeah. I was a single mom\non Medicaid, and I tested positive\nfor marijuana. They made my son\na ward of the state. I couldn't nurse him. I couldn't touch him\nor soothe him or hold him. Oh, my god. It was, yeah, it was\na true nightmare. I had a 4-month\nstint involvement with CPS, urinalysis,\nclasses, the NA meetings. I mean, it was a really\nbig bizarre thing, and it was for marijuana. It's really easy to call\nsomebody a bad mom. People like to judge\npregnant women for almost everything\nthat they do. It's, like... People like to judge women. They get... Yeah. Judge women. Did anyone consider, like,\n\"Hey, I'm going to stop at a certain time period\nbefore the birth so that I can\nat least mitigate some of that risk\nof getting in trouble? I did that... You did that? ...exactly that for at least\n30 days before I had the baby, and I started\nvomiting blood. Throwing up blood? -Yes. -Yeah. Andavolu: Yeah. Well, how about you, Kim? You're getting close\nto your due date. -Right. -What are your plans? My plans are just to quit\nsmoking, um, this week actually. I just want to try as hard as I\npossibly can to make it through. I just don't want to take\nthat chance with the CPS. It's terrifying. Andavolu: With 10 weeks till\nher delivery date and fearing repercussions\nfrom Child Protective Services, Kim has decided to quit pot and face her crippling nausea\nwithout medication. Kimberly: [ Retches, coughs ] \u266a\u266a [ Coughs ] \u266a\u266a [ Vomits ] This sucks. \u266a\u266a Andavolu: Kim is in this\nreally tough situation. She has serious health concerns, but she can't be totally\nhonest with her doctor because she fears\nshe's going to get punished instead of offered health care. So I want to know what the sort\nof broader policy implications are of that fear, so I'm going to go\ntalk to Lisa Sangoi, a family law attorney\nand researcher who's writing the\nfirst-of-its-kind advocacy report\nreport on substance abuse and the child-welfare system. Sangoi: First and foremost,\nthe consensus of every major medical\norganization is that, if you tell\na pregnant woman that, \"If you come to seek\nprenatal care, you risk a doctor calling Child\nProtective Services on you,\" they will not seek\nprenatal care. And that is far worse for\nthe health of the pregnancy and the newborn than any sort\nof controlled substance use. Aren't CPS just sort of doing\ndue diligence to say, \"You're doing something illegal,\nso we're gonna come and check it out to make sure\nthat you're not doing other things\nillegal\"? So what I'm finding\nin my research is that wealthier women\nand white women, they can go to their doctors without fear\nof being drug-tested, but in the public hospitals, uh, that serve primarily\nlow-income populations, the first line of defense\nfor a doctor who discovers that\na woman is using drugs while pregnant is to call\nChild Protective Services. Is this kind of an extension\nof the War on Drugs? The war on drugs\nwas built on the logic that we need to protect children\nfrom the harms of drugs, so it really actually\nshould not come as a surprise\nthe Child Welfare System is ground zero\nfor the War on Drugs. But what happens when\nthe protective impulse of drug-war logic is\nfocused on unborn children? Currently, 18 states consider\nsubstance abuse during pregnancy to be a form of child abuse, and as more state legislatures\ncome under Republican control, more extreme laws\nhave been proposed that require burials\nfor aborted fetuses, imprison pregnant\nwomen for drug use and even endow fetuses\nwith personhood, all of which seek\nto grant an unborn fetus the rights of a born person\nand pile on reasons to strip a woman\nof her right to an abortion. Punishing potential\nrisk of harm to fetuses seems well-intentioned,\nbut is it really just part of a sexist,\nbroad-sided attack on women's reproductive freedom? This risk-of-harm logic\nand analysis eventually extends\nfar beyond drug use. There was a woman who was\n8 1/2 months pregnant. She was in a car crash. She survived, but unfortunately,\nher pregnancy did not, and she was accused\nof manslaughter in part under the theory\nthat she risked harm by driving while\n8 1/2 months pregnant. If that's the case,\nwe are looking at a world where women are treated\nas vessels for their pregnancies and absolutely nothing else. As a woman of color\non public health care, Kim would seem a prime\ntarget for CPS action if they found out\nshe's been smoking pot. I'm catching up with her\nthe week of her due date to see if she has been able to manage\nthe symptoms of her HG without the help of cannabis. -Hey, Krish. -Hey, guys. -Hey. -How's it going? No, please, seriously sit. Sit, okay? It's good to see you. -How are you? -Good. Pretty good, man. How are you? So, like, last time I saw you,\nyou were going to quit smoking pot because you didn't\nwant to test positive on the day of your birth. -Right. -Were you able to? No. I quit smoking, and then I\nstarted throwing up blood again. When I tell the doctors\nand nurses, they're like, \"Are you sure you didn't eat\nsomething red or marinara or...\" I'm like, \"No.\" What was it like\nin the doctor's office? The last one, they had to test\nme, and I went down to the lab, and then I had to go\ngive a sample. I had the first positive test,\nand I told them... So you, wait. You tested\npositive for using marijuana? Yeah. Even if I had quit\nby the time they tested me, it still would have\nbeen there. Take -- It was kind of, like,\nhumiliating. He treated me like I was\na junkie or something. He said, \"Oh, wow. You're really\nhooked to that stuff, aren't you?\" Every time I go there,\nI feel judged. It's hard. It just messed up the whole\nrelationship with the doctor. What does that mean for the day\nthat you're going to deliver? If I test positive\nor the baby does, then CPS is going to talk to us. At worst case is that\nthey take my kids. \u266a\u266a I'm real scared about, like, what's going to happen\nat the hospital. I'm not worried about\nactually giving birth. I'm worried about afterwards. [ Baby crying ]\nWoman: Look at all this hair. You see how long her hair is? -I know. So cute. What's her name\ngonna be? -Solimar. -Solimar? -Solimar. -That's sun and -- sun and sea. -Mm-hmm. -How will you spell it? S-- \u266a\u266a -Hey, man. -Hey. How's it going? Good to see you, man. Good to see you. -Congratulations. -Thank you. Thank you. Hi. Hey. How are you? Check it out. Hey, JD. How are you? Hi. You want to hold her? Yeah. Hi, sweet one. [ Baby cries ] Oh. It's okay. [ Chuckling ] Hey. We've been expecting you. She was born healthy,\nbig, no problems. Wait. What was her birth weight? 6 pounds, 13...? 13 ounces,\nand she gained an ounce a day. Okay. Let's give her back\nto Mom, I think. [ Crying continues ] All right. You got her? Yeah. I think we're going\nto give her a bath now if you want to help us out. Yeah, of course. Here. All right. You want to take her\nfrom me? -Let me stand up. -Oh, okay. Here we go. Okay. You expected CPS to be there. Were they there? Yeah. They tested my blood\nwhen I got there. They tested her first\npoop and meconium, and everything came\nback positive for THC. Both of us. I had, like, the worst possible\noutcomes in my head, but none of that happened. The CPS lady came. She said she didn't\nthink anyone -- anything was going\nto come of it. The next day,\nI got a phone call to set up a home visit, and everything was good. She interviewed us, and she said\nwe seem like we're doing great, and there's no reason\nto be worried about the baby. That's great. Maybe if we had\na different home or we lived\na different way, maybe we wouldn't\nhave been so lucky. I cried out of relief\nafter she left 'cause I was -- everything I was worried\nabout the whole time. We stood up for ourselves and\nour rights and our kids' rights, you know. I'm proud of that. \u266a\u266a When my wife told me\nshe was pregnant, it was one of the happiest\ndays of my life. We were bringing new life\ninto the world, and that's sort of why\npregnancy is so precious, why we're so protective over it. Smoking pot while pregnant\nhas its risks, but the extent of those risks\nwhen you consider how it might help\naren't entirely clear. So feeding women into\nthe flawed child-welfare system because of weed\nperpetuates the myth that good people,\ngood parents, good mothers-to-be\ndon't smoke pot, but things worked out for Kim. She had her baby, and she's this beautiful\ntiny new life. \u266a\u266a I thought Kim's story hinged\non whether she was justified in her choice to smoke pot\nwhile carrying new life, but what I've learned\nis that she doesn't need our justification. Pregnant or not, it's her body,\nso it's her choice.", "bLJts6NdwW8": "so we know Gary let me know full-time you didn't see the oxidation mood make sure I got that running sorry for what one thing

cannabis infused brownies with cannabutter your butter your coconut oil whatever you're infusing whatever sort of fat throw it into the into the crock-pot let it melt then add your D carbs cannabis to D carb this I've ground it up lightly you don't want to kill it you don't want to pulverize it just lightly grind your cannabis this is three and a half grams and I put it in the oven on 240 for one hour this is what it looks like when it comes out of the crock-pot now that is the infused butter like so this comes off that's my butter the infuse this is what I cook with and you can put it on bread like bread and butter whatever this is the actual psychoactive THC infused butter okay I'm just gonna preheat the oven if I can find it there we go to 350 so while I'm mixing the ingredients the ovens preheating a lot of just a lot of edibles that you make with cannabis get really dry so you're gonna you need the extra oil coconut oil or butter spray everything if you're making edibles

start the tutorial I'm going to do a step by step guide with all of the math right now on how to specifically dose your edibles that guide that I'm gonna go through is going to help you in deciding what ratios and quantities to use so what you're gonna need for this whole process is going to be your weed you're gonna need one to two sticks of butter you're gonna need some water a nonstick preferably nonstick saucepan a metal meat thermometer or you could use like a laser thermometer you're also gonna need some cheesecloth it's usually in the aisle buy like all of the cooking utensils like the spatulas and stuff like that it's usually in that area and then besides that you'll just need some type of cooking sheet or baking dish or jar to solidify the butter and oh and you'll need like a grinder or something to grind up the wheat obviously but with that being said let's make some edibles so the first step when we dose our edibles is we want to find the THC percentage of our weed now I made this little chart right here for you guys in case you know maybe you didn't get your weed from the dispensary if you catch my drift if you do get your weed from the dispensary the label is going to tell you the percentage but in case you don't know so we that you just get off the street that's like hey it's pretty good it gets me high but you know it's not like super frosty top shelf [ __ ] that is gonna be typically five to ten percent THC potency higher end weed something a little bit nicer that's gonna be like eleven to fifteen percent so I would say like the ten to fifteen percentage range is probably pretty average and then if you get your weed at the dispensary it's usually gonna be fifteen percent up to even thirty percent now the national average percentage THC percentage is ten percent now that we have figured out the percentage of THC in our weed we have to do some math this is optional this part right here which I'm going to explain to you guys there is actually a THC a to THC conversion so like I was saying earlier let's say your weed has 10% THC a we're gonna multiply that by 10 to get the milligrams per grams ratio so if your weed is 10% we multiply that by 10 that is 100 milligrams of THC per gram 100 milligrams of THC M equals eighty seven point seven milligrams of THC per gram that is all very confusing and you know eighty nine point seven is close enough to 100 so for simplicity reasons I just use 101 THC to THC ratio so 100 to 100 that way you don't have to you worry about this whole conversion here we're just gonna use a one-to-one ratio in which case you can ignore this conversion so now that you have your percentage of your weed for simplicity let's just say that your weed is 10% THC or 100 milligrams of THC per gram as I was explaining before that's the national average so I made this little chart for you guys that you can also screenshot so in this chart we have this side here is going to be our available amount of weed the total milligrams per batch this is how many milligrams of THC are in each brownie or cookie each individual serving if you have 1/8 of weed which is three and a half grams that's gonna be 350 milligrams per batch if we divide that by 12 that is 29 milligrams per brownie or per cookie so obviously like I said before for a batch of 24 servings you're going to divide the total milligrams per serving by - since we're doubling it honestly if you're gonna be using a full 1/2 ounce or a full ounce of weed I would say go ahead and make a batch of 24 I mean that's entirely up to you but if you put half to a full ounce of weed into half a cup of butter it's going to taste very like earthy and weeding again this is up to you use this table for reference and you can tweak the numbers as needed so yeah guys that is how you dose edibles if you have questions just leave them in a comment and I will be happy to answer those for you and then I'm putting these full pages out here so you can screenshot them and here I have the entire step-by-step guide to actually making the butter but if you want to go ahead and screenshot this for simplicity purposes please go ahead so first grab a cookie sheet line it with some parchment paper for this batch I am not using flour like nugs I'm using our shape jar so every time we've been rolling joints or blunts and there's leftover shape we put it in this jar along with the stems so I'm going to actually wait and see how much we've accumulated and I'm gonna use that and I know it looks like super stemming and everything home but there's like a shit-ton of Keith at the bottom if you could see that in the previous clip so I'm just gonna go ahead and weigh all of the shake and stems and see what we've got over time and as far as my dosing goes I'm just gonna say that the shake is about 10% put that in the oven to the carb at 200 degrees for about 30 minutes and every like 10 minutes or so you're gonna want to take that out to kind of stir it so the surface area is even so coarsely grinding the D carved weed is going to help the butter taste cleaner but you can use a coffee grinder I just don't really recommend it and then I'm turning my stove on low and we're putting in a full cup or two sticks of butter in there along with one cup of water so you want equal butter to water ratio and what the water does is helps it to regulate its temperature regulating the temp is key with making cannabutter so once the butter is kind of melted in the water as you can see you can go ahead and add in your ground-up flour and just mix it in there and then once the mixture has started to kind of simmer like this we're gonna go ahead and take our thermometer and take the temperature so the key here is we want the time sure to always be within 160 and 200 we do not want it to be over 200 so after I let this cook for 3 hours you can do 2 to 4 hours that's what it's gonna look like go ahead and grab a dish and some cheesecloth so I'm just taking the cheesecloth and we're going to you'll have to cut it because it comes in huge pieces to fit over a bowl that's what I'm using you can also use a jar or something like that and we're gonna go ahead and pour all of that mixture into the cheesecloth [Music] so once you have that all in there you're just gonna go ahead and wring out all the butter don't squeeze too hard because the cheesecloth can rip and then you'll have to start over that's happened to me before but yeah once you wring it out all the way you'll see what it looks like when it's dry [Music] yup Phelps like literal [ __ ] so we're gonna now transfer the butter to some type of cooking dish if you don't have a glass dish like this you can use a cookie sheet I've done that before and then we're going to saran wrap this and put it in the fridge for 1 to 2 hours to solidify and then once we take it out of the fridge it's going to look like this and go ahead and take off the saran wrap and we're going to scratch the surface to see if any water has separated under the butter so if you added a lot of water throughout to regulate the temperature you'll have to crack the surface and drain the water out from the butter but since mine was good I'm good about regulating the temperature all the water evaporated from my butter while I was cooking it so now we are good to go we're making brownies so melt that butter back down put in a cup of white sugar we're gonna do 4 eggs and 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract [Music] so next I'm just sifting in the dry ingredients it really makes a difference it's 1 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder and then a cup of all-purpose flour go ahead and sift that add 1/2 a teaspoon of salt and a half a teaspoon of baking powder not baking soda and then go ahead and mix that up [Music] I'm putting this back into the same pan because it already has all that butter residue on it so it's like pre-greased then we're going to stick this in the oven at 350 degrees if I remember correctly for 25 minutes but don't quote me on that and this is the finished product you guys all done and ready to be eaten and I did testis and they were fired but thanks for watching", "2aSZZoScY70": "[Music] welcome to infuse these the cooking show where everything is infused with cannabis especially me your host Matt lamb today we're making chocolate three different types that were making vegan dark chocolate white chocolate and milk chocolate [Music] this episode of infuse needs is brought to you by 424 high-quality edibles delivered fresh in Los Angeles and Orange counties California please visit 420 food club.com [Music] for this recipe we are going to be using cannabis infused cocoa butter instead of regular butter or coconut oil so for the cocoa butter tutorial you can see a couple of videos back I'll put links in the description for a full tutorial on this but I'm just going through a real nutshell version of it here but basically you would take your amount of cocoa butter which for each recipe is a half a cup and a half a cup to about 1/8 amounts of cannabis would be good and you're gonna activate your cannabis by decarboxylate again in the oven and then infuse it into your oil for an hour to two hours over a double boiler you could also use an herbal infuser machine or some method like that the my fast infuser is a good one and basically you're going to infuse cocoa butter much like you do butter and that's going to be one of the main basis for each of the three recipes that we do today so if you need a full recipe for that please check the link in the description for that tutorial first up is the dark chocolate recipe which happens to be vegan it's the only one that is at this though and for that you need the half a cup of the infused cocoa butter half a cup of cocoa powder 1/2 a cup of real maple syrup half a teaspoon of vanilla extract a pinch of salt and optionally you could add some chopped toasted nuts or some dried fruit the first step is going to be to put your half a cup of melted cocoa butter into a double boiler set up and if it's not melted already it's about a quarter pound and you can use a quarter pound and then we're also going to be adding in now our cocoa powder and if you let your cocoa butter get hot first that cocoa powder will melt much easier and just melt right so give it a couple of minutes before you add in your cocoa powder so it'll melt easier then we're gonna add in our maple syrup next we're gonna add in our vanilla extract pinch of salt and that's it pretty much for the ingredients now we're just gonna whisk those together if you're gonna add chopped nuts or raisins or cranberries or anything like that you want to have that later and before you pour it into your moles which is what I'm going to do I'm gonna head and chop up some cranberries if you don't have a candy mold you can also just pour this out on a piece of parchment paper and then break it into bark and pieces and then I'm adding also some toasted almonds and I'm chopping those up and I'm putting a variety I'm adding some with nuts and almonds I mean with nuts and cranberries some was just nuts and some was just cranberries okay and now I took a little too long doing that so it's thickening a little bit more than I like for it to but it's okay you can still add little spoon and just jiggle it mix it up with a spoon and then just kind of jiggle the pans and settle it down in there so that's fine okay so my molds are ready and I'm gonna let those sit for a couple of hours to cool off and to harden to set I actually put them in the in the refrigerator because it's been really hot in California lately now these are really delicious dark chocolates they're kind of bittersweet and there's some problems you can see on the surface that had to do with the molds and we'll get to that at the end of the video now let's move on and to our white chocolate and for that you need a half a cup of the infused cocoa butter a half a cup of powdered milk two thirds of a cup of powdered sugar two teaspoons of vanilla extract a pinch of salt and again optionally there's toasted nuts or dried food if you want to add that in there are a couple of mistakes that I made in this recipe when I made the white chocolate that I slice is gonna help me make the milk chocolate turned out great but I'm gonna go ahead and show you how I did the white chocolate and then we'll talk about the mistakes that I made at the end of the video so make sure you watch till the end of the video to figure out how I could have improved this but we're taking our powdered milk now I'm taking the half cup of coconut butter or the cocoa butter and melted it and cut it hot now I'm adding in the powdered milk and you can see that powdered milk is actually kind of big granules it's it's big grainy pieces and that's going to be part of the problem that we'll get to later now I'm also adding in my vanilla extract I'm going to go ahead and whisk those together and if you can see on the side of the pan there's a little little graininess that's not really dissolving in that good but now i'm maxeen sifting in my powdered sugar and this was another lesson that I learned during this version of the chocolate and that I could have sifted that chocolate beforehand instead of sifting it into my pan and making kind of a mess and looks like it had a snowy winter night but anyway that was a little bit of a mess it was a to hard to clean up but I should have sifted that powder beforehand that powdered sugar okay now you have all your ingredients and don't forget your pinch of salt that I didn't get on camera but I didn't put it in there and I've taken it off the heat and you can see it's it's you can maybe see from the video here but it's a little bit clumpy looking kind of grainy looking which is that powdered milk not dissolving fully but I went ahead and took a chance and figure that my work out okay and also after it's at a minute you don't really see this in the video either but it's sort of the oil seemed to separate to the top I was really concerned about how this white chocolate was going to turn out and it looks a lot more yellow there's something with the lighting there the brightness of the light it makes it look a little more yellow than it actually was and when it actually hardened in the refrigerator after a little while I was really pleasantly surprised at how well it all homogenized together what seemed like the oil separating to the top just went away it all seemed a very consistent from top to bottom and there were some graininess still in it on the on the tooth when you eat it but I'll get to that in the end and tell you the solution to that problem and so here we go we're going to go into the milk chocolate which turns out great by the way we're going to have a half a cup of infused cocoa butter a half a cup of powdered sugar a quarter cup of powder two whole milk 1/4 cup of cocoa powder a half a teaspoon of vanilla extract and a pinch of salt and again the optional nuts and fruit if you want to add them in and here's where I learned some lessons last time and I didn't sift my powdered sugar beforehand so this time I decided to go ahead and sift my powdered sugar and my cocoa together so the first step is to go ahead and sift your powdered sugar and your cocoa together and to a bowl and have those ready to go you can see sifting it together really makes it nice and silky and here's the other lesson that I learned from the white chocolate recipe with the problem with the milk is to take the powdered milk and put it in a blender or into the ninja like I have and just eviscerate it until it's a very very fine powder so it'll just blow away easily so I've added in my cocoa butter here I've let that get hot and now I'm adding in my finely finely powdered powdered milk and you can see this time it just dissolves right in there it just melts right into it so quickly and disappears into it and not like a grainy sludge like it was last time it's a much smoother consistency and also sifting together that cocoa powder and the powdered sugar made that dissolve so much more quickly is so much easier so if I had done that on the white chocolate I would have been much happier with the final result it would have been had a much smoother consistency anyway this this milk chocolate is going so now I'm adding in my vanilla extract I'm going to also add in a pinch of salt it only takes just a couple of minutes you get a real nice glossy very slick look to your chocolate at that point go ahead and take it off the heat and then you can add in your mixers if you go on to and put it into your molds and I can tell by this one already that it's going to be a lot better than the white chocolate so I learned my lessons there and you can see it really turned out good and the the chocolate there that Mel chocolate has a nice snap to it and it's probably my favorite of the three although that dark chocolate really has a nice richness to they just it's delightful really great so here's what I learned though to make sure you get your molds nice and clean that's why on the dark chocolates got those kind of messed-up looking spots on it there was some leftover oil from a previous time I didn't see make sure you keep water away from your chocolate make sure you pulverize your powdered milk into a fine powder before you add it into there and also pre sift your ingredients and it'll melt into a lot quicker this episode has been

Galliano from magical butter calm and as always thank you for watching and don't forget subscribe to our YouTube channel just a goodness magical magical", "LuuKvfonSis": "Angell Tiger is a speaker and activist and an entrepreneur she works with the LA cannabis medical task force and runs her own cannabis edibles company known as Ruby doobie and we've got a lot of Ruby dooby goodies in front of us right now angel thanks for thanks for joining me thank you for inviting me Dave yeah I'm very excited to talk to you because I've wanted to do something a little more in-depth on pot for a long time and and you brought pot cookies brownies let's get into this stuff first okay and then we'll talk about the history at legalization what do we got in front of us these are some of the things that I make sweet dreams brownie it's a dusted with a little bit of sea salt on top it's about 57 milligrams here so 37 milligrams of THC what does that mean so you you ate that how do you feel after well I personally would not eat a whole brownie right I would have half and that's plenty for me but it really depends on your own metabolism and your your how experienced you are and it can differ on depending on the day and on how much you've eaten that day right and doshas dosage guidelines very you know I've seen recommended dosages between 5 and 15 milligrams for people or some who want between 20 and 30 and this is all sort of unchartered territory for a lot of people because for a long time you know I think I said once on the show when I got my weed card I went in there and I said you know they showed me wax they showed me oil they showed me edibles I said well do you have any just weed you know green buds like old fashioned weed and that made me feel like old I got a guy wants a smoked weed but this is sort of the new thing right well you I think not as many people are familiar with edibles but it's been around and it's a great way to make use of the whole plant because really what when you smoke you're smoking the flowers the buds mmm but you still have all of the leaves and the trim and the small buds and all of that has a you know active ingredients in it too and that's primarily what I used to make my goodies and here's a peanut butter brownie ginger cookie the crew is very excited by the way I'm happy ginger cookies credible cookies and chocolate chip cookies and I make cakes and other things too lemon bars yeah so you make all this stuff and this is for people that may want the medicinal benefits this is for people that may want the recreational benefits it doesn't matter to you right like you're selling it then and yeah it's nice of someone alleviates some pain but right well I work with the dispensaries I work with a handful of dispensaries in my area so I am a member that's that's providing edibles for my fellow members sure and you know you can't really you you can't in California you still have to get a doctor's recommendation to even go to those dispensaries right so my sacha hard it's not it isn't right and and it's tough to make the distinction between what's recreative to distinguish between recreational and medicinal because if it's if you're using it to relax at the end of the day and to de-stress hmm that's me that's it isn't it in some ways yeah all right so let's get a little bit into your story and then we'll talk about business and legalization and all that chef so you got into weed basically I think you were smoking it recreationally but the reason you really got into this was because you were having migraines and pretty much the Western medicine that you were trying just wasn't anything right yes but I think there were two forces that kind of both intersected and and drove me into cannabis definitely my migraines I I've had migraines for many many years and about ten years ago they started getting a lot worse and more frequent and I was trying all kinds of different medications I had a steroids injected into my neck to try to get rid of them I had some prescriptions that were so strong that they require that the triplicate prescription you know and nothing helped me I mean lots of times that the drugs would irritate my stomach so much that I would feel worse sometimes they would just knock me out and that's how I was survived my migraines no and cannabis is really what allowed me to to continue living and manage them without having to check out for weeks at a time or days at a time so that definitely treating my migraines was one forest and also a desire to simplify my life you know I am I was working at the XPrize Foundation I was a chief of staff there and you know very rewarding challenging position but I just felt that there was something missing you know I I wasn't spending very much time with my son who was two years old at the time I would have to travel a lot and I just wanted to create a change in my life where where I would not be so dependent on on a check grow growth my own food and cook my own meals and and rather than pay someone to do this and that I wanted to do those things I wanted to be the one with with my family right so that's really interesting so it wasn't just I want to get stoned and have a good time you got into the edible garden thing which it was nice you were growing weed but you were also growing stuff to actually eat and to lead to feed your child we were growing in at one point we were going enough food in our garden that it was too much for us to even eat I mean neighbors would come and we encouraged our neighbors to come and tomatoes artichokes peppers eggplants collard greens charred kale I mean we still have you know lemon trees apple trees nectarines oranges it's a beautiful thing to just go outside and pick your food and you know you don't have to get in your car yeah yes you can't get anything fresher than that yeah it's funny I have I mean I live in LA - and you know I have a little outdoor space with a little garden and even if I'm just plucking tomatoes or something I find that very therapeutic oh it is so just that action of doing of growing something for yourself whether it's marijuana or a tomato or a pepper or something even right there connecting with nature this is all intertwined with ultimately you going into this business I believe so I mean it's wanting to simplify wanting to be more in touch with nature you know it's so easy to get disconnected from food and to know what food looks like when it's actually growing I mean when I when we first planted our garden it was with the help of a nonprofit called la green grounds and we had 50 volunteers come out and help us plant our front yard and our parkways and I was intimidated because I had never tried to grow food before and I didn't know how it all worked and it's I'd never put my hands in the dirt and planted anything and to watch things grow and to be able to feed my family that way and and help you know feed the neighborhood it was an amazing experience and food food is medicine you know cannabis is medicine I mean I really don't see much of a difference right so you see this green thing that grows naturally from the earth like all this other stuff that we eat you see that just sort of as an extension of every other thing but the city wasn't that thrilled right with your your garden so here you are a person that sort of takes life into your own hands on your own property and the city of Los Angeles what did they do well okay going back a little while I what got me inspired to plant the garden as I watched a TED talk by Ron Finley I don't know if you've heard of him the gorillas garden against gangster garden oh okay yeah so um the whole idea of that he presented growing your own food is like printing your own money I mean there were some things that just resonated so deeply with me that immediately after I saw the talk I I got in touch with la green grounds and said I I need to learn how to do this how can I volunteer and it turns out they were actually looking for an LA resident to plant a garden and the timing was perfect so we planted we were selected and that's how we got our garden so yeah the city though didn't want you to do it it's something all right so Ron when he when he did his TED talk he had planted an edible garden a few years before mine and was sighted and went to City Council and made the case that you know it doesn't make sense you should allow people to grow food on their on their parkways and the City Council at that time agreed and said that they would work to change the laws in fast forward two years later I plant you know we plant our garden and I was operating under the assumption that it was all good right the the changes were in the works but a few months after this we were cited I mean a guy came to my house and kind of aggressively said you know all of this has to come out and you have 48 hours to put it all back to the way it was and so this had nothing to do with weed just to me know this is known squash yeah oh yes eggplants oh yeah things like that so that because we had the support of a lot of you know la green grounds and Ron and it was easy to to get attention drawn to the to the issue it had been going on for some time Lopez from the LA Times came out and and wrote an article about our garden and it it helped bring the City Council's attention back to this issue and not long after that they did change the laws so you anyone in LA can can grow fruits and vegetables on their on their Parkway before you had to there was only a short list of approved things you could grow right and if you wanted to deviate from that you had to I think filed a request and I think was like $400 to even ask just to ask to use your own property yeah your own yeah and then you know you might not get the approval yeah so now I think the way the law reads is you can grow whatever you want except for some some fruit trees are not allowed to be on the Parkway but it was it's a huge step right right now as long as you have a medical marijuana license you can also grow eat I'm guessing you can't do that in the front of your house though I don't think it was it would be such a good idea probably not a great idea all right well I don't want to get too into the weeds on that one antenna but I thought it was an interesting way to start because it shows how marijuana and legalization and medicinal uses and all that are so tied into our legal system and then we can get into some of that stuff so alright so you have the migraines you start saying all right I'm going to smoke weed to make myself feel better how long did it take to figure out what worked for you what actually was the right strain and can you talk about strains a little bit well you know I I know with some conditions people look for particular strains you know I think okay so there there yeah let's do let's do one away yeah when you talk about cannabis there there's cannabis indica and sativa right I sit there they look different physically like sativa plants are usually taller and leaner thinner branches and grow better in warmer climates kazar kind of shorter and bushier and hard ear besides that indicas are usually they help to relax you most people will use them at night too as a sleep aid or and sativas generally will give you more energy let you keep more focus so more people will use sativas during the day because you can still function all my comedian friends that get stoned on sativas and write all day yeah exactly right and then within okay so you have strains that are either indica or sativa or they can be a hybrid and then each particular strain has its own profile how much THC is in there how much CBD is in there yeah and so let's unpack that a little bit so THC is the psychoactive are correct and CBD is is it's the medicinal part is there to describe that THC also has medicinal properties but it is the psychoactive a element CBD is is cannabidiol it's another cannabinoid those aren't the only two I mean there there are others and but CBD does seem to have most of the medicinal value I mean it can it can it's been shown to stop some tumor growth it's you know it's great for pain relief its reduces inflammation you know it's I mean I have a friend that takes CBD well for anxiety right and she told me all she does literally is it she's a little dropper in the morning she drops like two drops of every time that's it it doesn't have the diarrhea and vomiting and thoughts of suicide and restless leg syndrome and all the other crazy things that come with all the commercials that you see on TV for all these other antidepressant it's it's there it's so gentle I mean it has so many benefits and has never killed anyone um mentioned that at the top I've never murdered in yeah yet to happen but it's it still boggles my mind that a plant first of all that has so many medicinal properties so and besides medicine I mean what about you know renewable energy and you know paper you know I mean it's it's strong it's a strong fiber I mean replace so many things the fact that we look at it is such an evil thing I don't understand yeah how can I can tell it it truly boggles the mind yes yeah yes all right so we have THC CBD and then you have the indica and sativa and the hybrids of that so for the medicinal stuff let's just do that first people if you didn't want to get stoned but you just wanted medicinal benefits that's where you would use just the CBD is that right um okay CBD yes you you want that but there's been a lot of research research that shows that CBD alone is not as effective as when you mix it with THC meaning that it's the whole plant that you want to treat you with not just taking a one piece of it um I think it it's referred to as the entourage effect because there's so many elements and they all kind of work together so people who are looking for CBD are usually looking for CBD rich strains or in some cases you know like the concentrates and things like that but I think for the most part you'll find that they're more effective when when there is a little THC in there yeah so when you found the right one for you well first up how long did it take for you to find weed that was like oh these migraines are dying you know I didn't even think about weed as a treatment for my migraines because when I get bad migraines I would get very nauseous dizzy a smoking pot was the last thing I thought would help me really but then I I did read that it helps and for me it's it it relaxes me enough that I mean it it helps the nausea and also it helps me control the anxiety that comes along with with the onset of a migraine I don't know if it's like two things attacking you at once if the migraine but then knowing it's coming now you're said oh my gosh about that yes and the need to try to hit both it treats both of those things yeah yeah yeah um all right so then you started doing that it was working when did you say all right I could make a business out of this or I got it I gotta tell people what's going on here well you know a friend of mine was baking and I was fascinated by it and so I would look up recipes and send them to me you should try this you should try that and he's finally he got to the point where he said you know what angel you should try it so I started experimenting and that's how I got introduced to making edibles and then I started trying them because well honestly I tried a few edibles and hated them I mean this is going back to like 2008 or something I mean before they had perfected right the brownies in the cook exactly I mean at that time you'd go to a dispensary and you'd see stuff that was just in like Ziploc bags and you know totally unappetizing to look at and oftentimes didn't taste very good and I mean I found myself in those early days just sort of like you know eating it real quick and just hoping for the best when now it's like literally it's like going into a great Baker oh you can get any anything pizzas sauces so chocolate bars can be any I can think of yeah you", "DoRyjd2zKwY": "what's good bass draw militia bass draw keys here i'm your friendly neighborhood negro and welcome to another episode of good eats in today's video guys we got a highly requested video for you today we're going to do our own homemade nerd ropes and you know that they're goodies for 20 style so without any further ado let's go ahead and get into it let's do [Music] way all right guys and real quickly here i do want to invite everybody please check out our membership program that we just started here on the channel it really does help with making all these videos also if you're interested

videos so guys please if you can support us right here on the on the youtube membership program or on patreon now let's go ahead and get into this video here we go all right guys so let's go ahead and get into today's video today we're going to be doing our own homemade nerve ropes this video has been highly requested for quite some time so we're going to go ahead and make it happen today now there is an easy way to do it and there's a hard way to do it of course i'm going to show you the easy way to do it today if you guys want the like the harder way maybe we can do that at a later time but today i'm going to show you the easiest way to make your homemade nerd ropes so the first thing that we got to do is i'm going to show you what we need we're going to be using some is it haribo i don't know is it haribo hariba let's go haribo we're going to use haribo um gold bears this is what i was saying about the easy way and the hard way these are ways just to take these bears right here we're going to melt them down in the microwave that's the easiest way the hard way would be the harder way i was ashamed to be to go ahead and make our own gelatin just like you would do when we're making our gummy bears you can go and make your gelatin that way as well and do it but we're going to go ahead and just melt these down and do it the easy way and of course with nerd ropes you're going to need some nerds so i went to the store and i got some nerds so as you can see right here i have a baking sheet on the baking sheet i have some parchment paper what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna take some aluminum foil and what we're gonna do is we're gonna actually make kind of like you can call it like a mold and that way we able to we'll be able to distribute our nerds and make our our nerd ropes the way that we want to make them all right but first what we got to do is we have to take some aluminum foil and we're actually going to make our mold you can say so that way we'll be able to distribute our nerds evenly let me show you what i mean you're going to take some aluminum foil we're going to make kind of like an accordion shape let me show you all right so you can see we have a piece of aluminum foil and we're going to do an accordion shape what i mean by that is you're going to hold it like this you're going to fold it like this and then we're going to [Music] hold it back like this we'll do that back and forth all right so you see we folded it back and forth now we just want to open it all right so that way you can you guys can see what i've done i've just made you can basically say like a w or m whatever that way we have places where we can actually put our nerds right we can put our nerds in here are you guys getting a good picture this way i don't think so let me raise up the camera and get a better angle for you guys but i don't think you're getting a good a good angle let me raise you guys up some there we go i think i made this a little bit too long i do believe i can fix that though there we go so i made him too long but i fixed that just by tearing off so now you can guys can see better what i'm talking about so what i'm proposing to do is [Music] now you see we have peaks and valleys in the valleys we're going to actually form our nerd ropes you see what i'm saying so what we're going to do is we're going to pour our nerve ropes in here right for the bottom layer and then what we're going to do is we're going to put these bears inside of this measuring cup and melt them down in the microwave at that point that's where we're going to medicate it now as far as how to medicate this you can use tincture you can use coconut oil it's up to you we're going to use some coconut oil today but if you got some tincture use that and as far as how much you want to use it's really based upon how strong do you want it i'm going to use two or three tablespoons of coconut oil for this but it's really up to you about how much do you want to medicate it if you're talking about how much thc you're putting in it that you know it just depends on how strong did you make your oil how strong did you make your tincture and then from that you can go ahead and you know put it in accordingly so let's go ahead and do the first part of this which is putting the nerds in here i'm gonna take a box open them i'm gonna start putting them in here i got seven boxes so hopefully that's enough [Music] if it's not oh no [Music] oh nerds all right [Music] and i said i'm going to try something on this last one what i want to do is i really want to take some spray and like spray it in here [Music] because as you can see i did these without any spray right here and so i'm wondering how how they're gonna be as far as sticking to the aluminum foil in the past when i've used things with aluminum foil and it's sticking it's been really hard to come off i'm just really trying to make sure they got an even coat so let me do that coconut oil cooking spray and i'm just going to [Music] and that's going to be our test to see if we should have sprayed it i just thought about it right now all right so look take some more of these nerds put them in here all right so we're pretty good on that i have four rows ready to do four ropes i bought a lot of nerds so i can now always do more batches so now what we got to do is we're going to take our bears right here we're going to put them in this measuring cup pyrex measuring cup put it in the microwave we're going to melt them down and then that's when we're going to take and our fused oil and medicate this up obviously if you don't want to medicate it just don't use the oil don't use any tincture if you want to make fantastic nerd ropes just like this that'll be just fine so yeah here we go all right so there's two cups in this bag we're going to use one cup right now like i said i'm doing this in batches so that way everything will work out the way we want it to so i'm going to take a cup of these gummy bears there's two cups in the bag we're going to take half of this and let's go ahead and put this in the microwave and melt this down and i'll show you what it looks like when it's finished this is two and a half minutes in the microwave and so you can see it's melted down now look at that so we're gonna do now that just melts it down we're going to take our coconut oil you can use tincture if you have tincture and like i said depends on how strong you want it i'm gonna do two tablespoons you know what i really you know what three tablespoons why not three tablespoons in there we're going to stir it up make sure you stir it up nice we're going to put this back in the microwave so we can warm this back up and keep it liquid once that happens and we take it out i'm going to put it in this squeeze bottle to make it easier to do the lines for the nerd ropes there's a lot of ways that you can do i've seen people pouring it cutting bags and that kind of stuff i think the easiest way to do is going to be with a one dollar squeeze bottle that you can get from the dollar store if you need a link for this i will put it in the description for you but yeah back in the microwave we go all right guys so we're out of the microwave now what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna take this and i'll pour it inside of here to make it easier [Music] so now we got this in here let's go ahead and do some lines that doesn't sound right let's put some lines in here so we can go ahead and medicate this go slow all right guys that's pretty hot so i'm going to use my magical butter glove in order to do it [Music] there we go very nice [Music] and this is going to be the easiest way for you to do it so you can control what you're doing what i like to do is just go down one time up one time and that'll be good enough [Music] it's like the easiest way to control what you're doing you can put exact strings in there perfect look at that look at that beautiful that's the way to do it without any of the waste and what's so great about it is in this squeeze bottle if it goes down in temperature all you got to do is warm it up a little bit and you can continue to do what you're doing all right guys so now that we got that done before this dries up let's go ahead and put some nerves back on the top of this [Music] all right guys so now you can see that we have everything covered there we go so now we have our [Music] gumby mixture in between the nerds and now all we got to do is just let them sit all right guys so what i'm going to do is i'm going to put these in the refrigerator for 30 minutes and then i'm going to take them out and take them off the take them out of the mold here and show you what they look like so yeah give me 30 minutes we're going to put them in the refrigerator and we'll be back in 30 minutes all right guys so it's been 30 minutes inside the refrigerator all right so what i'm going to do now is i'm going to attempt to peel these off see if they're set [Music] look at that it doesn't matter about if all the uh excess nerds fall on the tray that's why we put the parchment paper down look at that yeah i told you guys this is the easiest way to do it nero nero all right so these have been coming off pretty easy here doing it the way that i did it these are the ones by the way these are the ones that we didn't put the the spray down this one right here is the one that we did this right here is with no spray nerd rope nerd bro all right now this one is the one with the uh with the sprite and they came look the one with the spray came right off so i would say guys you might want to use this break because the one with the spray came right off look at that [Music] alright guys so i hope that you found this

today I'm gonna be eating one of these twisted extracts jelly bombs so this is the raspberry z-bone so what this is is a fruit get me it's a Lego block basically where it is so contains cannabis obviously so apparently it's Alisa katene it says are jelly bomb did designed to provide constant reliable delivery system for the ingestion of cannabis direction cut into eight equal doses of ten milligrams each first time users take a single ten milligram dose about 40 to 60 minutes for full effect dose may be adjusted as needed or so scheduled so yeah it says active ingredients is it's a made from hybrid cannabis extract winterized and decarboxylated so we're gonna bust this thing open and then we're gonna take a good look at it and then I'm going to eat it so basically it comes it does come in like a resealable bag but I was just at the top because I never eat these single-dose well they are single boats but not 10 milligram goes but anyway so this is what the jelly Guam actually looks like so it literally is a label block I'll pull up some close-ups and whatnot but yeah wicked constant constantly good consistently consistently good yeah nice consistency smells amazing the effects of these are awesome but I'm not gonna just eat one today I'm gonna be eating - Lego blocks today so this is 160 milligrams together which is a pretty decent dose for a lot of people I guess but considering work in the cannabis community and constantly smoking constantly trying edibles constantly trying new things I should be able to do this so - wicked stuff yeah the aftertaste the aftertaste right away is cannabis yeah that's really good um yeah I eat these on occasion almost two three times a month I won't eat these every time I do eat these I have a wicked sleep wicked sleep I try not to eat everyday just because I want to kind of keep my tolerance a nice level my tolerance was already two eyes as it is so yeah again thanks for watching yeah Cheers", "tsTpurtMuEE": "so I'm in Oregon and at my first pot shop that was actually open and you can only buy one edible per day and I did not buy an edible that time THC I've got one that's high and see beady because i heard that is good for PTSD and I love America just like the people in Portland and I'm doing this trip so our vets can get healthy too many military suicides with the zoloft we need something that's going to make work I think the CBD the low THC pot I think that's the solution have a great day", "yK4OR0yt0rg": "what's up everybody my name is Sarah P and welcome back to the haze today I'm coming at you with another edible review today we're gonna be doing the spicy chamoy sweeter high gummy is now sweeter hi is a company I believe based in California they do a lot of different products I think they do like vaporizers edibles so on and so on on their website I couldn't find too much information on them specifically but they say they specialize in high quality lead which I think all these companies do anyway at this point these guys are the 300 milligrams on the packaging and it does not tell you which how much milligrams is in each candy strip which is the hard part but on the back to tell you the nutrition it has lots of sugar so if that's something that concerns you be aware of that but they are very very delicious let's just go into opening them they have one of these on them not one of those child safety loved ones again they don't tell you how much milligrams they're in each strip but here is one of the strips now I personally don't like sour candies I don't have a high tolerance for sours but if you do you will absolutely love them they're very similar sour points you like sour patch kids those aren't these are for you I'm sure these are gonna be good the spiciness too is also not overwhelming and if you're not really into spice this won't really hurt you it's gonna be like comparable to like those little sweet Mexican candies with the spice around it those those are the most similar to these other than the sour being like obviously really overwhelming for me this flavor on these guys are really really good I haven't tried the other flavors but the spicy and the sweet the combination is super super nice the high so for me from those guys you do get high I wanted to say that it feels like 300 milligrams I ate an entire pack of these in one day and it felt like probably like a hundred and fifty so I don't know who does their testing but yeah it's definitely if you're looking for 300 milligrams this will be a little bit of a fall short but if you're looking for 150 labeled 300 this is for you it was not overwhelming high either I didn't get those little butterflies feelings in my tummy I just started a little giggly I'm always feeling the loose and then I fell asleep which is a thing I gotta say about edibles they will make you knock out I fell asleep like 7 p.m. and woke up at 11 so if you want to sleep these are a great sleep aid honestly um I don't know why they didn't get me super high and just made me sleepy usually both come together but I don't know maybe way to hit me or maybe it was what I was doing that day but yes these will make you sleep won't make you get extremely high won't make you get paranoid will make you get in your head but if you're looking sleep these guys are a great option also for smell wise in my last standing a video a lot of people are wondering about the smell I get no THC flavor no THC smell but if you're looking for something and that can be really hot on the low somebody can take in public something that you're afraid someone might smell it in your backpack person like that you won't get this with this this you don't smell any THC no oil nothing even in the flavor you couldn't you couldn't tell the difference between this and a regular candy to be honest so yeah if I was you and I saw these guys at the dispensary it's 300 milligrams I got these for 15 bucks I would get because oh I I'll be honest a lot of these kind of packaging a lot of these kind of candies I don't pick up when I see they don't seem to hit very well for me they always seem to be disappointing but these guys were actually something I have now revisited this is the second time I bought it and I didn't I don't regret it I think they're they're they're fun so if you want something a little bit different you're tired of cushy punches you're tired of lemonade's you're tired of the whole shebang you guys see the speeder hire any other gummies I'm sure they're all the same I would pick it up so again my name is Sara P thank you so much for watching the haze please follow us at our Instagram at the haze channel also hit that subscribe button on our YouTube please leave a comment below let me know if there's an edible you want me to review I will go out and find it so thank you guys so much for watching and I will see you next time [Music] [Music]", "0li7oHKID9g": "(laughter) - He's high.

I do, there's a proper place and time, and school is generally not it. - No, they don't get in\ntrouble, their parents do. You know when you see\nsomebody get out of a car and then you also see\nsmoke coming out of it? So my job is like going\nup to them, being like, you can't do that with\nyour kid in the car. Feel like I shouldn't\nhave to explain that. Yeah, that's the kind of school I work at. - Okay. - What's your name? - Jacob.\n- Cool. Jacob, nice to meet you.\n- Nice to meet you. - And how do you spell that?\n- J-A-C-O-B. - Okay, no K? - No K.\n- No, okay. - Immediately, this man is high. (laughs) - I have some questions. What do grapefruits\nhave to do with grapes? - Uh, I don't think they\nhave, is this a joke? - No, it's an actual question. - Oh, I don't know. What do they have to do with grapes? - I don't know, you tell me. - I don't know. - That phrase in general\ntends to be misleading in my experience, so I would\nnot say a stoner lookin' at this guy. - Why is there an interstate in Hawaii? - I don't know, why is there\nan interstate anywhere? - I don't think he's high. You're just kind of like\nthinking about too logically. - I do not believe you are high. Okay, I don't get to find out immediately, okay, I'll find out later? This is great, okay, okay, hi. - I think he might be intoxicated. - Okay, so what do you think of the book? - I like it. - That's what I do just to\nsee, and usually they do smell very much like, their like man perfume. - You think you're good\nat catching your students? - I do. - Do you get pleasure outta\ncatching your students? - Yes and no. There's something that makes me feel bad, 'cause it's like I don't\nlet them keep this secret. - Why don't we go to page 12. And why don't you read this section here. - What the fuck? (laughs) - I think he's high. - I think you are high. - I am. (laughs) - Hi. - My name is Emily. - Emily, James. - James, nice to meet you, James. Can I hug you? - Sure.\n- Okay, fantastic. How long have you been smoking cigarettes? - Probably 60 years. - What's your favorite cartoon ever? - I like some Zapp comic\nstuff from the 60's. - Okay. - Do you do impressions? - I do, but I do impressions\nof people that you don't know. I don't do 'em on purpose,\nthey just pop out sometimes. It's just somethin' that\nhappens once in awhile, and I notice it but\nnobody else notices it. But I know that I'm doing an\nimpression of this person. - Can you sing a nursery rhyme? - No. - Yeah, I think you're high. You kinda went on this like\ntangent about the impressions that you do of other people. - Not high, I think he's quite sober. - Somethin' tells me you do smoke weed. This man is high. (laughs) Yep, and that confirmed it. So thank you. Good to know and he just left. He didn't know what he said anyhow. This is great, I'm winning kind of. - I feel the need to\ngive you a hug as well. Can I do that? - Well, yeah.\n- Okay, okay. Okay, great. - Hey, I got a good sniffer. - Do you want a little snack? - Yeah, alright. - The flamin' hot Cheetos? - You like spicy food? - Yeah, I like spicy food. I'm half Mexican. - I'm full black. (laughs) - Do I remind you of a\nteacher you've ever had? - The ones that caught me smokin' weed. - Really? Did you only get caught once? - Yeah. - Okay, so you learned your lesson. - Yeah, I mean, not really, but. (laughs) - Oh, I don't. I just felt like I had a\nresponsibility to look out for the other students. I'm in a portable classroom,\nso there's not a lot of ventilation in there. So it was like a hot box in there. And all the other kids are just like, what the fuck is that? - I think you're high. - Is it 'cause I'm black\nyou think I'm high? - You're black? (laughs) No, the lids are kind of low. - I think you're high\njust because this comes from my father, it's called nigga glare. And the fact that he's\nlaughing right now means that he's probably\nunderstandin' what I'm sayin'. Is that cool?\n- I mean, I feel like you're profilin' me. (laughs) - I think he's probably high. You're just camping on them. You're just campin' on the cheetos. He's high. - Did you smoke weed in high school? - No, oh my God, no. - Can you go to page 37? - That's 36, 37. - Okay, cool, what's the\ntitle of this chapter? - What the Germans lack. - Oh, okay, good, continue. - Among Germans, it is\nnot enough these days to have a spirited mind. - Very nicely done. I feel like I have the\nanswers, is that too fast? I feel like I'm really good at this. - I don't think so, no. - I think you are not high. - I smoke weed a lot, bro. You and I look almost exactly like we shop at the same place. (laughter) What's your favorite\ncrunchy food or snack? - Carrots, you know. - Let's see the Nietzsche. Before you read Nietzsche, do you have any strong thoughts on Nietzsche? - No, boring. - Boring?\n- Yeah, that's the main thought I think. - Okay, let's read this passage here. - You choose dialectics when\nyou have no other means. You know that using it provokes mistrust, and that is not very convincing. - So why do you think Nietzsche says, \"it provokes mistrust\"? I think she's high. - I don't think you're high\nbut you seem really fun to smoke with. - Hello.\n- Hello. High. (laughs) I'm so sorry. - Is that a racial thing? - No, it's not a racial, what? (laughs) - Want some Doritos? - Kinda, but they make\nmy hands all cheesy. - I could just give them to you too. I can feed them to you. - I'm already holding it. - Okay, well then nevermind. - Alphabet, backwards. - Z, X, Y. - What were you gonna ask? I feel like you were gonna say something. - No. - I think she's high. - You're the one eating all\nthese, I think you're high. - No, she's-- - When I'm high in front of other people, I try to be as sober as\npossible, and you seem like you're trying to be as sober\nin front of me and with the smiling included, so I think\nyou might be a little high. - Hello, I feel like\nyou look like a stoner. - I feel like this is a trick. Oh, fuck off. - You hungry? What would you want to eat right now? - Well, they said they\nwere gonna give us pizza. - Yeah.\n- So I'm just - You're waitin' for that pizza? - I'm just waitin' for the pizza. - Do you have like a snack\nthat you go for each time? - Cookies. - What kind of cookies? - Chocolate chip. - Always?\n- Always. - I'm a snicker doodle\nkind of girl myself. - Actually, wait, let me think about it. I was always like anti-oatmeal\nraisin for a long time, but those are like super moist. You grow up and you hit\na point of maturity, you're like, okay, I understand\nwhy oatmeal cookies exist. (laughter) You wanna see the tattoo? - You got a tattoo? Yeah, let me see it. Why, what does it signify? - It's my favorite dessert. - He's stoned. - I'm gonna say you're not\nhigh, but you really wanna get fuckin' high. - Not high. Not only were you able to\nhold the conversation with me, but once or twice you\nactually jumped in over me, almost like, what's it\ncalled, interrupting. But I like that you tried to fake me out. - Dammit. - Fuck. Damn. (laughter) - I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry. Is this your life? - Yeah, I'm pretty used to it. (laughs) - It must be hard getting\njobs, I'm so sorry. (laughter) - That and like, I don't know,\nsometimes like I don't get let into bars 'cause they'll\nthink I'm like drunk or high. Like, oh yeah, I can't let you in, dude. - Do you smoke weed? - Very rarely, but I like parties. - Because school fuckin' sucks. - I don't know, I just feel\nlike don't be like punitive.

Li back July 17 I'm not", "jFV3Nb-ulSo": "it has almost been a year since recreational marijuana has been legalized in Colorado and business is thriving edible cannabis products account for almost half of the nearly 70 million dollars a month earned by local marijuana businesses according to the Colorado Department of Revenue but the market has not avoided controversy over consumption and accidental ingestion have generated considerable negative press so I travel to Denver to learn more about what goes into the production of these sweet and savory pop goodies and to find out is anything being done to resolve its issues today we are with Julie at sweetgrass kitchen Julie is one of the pioneers of the edible cannabis movement hi Julie hello thanks for being here so I heard you are going to let me cook some products right so let's go I'm gonna start baking you ready for me I wish I could the marijuana Enforcement Division requires all employees to have a badge in order to work a licensed marijuana facility I think it's because my paralegal Greg told you I'm a terrible cook so I don't believe you but can I at least help out you got it Oh may I help terrific so what's the next step Julie as we've got to put on our hair nets our gloves and our aprons and we can get started hi gang sweet cross kitchen specializes in butter based edible products we make brownies cookies and a seasonal pumpkin pie both on the medical side and the recreational side so when you say that pot is in your food it's actually in the butter right Hanna water is made when cannabis flowers Lauren fine silver this you are the head chef here at sweetgrass kitchen yeah and you're giving up your duties for the day to me okay so chef do you mind if I help out a little yes we we can help oversee the process okay keep close eye on me ah okay so what are we doing here we're making single serving peanut butter cookies today okay so tell me what to do I'm ready let's go are you guys scared a little bit he's going into a field and hit the bottom of the bowl at something that's very important is that we mix all of our products thoroughly and that ensures that the final product is to Majin s what's the recommended dosage for a consumer someone who buys the products I recommend that if you've never tried edibles before or it's been a really long time to start with five milligrams or less and wait at least two hours if you aren't feeling the effects yet you can always eat more I always tell people you can always eat more you can never eat less Julie I've added half of my dry ingredients what's next after this the next step is portioning out the products into single serving cookies and because you don't have a badge and because portion control is extremely important we're gonna have to let chef Lauren and her team take it from here something that has been a concern in the edibles market in Colorado is overconsumption and accidental ingestion the edible industry is 45% of the market right now the backlash has mostly been with edibles and while you can say okay I recommend my consumer only have half a cookie or one cookie if it's your first time there's no way to control what someone eats right right who in take the pot out of the equation if you send me home with a box of cookies who is just going to eat one there's certainly a responsibility on the consumer level to redirections and of course follow them something that the cannabis Business Alliance and the edibles council has done to minimize overconsumption is create an edibles education handout what we found were four most important points were start with one serving or less wait up to 2 hours don't mix with alcohol or other controlled substances and of course keep out of reach of children and pets and in the original child-resistant packaging in March 2014 according to a report by the Denver Police Levi's fam bah a college student visiting from Wyoming jumped to his death from his hotel room after eating six times the recommended dosage for edibles to sweetgrass kitchen cookie wrappers were found in the hotel room the coroner ruled the death accidental the incident with Levi Samba was was very tragic but it's important to remember that marijuana was not the cause of death when you say marijuana marijuana wasn't the cause of death and maybe I'm just speaking as a lawyer an autopsy was performed on the young man and the autopsy revealed that marijuana was in fact the cause of death well a significant contributor is is that what was in the autopsy report marijuana is not a toxic substance it there's no amount of marijuana that can actually poison someone to the point of death some say that's not true American scientist magazine reported that consuming 100 to 1000 times the effective dose of marijuana could in fact lead to death and while that makes marijuana less toxic than alcohol the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment wants to ban the majority of edibles saying they violate the laws requirement to prevent marketing to children since marijuana has been legalized for recreational use there have been many reports of children accidentally ingesting the product and then ending up in the emergency room that is true and certainly a valid concern accidental ingestion by children is something that that the industry has worked very hard towards minimizing through very strict packaging requirements including child resistant packaging very stringent labeling requirements but the good news is that in the past several months there hasn't been a hospitalization of a child so what that shows me is that people are now becoming more aware of the intensity of these products and the importance of keeping it out of reach of children we reached out to Children's Hospital Colorado and they had a different take saying they've treated 14 children this year seven of whom required intensive care the hospital predicts it will treat double a number of children as they did in 2013 and as for sweetgrass kitchen their staff has quadrupled and their profits have increased five hundred percent since recreational marijuana has been legalized", "iLwOzA2asFk": "[Music] 102 beats the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking another look at an edible sort of an edible I don't think you really eat this one but we are taking a look at trophies trophies mints here a little bit less milligrams than we normally do this is only a 60 milligram edible or mint but I decided to try it because I like the concept but mints I like the concept of smaller more discreet edibles so I decided to go ahead and give it a go it does again fall under our normal normally smaller than our average dosage but I really really want to give this a try so the packaging is pretty basic here just little plastic packaging let's call the information we need on at those 60 milligrams of THC four milligrams of CBD it's a hybrid mint flavored yada-yada-yada lab tested which is nice to see and on the back it's got the testing results which is always great to see and then it's got zero calories solvent free gluten free sugar free non-gmo and vegan and then it's got some directions on here as well cut the trochee to the desired dosage I'm just gonna take the whole thing obviously pop it under your tongue and leave it alone wait a few minutes to fill the tingle that's the cannabinoids absorbing into your body and lastly enjoy effects within 30 minutes wait an hour before dosing again we're just gonna do the whole dose at once as common here on weeks and then the last thing I want to tell you guys is I picked this up for about $10 at my dispensary which is pretty expensive but I was able to get a deal and get it down to closer to $7 so not too bad for a 60 milligram a table it says fast-acting and long-lasting so let's give the trokey mint a shot got my scissors here cuz I've been burned too many times trying to open heart open packaging so there we go we'll just cut it and here is the mint a very small little square doesn't really show up there on the camera but it's got four little perforated edges if you want to cut it into fourths of course we're not gonna do that we're gonna do what it says take this and take it sublingually pop it right under our tongue here and then I'll let you on our case and the answer is bad ooh it tastes like a mixture of very strong minty like Altoids e-type flavor and then we'd look oh I don't want it under my tongue it's a nasty tasting nasty oh do you not like well guys I'm gonna leave this on my tongue there lol switch it will hopefully be pretty quick cuz it's gross and then I will come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how this trophy mint is actually working on me hopefully it's gonna be doing something because it's causing quite a bit of anguish right now so I'll check back with you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling thanks for watching weeds and I'll see you in just a bit peace it has been 2 hours since I've tried the trochee 60 milligram hybrid mint here and I really really did not like the taste it was something spectacularly awful look disgusting but 460 milligram animal I'm pretty pleased with the results I'm not outrageously high I'm not even very high but I'm gonna solid 5 probably somewhere in that range maybe 4 460 milligram edible that you took sublingually it's not bad I I actually I like edibles that are a little bit different in terms of not just your standard cookies brownies and things this doesn't have any calories no sugars that's nice and it's pretty discreet you can pop one of these bad boys under your tongue at the airport or whatever and feel good to go so I think I like it I'm not sure I'm gonna recommend it because it is kind of expensive for what you get and it's not gonna get you out rageous lehigh well the reason is I'm not gonna I'm not gonna recommend it for the cannabis patient that or for the cannabis user that is a heavy user if you're a heavy cannabis user you do a lot of edibles go and pass in the trophy it's not gonna get you high enough if you are edibles curious and never really done many edibles haven't done any edibles at all or you want something small discreet yeah give it a try I think you're gonna I think you're gonna be happy with it it's not for me necessarily because again it's just too small of a dose but I did like my experience with it so uh I'd say I'm pretty positive on trochee but I'm not necessarily gonna say run out and grab it if that makes any sense at all I certainly hope it does um so that's gonna do it for this trochee mint medical with what does that say now I have to read this here Oh medicate with confidence that makes sense all right guys while I medicate it with confidence thank you so much for watching weeds guys and we will check you out on the next review peace", "87FgbwgR34E": "hey guys welcome back to the do gross on today's episode I'm gonna show you how to make edible chocolates I'm gonna do pretty much from the start to the finish starting out with infusing butter and enough with a really simple way to do chocolates we're not making it from scratch we're just infusing like baker's chocolate with our and fused butter [Music] well for this batch butter I decided I wanted to go with green crack which is a hybrid strain but it's it leans a lot more towards a sativa side so it kind of wanted a good daytime high-energy kind of butter to make these chocolates with [Music] so I did want to make this butter fairly strong fairly potent and I had two cups of butter and which is basically four sticks of butter and I infused a quarter ounce of this group of cracked flour into the butter with the magical butter machine the first thing that we have to deal with our cannabis is 2d carbon so throw it near oven at 250 ish degrees and spread it out a little bit and make sure it's in there for about 31 well that does is it transfers the THC a and to THC psychoactive property in cannabis so you definitely need to do that before infusing it in the oil little tip if you guys are using this magical butter machine is while your d carbon erat cannabis just throw your like hard butter right into the magical butter machine right now and start it up for an hour on low temperature just so you can melt your butter and then it's ready for the D carb wheat as soon as it comes out [Music] well after 30 minutes in the oven I pulled out all that weed and took it off the stem no need to put the stems in there and ended up having 12 grams of cannabis that went into four I'm sorry two cups of butter all you need to do is just add that right into your butter solution that you have all warmed up and add a little bit of soy or sunflower less at it as well that helps to emulsify and combine the cannabinoids to the butter I love this magical butter machine though it does it all for you adjust 162 hours once everything's in there you are good to go to set it and forget it for two hours [Music] all right so let's talk about dosing that is a thing that's really hard to find exactly the right the right metrics on how to get it I found this website this calculator out there and you need to know the starting material the THC in the starting material I know the screen crack is roughly 20% so that's what I'm starting with and if you're using trim you might not really know what you're getting so this one I wanted to get a more accurate test on on the exact THC percentage per serving [Music] I was gonna be melting down 12 ounces of chocolate and I was gonna add two ounces of the infused butter so I knew that for the 12 ounces of chocolate I was gonna have roughly 210 milligrams of THC that's going to get infused in that entire batch I didn't know the final amount of serving still after I poured it and that's how many the runner and the first one so the first set of chocolates so I do that that was roughly 5 milligrams per chocolate in the first batch all right so after two hours next step is we just have to classify the butter away from all the cannabis material that's left in the bag so there's this bag comes with the magical butter machine which is basically just like a strainer so pour it all in there squeeze it all out get all the butter through hopefully you don't get too many solids that come through with it there definitely want some milk fats that came through but was able to pretty much clarify that out by just pouring it into the jar before I was gonna add that to the chocolates you do lose some starting material as well so even though I went in with two cups of butter I only came out with about maybe a confident corner of of the butter I probably could have done a little bit better like squeezing out more but that was the clearest stuff that I got and that was the stuff I was happiest with so yeah only about 1 and 1/4 cup but off of the two cups of butter I started out just by doing a small double boiler thing you can warm up chocolate however you feel like this I just boiled some water put another pan on top of it in the water and poured in the chocolate chips from there so 12 ounces of chocolate chips and 2 ounces of the infused oil [Music] after that just start for a few minutes want to make sure it's obviously very evenly infinim mixed in they might want to separate a little bit I actually did add a tablespoon of some more lesson to this as well to help with the emulsification of the oil and the chocolate [Music] the first bachelor did two ounces and wanted to see how the consistency was they seemed really good when it popped amount so the second one I was like maybe we can make these a little stronger so I added three ounces to the next batch which ended up being on the dark chocolate chocolate chips that who meld up here [Music] now all that's left to do is just pour them into your molds I use these silicone molds I got off of Amazon I didn't need to oil them at all they pop out super easy so yeah just forms for an ear molds and then right under your freezer only takes about 30 minutes for them to firm up once you have your final count about how many servings you have then you can actually see how many milligrams of your THC is in each serving so my first batch I kind of overfilled a little bit all the way up to the top and I got like 40 for individual chocolates of this semi-sweet stuff with the two ounces of infused oil which was roughly 5 milligrams per serving my second batch the dark chocolate I used 3 ounces of oil actually a little bit more than that and it ended up making 62 I want to say 62 servings so a lot more servings and that's visit and pour in the chocolate quite as much but the THC percentage was roughly the same because I used that more THC infused oil in the whole batch you I have all sorts of different containers and stuff for flour and inedible so I put some of these little ten summons bags and then I'm gonna be leave them in my refrigerator for I don't know maybe a week or so eating them once in a while but also just want to let them dry out a little bit there a little bit moist so yeah leave it in the fridge for a bit and I think they'll be good on the shelf for at least a couple months and that is it I think that is the easiest way that you can make chocolate edibles they're not making any chocolate you're just melting down existing chocolate adding your oil boom done simple as that so it's gonna work for a lot of us that aren't expert cooks like myself and yeah I think these things will be great so check out the magical butter machine if you're interested at all in making infused oils you won't regret it I'm going to post a link down below that you can click as well to get it off Amazon and if you've watched a couple of these videos that though if you subscribed and hung around got more videos coming up about once a week and yeah I think that's about it for now if you guys have any questions let me know until the next time you guys take care [Music] you", "vQVXrOLrW9c": "[Music] [Applause] hey guys my name is Chiana and today I'm gonna be showing you a really easy way to make peanut butter now I chose peanut butter as my first video because once you know how to make it the possibilities are good today I'm gonna be using it to make a batch of brownies but really you can use it for any recipe that calls for butter I like to put it on my toast in the morning you can really get creative with it so that's why I just want to show you this easy recipe I do want to say that I usually use the magical butter machine to make my butter it's just an infusion machine and I know that a lot of people don't have it and they don't want to spend that $200 to make it and this comes out just the same anyway so I really just picked a recipe that you guys can make with the stuff that you already have in your house pretty much you get started I do want to say the link to the recipe is gonna be in the description below which will take you to my website and you can see the recipe and everything else you need so what you're gonna need is a strainer and some cheesecloth you're gonna need about a cup of water you need some butter and you're gonna need your flour can't forget that today I'm using and eat them an ounce of flour and I'm using a specific butter now I'm just using this cuz I'm going to put all my butter into one batch of Rowney you can also use half an ounce of flour and a pound of butter which is four sticks you can also change your flour amount depending on if you want it more potent if you want a less opponent it's really up to you what you want to do you're in charge of your destiny so let's start with the first jack decarboxylation so decarboxylation sounds really confusing but it's really simple actually it happens naturally when you smoke the combustion when you heat your herb it activates the THC same with vaporizing it so when you have your flour when it's harvested it actually not has containing the THC it's containing two hc' egg so once you put it in the oven we're converted and THC I into the THC which is the psychoactive component as most of you probably know so really decarboxylation is just activating it by heat and if any of the most out of your so I already have it in this little plastic baggie and I already broke it up mostly but you can really just do it with your hand and don't be too nit picky about it it's it's really not that hard just break it up it's a little small pieces the reason we're doing this is because when you heat it you want it to spread evenly so that it heats evenly and also later on when you're making your butter the more surface area that your flour has the easier it's gonna be for it to absorb into the fat of the butter so I tell you what to have that and also you don't want to make it too small so it goes through the cheesecloth don't be too hard on yourself you'll do great now I'm just gonna spread it onto my baking sheet now I also use a covered baking dish in the past you can really use whatever you want I do want to say that it will make your house smell like flour so if you have roommates or parents or anyone I just want to give you that little disclaimer so I don't have a lot of flour today so it's not that hard for me to spread it but that it's spreading evenly d calculation is very simple you won't mess up I promise so actually I've even my ovens at 240 degrees and I'm gonna keep it in there for 45 minutes now that's in the oven we'll see you in 45 minutes okay guys now let it's been 45 minutes we're ready for our next step so what we're gonna do is we're gonna take our butter and we're gonna put it on medium low heat and I like it more on the lower end because throughout this entire process you never want your butter to come to a boil so we're just gonna leave it there once it butter is melted you're ready to add your water and the water is really just to prevent the butter from squirting or burning the bottom of the pan and it also ensures that throughout this process when it evaporates your butter and your flowers on evaporating but the water is instead so I'm ready to add my water and I'm just gonna let this melt for a little bit okay it's now that it's melted we're ready to add our herb so aren't going to do is you're just going to put your decarboxylated flower into it and I'm just going to give it a little bit stir now we're just gonna let this sit here for three hours and I'm gonna come back every 30 or 45 minutes and check on it make sure it's looking good and just give it a little bit of a stir because you obviously always want to stay by it when you have something on stove so I'll see you in three hours okay guys so I have a little bit of a confession to make I actually ended up abandoning my butter last night but as Confucius once said it does not matter how slowly we go as long as we do not stop so we're just gonna tread on and grab my butter off the stove that may or may not have been simmering for three hours and we're pretty much ready for one of the last steps so what I'm going to do is I'm going to take my strainer and I'm gonna take my cheesecloth I'm gonna put the cheesecloth over this trainer and I have my glass bowl this is the boiler butter is going to go in so glass is always better just because plastic when it gets hot could leak some toxic stuff into it but what I'm gonna do is gonna take my butter and I'm just going to pour it through the cheesecloth just gonna strain it through and it's going a little bit slow but that's okay just push it down make sure I'm doing as much as I can out and it'll speed up the process a little bit do you like my spatula kiss the cook I'm still going so if you have more butter you might be here for a little bit more time and if it's not too hot you can't even take your cheesecloth and push down on it with your hands just get the remaining golden juice out okay I think I got it all and so what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna cover it I'm gonna put it in the fridge until it hardens which might be a few hours okay so now that my butter is hardened finally it felt like it took forever you can see here that the water has kind of sunk to the bottom and separated itself out from the butter and so the last step really is gonna be to get this water out of here and so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take a knife and I'm really carefully just going to cut along the sides of the butter and I'm gonna do it without breaking it hopefully because all I'm trying to do is make a big enough of a hole where I can get the water to come out and the harder your butter is gonna be the better it's gonna be for it not to break so that's about it and now I can really just pop the rest of the butter out if I want but what I'm left with here is just a beautiful circle of peanut butter and so that's pretty much it I hope you guys like my video feel free to leave a comment and make any requests for nights and videos and recipes that you guys want to see okay well I'll see you next time [Music]", "NgoDsQqicvk": "[Music] um [Music] what's up guys welcome back today i'll be showing you how to make a delicious infused starbucks starburst drink i use all pink starbursts because those are my favorite and in canada we don't carry the all pink starburst packs you have to buy like the original one and then separate them out but that's okay i made mine pink starburst i think i used some red too and lemonade is such a good combination it's so good there's a whole tablespoon or just a little bit under a tablespoon of coconut oil in here and you can't taste it or feel it i thought it kind of would affect the texture and like the mouth feel and the taste and i can't notice it but it's so delicious i love it so much and if you guys like starburst flavor like how i do you should check out my diy infused starburst video which i'll post a link to in the description box below to make this delicious drink here's what you're going to need some starburst candy flavor of your choice infused coconut oil or tincture a flavor mix i'm doing iced tea and lemonade and then some additional lemon i just want to start off by saying my double boiler is not dirty prior to making this i made some infused starbursts and i'm just using the same double boiler so i don't waste anything at all and i'll post the link of how to make the infused starburst below this recipe is extremely flexible so you can just use whatever you think would be good portions for yourself i'm starting by adding about a third of a mason jar of water to a double boiler and then adding in five starburst candies you could add more you could add less five was good for me um if you added more it would be more flavorful and more sweet so if you don't want to use a drink mix and you want to just use the starburst you'll need probably closer to like 10 or 15. then we'll just leave it on the double boiler stirring occasionally it took about five or ten minutes for these to really start to melt so just keep stirring them until they fully dissolve which again like i said might take some time because they do need to melt and then you can add in your coconut oil i'm adding in about half a tablespoon you can do more or less depending on how strong you want to be surprisingly you couldn't taste the coconut oil i was worried it would be quite strong but the drink mixes and starburst flavor really took over an alcohol or glycerin based tincture would work well for this as well really any extract would work but i wanted to use coconut oil because that's going to be the most difficult to get to emulsify into this drink so you can see i've been stirring and stirring and you can still see those little oil bubbles on the side so we'll need to emulsify that so it has a better consistency so i just took the double boiler off the heat and put my immersion blender in the mixture which was a little bit tricky because um it's pretty shallow so i just added some more water so i could get my immersion blender submerged into the mixture if i was to do this again i would just add more water from the beginning the only difference is that if you have more water you'll need to put it in the fridge to get cold whereas if you use less water you could just pour it directly over ice and drink it right away now you can add your flavoring of choice for me for this one i'm using some lemon and i really love this powdered lemon because it tastes like real lemon and it's easy to always have on hand and then i'm also going to be adding um some crystal light lemonade and just mixing that in now everything's pretty much done i've tasted it and added some more lemon to my liking and then i'm just going to put it in a mason jar and put it in the fridge and as i put it into a mason jar i realized this would probably be the better way to emulsify it because the immersion blender really gets in there so just a little tip don't be silly like i was and try to use your immersion blender in a shallow dish when you could just do it in a large mason jar now i'm just going to throw it in the fridge to get it nice and chilly now that it's nice and cold from being in the fridge i'm going to shake it up and pour it over some ice the sweetness of the starburst mixed with the tanginess of the lemon and the lemonade is such a good combination and i really love it and the iced tea was good too but there was just something about that pink starburst lemonade that was just to die for too simple too delicious don't get any better i'm eating a starburst while drinking it that that actually does make a little better [Music] so good i feel like there's so many different combinations you can make with different flavors of starburst hope you guys try this out please let me know if you do if you like this video please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe thank you guys so much for watching [Music] you", "3JnNdwTHIKM": "so how you know it's not bad because of the

going to be making THC infused strawberry lemonade that I made with distillate so I'm going to be a hundred percent honest with you I'm leaving a timestamp here so you guys can go straight to the recipe because I've made this way more complicated than I needed to be and basically this video you're gonna watch me turn a mistake into something magical I can start feeling the heaviness right now Dex first things first you're going to need a gram of distillate roughly it does all the grams and I'll be talking more about it later on two cups of sugar 1 cup of Everclear this recipe calls for a two-to-one ratio and we're using Everclear to dissolve the distillate that Everclear is something you could potentially skip next we need roughly two cups of half strawberries as well as one and a half cup of fresh squeezed lemons next you want to preheat the oven at 200 degrees and leave it at 200 degrees so that where we don't activate the THC and I honestly just so it you don't need to activate the TFC because it's already there so we just want to make sure we conserve as much as possible next get the 2 cups of sugar and put it into a pan then get the 1 cup of Everclear important to a bowl now we're going to be putting that one gram of distillate into the so that we can start mixing this distillate roughly houses around a thousand milligrams of THC in it the reason I wanted to put it and Everclear was so that it would dissolve evenly and that way I could put it evenly throughout the sugar my original plan was to make granulated sugar about what I did was I messed up and I closed the oven door and then it turned into a syrup so then I decided to work with what I had but yes I will be making an actual tutorial on how to do the guy kneeling sugar now we just mix the Everclear and the distillate together next you pour the mixture onto the sugar you could use a little bit of a wider pan than we did then we mixed it all together and make sure that everything is saturated evenly next just place to the 200 degree preheated oven and set your timer for 13 minutes and check for daily and this is where I messed up my original plan I did close the other door so it did cook down and it created an actual cistern so if you do want to make granular sugar you simply just leave the oven door open so that way it can all evaporated but then you get this golden to cool this is where the real recipe begins you simply boil two cups water and keep it on a very low simmer because you do not want to activate the THC and then I poured the syrup that I created into the water just to dilute it a little bit now here I'm going to be placing the actual instructions on how you can make it a lot easier and save the headaches basically ideally you would just put the two cups of water melt two cups of sugar into it and then add a distillate right on it I actually enjoyed several clearer taste to it it had a little bit of a move to the lemonade so I didn't mind it now it's time for the lemonade start cutting an equivalent of two cups of hats strawberries put them into a little bowl and then start mashing away you could certainly use a blender but according to my friend he doesn't believe in them use this now it's time to roll some lemons and get the juices flowing and start to squeeze the lemon juice in there I did get a roughly an equivalent of a cup and a half of lemon juice it could certainly be anything ever they want and then I add the mashed and pureed strawberry onto it I actually enjoyed the masher because it left Jack pretty pulpy give it a good stir and then we're ready to add the syrup we created put it in along with two cups of water and that's pretty much it after giving it a good little stir simply serve in chilled glasses and enjoy I really enjoyed making this granted it was a headache and a half just because of a failed experiment but you can always turn something negative into a positive and definitely this was a positive hope you guys enjoy it as we did and I'll see you guys later we're gonna feel it slowly I'm happy you", "TPFSIS_1a64": "hi and welcome to infuse dates today's recipe is cannabis infused jalapeno nacho cheese sauce [Music] [Music] this episode of infused eats is brought to you by the infused eats comm cookbook dozens of cannabis infused recipes and an affordable online interactive cookbook every recipe includes full ingredients list written instructions and more sign up at wwe.com today now let's get started the first step is going to be to grind decarboxylate and infuse our cannabis and we're going to begin this bike riding it I'm using a grinder but you can use your fingers or pair of scissors if you want we're gonna grind that into a medium to fine grind I'm gonna go ahead and grind it directly into a small oven safe Bowl as well and then next we're gonna go ahead and add in our butter and what a cubes a butter so it melts more evenly and quickly and we'll combine that directly in the pan with our cannabis and we're gonna wrap that tightly in foil then I'm going to put this in the oven and I'm going to decarboxylate and infuse it at the same time and you haven't a 250 degrees Fahrenheit for two hours and you can leave that undisturbed for two hours and in the meantime you could go ahead and begin the next step [Music] and the next step is going to be to prep our vegetables that are going in our dip and so what I'm going to do is to go ahead and finely mince the onion and then I'm also going to add II seed and also finely chopped immense the jalapeno peppers I'm using red jalapeno peppers but you could also use green jalapenos if you like I just wanted something a little different and so we have the jalapenos diced and then we're also going to add in a little bit of garlic and on the garlic you want to mince that finely as well we're just using a couple of clothes and I'm going to smash and mince that finely and then now we have all our vegetables prepped and it'll be easier when we now move on to the next step of combining our ingredients and making the sauce now our butter is decarboxylated and it is infused you can see that has turned that nice rich green color that you want with your butters and I'm going to go ahead and strain that through a metal fine mesh strainer and it's up to you you may decide you don't want to strain it and you can't leave it in the dip if you want but I just find the textures a little more pleasing without it and so strain that out and then we're gonna put that into a large saucepan on medium heat and then directly into that butter we're gonna add in all of our vegetables our onions our jalapenos and our garlic and then we're going to let that simmer until it's opaque for about five minutes and then we're gonna make a roux by adding in our flour now once you've added in your flour you're gonna let that cook down for another two or three minutes is gonna turn into a nice slurry roux and then once that is occurred you're going to now add in your milk just using regular whole milk here and we're gonna add that directly in there and then you're gonna let it cook for another five to 10 minutes and what's gonna happen is it's gonna start to thicken just slightly and once you've got kind of a nice gravy thickness and it's also the roux has melted down into your milk we're going to now add in the cheese and then we're gonna keep that on medium to medium low heat and we're going to let it cook for another five or ten minutes and once your cheese has melted and incorporated its gonna be nice and silky like you see here and at that point you're finished we now have our cannabis infused nacho cheese sauce and you can use this of course on nachos with seasoned ground beef it tastes delicious but it's not just a nacho you could use the same recipe for other dishes for instance you can steam some broccoli and put the cheese sauce over some broccoli if you want something a little bit healthier and I tell you this is a really delicious recipe it's simple it takes a couple of hours to make it with the D carving but it's still a pretty simple recipe but

a quick video or until for making edibles so let's get into it so the first tip would be to purchase a skill so the reason why you want a skill is to be able to accurately measure your kena business tip number two would be choosing the correct type of cannabis so provided gainers I would recommend using cannabis shape or trim the reason why I recommend this one is they feel it's gonna be way more affordable then use a flower or any type of concentrate so start with shape shrimp but let's get into the nest - alright guys so the next tip would be choosing the correct type of fact to buy it with your chemist so remember cannabis is that soluble so in order to confuse your candidates you need to use some type of back so the most proper fat would be your butter if you just have to use butter make sure it's clarified butter and I will try to get the butter with the highest fat content the more fat but what I have the better so just keep that in mind the second most popular type of fat to use to make edibles would be coconut oil now there's two type of coconut oil that most people use most people will use regular coconut oil or MCT coconut wall so depending on what you are making that's gonna have an impact or what type of coconut oil that you want to use if I'm making my cookies cake brownies I'm gonna be using regular coconut water not if I'm making like cannabis pills cannabis syrup honey then I'm gonna use MCT oil but besides coconut wall you can also use olive pool but let's get it to the next tilt the next tip would be using less I think to make sure your edibles now let them come into the sample form it's gonna come in powder and it's gonna come in liquid now there's different type of listening to you have your sunflower and you also have your soy I recommend using sunflower or diesel research but let's go to the next to the next tip would be to purchase cheesecloth or some type of string is for the purpose of the cheesecloth is to filter Isaac enemies [Music] so let's get to the next two so the next tip would be to label your products [Music] so every time I make a nut butter or a kennel or not always label my product and the reason why you want to do that is it's gonna make it easier to distinguish what is what so right here this is Keith choking the wall and this right here your CDV OpenNet wall so by labeling your products is gonna be easier for you to know what it's like so when it's time for me to make my edible I won't have any issues with figuring out what is what so just keep that I'm on guys but thank you for watching this video don't forget to Like share and subscribe [Music]", "nBlBahN72YY": "[Music] hey out here in Cali visiting checking out some of the dispensaries and stuff out here I picked up this mystery baking company new canvas infused green apple strips there's a hundred milligrams in the whole bag and each piece is about ten milligrams so here you go right here nice little strip ten milligrams in here so since there's only 10 milligrams per piece and only 100 milligrams in the bag I kind of got to eat like the whole bag to get an effect which since I have a high tolerance this product is not the best for me it tastes delicious it's an awesome taste I love eating them but it just as imprudent enough if you're new to cannabis and cannabis edibles then this might be a nice one for you because it tastes good it's only ten milligrams for anyone that's accustomed to taking in cannabis not the best option go with something a little stronger not saying this company's bad just this product is not the best for someone that has a high tolerance so that's my review on the cannabis infused gummy strips by mystery baking company 100 milligrams and whole bag ten milligrams apiece not a huge fan tastes delicious though they taste they taste awesome they're so good I love eating them they just don't really give me the effect that I want", "0gsvUuwBZVo": "hey everybody welcome back it's Master\nBlaster we're back at Johnny's green extractions and today we're in the\nkitchen we're gonna make gummy bears today and we're gonna infuse them with\nshatter we're gonna make 100 gummy bears here we're gonna use half a box of\njell-o two packs of gelatin maybe a tablespoon or two of our vegetable\nglycerin and we're gonna use our shatter here there's seven grams in here this\nshatter has to be decarboxylated which means it has to be heated to change the\nform of it from a THC a to THC so that you can get a medical effect from it and\nwith that being seven grams that will break down into point forty five\nmilligrams of shatter in each one of these gummy bears so they're going to be\nquite strong because they are for our own personal use and basically a medical\nused to help you sleep etc I just want to stress the point here that these are\ngummy bears and if you do happen to make something like this it is so important\nthat if there are children around whether it's grandkids your kids nieces\nnephews friends that have kids any kids that come over you can't just hide this\nstuff you actually have to lock this away because if a kid did get into it\nand they do seem to find things they will be hospitalized so everybody keep\nthat in mind and that's with all all edibles that you make that are THC\ninfused okay so our first step here is we're gonna decarboxylate this shatter\nwe're gonna put it in the oven at 200 and\n50 Fahrenheit for half an hour all right that's our first step here all right everybody we decarboxylated\nour shatter we melted our jell-o mixture it's warm remember everything's in low\nheat now we're just going to melt our shatter right into our liquid here slide\nit over to the heat pretty sticky   okay go we're gonna mix that in here now ok we got our hot liquid here we\nadded a teaspoon and a quarter of food glycerin just to disperse the shatter\nin here now this is a little tricky to do so we've got to move quick here here\nwe go and basically that is it okay everybody this is master-blaster\nsaying thanks for watching give us a thumbs up subscribe peace and we'll see\nin the next video bye guys", "zYgVCXcyrcI": "hi welcome to dive into light edibles my name is Liz if this is the first time you're joining and to the regular subscribers thank you so much and welcome back new subscribers thank you again for joining I'm so excited this channel is kind of weirdly taking on a life of its own it's it's really really exciting but a little overwhelming I'm not gonna lie it's kind of cool when there's like you know a couple thousand people seen it but now we're getting into some not large numbers for me um that I never expected and it's like what oh but it's super cool and thank you guys so much I couldn't do this obviously without you so today I know I've got another company recipes up there and I'm always working to refine and make things better so in this recipe this is good for regular gummy bears or regular gummy candies or the sweet and sour there's really only one difference in the change for that recipe whether you want to make regular or the sugar sugar-coated and so I wanted to go for that as well as a little bit a little bit of change in the method but any one of those recipes will work so kind of how I'm gonna how I would list it is the regular gummy bears that I put is more like a condensed jello realistically it's jell-o and gelatin and you harden it up that's condensed jello and then the other candy this the sour one with the the sugar-coated sour ones they're more like a real candy so I know also how the gummy that's more like a real candy versus just condensed gelatin and I will stop babbling on now and also I've got a recipe at the end there if you want to stay tuned on how to make inverted sugar which is a replacement for corn syrup so if Kourt lake corn syrup is difficult for you to get expensive just not available in your local grocery stores you can actually make your own at a fraction of the price and it's super easy to make however it is very very finicky but I go over all of that at the end there about the inverted sugar so I hope you stay tuned for that and and check that out and I think that's all I've got for us right now I'm gonna get in as I usually do get into my ingredients the utensils you're gonna need we'll put everything together and we'll get some candies made we're getting started what you want to do is to get a pot of either ice water or set up a pot of cold water and put it in your fridge or freezer about an hour before you want to start this very important you need the really cold water to start to stop the cooking process for the syrup so just get that set up ahead of time and now we'll get into your ingredients and the tools that you're going to need all right so I'm just gonna go over the ingredients now the ingredients for the gelatin side are exactly the same whether you want to do be regular or whether you want to do the sugar coated it's exactly the same the only difference is whether you're doing the sugar coated or the regular is in the candy syrup and the difference there is if you're doing sugar coated you're gonna use one cup of sugar actually I'll go over that when I get into the sugar part you never mind about that right now we'll start with the gelatin side so you're going to need a one box of jell-o three envelopes of gelatin or three tablespoons you are going to need a quarter cup of corn syrup or you can use what's called inverted syrup which is a substitution for corn syrup I have a video at the end of this to show you how to make your own inverted sugar which I use quite often which I'm actually using today I'm just showing you the bottle for what you've got what you need in the light corn syrup you will need a quarter cup of melted can of butter 1/2 teaspoon of gore gum a quarter cup of liquid now I tend to use the kool-aid jammers or the or the kool-aid waters they're great or the Hawaiian punches are great to use as well or you can just use water you're gonna want a half a cup of liquid again you can use your juice or your gelatin I'm sorry your juice or your water for the gelatin and for this you need it needs to be cold so for your gelatin it has to be very cold and for our jello portion we're actually going to boil that and the only other thing is if you want to add some additional color and additional flavor we can do that as well and I think Oh sorry and we also need a quarter tea store sorry a half a teaspoon of citric acid I apologize almost missed that our half teaspoon of citric acid that's everything that we're going to need for our gelatin side and now I'm just gonna when we start the syrup I'm going to go into the ingredients in that for the syrup side and then if previously I talked a little bit about clear gel for the regular gelatin gummies you can actually use this now for either one and again we're gonna do all the work on our gelatin side and add this in so with regards to the clear gel if you want to use it what you need to do beforehand is you take a cup of the clear gel and you mix it with a quarter cup of sugar and you keep that to a side mix it thoroughly so that the sugar and the starch are thoroughly mixed the reason for that the starch will clump if you do it on its own or doesn't have the sugar properly mixed these starts will clump up in your mixture so that is why we add the sugar then you are going to use two tablespoons for your gelatin for your gelatin mix now this is an option now what this does is it takes your candy to that next level that more professional candy like you get in the candy store so it's not as gelatin like it's more it's a little bit softer it's more of that gummy candy versus just like concentrated gelatin and I've been using this ever since I first since I tried it I used it in all my candy now it's I love it it's not that expensive you get a large container of it and it lasts quite a long time so if you do make candies more on a larger scale or on a professional level you might want to give that a try it's excellent it's a little pretty pain to work with but I'll go over all that adding that in so for the candy syrup you're going to need one cup of sugar okay laureate let me back up here if you are making the sugar-coated gummies you are gonna use one cup of sugar and a half a cup of corn syrup if you want to make regular gummies that are not sugar-coated you're going to switch that you're going to use one cup of corn syrup to a half a cup of sugar but it's to a half a cup of sugar so the recipe is exactly the same this is the only part that'll change regular gummies one cup of syrup to half a cup of sugar sugar-coated gummies one cup of sugar to half a cup of corn sort syrup and the water remains the same half a cup either way you go that's all you need for the candy syrup side temperature cooks to the exact same we're gonna cook it to 260 all right so the equipment that we are going to need is a double boiler you don't have one no problem just what I do use a metal bowl that fits into a pot you want to add water into the bottom to the pot you just don't want it to touch the bottom of the bowl you're gonna need a second pot for your syrup you would let you want to use a heavy bottom pot it works it's better for even the heat distribution for your syrup that way your syrup cooks evenly you don't have any hotter spots you're going to need a candy thermometer a hand blender a whisk a couple of spatulas and a strainer if you've got one handy and I think that's everything that we need for our equipment I usually end up finding something that Wow's that we need but this is generally the majority of the equipment that you're gonna need so next I'll get into the ingredients for putting our gelatin portion together and then we'll then we do the candy syrup and then we combine both of them alright so give me a moment to get everything together here and we'll get started all right so let's get started with our recipe so our very first step what we're gonna do is our quarter cup of liquid we're gonna heat up in the microwave for one minute we want that boiling then with our half a cup of cold liquid we're gonna bloom our gelatin so add that to a bowl and your gelatin you want to evenly spread it over your liquid and again water or the juice I'm actually using kool-aid jam or yes or sorry I'm using the kool-aid waters you know if you do use real juice with real fruit all you need to do is to add a mold inhibitor laureen's makes a makes one and that's what you need to use if you if you use anything with real fruit in it otherwise they will mold very quickly but if you use fruit jammers Hawaiian Punch they don't have anything real in the sugar content they don't go mouldy I literally have gummies that last for months I've never seen mold on them so with regards to your gelatin you want to sprinkle it evenly and then mix it up to make sure that there are no lumps and then you're gonna set it aside for five minutes to allow it to bloom and meanwhile I'm going to microwave this for one minute so you're gonna add your box of jell-o to the double boiler you're gonna set your temperature to low and we're just gonna wait for I'm just waiting for my liquid to boil all right so we're going to add our boiled liquid yeah it got very hot I'm gonna add that in and we're gonna stir that around let our gelatin let our jello get dissolved you might need to add a little bit more liquid to it if you find that it's not fully dissolving but it takes a few minutes anyway and you want to continue to scrape all the gelatin off the sides otherwise it will harden up and we're just gonna stir that and let our water get warm now it's really important with jell-o and gelatin is the heat jello and more gelatin sorry I apologize the our unflavored gelatin melts at just hot a hot water bath if it is too hot it breaks the gelatin and what will happen is your you'll notice it'll start to get very foamy if it starts foaming immediately remove your bowl from the heat and let it cool down you also may need to add about 1/2 a tbsp more of unflavored gelatin because you've kind of broken the the you broken the gelatin a bit so it may not be as sticky or it may not be sorry gel as well so you may I need to add in an additional half a tablespoon to compensate for that so I'm just gonna continue to stir this on the low heat until it is till it's pretty much fully melted until the sugars all fully melted so now that my gelatin is pretty much melted we're gonna add in our quarter cup of corn syrup and get that thoroughly stirred in and we're also gonna add in our half a teaspoon of citric acid we're gonna let that all mix in and melt together again try and keep the sides of your bowl as clean as possible so now that our jello is all melted we're going to add in our gelatin and your gelatin is bloomed when it is nice and spongy if it is squishy at all then either your gelatin is it's not strong enough because gelatinous do have different strengths or it's old and the gelatin is just broken so you want it to be nice and firm and just break it up into pieces and scoop it in and then we're just gonna stir that until that's melted and again remember you just want to warm hot water by at this point you don't want the water underneath boiling at all otherwise your jello your gelatin will break and again if you see it starting to foam up at all take it off immediately now once your gelatin is all melted and everything looks nice like so we're gonna add in our can of butter so you know it in a quarter to a third of a cup of can of butter I'm doing a quarter cup they have dogs and cats behind me [Music] cats trying to trip me up here and then I'd in the Gerber gun this is when you want to use the strainer throw it on there and you want to evenly sprinkle it all over the top and now we're going to get our handy dandy hand blender and so you're going to blend this until it is completely all one color one unit alt one texture and that you're not seeing any kind of oil separation [Music] all right so we've got that all what we called emulsifies so what Gord got gorg um is an emulsifier what an emulsifier does is it allows oil and water to come together essentially it creates a little bubble so when we use the blender it breaks the oil particles up into tiny little part into little pieces and the emulsifier acts as a bubble and holds the water and the oil together in little bubbles that's how it all comes together and your water and oil live happily together otherwise your butter is going to separate and come to the top if you don't use that now a lot of people have asked me if you can use zanza zantac xanthan gum no you cannot it is not an emulsifier it is only a thickening agent so geurim is an emulsifier it is also a thickening agent and a stabilizer that is the other you can use lecithin I prefer Gore gum because lecithin gives it a flavor that I really don't like and I find that the Gore gum works awesome with you don't need the lesser than now at this point if you want you can add in your some additional flavoring I add in about a cup and a half full and if you want to add in some additional color I do it on this side as well I use the no taste red if I'm doing red color so I'm doing raspberries so I use the no taste red reason for that a red die has red food coloring I mean has a tends to have a bitter flavor to it so I like the no taste rent the only downfall about it is you don't get quite as an intense red as the regular ones but I would for rather give up a little bit of the color for than the flavor so I'm gonna mix that in and I'm gonna use the hand blender again just to get it full all mixed together the color comes out much nicer when you use the hand blender [Music] and when you're riding a clear gel you're gonna want to have your whisk ready and coupes and we're going to add in a tablespoon at a time and you want to evenly spread it over the top like so and then use this too and then you're gonna have to whisk it for about a minute or minute or two you're gonna notice it start to thicken up it's just kinda like cornstarch you know when you're making gravy you have to keep mixing it a little while for it to up for it to thicken up and do its thing we're gonna do and you can see how it's starting to thicken up and now we're gonna add in the second tablespoon same thing evenly over the top whisk and you're gonna repeat the same thing we're going to whisk it for about a minute or two until it's all to look pick it up so you can see how it's thickening up here I said you want to continue whisking for about two minutes and it should look nice and smooth and again all one uniform texture and color alright that side is ready is finished now we're gonna do the candy syrup side alright so for our candy syrup side because I am doing sugar or sour coated ones I am going to be using one cup of sugar half a cup of corn syrup and a cup of water now remember if you want to make regular gummies our only difference is you're gonna use a cup of corn syrup and a half a cup of regular sugar that is the only difference there you're gonna mix that together until it's up until it comes up together and your sugar begins to dissolve make sure to go all around the edges because the sugar likes to hide on the edges all right so and once your gonna have that all mixed up you're gonna turn your heat on to medium medium-high and you're going to continue to stir this until it begins to boil once it begins to boil you're not going to stir it all right the other one of the things I forgot is you want a pastry brush or a paintbrush clean paint brush so that you can clean off the sides of the pot to use a cup of hot hot water and that'll melt any sugar crystals that you've got and you want to get those off the side because any sugar crystals can cause your syrup to crystallize later on and just continue to stir it until it begins to boil Oh once your syrup begins to boil stop stirring and you're going to add in your candy thermometer and we are gonna cook this until 260 now if you want a firmer candy you can cook it to about 280 so anywhere between 260 280 you can experiment on your firmness if you want a softer candy cook it to 250 but I found 260 seemed to be a really good temperature for it and we're just gonna let that go until we hit the proper temperature now you also want to get your pot of cold water handy and the only thing that you'll do drink the cooking process is if you do see any sugar crystals form just wash them down and now while your candy while the candy syrup is cooking you just want to consider this because stir your jello side because the top part of its gonna start to solidify and the bottom is gonna be liquid because it's closer to the heat so you want to continue sure to mix that up and it all stays nice and smooth and keep it on keep it on low temperature so you have the low hot water bath keeping it melted all right so I've hit 260 take your pot and submerse it in cold ice water turn off your heat and you want to wait until the temperature begins to come down on your thermometer then you're going to place it on the counter until the temperature hits 240 well once your temperature reaches 240 you can remove your candy thermometer and we are now going to add in our gelatin or our jello and our gelatin mixture right so now we're gonna get our jello we're going to get that added in and then you're gonna very carefully stir this until it is fully mixed together your sugar the sugar syrup and the gelatin come together but be very careful because this is very hot you're going to pull it from the bottom and again make sure to get the edges and then it's this is up to you it's an optional step I do I like to use the hand blender on it and the reason I like to use the hand blender is just to make sure that everything is all mixed and blended thoroughly together [Music] [Applause] well see you like that be careful I'm gonna clean up my little mess here and then we're gonna get lit gonna let this sit let some of the air bubbles come out of it we you can work them out by just gently stirring it let it sit and then just look gently stir it again we need this to cool down a bit so you can do that and I'm just gonna clean up a little all right so my mixture is cooled down a bit and I'm going to pour it into my to my bottles my squeeze bottles that was one of the things I forgot in the utensils or tools you need is your squeeze bottles or eyedroppers and I use these squeeze bottles they're by sugar sweet sugar bowel and they've got their nice because they've got the piping tips for them which makes it really nice and easy as well as they have a wide bottle and a wider thread if you use bottles that have too thin of a thread if your syrup is hot or really thick it'll pop the top right off if after you filled your bottles if you still have syrup left just keep it on the lowest temperature just so that we can that you it'll stay so melted there otherwise it will solidify all right so now we're gonna get ready to put this into our moulds all right and then when you're filling up your mold you just want to fill them up just a little over halfway you don't want to go all the way to the top because that way it makes a rough edge on them and it makes your candies not very nice so you just want to try to make them as clean it's also you want to try not to get any jello on the edges there and you're just gonna fill up all of your molds and then once you've got them all filled you're gonna put them into the refrigerator for a minimum of four to six hours I found its best overnight so if after four hours or so II go to try to take about there knock coming out just leave them for overnight usually that usually works if they're still not going to come out of the mold you can put them in the freezer it means that you've got too much syrup the gelatin isn't working too well what you can do is put them into the freezer get them out of the molds remount them at about a tablespoon of gelatin and recast them and then if you find that you take out your candies and they're far too gummy too sticky you can remount them and add a little bit of liquid to it means that it has more too much gelatin you can add up I probably say about two or three tablespoons of liquid to it remelt it and just recast them and this recipe makes about sixty candies if you use smaller molds and if you use those little tiny bear molds you're gonna get about at least a hundred to 150 all right so these candies I had in the fridge overnight and I made lemon yesterday so you can see now I did I have found that they do stay there are better if you leave them overnight then just leaving them for a few hours and they'll come out and you pop them right into your sugar sour mix now your sugar sour mix should be one cup of sugar to a half a teaspoon of citric acid don't use any more make sure to thoroughly mix it in and that'll make a nice sugar sour mix if you just want sugar just use sugar what I usually do is for the sweet ones I will use a cup of sugar to about a quarter teaspoon of citric acid just a little bit because it brings out the fruit flavors so you just mix them into your sugar shake off the excess and lay them on a a rack with parchment paper to dry overnight now these guys also dry a lot quicker and then the other recipe and just pop them out now if you find that they're getting too sticky like this you can put them back into the fridge sometimes they do the when you leave them out they get too warm so as they get a little bit too sticky so what I usually do is take out one mold at a time and do them and that's it you'll continue doing that until they're all are all coated and just lay them out on the rack to dry overnight and those are your sugar or your sugar sour coated candies your sugar soda yeah cannabutter gummy and I just want to go for also a couple of things with regards to molds when you get brand news if you get brand-new silicone molds what I recommend to do is to cut to season them so I use a spray the spray cooking spray I spray it on let them sit for 20 minutes and then rinse them in hot water I don't use soap on them again but I want to rinse off all the excess cooking spray and then that kick that that cures them which is nice I found that red silicone mold do not work well for some reason they're thicker and I can never get anything out of them so I tend to stay away from red silicone molds I found the blues Browns and that work great but red mm-hmm does not work Oh to make inverted sugar replacement for corn syrup you need two cups of white sugar one cup of water and a quarter cup or sorry a quarter teaspoon of citric acid you're gonna need a pastry brush or a clean paintbrush brand new one will be better in a glass of hot hot water we're going to need a pot you want your pot to be super clean there cannot be even a speck of dust or dirt in your pot because it will cause your syrup to crystallize now you want a spatula and your candy thermometer that's pretty much all you need so to get started we're gonna get started in just one moment all right so we are gonna combine we're gonna put in our sugar or 1 cup of water and our quarter teaspoon of citric acid and we're gonna stir that till the biggest sugar begins to dissolve and any sugar crystals that are on the side you want to make sure to wash down we'll do that in a minute and if I change you see anything in your sugar at all any dust or any little particles whatsoever make sure that they come out because I said anything at all in your sugar will cause it to crystallize and sometimes things happen you get little little dust or little pieces of stuff I said then wash down any sugar crystals off of the side and then we're going to turn our heat on to medium high you want to make sure that your pot is always in the center of the burner so that you're getting proper even heat distribution not where your sugar is cooks prop evenly and so we're gonna continue to stir this until our syrup starts to boil the moment it begins to boil you're gonna stop stirring it stirring once it starts boiling will actually cause your syrup to crystallize and we need to avoid that at all costs so just continue stirring until it begins to boil and wash down and in between keep the washing down the sides of your pot for any sugar crystals whatsoever like literally one crystal will cause your your syrup to crystallize so although it's really easy to make it is very finicky when you're stirring it's also very important to take your spatula and go right around the edge of the pot the sugar likes to settle in on the edges so you want to make sure that nothing's sitting because otherwise if it sits to the bottom it will will stick and cause you problems so the reason why inverted sugar is so finicky and while any crib one single crystal or dust will cause it to crystallize because what we're making is a what's called a supersaturated solution so I don't know if you remember science class see that science stuff does come back to you if you you made saturated solutions and supersaturated solutions where you add a saturated solution is where you have water in salt you have us salt to its maximum saturation point in its water once you go one crystal beyond that it becomes what's called a supersaturated solution and that is what we're making here because we start out first of all with a saturated solution the two cups - 1 cup of water tea cups of sugar - 1 cup of water creates a super create a saturated solution by cooking off the water we are now gonna have more sugar content than your water which then creates your supersaturated solution there you go science for the day you've learned your something new you're done oh sorry one thing I did forget is you're going to need the lid for your pot mine as you can see this one is too big for it if you don't have the right lid no big deal just use them flipped over they work just as good so you definitely need the lid to your pot because once we stop cooking this we're gonna put the lid on it immediately now as soon as it starts to boiling you're gonna stop stirring it you're not going to stir it anymore from this point on you're going to add your candy thermometer and we are gonna cook the syrup to 230 for between 234 and 237 if you want a little bit of a looser syrup then 234 if you want it a little bit thicker than 237 but you're not gonna go beyond that and the only thing now that we're gonna do through the cooking process is wash down the sides of any sugar crystals form that it's the only thing you want to make sure that's equal that's it that we're going to do through the process so keep an eye on the thermometer goes fairly quickly don't walk away don't go be hitting the bong or anything silly like that and as I said as soon as it hits 234 you're gonna wash down any crystals that may be on the sides and then we remove it immediately from the heat place the lid on it and put it on your counter or a stone block and you're not going to touch it again until it's room temperature it is very important that it doesn't get agitated or moved in its cooling process because any agitation again can cause it to crystallize now if your sugar does start to crystallize at any point not a big not a huge deal put it on low heat re melted and it should be fine so as it's boiling while it's boiling into all the sugar melts the crystals can splash up onto the side so said just keep a very close eye and if you've got which imma call it screws here normally there's little bolts here on your pot where the handle make sure to clean around there because the sugar likes to hide in on those and the sugar also will gather behind the thermometer but I only tend to move that one time near the end of the cooking process because as I said you don't want to be agitating your sugar at all so when my syrup gets close to to 29 to 30 is when I will gently move the candy thermometer and wash the crystals off in and behind mat and then gently move it back all right so my temperatures now at 234 I like to actually let mine go to about 237 I like it a little bit thicker so at about 236 I'm gonna pull it because your sugar does still tend to and continue to increase once you pull it off the heat so we're at 235 236 I'm going to remove the candy thermometer turn off my burner remit place it over on my back burner here cuz it's nice and cool wash off any crystals that may be there for the last time be very careful and then you're gonna place your lid on it and you're not going to touch the syrup again until it reaches room temperature as soon as it reaches room temperature you can use it you can either store it on your counter or you can put it in the fridge for up to six months and the one thing is you can transfer it to another container however any time I've ever done that I have it ended up crystallizing I guess the agitation of moving it from one container to another so I just tend to leave it in the pot that I cook it in so I always recommend if you're gonna do that use a pot that it's not your favorite so that if your it's off to the side for a couple of months you're not gonna miss it so I basically designate one pot for my syrup so I'm not gonna miss that pot if I'm if I need it for in the next couple of months and that's it for inverted sugar making your own corn syrup so this said this is I use it quite often in place of my corn syrup it's great if you do not have access to a corn syrup easily or like places in the UK that you really don't have corn syrup you've got I think it's called a golden syrup I'm not sure but now you can easily make your own well I hope you enjoyed that little tutorial there on how to do your own inverted sugar thank you very much for watching you have a great so that's my little tutorial there on a regular gummies and sugar sour coated gummies I hope you enjoyed that as always if you have any questions at all please don't hesitate to put them in the comments I'll get back to you as soon as they can I do apologize I do sometimes have a bit of a delay there I don't mean to but some life takes over sometimes but I do try to get back to everybody as I can and then here's our little of my little lemon and I did lemonade and or sorry kind of turned out like lemonade so there lemon and raspberry and these are there were little little puppies aren't they cute well good luck with your candy making and I'd love to hear how your how yours turned out and if you have any questions about the inverted sugar let me know and I hope you have an awesome rest of your day thank you so much for watching and if you're new here and you like the video I really do hope you subscribe take care have a wonderful awesome day [Music]", "YDVZV7NDI2I": "what's up everybody welcome to the channel today we're going to be making cannabis kool-aid so let's get into it [Music] the ingredients to make your cannabis kool-aid would be two to three packs of kool-aid next you're gonna need your sugar we're gonna be using two cups total i'm gonna be using one and a half cup of white sugar and a half a cup of brown sugar i'm gonna be using a one gallon pitcher to make my kool-aid and the last ingredients to make our cannabis kool-aid would be your cannabis simple syrup if you don't know how to make the cannabis simple syrup no worry i'm going to leave the link below so the first thing i'm going to do is measure out my sugar [Music] i just measured out one cup of sugar so now what i want to do is take a bow and put my one cup of sugar in that bowl now set the bowl to the side now i'm going to measure out one cup of sugar but this time we're going to measure out a half a cup of white sugar and a half a cup of brown [Music] sugar [Music] all right guys so once you measure out your one cup of sugar put this to the side and what we're going to do is get our pitcher [Music] and add your sugar to it [Music] now add your kool-aid [Music] now mix your ingredients all right guys so now what we're going to do is move this to the side turn your stove on high now i'm going to measure out two cups of water [Music] put your pot on the stove and add the water once your water start boiling add your sugar let the water boil until your sugar is completely dissolved all right guys my simple syrup is now done so while your simple syrup is still hot add it to the kool-aid now mix everything together [Music] so now what we're going to do is add some more water to our pitcher so if you want to you can use water out of the sink but i'm going to be using spring water [Music] once you add your water to your pitcher just mix everything together [Music] now i'm going to put this in the fridge for a few hours [Music] all right guys so i've been about five hours my kool-aid is now cool so now what i'm going to do is infuse our kool-aid using the cannabis simple syrup all right so now what i'm going to do is measure out one cup of cannabis simple syrup so now i'm going to add the simple syrup to my koolaid [Music] now i miss it together [Music] all right guys my cannabis kool-aid is now done thank you for watching this video don't forget to like share and subscribe [Music] peace", "mAZXWAuWp6E": "[Music] [Music] what's up guys welcome back today I'm gonna be showing you guys how to make nerd ropes here's what you're going to need two boxes of nerds one cup of gummy bears and some tincture the first step is to fold some foil in an accordion shape and spread it along a baking sheet then you can pour your Nerds into each fold of the tin foil make sure you have enough because if you don't the gummy make sure we'll stick to the tin foil and it'll be harder to take them out after then you'll melt you're going bears in the microwave for about 40 seconds and if you like add 1 tablespoon of ginger and stir it in I'm gonna be pouring my gummy mixture into a squeeze bottle so it'll be easier to dispense be careful not to pour too much just like I did on that first one take it slow and just do a thin line now you can top the ropes with some more nerds once they've all been filled squish the tinfoil together to make them into a tighter more compact shape then put them into the fridge or freezer I still had some remaining mixture left and instead of making more ropes I'm just gonna make some little nerd bytes by using a mold that I had on hand I also added some more nerds on top before I put them into the fridge once they've solidified in the fridge or freezer shake off the excess nerds into a bowl and then peel them off the tinfoil now some of mine came off okay but some of them I had a little more difficulty with so I decided to leave them out for about 24 hours outside of the fridge or the freezer so that they could dry out a little bit more which made them a lot easier to peel off the nerd bites in the silicone mold came out really easily after letting them sit in the freezer for about an hour [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you guys they turned out so beautifully it did take an extra day for them to drive because they were sticking to the tinfoil but after I let them dry they turned out absolutely wonderful just make sure you put enough nerds on the bottom part of the tinfoil so that you're not having issues with the going mixture sticking I can't believe how fantastic they all came out I'm so excited and they're so delicious because I have already tried some and the little bites are so few I love them so much I could have made more ropes but I kind of liked having these little ones if you just grab I hope you guys enjoyed this video thank you to the person who requested me to make this video because I'm absolutely in love with these and I'll be definitely making them again thank you guys so much for watching I hope you try these out have a wonderful day", "YmpPGpPUw0Q": "[Music] hi guys welcome to Diamond delight edibles if this is the first time you're joining my name is Liz and all-you-can regular guys welcome back thank you so much for your support I just popped that 10,000 market oh my god think you could not have done any of that without your support guys I really really appreciate it it just means the world to me you like me you really really like me sorry just being an ass having some fun alright so today what I'm gonna do now that I showed you how to do canna candy sugar & Canas syrup we can now make our gummies without using butter and the Gerber is an emulsifier however if you want to make them super super strong absolutely go ahead and stuff the butter back in there but this gives you far more control over how strong or weak that you would like to make them now you guys are always asking me how much milligrams etc something is and I don't generally tend to answer that very often because it is all dependent upon what you make how you make it once you're starting THC is etc so what I've done is in the description there I've included a link for the calculator that I use it's a free signup it's a little course you're more than welcome to have a look take a look at it listen to her she's really interesting and lots of information but the calculator you can use for free and that's what I use so then you can go ahead and you can make your calculations and figure out how strong etc that you want to make your candies and with this it gives you a lots of versatility so you can go all can of sugar and syrup or half-and-half which is what I'm gonna do in the recipe so I will stop babbling on now and I'm gonna get into the ingredients of course and of course what we need and then we'll put all that stuff together and make some awesome gummies there we go alright guys all right so for our new gelatin for our new gummy version here you're gonna use one box of your paper flavored jello I three tablespoons of unflavored gelatin a half a cup of water for blooming your gelatin or what I use are these kool-aid waters so they're just flavored water so I now use these in place of water they're great because they add more flavour to it or you can kind of combine some flavors which is really cool to do so I use those things are nice they're lighter and sugar and said just adding more flavor now another thing you can do for adding flavor is juice crystals now I get these at the bulk bar and you can only get them during the summer time but I get these in all different flavors and I've got two tablespoons of those again enhancing the flavor that way if you don't want to use or have these flavors artificial flavors you can go use those which work great the other thing you're going to need is a quarter cup of your can of syrup and a quarter cup of water for our jello and then for our candy side our candy version so it's going to be like the other one where we do the cook you're going to need a half a cup of regular sugar 1/2 a cup of can of sugar or again you can use a full can of sorry a full cup of your can of sugar same thing with your syrup I'm using a quarter cup of canned syrup and a quarter cup of light corn syrup again you can go and use as much or as little of either of those as you like I like to do the half-and-half mainly for taste and not to kill people so that's my kind of my you I don't want anybody rendered completely useless and then we are going to need 1/2 a cup of water and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid and then as well if you want to add additional colors or flavors you can add those optionally as well and as I said if you want to add your butter as well it really makes them super duper you can do that you're just going to follow exactly the same thing except the previous steps from the previous version with regards to adding the butter and the Goregaon to emulsify it now something else I wanted to say and the same thing now in this version I'm not using the clear gel however you can use the clear gel exactly the same way as you do in the previous recipe of the regular and sour gummy recipe that's a good one to follow it's the most up-to-date and gives you both those versions that you can use and that's all we need for our ingredients and now we'll get into our equipment and then we will get the best part go and we'll get all this stuff put together alright so the equipment that you're going to need just like the other recipes a double boiler I just do a makeshift I get a bowl that will make sure that your water does not touch the bottom of your bowl you will need a smaller saucepan for our candy syrup two spatulas you will need your candy thermometer and you will need a larger pot that your bought is that your saucepan small saucepan will fit into ice water water with ice in it but a little tongue-tied today and obviously your candy molds now a lot of you ask me how many candy is gum you will get out of a batch now it's all depending obviously on the size molds that you use if you use about this large size I got these from Michaels you will get about sixty if you use of this size gummy which is kind of a little bit larger than those big ones you're going to get it probably about 75 to 100 and if you use the little teeny tiny ones then you're going to get about 150 to 200 of them so that's approximately what that recipe will break down to you for you and now d'leh before we get started there is something very important that I found out from my other recipe when I started this is and I don't do this in the other recipes but when we're working with the can of sugar and the can of syrups it is a must that we oil down the sides and the insides of our pot for the candy syrup reason being when it heats up and starts boiling the oil THC oil starts to separate and it sticks to the smiths of the metal of the pot you might have noticed that if you did that with a can of syrup which is why I redid the video for that specific reason so we're going to do things a little bit differently than we do for the regular candy recipe but I'll show you all those details once we get into it but the very first thing and don't really don't want to forget is we're going to lightly grease our saucepan and hold on just couldn't dribble a little bit of oil into it and then make sure to work it all the way around make sure to get it right into the corners because anywhere that this oil is not where there's no oil your THC will sit the only thing that dissolves THC oil is oil because it is oil soluble by doing this we're going to be able to scrape anything that sticks to the sides off much much easier then seeing all your products that they're going oh what happened so you said you want to lightly grease that you don't want to have any excess oil so make sure to do that up as well as your spatulas you want to lightly oil your spatulas for the same reason when we scrape it off the sides if these are not oiled it sticks to it and it doesn't come off so you want to make sure anything that is going to be touching the THC the syrup you want to make sure that you all and that's it I'm gonna get into putting our ingredients together and get this started oh one other thing I wanted to cover is with your moles I don't spray my moles beforehand but I have found sometimes that they do stick but so what I do is I care them so I will spray them or oil them down lightly let it sit for 20 minutes in the mold and then wash them out so it still leaves that oily feel but it's not gonna leave your Piquet knees all greasy and makes it far easier for them to come as well as you only have to cure them once every few once every five or six batches or so so it lasts a long time by doing it that way all right so now I promise we'll get into the ingredients in our candy all righty so the very first thing that we are going to do is we are going to microwave our quarter cup of liquid for about 50 seconds till it's boiling and we're going to bloom our unflavored gelatin all right so you're going to evenly sprinkle your gelatin over the top of your liquid whether you use water or the kool-aid water and then you are going to stir it in now a lot of punches I explained in about whether that your gummies did not are not that they're too sticky but they're not gelatin enough that can depend a lot of power on your gelatin I just bought a batch of gelatin because I buy a bulb that didn't it wasn't blooming at the strength of it or something was not working well I did two batches and I had almost double the gelatin so a lot of it is dependent upon your gelatin now one test that I do is when I put in the three tablespoons and mix it in it should start very quickly to get the texture of apple sausage and clicking up pretty quickly now this is not so what I'm going to do is I'm going to add in another half a tablespoon of gelatin yes I've just sprinkled on another half a tablespoon and I'm gonna stir that in and now I'm getting that texture of applesauce can you kind of see what I mean that's how you know you're probably are at the great strength for your gelatin starting off if your gelatin is not right from the beginning if it's mushy I'll show you when we go to put this in but that's the texture it should be once you once we've got it mixed in now we're gonna set that aside for five minutes or so to let that bloom now meanwhile we will add our box of jell-o I'm giving the blueberries well berry blue and we are going to add in our boiling water and stir that around and get it dissolving see was it and then just keep scraping because the jello will cause the sides of the bowl are cool it's good to just kind of stick to it so just keep scraping the sides down as you go and turn your heat on to low so again we only want to melt our gelatin over a hot water bath we don't want it hot at boiling at all that's what breaks our gelatin a lot of the time is you don't even think that you've got it too hot but really past hot water probably by 150 degrees it is that's about all you need so that's that's a big mistake that a lot of people make myself included so I'm just going to continue to stir that gently until the gelatin is dissolved and then we will add in our corn syrup and our other stuff and once your gelatin and that has started to melt the sugar takes longer because the sugar melts at a higher at a bit of a higher heat so it just takes a little bit longer but once your gelatin and that is melted you can add in your corn syrup and your flavor crystals if you're wanting to add so you saw your canister your quarter cup of Kanna syrup and then your flavored juice crystals if you want to add those in as additional flavoring and again just stir that until it all starts gets incorporated and now for you guys asking for those clear gummies how do I get my gummies clear this well you can now you could have perfectly clear gummies so I'm gonna kick it continue to stir this and just gently mix it together until everything is melted and combined I'd you notice I got my nails done so for all of you those wishing that I get them done they're done and to those of you commented there you go I know I looked at the videos and thought make and those are ratty looking hands so I do apologize hopefully it'll be better from now on in the future I hope you like these a little bit better do you got a look at them for quite a long time so why not make them a little bit more attractive and also just remember to continually scrape down the sides of your bowl so that the gelatin is not sticking to the sides and just to show you this is just how hot your water should be there shouldn't be any boiling just a little bit of steam coming off of that that's as how that's as hard as you want to get it otherwise any hotter than that it's gonna break your gelatin alright so now that everything's pretty much dissolved I'm going to add in our gelatin now here's another thing if your gelatin is after 5 minutes or so blooming is mushy when you touch it then your gelatin is not strong enough so whether it's old and it's weakened or there are different gelatin with different strengths if it is nice and firm to the touch and no mushy you're good to go so I just split this up into pieces slap her in and you're just gonna let that you're just gonna gently again stir that until it completely melts and again if you start to see any kind of foaming may take it off your heat immediately it's getting too hot so I'm just gonna let them set them going to continue to stir that until my gelatin is fully melted well once your gelatin is melted and everything looks good and it is nice and translucent just set it off to the side and now we're going to start our candy syrup alright for our candy syrup in goes our half a cup of white sugar our half a cup of Candace Canon sugar our Candace syrup quarter cup a can of syrup like I said before you're more than welcome to play around with your different measurements on that as long as it equals 1/2 a cup either way it doesn't matter and our quarter cup of light corn syrup our half a cup of water and our quarter teaspoon of citric acid and we're going to gently stir that till ever - your syrup till your sugar and water and everything's just combined and then once you're combined here turn your heat on to medium Cline to start and then we're going to drop it down to medium once it begins to boil and you're just going to continue stirring this make sure to get all around the edges because the sugar likes to sit there and so we're going to continue to stir this until it starts to boil now all of my and all the other candy recipes I say as soon as we start boiling we're gonna stop stirring and use our brush not in this recipe and I'll show you once it starts boiling as I said the oils yeah I got a little syrup on the burner there so the oils start to separate out with the heat and until it gets all to the same kind of temperature it will they will stick to the side so we're going to have to continually work the sides of the pot but you're going to want to be very very gentle because we don't want to spit dirt into the syrup so as I said I'll show that all to you once it gets there now you'll start to notice as as it's starting to heat up if you scrape the sides of your pot see all that that's your oil and that's what we want to make sure it gets back into our syrup so I usually have to use the two you want as I said you have to grease both spatulas here and work it off get it back into the syrup and we're gonna have to do this continuously through the whole cooking process so at anytime that you see any darkness starting to form on the side make sure to scrape it down and as your syrup gets hotter you can just put your spatula in it'll just melt it off and also make sure when you are scraping the sides of your pot hold on to the handle firmly I've done it before I wasn't paying attention and whoops and the last thing you want is molten lava being poured anywhere other keeping it in the pot so when your syrup begins to bubble starts boiling you're gonna touch your candy thermometer and remember this is normally where I say we stop stirring not this time so we're not actually going to stir it what we're gonna do is just to continually scrape around the sides of the pot but don't go deep into the syrup we just want to stay around the bubble area and you just want to keep pulling this in so this is the alcohol of the excess alcohol and stuff burning off and any impurities that are in it so see how it's gathering up on the sides that's what we want to make sure get them back into our syrup whatever is supposed to cook off will cook off whatever is good will stay in so again just gently don't go into the stirs syrup just gently keep going around the sides and you'll do behind the candy thermometer towards the end and we are going to cook our syrup - if you want a soft candy you're gonna cook it to 260 if you want a firm candy you can go as high as 280 280 is soft crack I'm gonna go to just before that I'm going to take this to 275 but you see what I mean about the oils how they just continue they'll keep going to the sides of the pot as it heats up and gets up to temperature it will it will the oils will get incorporated and once your syrup is boiling in that you want to just turn your heat down to medium just medium a little above medium I said then don't forget to get behind in behind the thermometer because it will hide in behind there I love the smell of this syrup cooking it's oh it smells so awesome oh and just as a tip for safety always have a fan either an overhead fan I've got one going or the if you've got an overhead on your stove regardless when you're ever working with tinctures even though you've working them in a dehydrated yeah most of it's cooked off some of them may not be and you just want on the safety side always have a fan going and leave don't be sparking anything up in the in the general area so you've had your gelatin sitting over on the side and you have a look and you've noticed that there's all this white inky foam stuff and you're sure positive that you didn't do it high on high heat the heat didn't get too hot that'll happen so nice if the gelatin is old and it's starting to break down so if you do see that in order to compensate for that bloom another tablespoon of unflavored gelatin and we're going to add it into the candy mixture at the end that's gonna help us compensate for the gelatin that's broken in our mixture here so that will help it so anytime that your candies come out super sticky and you can't get them out of the mold the reason is is because the gelatin is not gelling properly so there's a really handy tip there for you guys now in order to get that out because I don't want that in to go my syrup I'm gonna run this through a strainer before we put it into our syrup so now I might actually my syrup while I was babbling away there is getting close to temperature I've got my ice water ready to go and as soon as it hits temperature I'm gonna drop the bottom into the pot and once the temperature starts coming down and the cooking process is stopped I'm gonna set it to the side until the temperature comes down to 240 before we add our gelatin in just watch your thermometer till until the temperature starts coming down and your bubbles start stop bubbling and then just set it to the side and said until your temperature comes down to 240 all right so now my syrup is cooled and then it's say because I don't want that white foamy stuff into my syrup I'm going to use a strainer to pour it through that way it'll catch all the chunks of jell-o gelatin and being bad and I'm going to mix that in now I also what I did was I bloomed another tablespoon of gelatin in a quarter cup of liquid and we're going to add that in a little bit in a little bit so right now you're going to stir your jello and your candy syrup until it is all combined and if you find that your syrup is a little too sticky and it's solidified you can put your heat on to minimum you just want to heat the bottom to get the syrup off the bottom now you can make sure that you do so that you scrape the sides and if you said if you find that it's too hard coming off turn your heat on and it'll eventually start to melt so you just want to want to keep doing that until everything is completely melted in all the same temperature all right so now that everything is all melted together and nicely mixed now this is a test that I do to determine whether my syrup is did a job correctly if I pull it up and you see how it just goes in a nice smooth syrup it doesn't really seem to start gelling or anything it stays in a fine line so that's kind of telling me that this is gonna turn out way too sticky it's gonna come out what's it like you can't get it out of the mold it's more candy than the gelatin that's what I said about my gelatin breaking there that I knew that was gonna happen so I've added it I'm gonna add in the additional gelatin that I bloomed and I'm just gonna stir that until it's completely dissolved so now if you want your syrup just translucent that nice clear there you go you've got it you can go ahead and put it into your bottles your squirt bottles or use the little eye droppers for dispensing into your molds but however I never like to keep things plain so I'm gonna do half-and-half or I've got translucent and solid and also just to give you a look to see how to go about doing that all right so now when after adding the additional gelatin in now when I do my test you'll see it's thicker and it'll start to split up and almost solidify in midair so that's how you know it's likely going to set correctly I still had to not do things correctly that's occasionally but that is a very good indication that you're safe and good to go so if you wanted translucent go ahead and put it into your bottles at this point or use your eye dropper dispensers or whatever it is that you get it into your moles however I of course need to always get fancy so I'm gonna split this into two colors so I've got half of it translucent and half of it of the solid blue whoops all right so I'm just gonna eyeball this here if you want to be exact you can pour it into a measuring cup and split it exactly however I've been doing this from this pot for quite a while so I'm pretty good at it sometimes so because I mix the blue with the green because obviously the green from our can of syrup and our sugar so it's turned out a little bit greenish and I actually want this to be blue so I'm going to add in a little bit of blue color and then on 1/2 I'm going to add in white so this one I'm mixing in a few drops of blue you can use any kind of food coloring the gel base oil-based water base for this for this particular candy recipe does not matter so we're just gonna get that stirred in oh that's a pretty color you see it on the white that's nice that's a nice kind of teal color then in my other half I'm gonna pour in some of the blue the same kind of teal but this is gonna give me the solid background as the white now if you guys have white on hand make sure that you shake it really really well if it's hot it sitting for a while it does separate and you will find that if you pour it in you're gonna get a little tiny white it doesn't go well you get little white lumps or something like that it just doesn't blend really nicely so make sure to shake it really really well you can almost hear it come back together it's like you can almost hear the water at the top and then all kind of comes together and sounds a little bit thicker so I'm gonna pour a little bit of that in isn't that pretty so again you're just gonna thoroughly mix that in until it is one complete uniform color and once I've got that i'll get it into my bottles and we'll get this into the mold there's a little trick i learned the other day find it by Occident that's on most things happen so I'm if you want to have a half and half candy where you've got the clear on the bottom and the solid on the top what you can do to easily make that happen is use your hand blender on this we whip a bunch of air into it and once you put them together the air is all I'm automatically gonna bring the solid color up to the top or if you want to do that with the if you want it the other way around then air Rach you're clear but you're gonna have to wait a while for the bubbles to come out because that's gonna make it not so clear so I recommend just putting the solid on the back you can do that it's just a quick way of doing it otherwise you have to pour one layer let it set a little bit and then pour your second layer well aren't I just a cesspool of useless information today I'm just gonna pour this into my squirt bottle this should make a full almost a full bottle or a little bit more see bang almost right on now if you guys have to haven't seen these before these are the best squirt bottles ever they just make putting it into the mould so much easier especially if you want to blend colors absolutely highly recommend these I've got there's a link for them in the description there for you to make it easy if you'd like to order them and I'm just gonna do my clear and we'll get this going all right so I said I always do two colors I always like doing that so I did combination I'll either just whoosh or if you want to happen half you can do it that way you can go this way freestyle whatever you like and that's it get them all into your mold and you're gonna put them in the fridge for a minimum of two to four hours sometimes they've got to go overnight now if you let them go overnight and they're still sticking you can't get them out of the mold put them into the freezer for a few hours let them freeze up take one mold out of it I'd add out at a time and pop them out as quickly as possible if they still if there's still stop the first you'll come out if it starts to stick throw it back in the freezer work on another mold put them into a double boiler melt them down on low heat and add another tablespoon of gelatin melt it and recast them and that will fix that problem for you and that's it enough I'll come back low will pop these out so you can have a look at them and I'll show you how to sugarcoat them not that sugarcoating is that difficult but you can coat them with the can of sugar and just show you an easy way of doing it and that'll be it will say goodbye candies upset and you can do this in a bowl or I found that doing them in a large plastic bag worked a lot easier so in this I put a half a cup of regular sugar 1/2 a cup of can of sugar and I put a quarter part about a quarter cup of the flavored drink crystals that I used in my recipe again the drink crystals are totally optional for you just adds that little bit extra flavor and then I added about a half a teaspoon of citric acid because I wanted these to be a little bit more on this our side if you just want to have just a little bit of a tick bite but not really sour at all I add a quarter teaspoon so I'll do those two my sweet ones and then to the sour I use a 1/2 a teaspoon of citric acid I don't recommend using much more than that one it's not going to the sour flavor isn't that great and it can also melt your candies because citric acid acid is water soluble so simple enough you can actually see it oh and I also have sorry a wire a wire rack with parts line o parchment paper line line on top of it for them to dry so I just pop them out these guys are popping out nicely and I get and what I do is I do one mold at a time so I leave the rest of them in the fridge because otherwise they start to warm up and they can makes it difficult sometimes for them to come out of the mall so I just think about one at a time and once I get them on the bag I go a little bit there and I just fish them out and shake off the excess sugar and we just lay them out to dry here just like all our other candies this is just a slightly smaller mold that I use same thing now see sometimes you'll do that and you'll see you think oh no they're not gonna come out they're stuck just pull the edges away and then they just they'll just come right out now if you do that and it doesn't come out that's when you would put them into the freezer so again you see that just around the edges to pull it away and they're good to go and that's about it I'm just gonna go through and sugarcoat the rest of these guys and then I'll be back to say goodbye well guys that's my little demo there on your cannon Candace Eric and sugar gummy bears I hope you enjoyed the demo as always if you have any questions at all please don't hesitate to ask and thank you guys so much again for your support and let's get to the 50,000 whoo all right so you have an awesome rest of your day and thanks again for watching [Music]", "pxqo1RfC6Z8": "[Music] hi welcome to diamond delight edibles my name is liz if this is the first time you stop by and for the rest of you guys welcome back thank you so much i really truly appreciate all your awesome comments and your wonderful love and support i do apologize i've been a little absent for the last couple of months i've been really pretty sick for a while there um today's about the first day that i felt good so yeah i came to make you guys a video so if you want more details i put up a video under the community area there but i'm not going to bore you with the nitty gritty details here so let's jump into what i've got for you today and what i've got for you today are hot chocolate balms so what these are if you haven't seen these yet are really cool so these chocolate balls they're the hard chocolate balls and they're filled with hot chocolate or cocoa whichever you prefer and you put them into your mug add your hot milk and they turn into hot chocolate of course canna um but uh these are just wonderful and they make awesome um gift ideas for the holiday time which is just coming up right around the corner i know i'm sorry i'm sorry um but as i said they do make great gift ideas so without any further babbling on here let's jump into those ingredients the equipment that we're going to need to get these made and let me show you how to make these oh one thing i did tell you because this recipe today i mainly just show you how to make the chocolate balms if you want to see further details on how to infuse coco cocoa butter um check out my video on canna real milk chocolate and there i show you exactly the details on how to infuse cocoa butter and yes you can only use cocoa butter with real chocolate you cannot use coconut oil or anything else so please don't ask me that question only cocoa butter so i said if you need any further details on that as well as tempering details all right so what we're going to need for our can of hot chocolate balms is two cups of real chocolate and um you want to make it a dark chocolate it's going to give you a richer flavor so about 2 cups or 16 ounces if you've got black chocolate or shaved chocolate that's what you want to go with 16 ounces or two cups about one and a half to two cups of hot chocolate powder and this will be the pre-made hot chocolate powder it's already done with sugar if sugar is an issue for you then you can definitely use just straight coco you don't have to use the pre-made hot chocolate as i said i just do it because it's already got the sugar mixed in and it just simplicity's sake we if you want to add marshmallows what i did because these little dehydrated marshmallows are difficult to find is i just bought a really inexpensive hot chocolate mix sifted out the hot chocolate and kept marshmallows hey me um i think they if they're available on amazon if they are i'll throw a link down for you and then for i'm going to decorate mine with some salted caramel um for the decoration and give my hot chocolate a little hint of salted caramel but you don't have to do that if you just want to decorate them with a milk chocolate later to have that contrast giddy up i have not just leave them plain and then we're going to use um so this can be an and or an ore i'm going to add infused cocoa butter to my chocolate and i'm going to add about two tablespoons the other thing i'm going to do this is the end or i'm going to infuse my hot chocolate with tincture so as i said if you've got both you can do it if you just got one or the other there there you go you just add the cocoa butter to your chocolate or tincture to your hot chocolate all right so that's it for the all right so the equipment that we're going to need is you're going to want a double boiler for melting your chocolate so glass bowl in a pot or if you've got a proper double boiler you can use that of course most people don't so a bowl that fits snugly so um you don't have steam and stuff coming out the sides the other is you just want to add enough water you um towards the bottom you don't want any water touching the bottom of your bowl because it will get too hot and it will burn your chocolate also make sure if it starts boiling a little bit that it's not going to be touching the bottom of the bowl so you can always melt your chocolate in the microwave or what i picked myself up is one of these chocolate melting pots these things are really really nice so if you do do a lot of chocolate you may want to take a look at investing in one of these and what's great about it is because you have total temperature control although it's in celsius so you're in fahrenheit you just need to get some conversions but um easy to do anyhow as i said you can go 30 is about 86 degrees fahrenheit i believe which is your lowest temper for milk chocolate and for um for milk chocolate and white chocolate and then it goes up to 80 which for the most part you would never go that high because that's like 165 so and the reason that these are super nice is you can put your chocolate on and just walk away and leave it for a while you don't have to stay over the pot and continually stir it it's kind of nice basically i say it's just idiot proof for melting i've burnt chocolate before on the double boiler i step away for a moment this i can just drop the heat down step away go do what i want come back and just adjust my temperature and carry on my merry way so besides a way to melt your chocolate you're going to want a candy thermometer or a chocolate thermometer measuring spoon measuring cup about a quarter cup measuring cup or depending on how much tincture you're going to use a couple of spatulas straight edge a straight edge cutter offset spatula and a straight edge spatula if you've got those and a whisk you can use a metal whisk or a silicone whisk for chocolate either is okay [Music] you're also going to want a pair of gloves either silicone or latex or whatever really professional chocolatiers use cotton gloves but we'll just go with these this will help prevent you getting fingerprints on your product as you're as you're playing around with it if you're going to do some decorating you want a piping bag and then our mold for our little chocolate balms so this is i believe about a one and a half inch mold i will put up the link for it to um for you to see exactly which one it is and we're going to want parchment paper and the last thing that the method that i'm going to use to temper my chocolate is tabling if you are going to do tabling you need a marble slab or another natural stone slab things are falling uh is a natural slab as i said or marble and i actually got this from a table so all right let me get that out of the way and we're going to need a bowl we're doing our hot chocolate little tincture a baking dish with parchment paper and you're going to want a fine mesh strainer and a bowl i think that's about it of course you know i always forget something along the way but if i do i'll let you know all right so let's jump right in and let's get our hot chocolate infused with our tincture all right so to infuse our cocoa or our hot chocolate whichever you're using um get your uh get your powder get your strainer and we're just going to sift this through just to take out any lumps so you don't want all those lumps and stuff in your in your mix now i'm going to use about a quarter cup for 2 cups of for a hot chocolate mix oh another thing with regards to your hot chocolate mix i forgot to tell you read the directions on how much you need so there are some usually the less expensive ones will be like four heaping tablespoons or four heaping teaspoons you want to make sure uh you don't really have any more than two tablespoons um less is better it's hard to get it in those bowls balls and get them together so you want to make sure that your hot chocolate instructions are for at least two tablespoons or under just a helpful tip for you there this is my green dragon tank shaw and i'm just going to put a little bit on it first use my whisk whisk her in and you want to add in a little bit at a time because if you for one if you use an alcohol that is not a 94 or 96 you're going to have a lot more water you want to be careful of that because you're going to end up making it pasty so just add it a little bit at a time if you notice it getting clumpier pasty stop if you're using the 94 96 you can get away with a lot more but as i said just do it a bit at a time if you notice it getting pasty it all stopped you can always add more later so you can uh evaporate the batch and you can always add on as a secondary level if you want to make it really really strong i however don't really like to render people unconscious but hey whatever float your boat and then i take my strainer again and sorry you want to preheat your oven to 175 degrees if you're doing this in a an electric oven you i do not recommend doing this in a gas oven some people have done it successfully others have not always err on the side of caution and flame and alcohol don't mix and you can also use a dehydrator or you can always leave it out overnight if you have to do the table dry method just leaving it out overnight you're going to want to sift it a few times through throughout the night throughout the day and there we go so i'm going to pop this into the oven at 175 on the middle rack i'm gonna leave the oven door slightly ajar i have a ceiling fan going always make sure that you have some type of ventilation going don't ever take it for granted you can do this a hundred times with no problems and then one time you do it without ventilation and there can be a problem so very very skinny so what i usually do is i spread it out on the wrap trying onto the tray nice and evenly and then i just put little dash marks in it here just just so we can heat up through and i said pop that in the oven keep the door slightly ajar and it'll probably take about 10-20 minutes for that to evaporate so what i'll do is every couple of minutes i'll go with um one of my spatulas and just move the um hot chocolate powder around and then re-flatten it out so this way it brings the heated from the bottom to the top and it helps to evaporate it quicker and if there's any large lumps you want to uh just mush them out all right so we'll be back when that's done alright so my hot chocolate is done as take it from the oven now a tr uh test that you can do to see if it's done to make sure it's done is it's only at 175 degrees not that hot if you have really sensitive skin don't do this but if you've got tougher hands just run it over your hands and let it go and then if you feel any coolness on your hands from the air that means you still have some alcohol left so throw it in a little bit longer if it's totally dry you're good to go so we're just going to set that off to the side till the end time when we're going to need that next on to our chocolate all right so for our chocolate if you are using a double boiler you want to put it on medium low as i said you don't want it to get too hot chocolate melts at a very very low temperature so i'm using my pot i'm going to add in my chocolate and i'm going to add in two tablespoons of melted infused cocoa butter if you want to learn more about how to infuse cocoa butter and tempering chocolate check out my video canada real milk chocolate and i go over all those steps and details for you so i like to melt my cocoa butter first and add it onto my chocolate and then mix it over all of my chocolate i just found that it just blends a lot better this way when i do it the other way where i use cold cocoa butter i found a few more times than not i ended up with streaking and this method i don't just a little tip i'm giving you oops that pots are wasted small so i'm just going to continue to stir that until she all melts down nicely and as i said because i'm using this melting pot i can go toddle away for a couple of minutes i would just drop my temperature down right now i'm doing this for melting the chocolate i am doing it between 50 and 55 celsius and over in this pot over here i'm just melting my salted caramel yeah the salted caramel chips you can get them uh i found them in most grocery stores a bulk barn they're really easy to come by now if anyone's going to ask me can you do this with butter or anything else coconut oil no you cannot the only thing that you can add to real chocolate is cocoa butter and the reason for that is um the temperature at which uh but the cocoa butter melts butter and coconut oil melt at a very low temperature at like 79 80 degrees it'll start to melt so if you use those your chocolate will never ever stay set at room temperature that is the reason so if you see any recipes that are using butter in that don't bother trying it don't waste your time unless you plan on keeping them in the fridge and then using them right out of the fridge then you're fine but if you want them to stay set no will not work so just a little tip for your chocolate if you're using a block chocolate you want to make sure that you cut it up really really really fine using a serrated edge knife works really well for that same thing if you're using larger chunks you want to chop them down to smaller size it helps them develop quicker and if you're using a double boiler and that you um you don't have to worry so much about um with it burning if you have really large chunks in really small chunks it takes a lot longer for those big ones to melt and you can burn your chocolate that's why i just said i found these melting pots just so nice just temperature control like i said it's just a nice toy it's definitely it's not a necessity for making chocolate it's just it's a nice to have what would be super nice to have is a tempering machine chocolate tempering machine those things are expensive especially the good ones so i'm just continuing to melt my chocolate down here and once it's all melted we're going to get it to temperature of 113 degrees fahrenheit that's for dark chocolate if you're doing milk chocolate or white chocolate it'll be about 108 109 now if you're microwaving your chocolate um with about two cups or 16 ounces you're going to start with two 30 second intervals and then drop down to 25 sorry then drop down to 20 15 10 and then continue at 10 second intervals until you reach the temperature that you need so as i said for dark chocolate 113 fahrenheit for milk or white chocolate uh 10109 so our chocolate is almost all melted so i'm just going to check the temperature right now to see where we're at i'm going to guess about a hundred 99 i was close so with your chocolate with your thermometer if you're using one of these tight always clean off the end so that you get a correct read because the chocolate will harden up on the end of your thermometer and it can cause it cause a misread so i'm just going to continue to stir this until we get to our temperature so i'm just going to check it every couple of minutes another thing to remember um is that water is chocolate's mortal enemy if you get even a drop of water in your chocolate it can seize if that does happen don't panic get your sunflower or soy lecifit and put in just a drop or two that can help uh save it it can help loosen it up so where in most cases we use those as an emulsifier in chocolate it works for its viscosity so it'll help thin out chocolate so that so always make sure that your equipment whatever you're going to use is thoroughly clean and dried um i i just i generally do not use um wooden handle uh spatulas or anything because wood can retain moisture so i've done that before where i was doing chocolate and stirring away and it seized on me because the handle was damp so yay so i tend to try to like to stick to the solid silicone uh type spoons are but i find i find work best all right so we're at 113 for the dark chocolate you want to turn your heat off take it off your heat and you want to make sure your marble um your marble stone area work area is completely clean and again 100 dry so in the previous video i showed you tabling um this is a slightly different method in the one in the other video i still used temperature to get us to that point this does not so what you do is you take half of your chocolate if i engage what half is you set your regular you set your melted chocolate off to the side and you get your straight edge uh straight edge and your offset spatula and you're going to work the two use the two the agitation is what is going to create our beta crystals that we need and this what we're going to do is we're going to work the chocolate until it gets till it thickens up so this can oops you don't do that try and stay on the table but make sure to get all the chocolate from the side get that scooted in holder the cold from the side is what helps to start thicken up your chocolate i have found this has become my favorite way for tempering might take a couple of times for you to try it but as i said if you don't temper the first time you just re-melt it do it again continue to clean off the blades my coordination is not so good our chocolate's beginning to thicken up here a little bit almost getting to where we want it to be yeah professional chocolatiers are way neater at this so you can see the chocolate starting to thicken up now it's not flooding out as quickly i'm just going to go a little bit further almost done i found this way this method far quicker and more efficient i hate the other ways i have very few times do i ever get it right so you can see our chocolate's thickened up here it's not as fluid and it's starting to harden as it goes out to the sides so this looks about where we want it to be scoop up your chocolate not those other peas get the little pieces melted there [Music] now we're going to take our the half chocolate that we have and we're going to add in our thickened chocolate again chocolatiers make this look far more impressive eyes look like what the hell am i doing but trust me it works then get your whisk put my whiskey and you're going to mix it together until it becomes one texture the same texture it all gets mixed together and melts those two different textures together and becomes one nice smooth and silky and the color's all the same that looks pretty good now we're going to get our mold and you're going to fill that up fill them up to their tops you don't have to worry about being too neat you want to be pretty quick mix get that moved around and then you can try and dump it into your pot or you just pour it onto the parchment paper and scoot it off or pour it onto the board and scoot it off so you want to drain out the excess get your straight edge spatula and you want to scoop off scrape off all this excess off you want to try and make sure your molds are nice and clean at the tops and again you can move the chocolate around and we're going to dump out the excess and again we're going to clean the excess off the top here give her a little smack down get getting any air bubbles make sure that also make sure this is even now what i like to do is to place them upside down on a parchment lined board and pop them into the fridge to set this way um you don't get this big hunk of chocolate set at the bottom of your get that mold of the way you can just take it through any excess this will save you having a big lip what we want to try and create is a nice little edge and scrape off that top then i'm going to flip this upside down on my board here i'm going to pop this in the fridge for about then with your leftover chocolate here grab your pot and we're just going to scoop it back in the pot and re-temper it again for the second round so i think you can do this with candy melts um the only problem if you don't want to do chocolate tempering in that the only problem is i don't know how well or how easily they melt with um in the hot milk or hot milk and or cream but what you could always do to find out ahead of time makes it what you can always do is just do a quick test melt you don't have to infuse anything just melt some candy melts up um into the ball shape and see how they melt in more milk they melt up nicely then absolutely you can just use candy melts and you don't have to go through all this tempering chocolate all right so while my first layer there are cooling in the refrigerator i'm just going to re-melt my chocolate back up to the 113 fahrenheit and then just re-temper it again like i said it takes you may take you a couple of times to get this but if you can get down this method honestly it's so much easier and it makes you feel more professional so see our bowls now see how nice they are nice and even so again i'm going to fill them up i don't know where i'm going get that out of the way for a minute so we want to get that mixed around get that coated and again we'll just dump out the excess on our parchment paper and then we're going to scrape off this excess again you want to try and get the um the tops here as clean as you can getting your chocolate out of your mold a lot easier i just want to kind of smack out air bubbles here a little bit and then again we're going to dump out the excess so the reason that you want to make sure to be getting out all the excess chocolate is just have a really nice um even mold of your chocolate you won't end up with a big lump of chocolate in the base of them again clean off the excess and then one more time and then we're gonna do one final scrape here and i'm going to flip her upside down onto my parchment board here and pop it in the fridge here for about 15-20 minutes and then your leftover chocolate you can just um keep in a plastic container and just save it for next time there we go you can recoup most of your chocolate especially when it's expensive you do not want to be wasting too much and the other thing you can do is just take your parchment paper if you want to make sure to get all your chocolate pretty much put that in the refrigerator once it cools up all of that will just crumble right off i however i'm not gonna bother all right so we'll let those cool up then next we'll decorate them fill them and put them together all right so on to decorating if you're going to decorate go to this step if not you can skip on to the to the filling part so we've got our molds and they're all nicely set so you want to very gently take them out this is what you want to put your gloves on because you do not want to get fingerprints all over your pretty little balls and now you'll know your chocolate chocolate is tempered by when you touch it if it instantly melts and then it is not tempered but if it stays then it's good and it's not instantly melting on your fingers then you're good if it is not tempered it's not going to be if they're not going to be as pretty and shiny they'll be a little bit dull or streaky and as well as they said as soon as you touch them they will like instantly melt on your fingers so i've just put my salted caramel into a disposable piping bag and i'm just going to cut a little hole here and then probably should do this on a wire rack duh i knew i needed one so place the model place the wire rack down and then put some parchment paper underneath that and i'm gonna pop these in the fridge let that set up for just a couple of minutes while that's setting up well let's get our hot chocolate ready so again get your strainer and um and i've got a bowl here [Music] pay attention so i'm going to dump our hot chocolate into our strainer and we'll just strain it through take out all the lumps all right so on to our final step here everything's set here so we're going to fill them up and seal them up but what i've been here is i've got some tempered chocolate that i put into a piping bag and i put a really really tiny hole at the inlet tip so you're going to flip your little guys over if you if they're a little stuck to your rack here just get a little spatula and gently scoop those off and my um hot chocolate it its um recipe is two tablespoons so i'm gonna do one into each side so these get a little tricky to to stick together and then i take some marshmallows throw those in i'm just gonna make a little pipe that around the edge here carefully come together like so and stick them together then you can just gently with your finger just scoot off the excess off the edges here and then what i'll use is where'd they go is the medium size or these are the medium size or small sorry small um muffin cups to hold them in see pretty again we want to get that nice get a little edge on it take your two make sure your designs are going the same way let's scoot them together gently not the prettiest one but oh well can't be perfect we'll use that for the tester and there you have it hot chocolate bombs so what i'm going to do right now is i'm going to heat up some milk and we're going to give her a shot give her a try see how they turn out all right so i've got some boiled milk here let's check out how our balm does i'll use the ugly one so we just plop her into our cup here and i like to use a whisk we pour our hot milk i like to do a mixture of cream and milk that is my milk i don't really like it and look at her start to melt so what i like to do is to put just about a quarter in and get her mixed up use her whisk get her all nicely mixed up let's fill her up and there we have it [Applause] yummy yummy hot chocolate bombs that was good that was a perfect amount yum yum well before i can't finish up this video because if i keep going on this hot chocolate i'm going to bid you a fair a jew so i hope you enjoyed that video thank you guys so much for joining and thank everybody for i would

going to be making infused flamin hot cheetos now only RV is going to be absolutely amazing they are also the easiest recipe you're ever going to come across on this channel and it only requires two ingredients what you're gonna need some flaming hot cheetos tincture or infused butter or oil the first step is to spread out the cheetos on a baking tray if you're using tincture like I am you'll pour it into a little spray bottle I like this bottle because it does a really nice fine mist if you're using oil or butter you'll need to make sure it's warm enough to be liquidy and use one of these oil mister bottles like this I'll post a link for each of these items in the description box below now all you have to do is spray your Cheetos with the tincture or the oil if you're using the tincture you can just leave them out to air dry and they should be good after a half an hour to make them even stronger I'm gonna flip them all over and spray them again you can repeat this process and spray them as much as you like to get the desired strength just make sure not to use too much so they don't get too soggy if you're using oil or butter you'll need to put them into the oven for five minutes at 200 degrees I left my note to dry for about a half an hour and they're ready to put into bags now they've dried out they're ready to eat today obviously tastes amazing thank you guys so much for watching I hope you guys try this out if you enjoyed this video please give us a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe have a wonderful day [Music]", "4FspCKI1Y60": "[Music] hey it's mad at Rafal studios welcome to cannabase --ax today we're making cannabis infused marinara sauce this episode is sponsored by the mighty fast herbal infuser you can save money on my favourite cannabis infusion device add the herbal infuse or calm with the code ruffhouse this episode is part of our ongoing summer of fresh recipes today we're using roma tomatoes you need 4 tablespoons of olive oil an eighth of cannabis half an onion 12 to 16 roma tomatoes 6 cloves of garlic 1/2 a cup of red wine a tablespoon of honey a teaspoon of basil a teaspoon of oregano teaspoon of salt 1/2 teaspoon of ground black pepper 1/4 teaspoon of crushed red pepper and 1 teaspoon of balsamic vinegar and as far as the cannabis goes you can use a quarter ounce of the flowers or you could use 3/4 to 1 ounce of Shaker trim or 3/4 to 1 ounce of rosin chips in the first step if you're starting from scratch as we are is going to be 2 d car up your cannabis so I'm taking my cannabis flowers I'm going to go ahead and grind it up take out any stems and seeds if you have any of that put it in an oven safe dish now you could also use pre-made cannabis infused oil for this recipe and if you're doing that you can skip this step alright but then we're also going to put a lid on our animus and put that in the oven 2 D car but 250 degrees Fahrenheit for 30 minutes [Music] now that D card time is just perfect for the amount of time that we're going to need to prep our tomatoes so we're going to blanch our tomatoes by dropping them in some hot water for a couple of minutes until they start to blister and then we're gonna put them in some cold water to cool them off and to loosen up those skins and then once you do that with your tomatoes you'll find it really easy to pull off the skins and that's a lot better than trying to peel them in my opinion and also is starting to soften up Tomatoes which is going to make it a lot easier when it comes to stewing them so we'll continue peeling our tomatoes till they're all skinless and there we go now we'll be able to go ahead and chop them into smaller pieces and put them in a bowl and set them aside because we'll be using them later and like I said this is a just about the perfect amount of time to do this while the cannabis has been activating in the oven okay so now our cannabis is out of the oven and we're going to proceed with making the cannabis infusion so what I'm going to do is I'm dividing the olive oil so I've using four tablespoons and also I'm putting two tablespoons here in the and the oil that I'm going to infuse and I'm putting that inside of that cannabis that has been activated and putting the lid back on and then it's gonna go right back into that same oven that's still at 250 degrees Fahrenheit and we're going to let that infuse for one and a half to two hours while we make the rest of the recipe [Music] okay so we have like an hour and a half in two hours now should let that infuse and we can use that time to prep up our other ingredients like the onion and the garlic and the fresh herbs you could also use dry herbs in this and also if you have canned tomatoes and you want to skip that section about the tomatoes you can also do that and as I've said before you could also use pre-made cannabis infused olive oil so for instance if you have an herbal infuser machine like the mighty fast herbal infuser you can make your oil in that and then skip the step as far as making the cannabis oil okay but otherwise we're just going to go ahead and prep all the other ingredients and then we're moving ahead with the rest of the recipe so we're taking a large saucepan on medium high heat we added in the garlic the onions and the other two unenthused tablespoons of olive oil and then we caramelized and sweated those onions down till he started to caramelize and now I've added in the 1/2 cup of red wine and it will deglaze the pan with the red wine and let that reduce a little bit then we're going to add in those tomatoes that we had prepped earlier we're going to add in those fresh herbs that we just chopped up we're adding in the honey we're adding in the vinegar and all the rest of the ingredients we've got in the crushed red pepper going in we've got a salt we're gonna add some black pepper and now we'll let that stew down until your desired consistency and you can adjust the time and the temperature to coincide with how thick you want it and so with the infusion that's going on in the oven alright but now that infusion is finished and you can see I'm taking my cannabis and infusion and instead of the whole separate step of infusing and separating it out through a strainer I'm just gonna strain it right directly into my dish so you see I just use a fine mesh filter and just drop the oil right in there just using sort of the cream of the crop of the infused olive oil there because I wanted to taste really good and boy does it so that's pretty much it you want to just let it simmer for about five or ten minutes on the very low heat just to let that olive oil that's infused infuse into the rest of the olive oil that's not infused and you can serve it right away dip it in some breadsticks put it over some spaghetti this is a great marinara sauce that you can use or you can store it in a jar a container with a tight lid and just keep it in refrigerator and pop it out whenever you want to use it easy peasy and it's fresh delicious and healthy again I would like to thank the guys at Barbara infuser for sponsoring this video you can save money with a code roughhouse

very very strong THC oil using 17 different rosin pucks [Music] the thing about these rosin pucks is they are still loaded with THC we haven't been pressing super high pressure lately we've been doing around 650 to 700 so there is a lot of rosin left over in these the great thing is we've got a new teach egg tester so we're gonna find out just how many milligrams is left inside this oil at the end the last video you saw when our boss drank that entire thing he was completely loaded we are gonna find out just how many milligrams that was and we anticipate this one's gonna be a lot stronger so stay tuned to see just what the measurement comes out to we'll start by getting a little bit of coconut oil 60 milliliters and our beaker over there and warm that up to about 140 degrees for 5 minutes alright so there's our 60 milliliters what we're gonna do is add it to this larger beaker because we're gonna be putting the pucks inside here we need a little bit more space [Music] all right so we're gonna let that heat up for a few minutes it's at about 170 degrees right now okay so our oil is now at around 125 degrees we're gonna go ahead and start adding our pucks like I said we have 17 bucks right here if you want to take a look at these you can see these things are cake this thing has got a nice yellow color still kind of sticky smells great wish you guys could smell this we're gonna start by adding 2 at a time try to save a little time here so I'll take these two right here take a look at these I want you to see what they look like before and after they're gonna be a lot more clear and that oil is gonna be bright yellow by the time I'm done with these two so let's go ahead and have these in there make sure they're fully submerged and boom as you can see we can easily add two at a time in here as we lose a little bit of oil we might have to drop down to one at a time so this all depends on how much oil you're using [Music] all right so it's been about five minutes we're gonna go ahead and take a look at these pugs make sure we got all the rosin outside of them it was about five minutes and we're doing two at a time it's important to know that you can even do seven to ten minutes depending on how your puffs look after we're gonna take a look right now you can see that the oil is already a completely different color than it was originally so these do look pretty clear we'll probably go ahead and let those sit for about two more minutes make sure we get everything out and then we'll completely remove them [Music] okay so it's been two more minutes let's go ahead and remove these our first one here as you can see that was a lot more clear take a look at our oil here it's got a nice yellow color it was originally clear so we're gonna do is go ahead and squeeze the rest of the oil out of these pucks here okay so our first two pucks got them right here as you can see those things are really clear we pulled a lot of rosin out of those here's a one we haven't done yet next one we have done as you can see there's a lot of rosin inside of these puck still what we're gonna do is bill the other 15 bucks in there on a time lapse to save you guys time and go ahead and see how this oil tests out at the end okay so that was the last puck we just did all 17 as you can see these are completely clear now we pulled all the rosin out of those as you can see the oil is way dark way darker than last time we assume is gonna be very potent we're gonna go ahead and test it out but first we've got Adi carbon so let's get that last puck out of there [Music] okay so we just removed that last puck and we turned the temperature up a little bit on our hot plate we're trying to get around that 220 to 240 degrees range we're gonna let that boil sit there for about 10 minutes so we can de carve this is gonna activate all the THC that's inside that oil this should take about 10 minutes but we're gonna pay attention to the bubbles that are forming as you see those bubbles that means it's d carving and once those disappear you're pretty much good to go [Music] okay so next we're going to do is take a nug Smasher 37 micron bag and strain the oil through it what that's going to do is get rid of any of that plant material was left over [Music] all right so what were left with is 20 milliliters of completely activated THC oil what we're gonna do is use our new teach egg test machine a lot of you have been recommending this to us you really want to know how many milligrams of THC was in a in the oil when we were done what this does is it uses light to analyze the oil and give us the total cannabinoid count we know that flour that we pressed was predominantly THC however if you were doing heme it would give you the CBD results as well the only thing is it only tests up to 15 milligrams of THC or total cannabinoids per milliliter so we're gonna have to dilute our rosin oil right here in a twenty to one ratio with coconut oil so we'll do that now all right so let's get our scale zeroed we're gonna add a point 400 grams of clean coconut oil right here alright next we're gonna add point O two of our rosin oil [Music] turn this on alright so we're testing isolate infusion we're doing coconut oil temperatures about 75 and the infusion has been deep carbs we're going to go ahead and begin the test first we got to ensure the tray slot is empty which it is okay let's just calibrate yeah and while that's calibrated we can go ahead and add our oil to the tray right here [Music] all right all right we got the results ten point six times twenty so two hundred the point six times two would be [Music] so two hundred and twelve per milliliter and how many do we have twenty Destin that's that's a lot for one person to drink that's pretty heavy all right so extremely potent oil right here we just got this tea check yesterday we've been playing with it for the past two days really cool device we were really interested to see how many milligrams this was 4240 that's a lot more than most people would do in one dose like we did last time thanks for watching the video and make sure you stay tuned for next time hey guys make sure you

welcome back to the cannabis sommelier I'm your host Andrew Friedman thanks for joining me for another episode of food infusions today we're gonna make one of my favorite ingredients again a super versatile ingredient in the kitchen what better than hot sauce something you can put on absolutely everything now when you make a hot sauce it's really easy peppers garlic some acid these are the things that pull it all together and when we think about hot sauce it can really be any combination so when you look at my recipe you can totally manipulate and mold it put any special ingredient in that you like but what I have today is a pack of peppers we have habaneros we have Serrano's we have jalapenos I have half of an onion I have a nice little bunch of cilantro because I love cilantro but if you're not a fan of cilantro you don't have to put it in if you'd like to put carrots in go crazy put some carrots in make sure you sautee them I'm a garlic fiend I got six cloves of garlic most recipes call for three but I'm not Italian but I like what they say double it and vinegar very important the vinegar is what we're gonna put in the pan so I'm gonna saute my peppers onions and garlic all together in a pan I'm gonna put a bit of infused olive oil on the pan we're gonna get the oils juicing out of everything and then we're gonna end up putting it in the blender with a little bit more infused olive oil put a nice pan on medium heat get that going you could put your olive oil in whenever we definitely don't want to smoke this oil but we want to use it to help release the other essential oils from the ingredients so we put the oil into the pan it really helps get all the essential oils popping out of the delicious onion garlic and peppers that we've chosen it's also infused so this is the start of our infusion all right so we've been steaming our peppers onions and garlic for about five minutes now three to five minutes everything's getting a little bit softer you can see it sweating releasing its essential oils and what we're gonna do is just add about two hundred mils of vinegar white vinegar and we're gonna leave it to simmer for about 15 minutes and really release everything that's going on in there the Scotch bonnets the jalapenos the Serrano's all that delicious stuff [Music] a little bit of secret sauce it's been about 15 minutes on the simmer with all of our delicious ingredients we add a little bit of salt pepper a little bit of our secret sauce everything's looking fantastic nice and mixed together and the next step is just to introduce it to the blender and turn it into our sauce whoo that's a spicy Oh cover we've got all our ingredients in the blender that we've just simmered now there's a few things that I like to add fresh and just to pump up the infusion a little bit more so first thing is just a little bit more infused olive oil if you haven't watched that video make sure to click the card now I'm just gonna put a few more milligrams in there perfect as I mentioned I like cilantro and I like it fresh let's put some fresh cilantro in nice large pinch is what I'm gonna add today and then I have a few limes left over from making margaritas so I think I'm just gonna add three or four fresh lime wedges in here so now the easiest and most exciting part of making our sauce making the sauce really it's as simple as creating our ingredients like that and putting them in a blender we'll see how thick it is and see if we need to add more vinegar after a little blend wonderful smells delicious in here so we've got our sauce I have my container and we will just put it in there and let it cool now I'm really excited I have a really cool follow-up video to this one and I'm going to teach you how to take this infused hot sauce and we're gonna turn it into an infused salt you'll be able to use that salt anywhere popcorn just at on steak it's gonna be really really cool okay so our hot sauce goes in funnel always makes this much easier and isn't that beautiful that's homemade hot sauce nice thick delicious goodness no preservatives no additives I guess we're preserving with salt and vinegar that's all we really need at the end of the day there we go that was 500 mils of hot sauce I never actually get the amount right in the bottle so I'm even more impressed with myself not to gloat seal it up throw it in the fridge and because the amount of vinegar and salt in here it'll last easily three to six months my dosage there's about 150 milligrams of THC in this hot sauce you'll be able to dose it out everybody can use it on tacos and whatever you'd enjoy it with thanks so much for watching this episode I hope I hope you enjoyed learning how to make infused hot sauce please make sure to LIKE

if you're like me you probably have a lot you want to decarboxylate the Keith I am so confused right now it's just THC a and you need the heat to activate it just like you would when you're rolling your weed in the joint and you light that first hit got a big enough joint there right you need the heat to get high and we want to get high want to pre-heat your oven to 300 degrees so in order to decarboxylate the key you're going to use an oven safe Bowl we're going to use some parchment paper it's contained in the parchment paper which makes it easier and I've already pre-measured my two grams of Keith and I'm just gonna put it right in here with this piece of paper and you want to spread it as evenly as you possibly can to put it in the middle right you want to set the timer for seven minutes you want to allow your Keef to completely cool before adding it to any of your recipes a good rule of thumb is D carb your Keith before gathering your ingredients that way it'll have enough time to cool by the time you need it mmm smells delicious for this recipe we're going to use two cans of Keith two and a quarter cups of all-purpose flour a teaspoon of salt a teaspoon of baking soda three quarter cups of granulated sugar 3/4 cups of PAP dark brown sugar one teaspoon of vanilla extract two sticks of unsalted butter softened and two eight now let's get to baking in order to make the cookies you want to pre-heat your oven to 375 degrees we're gonna add the softened butter the granulated sugar the dark brown sugar and the vanilla extract along with the key in the mixing bowl carbs wise it's gonna set me back don't even give a [ __ ] we're gonna add a teaspoon of kosher salt you spilled the salt and a teaspoon of baking soda and then you just want to gently mix it we're gonna take the butter and put it right in the mixing bowl now we're gonna add 3/4 cup of granulated sugar mm-hmm that must be the sugar oh gold that's gold the dark brown sugar you'll probably need a spatula for this one since it's tightly packed yes and a teaspoon of vanilla extract [Music] hold your parchment paper and add the kief to the mix the great thing about parchment paper is that the kief doesn't stick to it now we're gonna cream the butter the sugar the vanilla extract and the keith's in our stand mixer or you want to touch the mixing bowl to the stand make sure it locks in place and you're gonna use your whisk attachment to make the cookies you want to blend the ingredients well until it forms a nice creamy mixture turn it off halfway and make sure you scrape the sides of the bowl we don't want to lose any of that swipe swipe swipe swipe swipe swish [Music] now we're gonna add the eggs one by one if you recall from the brownie episode we do it one by one in case there was a bad egg then we don't ruin the whole mix she was a bad egg [Music] you also want to make sure you scrape all of this down when you add the eggs to make sure everything gets well combined add the mixture with the flour baking soda and salt after that comes the chocolate chucks hmm you know what I need a little chocolate pick-me-up make sure you lower the bowl when you add the flour you want to start the mixer off slow so that the flour doesn't go flying everywhere [Music] scrape the sides of the bowl so you make sure you get all the flour into the mixture now it's time to add the chocolate chunks [Applause] waiting for cookies now it's time to portion the cookies make sure you clean off the whisk we don't want to lose any of this yummy goodness you can eat that you can use a small scooper or a table spoon whatever you have at home you want to use an ungreased cookie sheet or baking sheet or like I use parchment paper you want to have enough space around the edges for the cookie to spread please I'm gonna need you to spread I'm gonna try to get a good amount of the chocolate chunks along with the cookie mixture that way you ensure that all the cookies have chocolate chunks in them and the last ones aren't just sugar cookies once you've portioned out all your cookies depending on how small or how large you make them you can figure out how much THC is in each serving plugging that back in he takes the derivative and he solves the equation crowd goes wild it's also secondary Tomich THC percentages in your Keef again if you smoke high grade weed your THC should be at higher levels and if you smoke that schwag who does that then you're probably closer to the 20% mark we have a thousand milligrams of THC in this recipe we've made 43 cookies with two grams of keith's giving us a total of 23 milligrams of THC per cookie I have five numbers sitting all around me here we'll put these in that 375 degree oven for nine to eleven minutes until they're golden brown once they're golden brown will allow them to cool for two minutes on the stove and then move them over to a baking cooling rack cookies it's not that sniffing it's not for you let them cool on the stovetop for two minutes and then move them to a wire rack to completely cool now that the cookies have cooled on the stovetop for two minutes we'll move them on the cooling rack for them to completely cool once the cookies have completely cooled you can store them in an airtight container leave them on your countertop or put them in the freezer the last longer thank you for watching episode 3 of new medical edibles here you have it our chocolate chunk cookies made with Keith at 23 milligrams per dosage cookie thank you to our sponsors spackle and the marijuana crime drama a sea

rolling up all your corn and all your bosom inside [Music] this is not for you no chocolate for your dog you", "JFZvWx9r5zk": "hi today on green magic louse we're gonna be showing you how easy it is to take your cannabis butter and a simple pack of box brownies and make yourself some delicious pot brownies and so right off the bat we're just gonna open this up now as you can see it actually asked for vegetable oil you can substitute pot butter for vegetable oil all you have to do is melt it first and so we've already preheated the oven to the 350 degrees like it asks for and so at this point we're just gonna open it up don't the mix in here you're gonna need some water it calls for a quarter cup of water and 1/2 cup of cannabis butter in which you've been a warm melt down the cannabis butter so it is like oil beforehand I love it that you're gonna need three eggs to three eggs if you want it to be kinky so we're going for the fudgy type brownies and so there's my quarter cup of water we're gonna do the 1/2 cup and I'm gonna mix this up because there's a lot of keep in there and stuff if you go over a little it's okay but try to be kind of accurate so they're not too oily don't pin your cannabis butter I like to really get it in there we're gonna waste any of that crack your little eggs Bam's now we're going to just simply mix this up make sure to get it all thoroughly mixed now as part of the preparation while I'm mixing this I'm gonna show you the reused parchment paper and we've actually layered it because a lot of people find when you make brownies the trick is a lot of times the brownies when you're done cooking they're actually hard to get out of the pan they get tore up because for some reason pot brownies are excellent and becoming very sticky and so as you can tell we're mix this thoroughly don't have any of those clumps in there so make sure you really really mix it good because nobody likes roasted nuts to be honest and so and if you don't know how cannabis butter or if you want to know how we do actually have a video then we'll show you how to make your own butter and so if you do need to go ahead and watch that get your pot butter ready before you like you know get this far so now that's done like that I am simply going to layer this down into the bottom making sure to crush up any more of that dry stuff and we're gonna squash this down in here make sure you get it all out because you don't want to be wasting any of this deliciousness and that's potentially cutting your shelves short be tragedy on the box we're only cooking it let's see for about 25 to 27 minutes then we'll probably go 26 minutes meet it in the middle and we'll pull these out after they're done so after you're done cooking it you're gonna fool your pan of brownies out it's gonna look gorgeous just like that and you're gonna let it cool just a little bit so it can harden up firm up a little bit and then you're gonna just be able to grab it by the paper pull it out and drop it onto your cooling rack and so if you've never made pot brownies before it is actually that easy and so hope this helps you out make sure to subscribe and like peace and very best wishes", "WPakqUMCCIA": "So today I'm making gummy candy. I'm starting with a half cup of cold water,\nand to that I'm going to add three packets of plain gelatin. I'm just going to open these up, you can find\nthese in the store, they're available in the little box. I'm using Knocks but any kind will do, and\nI just want to add this gradually so it won't clump up. So just with a nice spatula or spoon make\nsure that your constantly stirring. Stir, stir, stir. You can see it's turning into a gelatin kind\nof a mess here. Which is perfect, just what we're looking\nfor. So I'm just going to stir that around and\nlast but not least I'm going to add one whole packet of Jello, because I'm really just going\nfor it. And I'm using the blue one, but any flavor\nyou like will do. Just pour it in there and again stir it around\nso nothing will clump up. So that is it, I'm going to take my candy\nand I'm going to move it to I have a pot of water simmering on this stove. And then I'm just going to heat it up inside\nthis pot of water. So I'm using a glass measurement cup and I'm\njust letting the heat from the water, kind of heat up my mixture. So this way none of my gelatin is going to\nend up burning, it's all very safe, very kind of a gentle process. You could also just pop it right into the\nmicrowave if you prefer and that's fine too. I'm just going to let that kind of simmer,\nand get nice and thick. So my mixture has melted so I'm ready to go,\nand here I have a nice cute little I have like a jewel mold. You can get any kind of plastic mold that\nyou like or any other kind of candy mold that. The little bears are really fun and adorable. But just while my gelatin is still nice and\nsmooth and liquid, I'm just going to go ahead and pour it right into my mold. You can even go ahead and fill it the way\nup to the top or as big as you like them. That is it. I'm going to let those sit up on the counter\nfor about 10 to 15 minutes or until they're nice and firm to the touch, to keeping them\nto the heat of your house you might need a little longer or a little less. But as soon as they're firm I'm going to take\nthem out of the mold and we're ready to go. So my blue gummy candy are still setting up\nbut I have some that are already done, so these are just the same just with a lemon\nflavor and a cherry flavor. The same recipe and you could see them getting\nnice and firm and chewy. Now if you want to get that kind of classic\nsour candy coating, you take a little bit of sugar mixed with a touch of citric acid. And what that's going to do is give our candies\na nice sour coating. And that's it or you can leave them plain\nor you can just drench them in sugar. Anything that you like, but anyway, enjoy. That's how you make gummy candies at home.", "axJVTaoyvWc": "[Music] [Music] in its edible Wednesday so 10% off all of our edibles and yes yes if you're asking we do have smokey so come on come on

it's a go but I made it home it was really good as you can see I'm still feeling those gummies oh yeah and like I wanted to share that I do get the last bit of our pineapple chunk it was 25 percent THC and I am super excited to try it here I'll show it to you like I mean it's really pretty like there's more food maybe the baby's my camera focusing on it maybe but look at it I'm not really under a direct a lot I'm just sitting that's pineapple chump don't look at my nails I know it's not enough okay okay I just wanna let you guys know that I bought like I'm I bought a pineapple chunk right like I was you know talking about and I you know I found two good seeds and they're now they're in the floor but there's one dang I always do that well hold on is that gonna go find the other seed does never believe this but I dropped it again but remember I'm under the gummy influence um it again so I've lost the seat again so I'm on the floor looking for it so I was gonna say that it was completely worth it as I found two good seeds but I'm gonna get to need to look it for it for my cat finds a seed it eats it if she's like looking over at she's like what are you doing what do you send my flashlight out him on the floor I'm panicking looking for the seed I got two seeds in the floor they were really good and I tried to show you guys they just fell out so but anyway I'll show you why I like thought it was completely worth it other than the seeds that I just lost in the floor pretty sure my cat's gonna find them first you see all this this was from pineapple that's the pineapple and this shirt here is the the this is the stem that it was on and I broke it up with my hands I didn't even use the grinder like I just broke it up because like I said this was in the bud bowl I bought it and it wasn't even dry it's really soft can you see that let's just take a minute right off this bud like it's indica 25 percent THC it was the last of it at my store so about just smoked it and I just couldn't believe how much it fell off that little stem there right there and I paid it was a was point 83 and I mean it's still fluffy I'm actually concerned if it's good if it's you know still I can't believe it I'm good right there by the way not that so just went and bought it right after I got off work so I I'm just really sorry I'm just going to shop to buy this everybody was doing and on and stuff so my hands on some pineapple chunk well I figured that all the way there I'm gonna sit right here in the floor I'm gonna go ahead and roll I already had I just want to show you this is crazy I'm really excited about this uh this is what's left Lucy you can see it there you just in total utter shock but that's what I got in there I got my little tip use a roll paper I'm not promoting I'm just saying like I like them even that looks like a paper sack [Music] makes me feel like it's all wrong you know how sugar is like brown this raw it's not got bleached and stuff that's kind of how I feel about this okay how big that sucker is anyways I'm about to roll another one up that's why I was like wait I kind of got your camera on because it's just gonna roll a lot um I'm really tired I've had a long day and of course I ate those gummies and and I drove around town in the heart trying to actually pull my car down I don't know why you could just head home it would cool your car down though logic was there I promise I don't know why though I didn't even run this through my grinder I I got a lot of keys right now I mean I'm still collecting I'm just it was actually just so easy to break up I was so surprised I like it I'm really upset that I didn't do it on camera but just trust me you know and I'm not trying to sell you anything because there's nothing to buy we're out you know and mercy and a ver growers so I think I just dropped a little piece on the floor so along with my two freakin cats over here but she's got her mouth she's trying to get me to play with her I'm on a meeting area I'm just really shocked this guy's I mean of this where's my bottle now what I've been shocked brought my radio home back I got call me buddy it was in my mind y'all I think I think my cat took off with my bottle and oh yeah I need to look for my seeds so stay tuned I can't believe that I like was one actually let's just go ahead and light one real fast I'm ready oh look at this got a paper out here see I guess that gummy has really affected me and that cat I know is messing with me because she takes off with stuff when I said things down she's trying to get my attention right now anyway for being out on the bud floor for like oh let's see I would say a good week I would say we maybe maybe maybe less than a week maybe a week [Music] I'm totally not trying to sell you on anything like this is like legit and and for all you out there they're like why are you using a roller I'm kind of spool to one that I can roll I just can't roll with the tip and make it look as good like really pretty like that like with it I don't know why I just can't I'm just a [ __ ] on my coffee table oh my gosh you don't want to see my laptop of course you do I want to

cooking if you want to do a really nice fettuccine okay was it like a Bisset yeah it's like a basil Wow it has a nice smell to it [ __ ] me that's definitely not basil is this cannabis yes so we smoke pot that's why I could smell the minute I came in here yeah would you want me to tell is this Li you here yes I use medicinal herb before you put your hands back in that cookie jar what if I save my room it's and get a bit late oh I've done for a while okay you know how do I get to the room I'll show you this is a first the owner of this Lodge is as high as a kite Wow look at this place he

based on fresh air he clearly doesn't care about paying guests kids don't do drugs and end up like that", "ppKvv2668OI": "[Music] when I was doing a bite here and today we're going to make some high-quality MCT oil using some canvas so there is a couple of steps to this and we do need a couple of different things so everything that we are going to be I have right here in front of us so we're going to need a crock pot for using this method of the making our empty tio which is a batch to the have right here this is some very potent stuff I found this out last night you're supposed to start low and go slow I definitely suggest doing that so when you're going to need for this is some MCT oil that you could pick up if you're in Canada at GNC health has some pretty cheap or if you go to probably any local health food store they're probably gonna have this stuff you're going to need some cannabis depending on how much you want the rear there are calculators out there and I will put a link for a calculator to kind of give you a rough estimate of how potent your your things are going to be like let's if you want to make gummies or stuff like that so I'm gonna put the calculator below and it'll basically just help you decide what you're going to do now when I made this little here I used 38 grams of cannabis as well as I don't know probably like three four grams of Keef and just the mixture of other candidates that I had around so it was pretty potent stuff so if you're going to use okay so to start we need to talk about D carving your cannabis or decarboxylation it's basically turning your THC a into THC which is what you are really looking to do if you're going to ingest cannabis now if you don't decarboxylate it really won't do much for you so what we're going to do so I guess what I should say is you have a couple of different methods of being able to decrypt leave so you can use the crockpot method because on high they usually heat up to around 220 degrees you put it in a calendar and you just put it there thank you news [Music] okay so there are a couple of different ways that you can be box decarboxylate your cannabis so you could either put it into a canning jar you can put it onto a cookie sheet or something like that or something like this here silicone cookie sheet and you can put this in your oven for about an hour at 225 degrees and that will decarboxylate your canvas this is the method that I chose to do this because when you do it inside of a canning jar with the lid closed you were actually keeping in the terpenes now if you were to just decarboxylate on a cookie sheet throw down a silicone on top of that that put your cannabis right on it you are actually going to lose your turkeys you're going to strip them out of your oil and that's something that I did not want to do so the canning jar method for this instance is a pretty good way of doing that because if you're doing your infusion in the same jar that you decarboxylated it you're going to keep all of your terpenes inside your jar which is great so let's start the process so in the oven 220 degrees for an hour what you're going to do is want to take this out every 15 minutes set an alarm and you're gonna want to turn your jar just kind of shake it up make sure that it's kind of everywhere mixed up and every half hour you're gonna want to burp the jar so you're only gonna burp it once burp it in the first half hour period then you take your cannabis out of the oven you are pretty much good to go so I have some footage that I use the making this oil here and this here is a pretty potent oil I had some last night and I can honestly tell you that you should probably really start slow and go from there don't don't overdo it I made some gummies and just like licking the spoons and the bowls I think I got my fill so yeah make some pretty potent oil and that's we're planning on doing here today it's you know so let's get started and we'll go from here [Music] so the reason why I'm wishing it up like this is because I have 473 milliliters of MCT oil and I know that that won't be a full jar up to here so we're just gonna squish it down [Music] all right that one's mixed up you see this mixed up pretty good here let's get this in the MCT oil and we're gonna get into the slow cooker [Music] [Applause] [Music] so the reason one of the reasons why we did it into the canning jar meant that was so that we were able to keep the terpene profile over animus now if you were to just decarboxylate on a tray we wouldn't got the same abilities out of it so we would have lost all of our terpenes [Music] this here looks like it's just to say covering at all and we got maybe like a couple teaspoons left in the bottle [Music] so perfect [Music] [Music] all righty guys so we dropped her in there and now you just gotta let her do or think what we're gonna do is just I guess probably keep filling this crock pot back up with water as imagine it's gonna get pretty hot and we're gonna lose some of its kind of the steam out so we'll just have to keep an eye on so we'll come back and check them in this problem you tomorrow all right guys so it's been about 12 hours now we put it in a little midnight last night it's just a little bit past noon here and 66 degrees Celsius one hundred and forty nine point seven it's temperature that it's been going at on high and if we take a look at her oil when first put it in it was clear oil now we can see it's a nice dark green delicious looking oil let's see if we can maybe get under light here a little bit sassy we'll get you a better shot your moment with flashlights alright alright guys so I've got my measuring cup I've got the strainer that sits in it I've got my cheesecloth what I'm gonna do is take this out of here this is actually pretty freakin hot play with and we're just gonna let it cool off for a little bit and while that's cooling off let me get some cheese bot open [Music] get a couple little laters wrapped around here don't really wanna be able to see through it but I would like to filter out most of those kind of fine once particles so I've got me one of these Curie filters and that's really gonna get all the very fine fine fine stuff out of it so that's what I'm gonna use for the very fine stuff so for now we're just going to pour it here into the cheesecloth get out most of the large particulates and then we're going to do the finds with this year we should have some awesome future oil and then with this taintdroid we can do lots of things with make some gummies well I don't really know lots of things but other than just that using this nature but I really want to make some gummies and that's what I was thinking about doing so if you guys are interested in that let us know and we will make a video for you on how to make gummies you can probably start to see this I'm not sure if you can see some camera not butter there's a nice green oil nice green danger I think what I've done here is underestimated the amount yes I have underestimated the amount the cheesecloth I would need to strain this out [Music] [Music] oh yeah there's quite a bit in this cannabis though [Music] you've got a clip holding this and now we're going to just do we're fine strain into our jar that we're going to store it in a little bit better review here my messy cupboard cannabis all over it alright [Music] all right so I've got a lid wash to clean ready here what I'm going to do is I'm going to stick a notice I got some MCT oil it was made November 5th 2019 and we're just gonna stick that on here now I'm gonna grab a flashlight so we can kind of see this here so we can see here it is a greenish oil we put it in it was Coulier clear clear and now it's a nice green so what you're gonna want to do the store this oil is it want to put it in a nice cool dark place some people recommend putting it in the fridge and that's one of the benefits of the MTT oil if you put it into the fridge it will not solidify like it does if you were to use coconut oil and I believe that also preserves a little bit longer as well so there's definitely some benefits of using the MTT oil so here you have it guys I hope this video was easy enough for everyone this stuff here tastes really good this tastes a lot better than the textures that I was buying from the licensed producers and with 38 grams plus a couple of grams of Keef this [ __ ] it should be pretty good well so we're gonna try some out and yeah we'll go from there [Music]",

Fuck! - Don't drop the fire in your hand. - I've probably smoked like\nfive times total in my life. And four of those times were with Keith. - I-I-I've smoked some weed before. It's legal. I'm an adult. - I like smoking weed. I think it's nice. It's relaxing. There are different types of getting high. - I don't actually partake\nin marijuana very often. (coughing) It's just not something I do. Maybe because I'm drinking so much. - And, why is it okay to get on camera and say, yeah, I can\ndrink a 12 pack of beer, but if you get on camera and say that you'll smoke a joint, suddenly, you're a villain. It's been proven that it's safer. - So, we're just learning now, more about driving while high on marijuana because there hasn't been a\nlot of really good research. - Okay, I'm gonna put it in park. Let's assess the situation. - So, In the state of California, it's legal to use recreational marijuana. However, it's not legal to\ndrive after consuming cannabis, because the obvious dangers of possibly being involved\nin a traffic collision. - Oh!\n- Wow. - Oh my god, is it okay?\n- No. - Did I kill it? - I just don't do it. I don't like doing it. I shouldn't do it, clearly. But, today, we're gonna do it, man. (mid tempo music) - [Zach Modulated Voiceover]\nYou guys watch Riverdale? - [Eugene Modulated Voiceover] You know, I saw the first episode in an airplane, and I landed right as the two\ncharacters were in the closet. I'm like, what the hell, man. - You gotta get it inside of yourself. - [Try Guys Repeat] You gotta\nget it inside of yourself. - You gotta take a deep\nlook inside of yourself. - How do we know when we're high? - I'm already a little high. - Really?\n- Yeah. - Do you guys have ants at your house? - Pretty, pretty princess. - [Try Guys Repeat]\nPretty, pretty princess. - Keith, you ever thought about how this is just your car that we're gonna-- (giggles) - Yeah, have I ever thought about it? Yeah, I've thought about it. - It's clearly a cat\non top of a second cat. Look there's the two tails. - Oh, okay. - [Zach] Are they facing out?\n- [Eugene] No. - [Zach] Are they tummy-to-tummy? - Alright. Well, we're high now. (giggles) - Snack time? - We have these cannabinoid\nreceptors in our brain. Throughout our brain. Throughout our central nervous system, where marijuana activates, but we still don't really understand exactly how that happens\nand how it impairs judgment. - Where does all this\norange stuff come from? - I have the worst cotton-mouth\nI think I've ever had. - The old saying, if you\nhave cotton in your mouth, (laughing) Jesus is trying to give you kisses. - What? (laughing) - What? What are you talking about? - [Eugene] It's a saying from the south. - I would let Jesus kiss me. - Doritos. Doritos. Doritos. Doritos. - [All Try Guys] Doritos. (laughing) - I think the Try Guys are\ngoing to be interesting. We're gonna be able to see\nthe differences between driving on marijuana\nversus driving on alcohol. In general, I think it's\nunsafe to do either. I really wish them good luck. - Police car. (siren wails) - If you get pulled over, stoned, how do they prove it? - There's no weed breathalyzer. There's no way to know. - We do have drug recognition experts. There are many indicators that we look at to determine what types of drugs they may be under the influence of. - [Officer Jenny] Good morning, sir. - Police. - Good afternoon, sir. - Good afternoon, Officer Jenny. (laughing) - Don't make up things. Don't start with lies. - How are you doing today? - Feeling good. How are you? - How good you feelin'? - How are you? - When you stop them, we look to see how their\nreacting to our questions. - Do you have any substances\nin your system today? - How should I answer that? - She seems nice. - You answer. - I haven't thought about that. Yes, ma'am. - No, no ma'am. - No. None? - No. Yes. (giggling)\n- Yeah. Alright, well, let's see\nhow you're doing then. - You were up there with us. You saw us smoking a lot of weed, Rachel. - Sure did. - We look at their face. We look at their eyes. We look in the manner of\nwhich they're speaking. As such as marijuana, they\nmay be somewhat reserved. Their eyes may be red. Slow to react. A person is gonna walk the line, heel-to-toe, heel-to-toe, while maintaining their\nhands close to their body. - And a four, five. - I feel like I'm in the Greatest Showman. - [Ned] Five, six. - [Eugene] Seven.\n- [Ned] Wow. - Eight, nine. Bossy. Yeah. - Sassy. Alright. - Also, there is a finger-to-nose. Everybody knows where their nose is. They shouldn't have a\nproblem touching their nose. - [Female Officer] Right.\n- Boom. - [Female Officer] Left. Left. Right. (laughing) - But at the end, the common factor is that we're gonna make\na decision if the person is gonna be deemed to be under the influence of drugs or not. - Alright, thank you very much. Thank you so much. I'm getting in the car. - Yay. We have set up 538 cones in\na complicated, closed course that is a traffic simulation, designed to challenge the driver. No, oh no. - I'm trying to phrase it as like, me and my buddies, we wanted\nto get some Taco Bell. This is just how we get to Taco Bell. There's potholes, there's intersections, there's school zones. Oh no, dead end. How are we gonna get out of it? It's perfect. Then, we have to parallel\npark when we get back home. It's just a trip to Taco Bell. - Driving while stoned. Yes, I have done that. - I've been a little high\nand I've driven a few blocks. It's fine, I feel like it's fine. - We do know that\ndriving on any substance, including marijuana, is\ndangerous, and is not recommended. - Yeah, we're good. Okay, here we go, alright guys. - I just smoked a lot of\nweed and now I'm gonna drive. This is not safe. Oh, you guys got snacks. - Yeah. (chips crunching) - I can do this. I feel like I can do this. - Click it, click it, click it, click it. - [Try Guys] We're clicked. - Let's go. - Alright. Oh, I went two, one too many. - You got this, Zach. - How do you feel, Keith? - I feel a little stoned. Whoa, what's going on with this road? Why is it all stupid? - Wow, oh wow. Oh wow. - You're doing great. You're doing great. - What fucking Doctor Seuss shit is this? - [Eugene] Oh no. - [Keith] You're crushing it, bro. - Some people actually,\nwho are high on marijuana, go to the opposite extreme. - [Ned] Easy. Too fast. Too fast. Oh, my god. - [Keith] You gotta keep driving, Ned. You can't stop in the road. - So bad. - When they smoke and\nthey get behind the wheel, they want to be extra careful. They'll go extra slowly, or they'll give themselves room behind the car in front of them. - That is common, to\nsee people drive slow, because they're trying\nto be over cautious. They know they've been\nconsuming marijuana. - It also, can impair coordination. (sounds of dismay) - No. No. No. No. No. The few times I've smoked weed, I've turned into a crazy person. - [Eugene] What are we driving over? - I think. I think it was a cone. (car honks)\n(squealing) - So, I have less\nexperience with smoking pot. Lord only knows what's gonna happen today. This is my Keith impression. So, Keith touches every car. (singing) The American gymnasts are always so sweet. Like, figure skaters do. They always paint Russian figure skaters as if they're really cold,\nbut I think eight years ago. - What are you talking about? - I'm telling you who I am. I said, who are you? And, I was like, Aliya Mustafina, the crown jewel of Russian gymnastics. One time when I got\nhigh, I stripped naked, I stole my friends dog, I climbed up a tree, and proclaimed myself the wolf king. That was one time. - California weed, it fucks ya up. - Pass a little nana to your friends. - Man, you gotta go. - [Zach] It's bite, bite, pass. What am I like when I'm high? - [Try Guys] Oh!\n- What? - We got something. Didn't you hear that thump? We thumped something. - What are you taking about? I'm giggly. (giggling) I certainly get paranoid when I'm high. - [Keith] What's happening with you? - [Zach] I think I was\nabout to hit something. - For some people, marijuana\ncan definitely affect their perception of time. (laughing) (chattering) Sometimes for some\npeople, high on marijuana, time can slow down. Again, if you're driving and you're not really sure the time, that can affect your coordination. Your ability to judge how far something is from something else and,\nagain, can be quite dangerous. - Jesus! - [Keith] Oh my god. Whoa, who's that? - It's Miles Bonsignore. (laughing) - Go, Ned, you gotta go! - Okay, okay. (singing) I feel like we were going too fast. - Oh, what the fart? - Three way hazard. (muffled chattering) - Oh my goodness, time to back that up. (laughing) - [Ned] Back it up. - Can you read? Can you actually read, Zach? - Yeah, I can read. - Prove to the audience\nthat you know how to read. - What's it say?\n- What's it say? Closed. Don't come this way. - That's not what is says. What does it actually say? Stop being funny. (laughing) - You told him! You told him, Keith.\n(laughing) - Well, if someone is high on marijuana, they may not be able to\ncalculate depth perception. - I don't have a backup camera. - Can you see out the back window? - It was high anxiety while driving. I was very concerned about everything. A little over concerned\nprobably, at times. - [Ned] Oh, please be careful, Keith. - Also, tough visibility with\nthree big heads in the back. - [Try Guys] Oh. (laughing) - Have I not been talking\nabout how people look sexy when they're backing up? Look at this.\n- [Keith] You look pretty hot. How do I look.\n- [Ned] Pretty hot. - [Keith] Oh, you look good. You're doing such a good job. (mumbling) - Marijuana, depending on\nthe patients experience with marijuana can also impair judgment. (car horn honking) - [Try Guys] Whoa! Whoa!\nOh. - Okay, hold on. We're gonna go back to where we started. - [Try Guys] Zach. Zach.\nOh my god. (laughing) - [Keith] You can't do that. - You looked at me and told me, oh shit, I'm getting too close. - Once I started to realize I was starting to knock over cones, I got so freaked out that, what if I was actually on a road? I would be so screwed. - You got this man. - Guys, I'm freaking out. - [Zach] Yeah, that's clear. - I made so many mistakes. This is horrible. - Some indicators that\ntell us that the person is not driving safely: Speeding or such as, running red lights. - I feel great. I feel great. I feel fantastic. I'm trying to take you somewhere fun. - What?\n- So don't critique. (laughing) - What does that mean? (laughing and whooping) - [Eugene] I'm taking you to the river. - This is that part of\nSan Francisco, right? - [Eugene] Lombard Street. - Lombard James. - We do know that it\ndecreases our inhibitions. We're more likely, again,\nto make some decisions we may not make, when we're sober. - I'm gonna try it. - Speeding or weaving\ntell us that the person is not driving safely\nor under the influence of some type of substance. (screaming) (car horn honks)\n- We got this. We got this. (car horn honking) - [Ned] Maybe you can get it. - [Keith] No, I don't think so. Maybe you can get it. - I could have done it. - No, you couldn't have.\n- {Eugene] No. - Driving high is extremely dangerous because they contribute\nto traffic collisions where people are injured\nor lose their lives. - Now, I've been through\nthis part of town before. (laughing) It always sucks. There's just so many people parked on it. - Especially in figure skating. I feel like it's always the young American girl getting gold. I feel like other countries\nhave worked really hard too. (laughing)\nWhy is no one-- - You're gonna be impossible to edit. You're so high.\n- [Try Guys] Oh no. - Zach, you just hit the parking garage. - You told me to read. (screaming) (collision clamor) - [Eugene] Hit the giant briefcase. Not my briefcase! (intense music) Yeah, Keith. - [Keith] Wow. - It also can slow reflexes down. (dramatic music) - [Keith] Whoa! Oh!\n- [Zach] Oh! (dog barking) I almost hit that skateboard and dog. (laughing) - [Zach] Oh, boy. - Watch out it's that stupid fucking dog. (screaming) (laughing) - I think that there's\nother deserving athletes. (screaming) - [Keith] Is it okay? - Did I... Did I kill it?\n- [Keith] Oh, no. (yelling) - Are you serious? Why is the crew-- - No. - No!\n- No. - No.\n- No! - Oh no, he's okay. - [Ned] Oh god, no!\n- He's okay. He's okay. - What is he doing on that skateboard? - He had so much more to give. - Did I kill it? Could someone tell me\nhow hard I hit the dog? Take my dog. - Why was he skateboarding\nso late at night? He should know better. - [Eugene] I don't care anymore. I hit a dog. - [Keith] Eugene, no. - I hit a dog. - [Keith] Just pull forward. - No, I hit a dog. I hit a dog. (car honks) I'm sad. - [Keith] Oh no. - Was it a tap, or did I break it's neck? - For most of that, I\nthought I did it right. - [Keith] You are crushing this. - [Eugene] Oh, perfect. - I guess the thing that I forgot, is you just make stupid mistakes. - [Keith] Don't go too far back. - [Eugene] Don't go.\nStop, stop, you're good. You're good\nYeah. - I can't see! I'm driving blind. (car honks) That's good enough. Let's get inside, guys.\n(clapping) (dramatic music) - Oh man. Wow, I got pretty high. - Try Guys have never been the High Guys, but that was a first. - I though that I would be perfect. I knocked over a wall. (laughing) If that were my garage wall, I'd be looking at thousands\nof dollars of damage. - My mental state was highly anxious. Then, when I had to do the reverse, I was just so confused. I screwed it all up.\nI screwed it all up. You temporarily forget\nwhich way your wheel is supposed to go when\nyou're driving in reverse. I think everybody kind of\nexperiences that at some time, when they're first driving. Like, wait do I-- It was like I was\nexperiencing that over again. - Certainly didn't have\nconfidence to drive while high. I thought it was a bad idea. I knew it was a bad idea. I knew I didn't want to be outside. - We do think that marijuana can be a little bit safer than alcohol. There have been fewer crashes reported with someone high on marijuana, than with alcohol. - I personally think that\ndrunk driving is worse than stoned driving. It doesn't mean that\nstoned driving is good. - The four of us were very\ndifferent types of high. I was really fixated on things. I think I was talking about Russia a lot. - I don't want the message to be, Keith was high and was able to do it, because Ned was high, and he wasn't. You don't know how it will affect you. It's best to just err\non the side of caution. - Your perception of how you drive, under these influences is not the reality. It just isn't. - We're still at the infancy\nof understanding how much marijuana has to be in\nyou blood to be determined to be impaired while driving. It gets very confusing, because if someone is a\nchronic marijuana user, those levels may be very high, but they may not actually be impaired. They may be as sober as the next person. We still need to find better tools to determine if someone is impaired while using marijuana while driving. - After this experience,\nI would never drive high. All of my reaction times were way slower, and my obsessive mind was focusing on everything besides the road. - We got two more videos. Come back next week and\nwe are going to drive while wildly sleep deprived. Then, we're going to drive while texting. (upbeat music) (laughing) - Sorry, we made our banana peels kiss. (laughing)", "kC0PG3GqVMo": "thank you too so today I'm going to show you guys how I do my any type of gummies any type of any type of salt cane the way I do this is no fail and it's really easy all you got to do is boil some water mix it really hard and you're good the main idea of my gummies and probably everybody else's but I use a little bit more just to be a little safer is a lot of gelatin so usually for a recipe for gummy bears and anything anything like that it usually calls for one box for tax which is fun you know that really will work if you made some gummies with one box of jell-o and four packs of it will work it's it's I'm not saying it's not gonna work but but now during a hot day or even just a little bit of moisture in the air your gummies are going to stick together and they're going to melt and you're gonna be pretty pissed off so take my advice and follow my recipe and I'm sure that your gummies are gonna hold up in your pocket you're gonna be able to go to work and go on with your day without any worry that something's gonna happen to basically the money you spent making these guns so let's get started so this is really simple like I said all you're gonna do is boil some water and that's it so we're gonna add 1 cup of water now that we had our water will crank go on so this isn't gonna take too long to get hot it's one cup of water so it's literally about two minutes it will probably be there so we got to think fast to move this so what we're gonna do is usually now you can do two full boxes of gelatin and that's only gonna make your gummies last longer they're gonna be a little harder a little more firm but they will last and that's the main idea but I usually like to do seven packs just because it's a perfect amount of like thickness in there so so now we're about to start boiling so I'm gonna add my gelatin sooo some cold water so it does AHS a little bit so when we actually do mix it doesn't get love you not sure if you guys know it's the Spanish shirt I'm wearing I believe design and he's out of Philadelphia PA and you guys like these shirt so I'm gonna be wearing check out his website I'll have a link down at the top lots of hats lots of shirts who's got lots of stuff ok so now that our gelatin is dissolved I'm gonna add our gelatin to the water after I have my gelatin I'm gonna have my gelatin pack then I'll add our additive and we're done so what's that era now it's at our gelatin give this a good a good old stir because you want to break up anything that's happened to not dissolve John says it's fish so this mix that we're making now I have three volts here this one box recipe should almost perfectly cover all three moles so now that our gelatin is combined and there's no more lumps now get out our gelatin so I'll do let's still line add your whole pack you really don't gotta rush this that's the best part about gummies and jello you don't it's not hard candy it's not like the minutes it's done you got the rush and it's gonna solidify on you if it does solidify you can just reheat it it's good again all right so now our jello has a gelatin and it's ready but does it have any good stuff so so it's outer additive and then we'll take the next step all right so now do you added your additive to this thing's ready to go you're ready to have a really fun day so the hard parts done we have it ready now the biggest problem is filling your molds I see people using turkey basters don't use surrogate of turkey basters think about when you suck it in just the two go over here you're gonna lose by the time you're done here you probably lost about seven to eight gummy bears worth of drop so don't use the turkey baster it's a mess and you're gonna lose stuff what I like to use is a squeeze bottle a squeeze bottle you can pour it in perfectly and boom boom boom boom no mess and no loss so let's do this so if you have a big squeeze bottle you can burp the bottle like that so when you tilt it it doesn't shoot out at somebody sitting across the room and you kind of control it a little bit better so you just go over each one how easy was that using a squeeze bottle way better than using a turkey bass boom all I got to do is wait for these is wait for these things are cool and I can be poppin these things all night long feelin really good so we'll check back in a couple of minutes when they're ready we'll see what they look like so we are all solidified see what we got the fact we used a lot of gelatin these things are gonna come out nice and hold your shape and it's gonna be nice so yeah boom just like you went to the store got some gummy bears this time they're gonna get you baked it'll look way cooler they won't melt in your pocket none of it okay go on your daily business don't worry about these but I just got these little molds I got from Michaels and they see more there's so many cool molds that you can do I really want to try the Lego molds you can build Legos with those things just so so cool but that was easy boil some water add your jello add your gelatin add your additive mix it up mold done I hope you guys can tell but I'm freaking freezing it's cold so what I like most about these is you know hard candies they're great when they take too long and you know sometimes you just want to eat some candy really fast and these are really good for it so you could be boom-boom-boom and be on your way instead of sitting there having to suck on some hard candy for a while these are these are great and you guys like what you solo today don't forget to check

gushers now if you measure out your tincture in advance you can know approximately how much is in each so if you do a tablespoon of tincture you can divide it by however many gushers you end up filling and that's how you can figure out how many milligrams is in each gusher i have not yet tried this with coconut oil but i believe it would work as long as you melted enough so the syringe would

cookies cupcakes and cardio comm today I'm going to be showing you how to make homemade rock candy we recently made a cake Penguins of Madagascar that used lots of rock candy and I was reading through the comments and people were asking of ways that they could make it themselves at home so I put together this video for you so let's get started so we don't need many ingredients to make the raw candy we need just 1 cup of water 3 cups of white granulated sugar now these parts are optional I've just got some colouring you can also use food coloring for this I have gel paste out in front and I also have some different flavorings and you can use them or omit them it just depends if you want your rock candy to be flavored and then we're going to be growing the rock candy on these little wooden sticks you could also use popsicle sticks or you could also use cake pop sticks so the first thing we're going to do is bring our cup of water to a boil which is 100 degrees Celsius or 212 Fahrenheit so once the water is boiling just turn it down slightly and then by the 1/2 cup we're going to add the sugar so I'm just going to add 1/2 cup here and probably start off with a cup here and then I'm just going to stir it and I'm going to keep stirring and letting the sugar in here dissolve while I'm stirring it we're gonna get the 3 cups of water in or sorry the 3 cups of sugar into the water which is going to saturate it and that's going to be how the rock candy forms so I'm just gonna keep stirring and adding the sugar and it looks like it's dissolved from that first addition so I'm just going to add some more and then keep going so I have all of my sugar in it's nice and thick and the sugar is dissolved into the water mixture so now I'm going to just give it a final couple stirs and I'm going to set it to the side for about 15 minutes to let it cool and in the meantime I'm going to set up the where the rock candy is going to grow so what we need to do next is give a surface for the rock candy to grow on so I'm taking my wooden sticks and I'm just dipping them into the water here just dipping the stick and making it wet and then I'm going to roll it in this white extra sugar so you don't need too much you can tap it off and this is just going to give the rock candy something to stick to and so like I said it's gonna help it grow so just stick it in the water and then dip it into the sugar so we're gonna let those dry and wait for our mixture to slightly cool so what I've got set up are small narrow glasses and if you you can use anything that's kind of like long and cylinder like this in order to help grow the rock candy and what you're going to do is if you want one to be color just gonna put a drop in to the bottom you don't need very much because it is quite a small amount so I've got some blue and some pink coming in here and if you want coloring or sorry if you want flavoring if you want to have one flavour for all of your rock candy you could put it in while before you take it off the heat but I want to show you how to make different flavors so I'm just going to put a little drop as small as I can get here into that blue one there and then change the flavor and put another drop in the second one so this third one that's on my right here I'm just going to leave it plain because the clear rock candy also looks kind of cool so I've transferred my sugar mixture to a container that I can pour from and the mixture is still hot you just want to make sure you've given it a little time to cool down slightly so we're going to do is just pour into my containers here and then I'll give them a stir so I'm filling it you want to leave a little bit of room for this for the stick to go in there and just give it a little stir so it mixes up all of the color and the flavor I'm just going to repeat that with all three and then I'll show you what to do with the sticks so what I have are large clothes pegs you could also use the regular sized ones these ones are just like because they have a little hole in the middle which just happens to fit perfectly with the stick so what you want to do now is you want to put the stick right into the center of the mixture but you don't want it to touch the bottom so what I did is I just go down to the bottom so I can feel the bottom and then bring it back up a bit because if you put your stick too low then the candy won't be able to grow as far as you want it to grow so that's as simple as it is and then you're gonna leave them for at least two to three days in order for any candy to grow and some of mine I left for a couple of weeks and so I'm going to be bringing those ones out to show you and I will show you how to get them out of the container after this so these rock candy growths have been growing for about two weeks and what you want to do at that point is take them off take off the little clothes cake and then the surface is hard so you just want to break it and you can do that with just a butter knife and make sure that you're not breaking it right by the stick and then you want to dump the excess out here like that and then inside you can see that the rock candy has grown around the little post here but unless you're really lucky you might have problem getting it out so what I've had success with is just holding hot water from the tap along the bottom of my container here and then gently prying it away once it gets a little bit soft so I'm going to go and do that and I'll show you the final product so I have the piece of blue rock candy out now and it's all ready to be eaten and I'm going to take the rest of mine out as well and I'll be back to show you all the finished colors so there you go everybody how to make your own homemade rock candy it was a pretty simple tutorial today but something that's really cool that you may not have done before so I hope you enjoyed it and you learn something new so thanks for watching remember to subscribe to the channel and I will see you all again next time you", "enm9eT1cyio": "what's up everybody welcome to the channel today i will be showing you how to store your candle oil edibles and other cannabis infused products so let's get into it alright guys so i'm going to show you guys how to store your cannabis edibles so for my gummy bears all i do is put my gummy bears in a ziploc bag make sure your bag is completely tight and then put your gummies in a cool dark place like your fridge for my rice krispie treats what i like to do is wrap my rice krispie treats and parchment paper and then add it to a ziploc bag [Music] i like to make sure my bag is completely tight and then i store this in a cool dark place like my cabinet all right guys now when it comes down to store your can of butter what i personally recommend is just putting your peanut butter in some type of ziploc bag however let's say if i'm going to be traveling for like a week or two and i want to make some edibles for me personally what i would do is i would use a vacuum steel bag like this here so what i would do is put my cannabis in this bathroom steel bag and then i will back and seal my bag so once you back and steal your cannon butter what you want to do is put this in a cool dark place so i'm going to be putting this in the fridge [Music] now i'm going to talk about how to store your kettlebell so i recommend storing your kennel or in a mason jar so for a short term storage you can use a regular mason jar but if you plan on storing your kindle oil for maybe like a month or two i recommend using an amber mason jar so the good thing about an amber mason jar or any type of jar that is dark it's going to help prevent light from penetrating your mason jar if you don't have access to an amber mason jar or any type of dark mason jar no rubbish you can use a regular mason jar just remember once again to store your mason jar in a cool dark place alright guys so now i'm going to show you how to store your cosmetic products all right guys so currently you are looking at cannabis with body butter so so for my people who are looking to make cannabis cosmetic products like cannabis body butter or cannabis balm or cannabis salad i recommend using some type of uv cosmetic amber jar to put your product in but let's get into the next one all right guys so now we're going to talk about how to store your cannabis all right guys so the cannabis dash box is definitely a short turn option i don't recommend using this over probably a few days at the most so my favorite option would be using the mason jar instead of using this regular mason jar right here to store your herb or cannabis i recommend using something like this here so these are amber mason jars the reason why i like these is because of the color of the mason jar so the color is going to naturally help prevent light from penetrating your mason jar which is a great thing light will degrade your cannabis over time inside of my mason jar i have this little rh pack so that little pack right there is a two-way humidity regulator so what it does is it maintains the humidity and it preserves the flavor and retain the aromas for my herb [Music] all right guys so hopefully you guys learned how to stir your kennel oil your canned butter and other type of cannabis infused product so overall what you need to remember is just store your cannabis in a cool dark place and you'll be good to go but uh thank you for watching this video don't forget to like share and subscribe [Music] peace", "Fc9bmPrwg18": "what's up everybody welcome to the channel today we're going to make peanut butter using distilling so let's get into it the ingredients to make my can of butter would be disciplined i'm gonna be using one foot gram of discipline next we also need clarify butter and you need some type of container or plastic mold to pour your butter into for me i'm gonna be using a marijuana mold to pour my butter into so what i'm going to do now is add this to hot water just to loosen up the oil [Music] while your discipline is sitting in the water measure out your butter [Music] and now i had a teaspoon of lecithin and now add your discipline [Music] [Music] now mix everything together [Music] all right guys so now what i'm going to do is put this on a pipe and let it simmer on low heat for about 10 minutes so let's get into it [Music] [Music] all right guys so every few minutes you want to stir your butter after 10 minutes remove your glass cup from the pot now mix all the ingredients one more time [Music] all right your ingredients should be fully incorporated so now what we're going to do is add our infused butter to our molds [Music] all right guys once you fill your modes with your cannabis infused butter let it cool in the fridge for a few hours [Music] [Music] [Music] troy you for watching this video don't forget to like share and subscribe [Music] peace you", "1LywYGV2M04": "hey guys welcome to the hot box it's a little straight my boy will today we got a dope video we're going to be eating some medicated jolly rancher gummies oh yes 600 milligrams yes we're so excited it's been a minute since we had an edible video for real but before we get into that 85.8 percent of you guys are not subscribed make sure you subscribe it's going down it goes back up you know just keep subscribing guys we need y'all support for real we just lost our instagram not too long ago so keep subscribing we will be making another one soon asap it's just you know we're just trying to keep it safe like we were saying we got some jolly rancher gummies right here look at this package guys some really nice packaging sours by the way yeah as these little characters maybe these little characters i with the characters i hope it's like different flavors yes this kind of reminds me of the last review we did with what was it the sour patch kids yeah it's kind of like that packaging it's kind of like the same kind of vibe and stuff and the dopest thing is uh they're heat sealed so oh yes open it you know it's kind of there's no pre-opening you know it's you don't know what's inside legit you know what i'm saying pretty legit what i'm gonna try to do is open up this little seal right here you can see the little strip on top yeah straight into it a little bit did they were good decent yep thank you hello yeah oh wow i think i got watermelon ones did you get watermelon ones too let me see yeah a bunch of watermelons thank you these are the watermelon ones i don't know yeah look yeah bunch of watermelons inside yeah jolly rancher let me get all these out that's pretty cool we weren't we didn't know what to expect so all watermelons that's pretty cool let's see i mean did you get one two i got six i got six two boca six of them they're sticky probably a hundred a little bit it means a hundred milligrams each that's pretty strong bro hell yeah what i'm gonna do is get a quick close-up shot for you guys and then we're gonna get straight into eating them look at this guys frosted we got six each 600 milligrams that gas gas jolly rancher gummies that with them let me eat this nice one first yes that's great today what are y'all smoking what are y'all eating do you all have edibles where you all have weed let's all know what y'all got and like i don't know is there different ones like is there grape ones yes we have this is the first time we're trying these so yes i don't know if there's other kinds are there apple ones you know yeah are there different flavors out there let us know let us know if you guys have tried it that's packed with flavor yes very sugary not too strong on the um like a weed distillate taste you know it's not too strong it tastes pretty sweet yes i won't say that's bad i would just say it's actually kind of good because you know a nasty distillate aftertaste is not what you want whenever you're eating your edibles that's why i don't like these taste really good eating my second one and get that structure on that that's what i'm saying let me do a break up they're kind of hard to break up yeah it's some dense snugs right there you know what i'm saying scrape gas these are pretty fire though i like the taste probably some of the best tasting edibles i've had so far we really like the sour patch gummies because there was just like a variety of flavors and kind of looking exactly that's what i like go check that out link in the description we also have a couple other edible videos if you all want to go throughout our channel and check them and we got some more edibles coming soon hopefully some skittles yes that's gonna be dope i can't wait for that one we'll be back here in a minute we're gonna let you know how these hit down the rest of them real quick yep initial taste and our first thoughts on it pretty great medicated jelly rancher the more you eat the more you taste now i'm starting to taste the dish a little bit all right we'll be back guys some gas right here yo guys we're back yep i think it's hitting a little bit i'm feeling something for sure yeah it's been about 20 30 minutes yeah it's a little vibe you know yeah we've been chilling we just got some dope ass sweet in today and so yeah we hit that this morning so i mean that could be it but at the same time we do like edibles and  feeling a little something something but you know we didn't like the fact that uh it was only one one type of gummy you know what i mean yeah you all seen it was just a bunch of watermelon we were hoping it was going to be like multiple you know like some sour apple and all the different gummies you know water reviews all bunch of different varieties of this was just kind of one thing so yeah that was uh that was the only disappointing thing but we we didn't know what to expect you know what i'm saying i think it's hitting you know i'm saying i feel something so and people would say oh they're boofy and you know i'm just feeling pretty chilled out like my heads for sure like versus right now versus how it was before this video i feel way more chill you know yes and especially getting back into the video now i'm starting to feel myself a little more i like it though i really like the packaging like we said earlier it's really cool packaging yes it's very dope like we said wish it would have been different ones than just watermelon yeah we got some extra ones for our buddies and they're gonna eat them they're gonna let us know how they feel about them it's gonna be pretty dope but we do got some other edible videos coming in we got some skittles yes for sure very excited about those we hope you all been liking the videos we appreciate everybody's been

frilly neighborhood negro and in today's video guys we're going to give you an update on the nerd rope video that we did yesterday let's go ahead and get into it let's do it all right guys let's go ahead and get straight into this in my quest to be a better content creator i'm trying to give you all the information i can about a certain topic so what i'm going to do today is we're actually going to do an update video on the nerd rope video that we did yesterday i had some other thoughts and i thought about some different techniques and some things that would make sense for us so what we're going to do in today's video is i'm going to update you guys on a couple things we're going to try a couple different techniques as far as nerve ropes and nerd bites but also what we're doing is i want to show you guys exactly what you're going to do if you're doing it in batches like i'm doing say you did some batches the first day then you're going to come back the next day to do some more batches i want to show you guys exactly what you can expect whenever you're doing that i'm going to start doing this on a lot of the videos there's a lot of videos that i feel that i should have did an update video for so i'm gonna start doing that on the videos going forward because of some of these videos you really need to know what's gonna happen a day after or two days after the effect so what we're going to do now is we're going to go ahead and get into this video this is going to be an update nerve root video from yesterday here we go all right guys so it's the day after and you can see that our gummy and our coconut oil mixture here has um you know hardened up here inside the squeeze bottle as you can see here the aluminum foil mold that we did is still right here and so this is what i propose that we do because we have so much control with this the squeeze bottle whenever we were doing it we had like amazing control over what we were doing i'm thinking what if we put some nerds in the tray right here and you know do some lines with our bottle here on the nerves there and cover them up and do them that way without the mole so that's what i'm proposing that we do then most people have you know ice cube trays at their house and i was thinking what if we did some nerd bites so that's what we're going to do that's what we're going to do updated version of the nerd ropes i showed you how to do it with the mold thank you to everybody for watching that video that video is doing great already and we're gonna actually see we can do this a different way so let's go ahead and try to do this i'm gonna get the aluminum foil out of here and prepare this let's do it [Music] some more nerds all right guys so you can see what i'm doing i have a bed of nerds right here that's pretty even and so we're going to try out my concept here so the coconut oil and the gummies is really infused here uh well if you're asking me why do i know that a lot of times when it's not infused well all the oil will be sitting on top all of the oil that we will be sitting on top and if you remember we put three tablespoons in here and so the fact that you only see just a little bit sitting right here and the rest of it is a fuse well and that means that we did a great job infusing this but you can see that it's not sticking to the bottle some people were was asking me about that in the comment section it's not sticking to the bottle at all the oil with the gummies really allows it to be malleable so what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and put this in the microwave for like 30 seconds and then i'm going to see if i don't know how long it's going to be i'll let you know guys know exactly how long it took me to get it to the right consistency here but the the premise of the bit is put this in the microwave get this to soften up a little bit here and then because we had so much control over when we're doing it do some lines on on the top of this nerd bed if you will and then cover that with gummies to see if we can do some nerve ropes that way not sure exactly how it's going to work but we're going to find out here all right here we go in the microwave all right guys so it was in the microwave for 35 40 seconds and as you can see now we're able to move it a little around so now we have it you know where we needed to be and just like i said as you can see it's not sticking to the bottle you don't worry about anything like that and now we can go ahead and do what we did whenever we made our nerve ropes the first time so let's go ahead and do it i got my glove right here um this right here is actually it's actually not that bad as far as the temperature but just to be safe it's better to be safe than sorry you know what i mean i'm putting the jar here so that way i can you know uh actually squeeze out some of the oil and actually get to the gummy part of it i'll show you what i mean right now here we go let's try to make some ropes right here let's do a little thicker this time there we go do it three times and do it again very nice look at that all right do it three times right there and do it again [Music] go two times three times make a nice rope because remember this is the medicated part right here all right do it again with this squeeze bottle you have a lot of control over this gummy mixture that's what i was really had the impression on when i did this the the first time with the nerve ropes and so now we're making thicker nerve ropes there we go bam stop it right there very nice put some more right here make this one thicker look how much control we got over like i said this was right here was only 40 seconds in the microwave look at that bam okay a little thicker too bam all right so that's good all right so just like before let's go ahead and take some nerds so let's go ahead and cover this up [Music] get another box [Applause] all right so now i believe i got everything covered now so what we're going to do right now is we're going to actually just put this in the refrigerator set it to the side while we do these nerd bites and we'll check them out in just a second here and see if it worked out all right so let me put this in the in the fridge and then what i'll do is we'll go ahead and get the ice tray and we'll go ahead and try to do these nerve bites here we go all right guys so we're going to go ahead and try to do some nerve bites as you can see i have this normal regular household ice tray what we're going to do is we're going to take some oil to make sure that we can get these out of here is i'm going to take some of that uh non-stick coconut oil spray but you can use you know whatever spray you have non-stick spray and we're going to spray these and because i have a couple bucks of these nerds left let's go ahead and spray these put some nerves down in the bottom of a couple of these put some more of our mixture with our coconut oil and our gummy mix put some more of that in there and put some nerds on the top there and then let that sit and see how that works out for us let's try [Music] all right so now that we got it in there let's go ahead and put some nerds in a couple of these all right so we have some nerds in the bottom of this now we're going to put some of our gummy mixture in here let's do it there we go i did another 10 seconds in the microwave and that just made it the right consistency so we just go ahead and do this there it is we still got some more of this gummy mixture left so let's do it some of these all right guys so we got that finished right there what i'm gonna do now is i'm gonna go ahead and take the the ropes that we did on the tray i'm gonna take those out i'm gonna put these in let's go ahead and see how those ropes did and then we'll come back to these as soon as those are finished here we go all right guys so we have our pan now out of the refrigerator it is only in there about 10 minutes or so let's go ahead and do this first one and see how it's going to work i don't know exactly about the time see if all the nerds had a chance to actually collect on our gummy strip or if we need to put it back in there or what have you let's just find out here we go look at that look at that nerd rope i didn't get another piece of parchment so i could put it on there hold on all right so we got a better setup now so this first no rope and as you can see we did them thicker than we did before look at that how easy that was and so if you do them this way you don't even need a mold just put your nerds inside the tray you got complete control over how thick or how wide that you want your nerve ropes with the with the squeeze bottle with the squeeze bottle you have complete control over how wide or how not wide you want your nerve ropes so this right here is a great fast method look at this nerve rope and so look so now we have a bed of nerds ready to go all you have to do is you see we have some more gummies right here remember in that in the first video that we did we only use a cup so this is another cup right here i can go ahead and put those in the measuring cup melt those down take some more oil and make some more nerd ropes so there it is guys that's our proof of concept that if you just lay the nerves in the tray with the squeeze bottle because of all the control that you have with it just make your lines in it cover it up and you're ready to go so now that we know that that works let's go ahead and go to our nerd bites and let's see how they turned out here we go all right guys so i just took the ice tray out of the freezer what i've done is i've taken the knife and i sprayed it with that spray so that it won't stick i want to go ahead and start getting these bites out of here let's see how they look if it worked out here we go [Music] do all right guys so there you have it that is a different way for you to do the nerve ropes as you can see doing it this way you have full control over how big or small you want it how wide or not wide that you want it this is a great way to do it so for everybody that's thinking about you i don't feel like making that mold every time you really can do it just by putting the nerds in the tray putting the gummy mix on top of that put some nerds on the top of that bingo bango is super easy if you want to see the full blog of today's video click the link in the description it's going to take you over to goodies420.com and before we get up out of here guys i do want to do today's subscriber spotlight today's

Welcome to Life Noggin! Oh there's a fog rolling in! Wait a minute! [Blocko Sniffs] That's not fog! People have been using cannabis as a sleep\naid for decades, mainly due to the feeling of relaxation and calm it\u2019s commonly associated\nwith. And many believe that it can even help with\nsleep disorders. Studies evaluating the effect of cannabis\non sleep go back to the 70\u2019s, but, because marijuana use has been illegal in the United\nStates since the 30s, research in this field has been largely restricted, and we are still\nlacking verifiable evidence of its effects on health. But scientists have been studying its main\nchemical components for the treatment of many medical issues, like the nausea caused by\ncancer treatments, seizures in children, pain and different sleep disorders. Before we get into how it affects your sleep,\nwe should probably talk about how it all works. What we call weed, pot, or marijuana is actually\na mixture of the dried flowers of the Cannabis sativa plant. It can be smoked, vaped, brewed in teas, made\ninto foods, or concentrated into resins and oils. No matter how you take it, the chemicals in\nthe plant will make their way into your bloodstream, travel throughout your body, and end up in\nyour brain. How fast you feel the effects and how strong\nthey are depends on the method of ingestion. And your experiences can range from relaxation\nand euphoria, to anxiety, fear and panic depending on how much you take and the potency\nof the drug\u2019s active chemicals., Some who have taken large doses have even experienced\na temporary psychosis, including hallucinations and delusions. So it\u2019s really, really important to be careful\nwith how much you\u2019re taking and how. And cannabis use has been associated with\nharmful side effects on brain development and the lungs, and can even result in addiction. The main chemical in cannabis is delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol\n- but you can call it THC. THC is a psychoactive chemical, which means\nthat it can alter your mind. It does this by attaching to neurons in your\nbrain and activating them. This disrupts normal mental and physical functions,\ncausing the sensations typically associated a \u201chigh\u201d. Cannabis also contains another chemical that\nis not psychoactive, called cannabidiol, or CBD. Older studies looking at the effect of the\nwhole cannabis plant on sleep had mixed findings, with some indicating that it can help you\nfall asleep faster and stay asleep, and others showing it can decrease REM sleep,, - which\nis thought to be involved with storing memories, learning, and regulating your mood. More recent studies focus on these major chemicals\nin cannabis, THC and CBD. They found that THC may only have a short-term\nbenefit, with continuous use causing a habit or dependency, as withdrawal from the drug\ncan cause difficulties sleeping.,, Studies also found that THC caused daytime\nsleepiness and bad moods, increased the time to fall asleep, and reduced the body\u2019s circadian\nrhythm - which is needed to regulate your sleep/wake cycle. However, medicines made from it could help\nwith certain sleep disorders like nightmares associated with post-traumatic stress disorder\nand obstructive sleep apnea. It\u2019s clear that more research needs to be\ndone before any definitive conclusions can be made. But, until then, it may be better to stick\nto natural sleep methods like avoiding caffeine, exercising, and keeping a regular sleep schedule.", "vlLo3VBV9X8": "hi everybody and welcome to Baker madness I'm chef Scott and this is a cannabis friendly cooking and baking show where we sometimes cook things and sometimes we no but at least once a week I eat some edibles from one of our Washington state dispensaries something that I wouldn't make in the house something that's probably more industrial then I might have the tools to do so we're gonna get started right away with today's friendly panda candies by hot sugar hot sugar is a subsidiary company of the fact and a company you need to go to their website fat Panda there that's fun I've already eaten a few of these these are our Panda candies these are the caramel apple flavor they have a bunch of flavors many many many not for kids this is THC infused tetrahydrocannabinol okay I'm not sure what the regulation is because this is a really new package as a matter of fact this package that you see is a redesign of the package WIC in the past I don't know six months but this is a new look whichever I like it's really aggressive in there I like that but this package doesn't have any of the nutritional values of anything whereas some of the other ones really do they have act it looks like you bought it at the grocery store it's got all the nutrition and the sodium and the all the stuff so I'm not really sure it must be a voluntary kind of a thing I wish cannabis companies are you listening please put the nutritional values on your products you see these words how tiny can you see the tiniest words ever so I wrote them down over here so he's sharing with you easier I'm gonna read some stuff here and you'll be able to tell from my face how I feel about any of it okay the following pesticides have been used to grow the cannabis that helped create this product Newcomb botan Agard max safer brand three-in-one liquid sulfur Zehra tall regalia PTO gannett role and as a guard which I think sounds like a place that Thor lives as a guard as a guard anyway that's one two three four five six seven eight different pesticides used on the cannabis on the flower the stem portion that's a lot of pesticides in Washington State you have to declare what pesticides are used if any so we have some other companies that we use a lot of flour from that are organic the cannabis was extracted using a proprietary blend of hydrocarbons winterized with ethanol and then molecularly distilled leaving no residual solvents I don't know what any of those words mean but it is forcing me to believe it sweetie okay all of these words are printed on that little half inch tall paragraph okay this is not necessary here are your ingredients today isomalt we're gonna talk about that in a minute pure cane sugar corn syrup vanilla beans cannabis can't can't cannabis oil propyl paraben artificial flavor with the brown color which is six colors like a [ __ ] Crayola box okay corn starch vegetable gum citric acid sodium benzoate potassium sorbate potassium sorbet really caramel flavor and a natto and a natto is just like a it's a vegetable color it's no problem isomalt let's talk about that that's the number one ingredient in this product isomalt is a sugar alcohol and if you're not a baker if you don't work in the food industry you may not know what it is if you go to Vegas or you go to some fancy place and they have those big gorgeous sugar sculptures and it's just tall and beautiful and sculptural and architectural that's made with isomalt sugar real sugar your table sugar that you guys are using right now is known as hydro scopic that means it pulls all of the water near it to it that's why if you leave should sometimes it'll get all mushy especially you live in Florida it'll get all I mean you can you know I mean I so melt on the other hand is not so in the pebbles candies they use pure sugar and corn syrup and those candies as they melt in your mouth they become pliable and kind of bendy isomalt does not these candies do not ever become bendy they get smaller smaller smaller smaller until I usually get bored with them and crunch them to death which is probably terrible for my teeth but I do it anyway because I have no control isomalt is really low on the glycemic index that means that it does not trigger an insulin response so it is not as sweet as real sugar but you can use it like real sugar it is granulated and it melts like sugar it acts exactly like sugar it is not hydroscopic so it's very firm that's why they use it you know to make stuff there is a national prohibition on cannabis so companies that operate in Washington state that also want to operate in other states or want to have their product in other states have to open separate companies separate facilities separate grow houses all separate if they want to for example fat Panda is the company that it originated here and it is also you can get it in count in Canada they have fat panda in Canada as well and here and I guess just recently in California what I but it's coming soon to Oregon Michigan Ohio West Virginia Florida Arizona Nevada and more to come caramel apple delicious first of all you get a sticker whose love a sticker [Music] all right I got this is what they look like this is ten milligrams of THC this is a caramel apple caramel apple flavor I like these because they're stupid packages really weak it's supposed to be childproof but clamp doesn't seem like it yeah [Music] but the flavor you guys super flavorful also the distillate that they're using is really front like I can really I can feel it on my tongue yeah it's really good hmm yeah yummy that was really nice okay I promise to set this one okay I promise chimera Lamia I will zoom it [ __ ] [Music] so the Panda can be worked I already know worked I didn't worked but it really works good so let's do a little let's do a little test now let's see I'm gonna mix these up these are some of my tarot cards I will do a little tarot card reading for you right now mmm tarot cards so special so maybe tippy do so magical oh so controversial pick a card any card to pick a card one pick it for you let's talk about this dope shall we oh my god yeah so these Panda candies I don't know what they're using how it works this the strength of the stuff if you call a few episodes ago I told you it's 10 milligrams per candy but they don't tell you what strain they've used or how strong that strain is so 10 milligrams of one kind of weed can be really much stronger than 10 milligrams of another kind of weed seriously the way they make these I feel them almost immediately this is one of the only candies is one of the few candies that really just I seriously I feel it within 30 minutes two or three of these are some kind of strong ass [ __ ] okay so on my scale let's give him four tastes an eight I'm gonna give him a 7 they have you can really taste the distillate and I mean the caramel apple flavor is good but you can still really it gets overpowered so a7 what I say think of it 7 and for efficacy a 9 and for price an 8 they were good plus no my Wizards discount love that ok so we've picked a card you picked a card - Jeff you picked a card this would be 10 of cups the 10 of cups now if you don't follow Tarot this is a great card oh gosh so family unit everybody's happy they got everything they need often the distance is their house it symbolizes family and stability and the river of emotions flowing through the promise from the divine through the the rainbow everything's gonna be fine so hold tight you guys find the people you love if you're not close to call them and it's gonna be fine we'll be fine see you next time on Baker madness [Music]", "Z5TFu5HgCkk": "hi welcome all city candy i'm elizabeth i'm nikki and we're here to try some candy yay brand new product sour punch bites fan favorite as soon as these came in i needed to try them i love sour punch that's like what i grew up on um getting at the concession stand so fan favorites is like i've never tried grape or lemon so so grape lemon tangerine fruit fruit punch is like the only normal sounding one i remember the blue ones and the green ones and these are none of those so all right well that's not exciting and look at how great this is so this is a really uh nice company investing in happiness is on their back they also have zero waste meaning anything that comes in into the business does not get into the landfill so

have a sweet day you", "NAb7z78N2UA": "[Music] hi everyone well welcome to diamond delight animals if this is the first time you're joining my name is Liz and the rest of subscribers guys welcome back and thank you so much I just passed the 10,000 market oh my god I am so excited I can't believe it you like me you really really like me just kidding anyway guys couldn't have done any of that without you I really do appreciate your support and all your awesome comments and everything I really do from the bottom of my heart absolutely love you so for our today what I'm going to show you guys is quite a few things that you can do with your tincture and as well as I'm going to show you a couple of different ways that we are going to do kin of flowers so you can do can of flower with your plant material or you can do it with tincture and the and other than that I'm going to show you some different ways of doing it so tincture like I said I kind of avoided it for a really long time for one how long it takes to make however with the magic butter machine four hours giddyup so I've kind of switched over to using that because I absolutely love it because you can make do so much with it so for example like the can of sugar that weed that I had in my previous video that I did that I showed you but how to do that well you can do that with almost any of your baking and baking and cooking products so I'm going to show you like I said today how we're gonna do flour you can do it with texture or with but I'll show you both ways to do that you can also would tincture the same way that we're going to do the dehydrated version you can do powdered sugar the other way you can do powdered sugar is from your can of sugar and I'll explain that to you when I get to the powdered sugar section you can do things like infuse your drink crystals your cocoa or your hot chocolate mix your cocoa for baking you could also do if you box recipes you could do your cake or your brownies or any of your cookie things like that you could pre infuse them there with your tincture and just dehydrate it and then you've got it right in there as well you can calculate your dosing a lot better I've put a link in for put a link in the description there for you guys of the calculator that I use I find it really good it is a free subscription to sign up you don't have to pay anything at all and as I said that's what I use so that's what you can use and you can figure out exactly how strong or how weak you want to make things as well as being able to do this you can now make have a combination of your products so you can use I can sugar can't syrup that's what I'm going to show you to how to do Candice Candice syrup I'm redoing that for one particular reason I'll get into the details that when I when we get to the can of syrup also how to do simple syrup which is the same pretty much the same as your can of syrup and yeah so I'm gonna go over all those things if there's only one particular thing that you're interested in I'm gonna have up for you those spots on the video so that you could just easily skip to that if you'd like and to those who wished I've got my nails done and to those of you commented yes I got my nails done and I know they looked really ratty I'd look at the video and like oh my god they look terrible so yeah they're done so what I'm gonna do is I'm we're first part we're going to get into the different ingredients that we need for the different recipes we're going to do the equipment that we're going to need and then put all this kind of stuff together so now with our can of flour with texture what I'm going to using is 2 cups of flour 1/4 cup of my tincture and you are going to need what I found is work best is a nonstick oven tray or baking cookie sheet works perks better I found that the gloss even though if I use oil I still found that a lot of the stuff is sticking a lot of your teach these stuff is sticking to it and very very difficult to get off so I've experimented with a few different things and this has worked best you will need a non not nonstick cooking spray or you could just use regular olive oil or any type of cooking oil we're just going to very lightly grease this pan and that's all you need for the for our tincture version and want to pre-heat your oven to 200 degrees Fahrenheit so you want to get that started and we will get our flowers going all right so the very first thing we're going to do is to grease our pan and we just said we're going to very lightly do this and the reason being is the oil the THC oil does separate out can separate out and when it does is it will automatically stick to the metal and once it does that it doesn't come away unless you use another oil because THC is oil soluble so the only way to get it away is to use another oil so that's why I found lining the pans works great so I'm not going to give it a light spray anyway back down or the other if you're using oil just give it a very light drizzle couple little drops like so and just make sure to get it all over the pan make sure to get it up the sides and in the corners cause anywhere that you don't have it'll stick but we just want to set the pan just very lightly coated because we don't want oil in that in our in our base product so we've got that ready to go my oven is preheating so we're just going to add our texture into our flour like so and you're just going to stir it in until it all gets mixed together and you might need to use your hands that's what I like to do I just like to get my hands in here and just work it through and you'll just continue to do that until your tincture is all nicely worked through your flour once you've got it mixed in there just put it in in your pan or your cookie sheet I like using a pan better so because you got to keep kind of moving in and around and on the cookie sheet I find you lot flights off out of the bottom and it's just more mess you got to clean up and I'm all about not cleaning up messes I'm really good at making them I don't really like cleaning them then once you've got your flour in the pan you just want to score it so you can either just use your spatula or if you've got a straight edge scraper you can just use that so you want to make these little lines through it why I'm doing this as it helps the air the hot air go through it helps it hydrate a little bit quicker and a little more even so once you've got that done you're going to pop it it o really important thing you come let me say really important thing you want to run a fan either a handstand fan or if you've got a ceiling fan get that running again because you got you've got alcohol that's gonna be evaporating and don't don't light up anything in the kitchen okay safety first there we go got my fan going my ovens preheated of course I've got something alright then you're just gonna pop it in the oven on the middle shelf or the top rock doesn't really matter and you're going to leave the oven door ajar so if your oven door up doors will close stay open - they're great if not put something in there to keep the oven door open because you want the air to circulate it's gonna help dry out help your dehydrating process as well as the fumes not accumulating all in your oven which could cause a boom and we don't want that alright so get your faith make sure your fan is always going and we'll check on this about every 10-15 minutes we're going to move it around to make sure that it all dries evenly all right now while that's dehydrating we'll get into the can of flour with the herb now for our can of flour with our herb very first thing you're going to do is we're going to grind up our herb super super fine so that herb brothers work the best and when you want to take out the stem so just remove your plant material from the stem take the stems out reason being is because they won't they don't grind up really fine and we want to make this legal we want to make this a flower and that's all flour is superfine ground-up wheat so we're just gonna do the same thing with this [Music] wow that's some superfine grind there there you go so you're gonna dump this into your flower get a brush to get all the x-ray I don't have one right now have you got a brush handy grab a brush I thought my brush they want to make sure to get all of that out and now because we want to get our plant material evenly distributed through our flower this is why we're going to we need the sifter or the fine strainer so you're going to put this drop your flower in the plant material into your strainer or your strainer and just gently work it through and you're just going to continue to do that until all of that goes through if you're having trouble you can always just use a spatula and work it through just keep moving it around eventually it'll all go through and you're gonna do this at least two or three times this way we'll make sure that everything is well mixed together and kind of evenly distributed all right so I switched out my strainer because my other one was a little too fine mesh the flower was having too hard of a time going through I love the one that had a little bit of a wider mesh oh that was my first run this is gonna be my second run that comes through a lot better wait here I'm gonna go and there you have it have a look at your flower and you'll you'll see make sure that it just looks all nice and even that you don't see kind of any patches of anything once that all looks good you can go ahead and store your flower in a glass mason jar or any airtight container and use it as you will for your baking recipes just bigger quantities would be exactly the same now you've got your you've got now your infused flower as well as you can also use your butters and can oils so again you can it gives you far more flexibility on how strong or how weak you want to make your products alright so now we're going to check in on our our tincture flower so it is starting to dehydrate it's kind of sticking together there not a problem you're gonna get your scraper or your spatula and you're just going to move that around and break it up and that's it just keep doing that until we are completely dry so this will take anywhere depending on how much you're doing probably both up to an hour forty minutes to an hour to a couple of hours I've set depending on how much you're making so you just keep doing that to keep checking on it everybody every 20 minutes or so keep breaking it up mixing it up and continue doing that until it's fully dried and back to the other all right so you take your flower out you think it's dry you moved it around feels pretty good but there's lots of little lots of little balls a little chunks that aren't breaking down so what we want to do is we want to make sure that those get broken down and evenly mixed in there so what we're going to do is we're going to put our flour in through our strainer and you're going to sift it through and we're going to catch all those hard little balls does that just continue to sift that through until the flour gets through and the little balls and stuff get caught up here at the top and then what we're going to do is we're going to put them into our blender or ninja or magic bullet or whatever that you've got as a grinding machine and we're going to grind those all up without them in and then we're gonna put this back in the oven because I'm finished drying because those little balls will be holding on to moisture all right so see you there I got all those they're left I'm going to throw those into my this model until the Magic Bullet container or thingamajigger flower I'm just gonna pop the lid on and run them through the Magic Bullet until it's till they're all flying I ended up or grinded up my little flower there and I'm gonna sip that through again any other hard balls we're gonna pull out and wreak right down just keep doing that until you don't have any any of those any more and we'll finish dehydrating that all right so I'm just gonna put it back into my can put it back in the oven and fit it and complete do you finish dehydrating that so probably another 20 minutes 15 minutes or so I don't know until it's dry how does that sound whoa check it out turn the camera around now you can actually see me and what I'm doing only 30 some-odd videos took me to figure that one out not sometimes cute but not too bright anyhow once your flower is completely dried you can run it through your grinder for one final one final go but if it feels all nice and perfectly nice and silky smooth and then you're good to go you can store it in however you like to store your flower or is a pluck baggie or any type of airtight container you're good to go all right now next we're icing sugar alright so for icing sugar you've got two ways that you can do this your one way is the dehydrating the exact same method as you just did the flour with the texture now for the for the powdered sugar what I did was one cup of one cup of powdered sugar to two tablespoons of tincture and I added one tablespoon at a time mixed it thoroughly with my hands just like I did in the flour and then I did the second tablespoon you can try to maybe out a third but I'd be careful cuz it's gonna get a little bit pasty and just gonna have to dry it out longer but you can probably do more I'm just gonna go with the two tablespoons right now you're gonna pop it in the oven and I'm gonna say drop this about a little bit lower do it to 175 and the exact same method every 10 and 20 minutes move it around and break up any big chunks and continue until that's completely dry now the other method that way you can do it is take a cup of your rate of the candidate sugar that you've made use 1 cup add it to a grinder a coffee grinder or your herb grinder would work the best that's going to give us you give you your finest grind I found like the ninjas or the the blender type thingies that make smoothies there they don't give you quite as fine of a grind and I don't have a coffee grinder so I'm not actually going to do the whole demonstration for you but it is one cup of your can of sugar to one tablespoon of cornstarch that's it put it in the grinder and still look super super flying like your powdered sugar and store again a ziploc or airtight container alright so last but not least and we're going to do our simple syrup and Arkana syrup and your simple syrup you would use in in alcoholic drinks or smoothies milkshakes anything like that you can also use it for making fruit salad a whole bunch of things anything that would call for simple syrup you can you can use that in and the other is your can of syrup which is glucose syrup also known as inverted sugar and it is a direct replacement for like corn syrup so I'm going to show you how to make that now your simple the your simple and the regular syrup is exactly the same the only difference is temperatures that you're cooking so there are two types of simple syrup there is the type that you kind of you're probably used to at the bar it's very watery it seems very watery that is a one to one ratio meaning one cup of sugar - 1 cup of water now the other type that I'm going to be doing is a two-to-one ratio and that is a two cups of your sugar - 1 cup of water and for my candor recipe I'm going to use 1 cup of canned sugar and 1 cup of regular sugar - 1 cup of water and 1/2 a teaspoon of citric acid and as I said the only difference is in what you how you cook it simple syrup you're just going to bring it to a boil once everything is dissolved you're gonna pull it from the heat we'll let it cool to room temperature the cannister of you are going to cook to 234 degrees and and that's going to give us a much thicker syrup and the longer that you cook it the thicker it's going to get however you do not want to go over to 40 otherwise you're gonna have syrup that you cannot work with all right so I'm just going to quickly get into our equipment and tools that we need and we'll get started all right so we are going to need if you're doing the two cups you're gonna need a medium saucepan if you're doing one cup then you just use a smaller saucepan you're going to need your candy thermometer if you're making the glucose syrup you do not need it if you are making the simple syrup you're going to need a spatula and the lid for your pot that fits if you can't find the lids up its find one that's slightly bit bigger and just turn it upside down that works too alright that's it for what we need let's get started all righty so the reason I decided to I'm redoing the cannister up if you may have seen the other one if there was one very important step that I did not initially do because I didn't realize I needed to so when I was making it I noticed that as it heated up the THC oil would be separating and it started to stick around the sides of the pot and it wasn't coming off and I'm like oh that's an awful lot of product being stuck there that you can't get off so what is THC soluble with oil that's right so it is very important that we oil line our pan you just want to make it very light coating and cover the entire pan as well as your spatula or any tools that you are going to be using with your syrup so you don't want to leave any excess oil or anything in there you just want the pan lightly coated all over like so I'm gonna do the same with my spatula same thing when we're getting me um oil off the sides there it will stick to the spatula but then it won't come off the spatula so again we want to oil anything that's going to come in contact with with our syrup now we are going to add in our one cup of can of syrup or one cup of white sugar or half a teaspoon of citric acid or a cup of water and we are going to mix this together and then we are going to put it on our stove on medium high I'm going to turn my heat there on so as I said medium-high and I'm going to continue stirring this now now usually my candy syrups you guys I always say as soon as it starts boiling to stop stirring however we're going to have to do this a little bit differently like I said as it heats up the THC oil starts to separate and sticks to the sides of pot and we don't want that so in order to prevent that or to make sure that it actually gets into our syrup is we're gonna have to constantly be gently scraping the side all the way around the side of our pot so see that that's come off we want that in our syrup that's the good stuff so just get it take it off the sides and just melt it into the syrup and we're going to continue to do this pretty much all the way through the cooking process now towards the end of it it does kind of settle down and kind of go in but I said you'll see the whole process here so see all that to get stuck to the side so that's why I wanted to redo this redo this particular video for that reason it was like oh my gosh that is not good so I'm going to continue to stir that and clean down the sides until it starts boiling again just keep continually well not continually but every couple minute or so scrape the side gently now as it begins to boil you're gonna you're gonna happen add on your candy thermometer and now because we're making an inverted sugar which is a saturated solution I don't know if you remember your science class however it is very delicate so we are not supposed to stir this once it starts boiling however we do have to continue to kind of work those sides so what you're gonna do is just very gently right kind of at the top of the bubble line just work it from there you don't really want to get your spoon into the syrup and you're just going to gently continue to work like that and pull the stuff in and any impurities will quill will cook off and will leave all our yummy stuff but again like I said it will continue to stick to the sides for a while until it gets to temperature and then it all starts to blend in nicely and like I said we're gonna cook this to 234 degrees Fahrenheit and sorry and once it sorry like once it also starts boiling turn your heat down to medium just a little bit about to the higher side so if you got numbers it would be around the six mark I don't like saying it so medium yeah you know what I'm talking about so it's that I'm gonna continue to very gently just at the top of the syrup line and the reason I said is you don't want to cause any kind of major agitation because that can cause your syrup to crystallize then also don't forget behind the thermometer very gently pick it up move it get to cleaning very gently again behind it see how much stuff was there and move it back and just try working very very gently I'm kind of we're kind of going against the rules of doing inverted sugar here by doing this now sorry if you were doing simple syrup it's that kind of said this before you would have pulled it a while ago so once it was boiling and started to get clear you would pull it you could actually at this point pull it so say about 208 210 degrees or so you can pull off that that would be your simple syrup and just you would put the pan on the back of the burner and just let it sit there until it reaches room temperature once it reaches room temperature it is ready to go you can transfer it to a bottle or another container or just leave it in the pot alright so I'm almost that's a 234 so I'm just gonna make sure to do my final click scrape down here minute I hit 234 I'm going to remove the candy thermometer put the lid on it and put it on the back burner until it reaches room temperature and I'm not gonna touch it again put the lid on it and that's it so as I said it's very important not to touch it until it hits temperature all right so you're just gonna let your symbols odd not your simple syrup your can of syrup and your simple syrup if you did both of them you're gonna let them sit until they get to room temperature once I said to get rid to room temperature you can go ahead and use them right away if you want to transfer them to another container storage container and then make sure that it is very well washed sterilized any particle dust particle hair anything at all will can crystallize your can of syrup the simple syrup not as much it's not as delicate but your can is syrup absolutely I don't generally recommend using plastic containers however if you do want to use plastic try to use a brand new one that you've never used obviously that's brand new such a don't be sometimes but yeah so just don't use one that's brand new and that way you won't have to worry about any kind of cross-contamination but other than that I'm gonna show you the syrup once it's cooled and I'll be back to say goodbye and here is our corn syrup so I'm just going to transfer it over to this bowl you want to be very gentle do not use a metal spoon a wooden spoon or rubber spatula only and said the reason that you want to be very gentle is because if you educate it too much or too rough with it it will crystallize so guys that was my demonstration for Ken flowers simple syrup canna syrup and your powdered sugar I hope you enjoyed that a lot of information there for you but it's all along the same lines and now it's great because now you've got all of the bases for your baking and cooking so you not just stuck now with butter you've got a variety of being able to use base ingredients right in your cooking and baking so now it's really easy for you to take your own favorite recipes that you like to do maybe you've got a grandma's chocolate chip cookie recipe now he's very easy go ahead use your can of flour and your butter sugar as usual and yeah let me know how your recipes turn out I'd love I love hearing when things turn out I definitely of hearing when you do have a problem as well so that I could try and help you fix that and I think that is all I have for you today I do hope that you subscribe there's going to be tons more stuff coming in the future and yeah that's about all I got to say for you today thanks again for watching I really appreciate it have an awesome day [Music]", "sIo3tYrd_5w": "by the way I saw your movie today it's very very very funny thank you I would not say it's family fare no no yeah it's uh it's kind of like an r-rated modern take on a Christmas fable I guess you would say yeah yeah it's about three guys who have a tradition of going out every Christmas and this is like their last year doing it because they're getting old and it's getting kind of sad and so they kind of decide to try to blow it out and and yeah and drugs new to the adult situation yes there is all that stuff you believe will Jesus be upset with you for this yes Jesus won't care that I go yeah Jesus is not our key demographic he came to this birthday yeah exactly I know it's too bad um I don't know Jesus would love it she's essentially he's got a great poster Jesus Jesus would love it yeah we have a clip here I think that it needs to be explained before we show it yeah so basically my character is about to have a baby and and he his wife to let him like blow it out before he has a kid gives him like a box full of every drug on earth and so I've done all the drugs and now I'm lost and I'm trying to find my telephone using another phone because I don't know where the hell I am and this is me like trying to get directions basically yeah uh I've been having pretty crazy night I'm gonna level with you I'm pretty messed up no way you don't say what's your name Spencer Spencer cool my family over there hi I'm Isaac nice to meet you Sona hey you have dogs can I pet them yeah go ahead they're fine thank you you're very well hi guys hi we gotta talk first all dogs can talk said yeah this I mean really this role of a guy who goes on this crazy drug-fueled adventure you're something that you've been a role you've been researching for many many yeah so it's officer how 14 or 15 I guess researching this role yeah very long right along here yeah I I've had some experiences like that throughout my life didn't tell it give us one of them do you remember all of them are they I remember some of them when I was 18 I went to Amsterdam with a friend which is a good start for a drug story I guess and decided we were gonna do a bunch of mushrooms because that sounded fun and and but the thing in Amsterdam mushrooms are I don't know if you've ever bought mushrooms but they come dried out normally and so they're like dehydrated you know and so you eat like three grams of them or something and then you're super messed up for like five hours and but in Amsterdam they were wet like fresh mushrooms like you'd put in a salad and so the weight was all off and and so we bought uh 60 grams of them and we were like we'll just split them its water weight I'm air we kept saying that like we can sitting like its water weight and so I mare we ate them and then we had a plan which you need which is to wish to go to the grocery store and buy picnic supplies and then go to the park and have a picnic and so we go to the grocery store add like as we're shopping they kick in like as hard as you could use a humanly fathom and we're just like buying like toothpaste and bread and like it makes it makes no sense I've ever like cheese and sunscreen and like you're just like just get it which will go where we go and so we go to the park and we set up our dog sensical picnic and then mushrooms meth with your stomach cuz their poisonous mushroom so I was like I have to go to the bathroom right now and I then was like and my friend was like don't leave me and I was like I have to and I was like I'm gonna find a Dutch restaurant and that'll let me use their restroom so I like was sweating profusely I remember and I burst into like a tiny little cafe and I just Dutch people be my good and house I could I use your bathroom and I think there is like go go go like I was in there for an hour no like and I don't even know if I went I don't know what I know what came out of where I just know I was I was in there for a long time I remember thinking like if I must have gone by now and so I got up and left and then I had to throw up which it's busy there so it's like Manhattan like there's people all over the streets and I was like where do you throw up and I was just like it's just gonna happen and I throw up I never had splashed on Dutch people's legs which was gross and they're like uh I remember seeing again discussed in Dutch faces and then I went to find my friend and he was laying facedown in the park like completely like a like a dead person and I went up to him and I was like yo I'm back and he just got up and he's like we gotta go and I was like okay I get it and he's like we'll go back I was like we'll go back to the hostel and he's like no we gotta leave Amsterdam I was like okay I guess that's what's happening and I remember trying to collect our picnic and you believe it bail bail and like and we left the picnic and then we went to the train station while still like fully tripping on mushrooms and we bought tickets to Paris cuz that was close and we went to Paris and we arrived in Paris in the middle of the night as we were kind of sobering up be like why are we in Paris I remember thinking like I did so many drugs I wound up in another country you're not just writing these movies you're really loving it yeah", "JG0_YdcLap0": "hello my children and welcome to wheats as we turn corn syrup and high and potassium sodium tartrate into not wine but weed welcome to wheats guys uh we are here with jesus and all my other homies today to talk moana that's right we're back with wanna uh surely i'm not gonna take the time to link below uh the video where i screwed up reviewing them before so we are here to review them in earnest today they're watermelon hybrid gummies uh this is a vegan gummy from wanna coming in at 20 bucks from my dispensary so this puts this at the uh highest end of the gummy um edibles at my dispensary so a bit of a premium for the wanna gummies um but nothing else too fancy here pretty basic packaging from wanna with their hybrid watermelon gummies we're gonna do it nice and short and quick here so that we don't upset the j-man we're going to pinch here as it says open it up and there are our wanna weed watermelon gummies manufactured by high life farms we've got our wonderful lab testing results and all of our stuff my cameraman is currently being uh pulled away by the dogs at this moment but that's okay here we go here is our watermelon gummy looking really nice and square how wonderful watermelon sugar weed aftertaste not bad pretty good well i am now my own cameraman again um and these wanna weed gummies well if you've had a weed gummy before you know what to expect um a lot of sugar to mask the taste and a pretty hefty cannabis aftertaste but i have certainly had worse uh and haven't had too many that are quite a bit better in terms of taste but it's not about how it tastes about how it makes you feel and for that guys i'm gonna come back to you in about two hours after i finish another whole hell a lot of a hell of a lot of these gummies and once i do i'll come back and i will let you know if these wanna weed gummies are as good as we all wanted them to be ugh anyways say hi stay healthy we'll see you back here in just a bit goodbye welcome back to wheat skies i'm back from paradise on earth or what was it called jesus's cameraman do you remember desert christ park welcome back to wheats guys i'm back from desert christ park or something like that the place with all the jesuses uh where we first tried the wanna cannabis infused watermelon hybrid gummies and these are pretty good gummies uh i'm not a hundred percent sure they're worth the 20 premium uh they are uh sort of better quality than the cheapest gummies for sure uh but whether they're the uh sort of eight dollar premium i'm not a hundred percent but they are definitely good quality and if you are concerned about um healthiness in your gummies excuse me guys there's a dog who's really just insistent go get them get out of my face um so if you're really concerned about your uh health and all that these are vegan uh and they are all natural flavors and colors nothing artificial here so uh they also claim to be artisan quality whatever that means anyways uh good quality stuff still pretty high from these uh it's been about three hours since i had my last one and still i am quite high so that is a pretty good endorsement right there and then anytime we have a product we like this much i'll take that camera person she's driving us all crazy go get just get out of our face just just just kid it's it's going to make it worse anytime we have a product we like this much i like to give a little cherry on top a little something extra that's not weed related so i'm out here in the middle of nowhere in the middle of uh god's country and anytime i'm out in the desert i think you know area 51 ufos sci-fi and we've been doing board games recently so i'm going to give you one of my favorite board games of all time one very cosmic and theme and that's cosmic encounters plays like five six seven eight players uh it is too hard too difficult to explain right here but i can tell you it's going to be one of the best times if you have friends who are into board games if you've never heard of cosmic encounters and you have a group that is willing to um do something different give cosmic encounters a try don't even remember who designed it right now that's because of wanna gummies and these wanna i was gonna make another one a pun but i'm too high so just you know uh know that that is an endorsement and that's going to be endorsement as well for cosmic encounters on your local board game store or online in some way i guess we're still in the middle of a pandemic board games are a weird thing to endorse but um they're an optimistic one and i'm rambling thanks guys it's been a it's been a blast here i'm sorry about the dog i'm sorry about all the jesus stuff you know uh we're just uh we're out here on vacation having a good time here on weeds stay high stay healthy we'll see you soon", "J-CQhL5uCwk": "Hey number of you have asked me how I go about making these candies that I post on to Facebook so I thought I would spend a little time here and make a video of me making the latest batch of candy I'm making a Japanese pinwheel design and the flavor in this particular batch is pomegranate that you see me adding to the hot sugar the sugar is about 310 degrees so it's pretty warm it will burn you severely if you're not careful so you gotta be cautious you'll see that I awesome now adding citric acid bring helps bring out the flavor in the candy you don't taste a lot if you don't have some kind of a acidic additive into the sugar now I'm pouring out what looks like four equal pools of sugar the point here is that I want to make four different colors I'm dividing it all up of course they're all have the same flavor in it because I entered it before this step and you're gonna see me go ahead and start to make the colors and I'm gonna use in this particular design this is red adding a little yellow a little blue for my primary colors a little white that's going to be used for it's sort of to reflect and help enhance the colors I'm gonna mix them all here and you'll see that it's boiling a little bit or steaming and the purpose of that is to try to drive off any water water and hard candy is quite the enemy and you're always trying to avoid adding any water or working in humid conditions it turns out this is a nice cold day today so it's a nice day for making candy I mix in the white now it turns out you don't really have to add white coloring if you use white if you just take that amber sugar and pull it long enough it will turn white as it incorporates a bunch of air bubbles it to alecky do with a taffy machine and now what you're seeing is I'm slowly peeling up the sugar is it cools on the edges and moving it into the center of each puddle if you will and that helps even out the temperature and eventually will make it easier for me to mix the colors in throughout each each grouping here you'll notice I've sped this up quite a bit and it's just an effort to make this video go a little faster all in all it's only about 10 minutes or so still pretty darn hot probably up in the mid 200s so it's I am wearing gloves under the blue gloves to help with the heat and you'll see me occasionally just set my hands on the table and that's just to try to help them cool off a bit they get pretty warm you'll see people often wear a really heavy gloves like welders gloves it's tough when it's this hot but I can work pretty quick here and then don't need it now I'm mixing the colors I'm not going to pull them too much I want them to maintain a transparent quality to them and you'll see at the end why that is but you can pull them quite a bit and actually in this case a red weed almost turned pink it would pull enough white into it from from the air bubbles that's incorporated from pulling you see the folks we've worked with a lot of white color they put them on essentially a taffy puller and help drive out or to drive it air bubbles and really generate a nice bright white crisp color in this particular case I mean it'd be that overall bright but I do want to be nice and opaque enough to help reflect the colors I'm gonna use in the design so it turns I don't want just three colors I want six colors and the nice thing about making the three primaries here is if you remember in art school or in high school in art class you can mix your primary colors to get just about any color you want so I'm dividing these into fourths because I'm actually gonna make six colors I guess I'm gonna cut them up here and if you remember of course that when you mix your red and yellow you get orange when you miss your red and blue you get purple and your blue and yellow to get your green and that's what I'm doing right here again I'm just trying to pull it enough to mix the colors evenly you know it's hard to see but in front of me there is a it's actually a pancake griddle I use as a heat plate and that helps slow the cooling down a little bit helps me control temperature the whole art of working with with hard candy is to maintain temperature gives to hot of course it melts you can't do anything with it if it gets too cold it gets brittle and you're done so we work to keep that sort of clay texture or state now I'm going to take each color and I'm gonna make essentially a long a triangle each one a there's going to be a wheel of the pinwheel and on each edge I'll put a little white and that will help divide the colors up when you when you look at the candy of all assembled so I'm gonna go through each color and do this I use this little spatula to helps me make a little nicer cleaner as you just edges almost there you see me occasionally rotate the sugar or in this case I may be taking it off the heat plate because it's getting a little too warm and I'm starting to lose the structure of the triangle and so I can take them off the hot plate and cool them down this way a little bit right now I've got my six triangles I'm gonna start putting together my pinwheel by adding each of the colors together I will give you my design as long as I'm working with them with their hot like this they'll stick together pretty well even if they cool off a little bit you can just run a little bit of water like on a damp cloth across the side of it and it'll act like glue and piece them together but I'm tending to work pretty quick so they're they're still pretty we're pretty good at hue so quality to them all right so now I've got my master role together here and so I'm moving away from maintaining temperature to maintaining structure of the design and I want to keep this round cylinder and first thing I got to do though is make them sort of bite-sized and that's what I'm doing now by stretching the the cylinder out a little bit and that design will be maintained whether it was letters or colors or shape or whatever throughout that whole structure or throughout all those little rods that are being pulled out they're also hot and if they sit too long and they'll go flat so you'll see me constantly rolling two cylinders to keep them from are the rods to keep them from going flat and maintaining their circular structure and that's what I'm doing now this takes a little while because it's going from a pretty warm temperature to you got to get them to they're essentially cooled down so you can crack them lifting it up shows you they're still not quite ready yet cuz they're uh they're deform now I'm getting ready if you kind of cut it out there but I did that for about 20 minutes off and on so now they've pulled down quite a bit I'm going through the process of breaking them into bite-sized pieces you can make these at different sizes I like this size it's about a half an inch and it's a nice bite-sized piece you can of course stretch the cylinders out or the rods out longer and thinner and you get smaller pieces or you can make different sizes whatever you what do you pretty like but this seems to work pretty well and that pot table you did admit of course it's sat for 20 minutes so it's actually cooled down now but I need that hard starch surface to cut against so the pieces essentially crack off and smaller pieces [Music] I'm getting them nearly finished as you might guess the rods that are in the middle of the thing looked the best some of the ones on the end or a little more deformed one way or the other but they all taste great and so he just tend to mix him in and nobody seems to carry to worry too much about it if it was something important I guess she could weed them out but the more careful you are the more uniform your structure is throughout the whole the whole sample set I'm getting to the end we'll cut the rest of these out and I'll let them cool a little bit longer roll them around little bit to kick get any sharp edges off and then I'll pack them up and hand to my friends and family and hopefully they enjoy them and it is a nice flavor and they do seem pretty pretty popular getting towards the end here here is the finished product as they lay it on the table but I really like a bottom though is when you hold them up to the light they really pop have a nice color to them in the light you know hold them up to the Sun or what have you oh that's about it I hope you enjoyed it I hope you have a chance to get some of these they are good I hope you enjoy it let me know I know thanks bye", "-7N80ptxDCk": "hi everybody it's Brad with big family homestead and in this video we are making candy sweet awesome simple easy candy so let's get to it that's right we are making candy some friends of mine at church said they really liked watching these silly videos we make up and and all the different desserts and and sweet things but they said also that they like watching Animalia videos too so I started thinking to myself how could we do this I came up with the perfect solution cooking with animals how about that we're going to cook up some candy with animals how crazy and fun is that going to be if you're wondering has he lost his marbles the answer is probably yes but we're going to still cook some candy ax it's awesome it's easy basically going to show you the ingredients we're going to do it fun easy cheap cheap cheap and you should be able to make it and you know it only takes like 10 minutes so this is awesome stuff okay so four ingredients as always or generally speaking I should say if it's a complicated recipe I generally don't make it and this one is very very basic you really only have four things that are going to make this candy up you've got two cups of granulated sugar 2/3 cup of light corn syrup 3/4 cup of water and then some kind of a flavoring I'm going to show you up close what I got here this is a raspberry flavoring but it's from my believe Lord and Lord and oils raspberry flavor and you can use whatever you want I've even seen people using essential oils and all kinds of other things but we use those because it's pre-made pre-measured out easy to do I think it costs like 50 cents or something really really small so there you go ok for tools its basic stuff you're basically going to need a saucepan a spatula and you're going to need a cookie sheet or whatever kind of form you want to pour it into if you're going to make lollipops you could get little forms for them or dinosaurs or even ape-like looking things that would be crazy candy candy apes but yeah anything whatever floats your boat you will also need a thermometer to monitor the temperature of your soon to be deliciousness in candy yay okay now that we've got our ingredients sorted we're going to heat up our saucepan and I'm going to need help from my lovely assistant David because it would be truly a silly thing for me to be cooking with a rabbit in my hand so here is my lovely assistant David ha the hammer the cannon DJ magic snappy pants whatever you want to call up so he's getting the saucepan ready and we've got our thermometer because basically all you're going to do is you're going to heat these ingredients up to 300 degrees they're going to boil then as it's cooling down you're going to stir in your lovely raspberry Ness for us it's raspberry nice it's whatever flavoring you want and that's it then you put it on your tray it'll spread itself out and as it cools down you cut it so here we go let's get it going over a medium-high heat so now as David's putting ingredients in I want to make a note there if you see that thermometers stick the sticky thermometer you basically don't want it touching the bottom or also will give you a false reading but you do want to make sure that's fully into your mixture here and in goes the water and now it's simply a waiting game as the temperatures coming up to 300 degrees you do want to make sure that you're stirring it regularly you're looking for a boil make sure that you're checking that temperature you don't want to get it too hot or you will burn it now you do want to keep stirring but when when you reach 260 degrees then you're going to stop stirring because it's going to continue to elevate in temperature that's already at a mass a critical mass critical critical mass and it's going to keep getting hotter so basically at 260 you stop and then it should start to clear up okay so we have just now crested the 260 degree mark so we will no longer be stirring we will still be waiting oh yes we will be waiting alright so now we're keeping an eye on the temperature like good little Scouts that we are but keep in mind that the last few degrees the last 10 15 degrees jumped quickly so you got to be ready to get this off the heat then you're going to stir it up again as you add your flavoring and then on to your form we just crested 300 degrees we've taken our goo off the heat we're adding our flavouring we're going to stir it up and pour it into what we're using for form is just our cookie sheet so we're going to take that thermometer off there be careful keep in mind this is 300 degrees stuff and if it sticks to you it will stick for a while it will burn the stew out of you be very careful so here we go now we're like I said we're just using a cookie sheet for our form because we're going to cut it into squares you just pour it on and it will spread out just like that now some of you might be saying yourself right now hey inner chubby guy why don't you lick the spoon that would be a terrible idea it might tear off your tongue it's very hot don't do it resist the urge all right let's see if this thing is cooled down it's been about 15 minutes what you do is you just take a regular little pizza cutter you're going to score this yeah like that into whatever size of shapes pieces you want now if it's not see that if it's not ready it'll just kind of blob back over itself and the idea is not you're not cutting it we're just trying to get it to a score so that when it actually does get completely hard then it will break apart very easily now if you let this go too long it will start to break right away so there's a sweet spot it's usually about 10 or 15 minutes oh so you look started to blob back together the edges are fine I got to wait so we'll wait another five now at this point it's all gridded up and it's not going to blob together anymore and if you were a normal person you would just let that sit there for a good 40 minutes or whatever but well let's just say I'm abnormal and I'm also not very patient so into the freezer you go baby all right so we very impatiently waited and reluctantly waited and waited and now it's done it's ready so basically you can just take and crack it bust it out of here however you need to do it I can sometimes get under here with a knife which was exactly one we'll do right now so now you have made candy delicious delicious candy one more step that we do is well actually take some powdered sugar and dust this stuff with it shake it around I mean this this little container is not big enough we'll do it in a bigger container but the reason for that is it helps it not stick together which is really nice so there you have it folks cheap easy delicious homemade candy it literally cost us maybe 50 cents for everything and in the great part is you know what you're getting you know there's no nasty weirdo chemicals no asbestos or fungal material well anyway I hope you liked the video and the animals so there you have it I'm Brad with big family homestead please pass the video around yes we're silly it's just silly here anyway have an amazing day that is one lazy dog one lazy dog indeed", "0Hct1HxIuwU": "hey baby family what is going on back with another vid back with another review and today we have sweet tarts soft and chewy ropes okay colors from real sources hmm what does that mean colors from real sources bro i feel like that's like they trying to act like we natural but technically we're not natural but we gonna act like we natural make you read this thing we naturally i don't know bro colors from real sources i've never heard that before usually they say all natural no artificial flavors uh real fruit like colors from real sources so what does that does that mean you took a green apple to make the green in this color like come on what do you i feel like you're trying to finesse colors from real sources sour apple i love sour apple i saw it immediately had to get it i love sour apple let's hope they did sour apple right and they didn't ruin it 90 calories not too bad this is a share pack uh i picked these up in walmart i believe i've always seen these rope things but i just was never drawn to it i was like nah that's not my cup of tea yeah like nah for some reason i just never wanted to try it until i seen the sour apple so now we're going to finally try it uh is there a slit somewhere here slit around here somewhere that's going to help me open it because where do i open it from so let me get my handy dandy notebook my handy dandy scissors and we're gonna see wow so they just they just thrown in there like that they just thrown in there like that i don't know who yes the smell is good it smells like the green apple nylon laters oh it smells like the green apple air head but i mean this big bag you were throwing some more here i mean you could have had a see-through clear bag that was like you know the size of a twizzlers i wonder why you want this long flat bag with this so here they are here they are ladies and gentlemen here they are a little darker oh they snap right off let's see they smell good it's a different type of chewy and it's almost like the uh what do you call them cow tails it's got the caramel in the middle i mean the um it's got like that white cream in the middle you ever had cow towel um what is the white cream though so all this is sour apple it's not telling me what the hell is the white cream in the middle come on man so i get together now it kind of i want to say it's the same so that's in the counter but it's nice it's not as loud it's not as much because it really don't like ooze out but it is there but that's crazy they don't tell us what this is this is i would definitely get these here like i said it's giving me the cow tail type vibes not the flavor but just it's chewy it's in a cream so now when the cow tell what i've had with them in a while but these not bad they're not real real sweet like too sweet sweet but they do got that sour tangy green apple taste and they're all and they're soft and chewy but it's a different type of chewy also it's not like i don't know it's a little different chewy than i had before like when you first buy it you think you're just gonna rip the weapon that's like no it's a little tougher than that but then he's like but it's not that but it's not that tough so it's like it's different different chewy that i had before but um i gave these style 8 out of 10. definitely would get them again that's probably the most i can eat i need to chill out i just reviewed the other game for this i need to chill out um eight out of ten not bad um the flavor is pretty much what you expect like i said it's not too too sweet which is a good thing sometimes these these these candies be like way over they could overdo it and like i knew it hadn't i knew it had to be like not too sweet because it's only 90 calories and i'm going out here man you try them out let me know how you feel about them come back to this video leave your comments on your thoughts on them if you already had them before leave a comment and tell me if you like them uh what do we get them again well no problem get them again but i'm not i'm not gonna like go out and look for them they're not like in demand but if i'm looking in the candy aisle and i see some stuff i could see myself maybe picking them up again um and now i'm probably maybe trying other flavors but i'm gonna add that thumbs up for your boy if you enjoyed this video uh if you're not subscribed please subscribe to the channel because we're doing big things over here reviewing all these streets we out bish hey baby you", "JGXk_kV4NQU": "hi welcome all city candy i'm elizabeth i'm anna and we're here to eat candy best job ever best job ever until we get something really sour okay warhead brand new product warheads ooze chews sour chewy candy filled with ooze but it doesn't look like ooze it looks like a cream so i'm i'm interested what they actually look like yeah in real life um lots of flavors in here mango strawberry ooh black cherry green apple watermelon and blue raspberry blue raspberry is not a real thing is it not i was wondering about that i've never seen a blue right here red ones yellow ones black ones [Applause] okay there's a blue one right there there's more in here there's a blue raspberry they're pretty the colors are very pretty right and let's see the yellow there's no lemon that must be mango mango strawberry green apple watermelon i'm gonna go with green apple i was gonna do that too so i had to pull all the rest of them out it's stretchy so hard oh you're right there oh they're sour but or not that bad until you wait a second i always know when my eye twitches up here that it's sour nope and that's unusual cause usually i can't handle sour you're not that sour i'm a little disappointed in that and you get a little bit of it but usually i can't handle very sour things and i'm taking this like i just don't know i'm going with the this has gotta be black cherry right yes that's my favorite flavor i think your dog farted again approved marley's asleep marley's done she's in a sugar coma all right if i have to pick a favorite black cherry's gonna be my favorite i liked watermelon i was not a fan of the green apple just really artificial sometimes green apple can be artificial but the watermelon was good i like mango in real life i'm not a mango fan so i'm not trying that one i like the black cherry i'm sticking to that my favorite black cherry you want to try one of these good come here try the black cherry tell her okay leave before it gets worse now i love it they're not very sour but they're a little bit sour there's like a touch of sour so i think it's it's a little sour but it's cream like i do like the cream butter if you like a hint of sour this is great if you're expecting like sour sour what you expect warheads right yeah if you're expecting to put it in your mouth and go you're not gonna get that here maybe maybe it's definitely not a warhead challenge type of situation right those are like not bad awesome car snacks oh they're a great car snack except for the sugar that's going to get in between this well you're not like dumping it out you're like dipping in problem-solving everything's all over the place just a hand sugar and spice all over anyways thanks for watching um thanks for letting us eat candy on camera have a sweet day bye", "DZTqHxVbqpQ": "good morning everybody today is a exciting day it is barely 7:52 a.m. so like almost 8 o'clock and I just watched my face brush my teeth

like being best fan so I plan on eating this right now so that way and like about an hour after I do my hair will be ready to do my makeup and humvee Heights bug so that's exciting but I wanna show you guys while I eat this this is cookies and cream flavor and it says it is by the brand 420 brownie I don't really know I'm not too sure yeah so it's so funny because on the back it literally says only start with a sugar cube piece sized piece wait at least 2 hours in all capitals it says 2 hours to feel the full effects but you know we're gonna eat as much as we can right [ __ ] now so - you're poppin so [ __ ] chocolatey like I don't want to eat it it's gonna be so torturous maybe this I know some people are probably like what the [ __ ] [ __ ] I would love to eat that and it's like yeah I want to be high but I don't wanna eat this like [Applause] do what it looks like very chocolatey it's um cookies and cream so not only is it the brownie there's double the chocolates of the cookies oh my gosh I don't want to eat this ah tastes like mint cuz my toothpaste I remember when I was younger I watched one of these videos of um a girl who actually had purple hair she's not even YouTube gray anymore I don't know what happened to her forgot her name actually her name was Erica cannabis and she had a video of her eating a brownie like this kind of but I don't know how many milligrams it was that by the way if you guys didn't know this is a thousand milligrams of thousands so that's kind of a lot okay a lot of people usually take like 100 milligrams 200 300 500 is a lot this one's a thousand so yeah I wish it was smaller so I could just eat the whole thing you know like one bite but the reason why I brought up Erica cannabis is um old video is because she was like oh I don't want to eat the brownie and nasty and I was like what the [ __ ] like I've never had an edible because I was like so young at the time watching that video and I remember being like what the [ __ ] this girl doesn't want to eat her brownie I'll eat it for her you know but now it's like no [ __ ] I understand because this is a struggle at least I got to film this video with like white peas and I'm like with white keys rather than like with the yellow tooth like you know my haters mad you had to find something new to hate on about me mmm haters mad Oh watch me you my brownie [ __ ] Oh Oh big bite mmm I hate it I don't like the taste I don't like it it's just too chocolatey it is 8 o'clock and I will check back with you guys in an hour I just came downstairs to get some water it's

I'm not a beauty guru guys I'm really not I'm actually very bad at doing makeup but I'm gonna try to do this good cuz like this is what I'm gonna wear for the rest of the day so I'm gonna literally try my 150% best to do this like pretty you know and I'm going for like a pretty like every day you makeup look I might do it like a little bit snazzier with some eye shadow and some lashes I've been wearing falsies a lot more and than I ever did in my entire life and I'm already getting if you guys think I should do a video on why I hate and we'll never get eyelash extensions again thumbs up this video so I could do like a whole experience and Q&A maybe all about eyelash extensions because I know what of you guys probably having on them yet and I know a lot of you guys probably do want to get them but girl I've got that a couple of times and from different people from salons from home studios and I just hate them and my phone's ringing who's calling me Yello yep life being guest on the beat yep okay now you're back to the Z video um what do I do next I got a cover up these acne problems cuz do you not see this face girl I know you do I know you see my pimples from a mile away I actually recently bought this foundation it's the LA pro coverage foundation by le girl hmm good thing I didn't go on my kappa pants [ __ ] oh heck no oh my gosh really honey I learn my freakin hair I got my arm again [Music] anyways as I was trying to say jeez you just want to be so rude trying to interrupt me a [ __ ] um I like this foundation I don't think it's the correct color for my skin but it's not like completely off we just kind of like oxidizes a little bit and then becomes a little bit too dark for me but I just kind of fix it with like a light concealer but yeah I ordered this from Ulta online because nowhere in my town do they sell la girl so I really had a guess my color because like obviously I ordered it online and I liked it I mean I don't regret buying it it was probably like five to eight dollars I don't remember exactly how much it was but it was pretty like affordable and I liked it um it kinda looks like pain on my skin like I'm painting my face but like isn't that what makeup is it's like painting your face right stop looking and it's funny because I'm doing a really bad job at blending this in but because I'm on camera I swear it on camera it looks so flawless and I look so pale but in person it looks way tan and then it doesn't look fully blended I hope so yeah always just keep in mind that youtubers I feel like look twenty times cuter through the camera so just you know don't be surprised when you see me add a bath on no I'm just kidding that's a really bad joke because mm I already passed but you get the idea I'm a Yoko has a [ __ ] basically next I do my eyebrows and honestly you guys I think I have been known for like a good year now ever since I started my youtube channel that I'm terrible at doing eyebrows I've always used this on Nastasia dip brow to fill in my eyebrows but just recently I switched to the honest Asya duo brow powder it's like the same thing just powder formula rather than the dipbrow formula which is like I don't know what it is and I don't know powder I think works a lot better for me and the kind of eyebrows I have because my eyebrows are really fine you guys could barely even see them from a mile away that's why I have to fill the [ __ ] out of them and just like you know I've tried yoga I only got eyebrows online so yeah you know I wasn't born with no eyebrows but when I use the dipbrow I guess I just looked like a lot more of a fake [ __ ] so when I use this powder it just works out a lot nicer for me because people don't judge me as hard on my Instagram comments and they actually give me compliments on my eyebrows people decide to be nice you know as opposed to when I use a dip brow people comment saying how fake my eyebrows are and how well it matches my personality oh [ __ ] I'm just roasting myself now oh and also somebody commented on my video recently actually shout out to that person who commented this cuz they said destiny oMG all you do is roast yourself like don't don't put yourself down like you know [ __ ] what anybody else thinks like your eyebrows are popping or everything this pop and you know who cares you know and I was reading that comment and I was like that's so true like who cares you know like who cares if I don't have no eyebrows that's what makeup is for to give me eyebrows you know like it's not a big deal it's just it's a [ __ ] piece of pube on your face like who gives a [ __ ] you know but honestly I love roasting myself because I love myself and how much why I can roast myself and laugh about it and still love myself and still feel like I pop it I'm beautiful even without makeup you know I don't really give a [ __ ] like Shu who do I got to impress honestly I ain't got nobody to impress like I you know life is just so short why live it trying to impress others Wow my eyebrows are not coming out good you guys I kind of just like slap on a bunch of product and then I get the concealer and I try to like actually make it look like I browsed oh like and I feel like once they get them threaded they'll be a lot easier to do right now it's hard for me because I'm really bad at doing makeup in the first place and then I'm a little bit high off of this edible and then my eyebrows just have [ __ ] hair everywhere like what the [ __ ] where do I fill it in you know the struggle is real right I say my say here's my eyebrows honestly if I got mistaken they don't look too shabby like yeah but not the best yeah they're pretty [ __ ] dark but I have had a worst days bill I've had worst days so that makes today a decent day kind of feel like hitting my wax pan because this edibles not doing me justice so Cheers all right so once I'm done doing my eyebrows I immediately jump into conceal oh my gosh the I fell that trying to talk okay cuz I'm already using the concealer for my eyebrows so it only makes sense to do the concealer after your eyebrows cuz then you're gonna need a use of concealer on your eyebrows like I don't understand how [ __ ] could do their concealer first and then do their eyebrows and then do concealer again you know I like to keep it all in one we can seal the brows and then we can sell these under-eye circles right now my pimples I mean my pimples my forehead you guys it literally has like craters on it like I want to zoom in I want to expose myself looking you see those craters okay like you see him you see how like from a distance you can't see them but then up close you could see them that's like the biggest insecurity I have right now is my acne on my forehead because they're not like pimples so I can't like pop them you know like they're not pimples but there's just like a bunch of like little bumps and I've never had that problem I've seen other like high schoolers I went to school with who have that problem and I remember always thinking like haha I don't have that problem and like all my friends would be like you guys and now look at me now look at me now I have that problem and I don't know so you know if you don't have acne right now y'all better not be laughing at me cuz watch watch you in a couple years get your fair share of acne and then you'll be like [ __ ] now what do I do and then I bake I bake these [ __ ] edibles that's what the [ __ ] I'm making after set these eyebrows in place because they like to play so I use this brow gel that I've had for a minute by anastasiya and I'm a broke-ass [ __ ] that I've had this sample for like months and you know it's still going strong and your girls still not having to spend that extra coin because she uses the samples alright anyways enough about my brother [ __ ] problems let's get it poppin with that bronzer so I used to always used a typical bronzing brush you know nice and angled no [ __ ] let me give you the biggest tip of your life I think I'm starting to feel the edible now actually okay anyways you get this brush boom this one's like super narrow and skinny I feel like this is I used to use this on my under eyes like that but now I just use my [ __ ] Beauty Blender for that and I use this from my mother [ __ ] Bora I see mother [ __ ] so much I should really watch my language Wow okay no wonder YouTube dis monetizes me um you know you just I think it makes your bronzer look a lot more like snatch'd would be the word like it makes it look like well [ __ ] you got a nice ass face you know you know what I mean I know you do because look at that it looks good you know and I'm putting like zero effort you guys like I'm the worst at doing makeup and I can make myself look dragoness [ __ ] with some makeup like honestly I'm so bad I do makeup but I need way more poppin with it I think so much cuter like look at me my skin my bronzer my cheekbones my eyebrows okay no we need this highlight crackle oh um I usually use I don't know what happened to it I probably dropped it just like I dropped my future now I'm just kidding um just how to drop everything I don't know happen to it I usually use a NYX spray for when I used to do my highlight but I don't know happen to it for like the 20th time how many times do I have to say don't [ __ ] know what happened - it was here like yesterday now I can't find it so I'm using this one it's a little fancier than the typical water supposedly cuz it's like supposed to be rosewater who [ __ ] knows they're probably lying okay anyways I'm using this highlight from this palette I got it as a present so I really I'm not sure what the name of it is or like how much it was cuz you know broke [ __ ] I would never buy myself this it's by lorac it's probably like 40 bucks for like literally the only not trying to roast on the person who got me this cuz I love them so much and I'm so grateful I have this because I owe you see this later but I feel bad cuz literally the highlighter is the only thing I use and this pilot was a good I don't know how much money put it and you know what I don't really like it that much because sometimes when I'm a high ass and I'm going like this to get my highlight I'll literally get the purple you guys cuz it's right next to the highlighter and I'll go on my face and I'll have a fat ass piece of purple and I'm like what and then I'll look down and I'll be like and then I have to do it like all over again and it's just a hassle so yeah I look so cakey right now like you know you went overboard when your skin looks like you need a blended out quick cuz I'd be looking like the Napoleon Express with my [ __ ] highlight like yikes okay I'm just cat oh I was about to say that I baked yes [ __ ] I baked oh my gosh I forget everything but I burped it tasted like we for the one cut this was like almost 50 bucks and I actually bought this myself and I only use this brown shade literally every day on a special occasion you might see me dip into like the Pink's but honestly I only use one color and I hate makeup you guys I hate spending money on makeup I hate doing my makeup the only thing I do like about makeup is the way it looks and I know my name we know actually I have this oh let's use this boom let's use it okay I just bought this this is from Stila oh my gosh this really made me a broke [ __ ] this [ __ ] was like 25 [ __ ] bucks and look at how much it's already gone like can you guys see that hole I just put the eyelash glue on the eyelash just waiting for that to dry for a sec and meanwhile honestly I'm really sad because I really didn't feel that edible so I'm sad I feel like by now I should be filling my [Music] completed makeup look all I'm gonna do only my top lashes because honestly when I play it okay and then the very last thing is of course that apply so I'm boom and then this is the completed makeup look honestly I think this I came out pretty good but I think this I did not so that was me trying to do my pretty good honestly from a distance it doesn't look too shabby you guys just gonna slap on that liquidy glossy and boom literally call it a day but don't wait and don't let nobody look too close cuz shoot don't be like [ __ ] is there a [ __ ] party on your eyelids cuz there'd be [ __ ] oh my gosh just don't keep in mind don't use as much glitter as I did and you'll be Gucci are everybody that concludes the end of this video honestly looks so fun I'm so sad that I feel like the edible did it hit me as hard like do I have hi of Tolerance they even eaten a thousand milligram a double I don't get high like what really cuz I fell high for a little bit and then I feel like the highest done like I feel like I'm done with the high like already so that's really weird maybe it was because I did it first thing in the morning so I just have so much energy that I just don't feel the high I don't know you guys doing the makeup I

"OvH7zH5AebE": "what is up everybody my name is beef and on this channel we like to vape and if you guys want to know more about mods e-liquids disposables and you just generally want to know more about the vape industry well this is the channel where you can learn on somebody should go ahead hit the subscribe button to stay informed guys in today's video we're taking a look at the fume in the rainbow skittles flavor so this review is a direct result of this comment right there so thanks for that subscriber to put me on to the rainbow skittle fumes i was not disappointed so let's go ahead and talk a little bit about it before we get into it all right so it's a disposable which means it's not rechargeable non-refillable there's five percent salt nicotine it's approximately 1500 puffs there's a draw activated firing mechanism which means you put your lips on you poke her up you ready to kiss it make out with it you know kiss the suction that you're creating by putting your lips on is what activates the firing mechanism and when you inhale it does all the work for you there's an integrated 850 milliamp hour battery there's five mil of juice per device with all of that being said let's go ahead and give it a vipe see what she does i think this would have been more accurately named if it was named like something after sweet tarts um you do kind of get the fruitiness from it there is a sweetness but there's an underlying tartness that my brain associates with sweet tarts and i just i can't get out of my head this tastes more like a sweet tart to me my girlfriend said it tastes just like sweet tarts to her so if you're expecting like an authentic skittles flavor maybe this isn't the vape for you but it is still really good i would still really recommend it i'm gonna have to give it a hot eight on the beef scale guys if you want to help support the channel even more there is the first link in the description down below is my patreon i have a couple different tiers

my name is Liz and oh I just hit nine thousand subscribers thank you guys so much that is so exciting next stop 1 million let's go anyway so I've had a few requests for doing a hard candy I did have one video there that kind of I did as a quick music video but I'm actually going to do one of my tutorials more in depth to give you more information and I'm also going to show you two different recipes so I'm going to show you one that if oh you only have can of butter to do with can of butter and the other one is if you've got texture how you can now make a really good tasting hard candy alright so as always I'm gonna jump right into our ingredients what we need and then get everything together to make some awesome candy ok so one of the most important things when you're doing candy making a hard candy making is humidity humidity is a huge factor if it is too humid in your home don't bother trying it it is summer in it is too humid don't bother trying unless you have a dehumidifier or air conditioner so I made these the other day and it was a little too humid and that's what's gonna happen is they're gonna come out sticky and tacky and they're just gonna melt together so optimal humidity is 35% however about 45 to 50 absolute maximum 50 is but 45-year okay at sugar alright so for our cannabutter hard candies you are going to need 1 cup of white sugar half a cup of corn syrup 1/2 a cup of water and a quarter cup of peanut butter and a half a teaspoon of soy or the other one sunflower lecithin yes you can use the powder if it is granular you may need to strain it but I believe the powder will work as well so that's what you're gonna need for your can of butter ones now if you are a tincture person you can make candy sugar & Canas syrup from your tincture if you don't already have those made up I do have the videos that show you how to make those so you can make up your your can of sugar and your can of syrup so for your tincture for takes your candy sorry gap there and this is the way the reason why I did this is so that you don't have the taste of alcohol this way the the alcohol has been evaporated off and it gives you a really nice tasting candy versus probably most you just use tinctures straightforward always have a contend with that taste of alcohol this is going to help eliminate that problem altogether so what you are going to need is a half a cup of white sugar regular sugar 1/2 a cup of can of sugar yes you can use one kind one cup of can of sugar I just prefer again for taste to do the half and half you're going to use a quarter cup of kanna syrup and a quarter cup of light corn syrup and a half a cup of water and again whatever flavors that you would like to use and colors to make it again this is gonna come out very green so you may not want that color you may want some other color and again the white for the solid background again more I'll go into detail now the nice thing about using this recipe is that you don't have to use an emulsifier like gore gum we're not trying to stick butter in places that has no business being and trying to make it stick so these are all natural ingredients and that's why I find this recipe works so much better all right so the equipment that you are going to need is first a pot a cold pot of water with ice this is for us to stop the cooking process when our candy reaches temperature you're going to need a small or medium heat transfer it pot non heat transfer and sorry heavy bottom is preferred and non heat transfer is there is no dark spots in the bottom of your pot so that means that there is no spots that get hotter than any other spots you have proper proper heat distribution and your candy isn't going to burn in it's not gonna be hotter in one spot but another you will need a spatula your candy thermometer your candy mold yes I know they're red and my dummies I say don't use red molds for hard candies are perfectly fine but not for gummies or if you're making lollipops there's this type of lollipop mold which is a 3d mold or you've got the flat mold that you can get as well so you're gonna have get those prepared and have those standby on hand and I'm gonna use these that's probably another one you're making hard candies you also want to make sure that your molds are small remember you want it to be in your mouth you don't want to be like you want it to to feel good in your mouth not be oversized and that's about all the recommendation I have for your candy molds we will get started first on the can of butter recipe alright so for our can of butter candies you are going to add your one cup of sugar your a half a cup of corn syrup and your half a cup of water you're gonna stir that until it is combined and your sugar started to dissolve and then we're going to turn our heat on to medium high oops sorry I always forget so you're also going to need a cup of hot water with a pastry brush or a paintbrush to clean these sides of the pot down up for many sugar crust that wants our sugar and water there of kamae gonna turn your heat on to medium high and you're just going to continue to stir it until your syrup begins to boil the moment that it begins to boil we're gonna stop stirring and we're going to attach our candy thermometer and cook our syrup to 300 degrees Fahrenheit and again you always just want to make sure that you wash down any sugar crystals that you see for it on the side of the pot the reason for that is so say your candy doesn't crystallize if you leave sugar crystals there it can cause your candy to crystallize now when you're stirring you always want to make sure to go around the edges of your pot the sugar likes to sit in there so you just want to make sure that none of the sugar is sitting or forming on the sitting and crystallizing they're on the bottom of the pot so you can see our or I hope you can see bubbles just starting to form there around the edge so it's starting to boil at this point I am going to stop stirring and I'm just gonna clean off any sugar off the edges then I'm going to attach my candy thermometer and as I said we are gonna cook this to 300 degrees Fahrenheit the moment we hit 300 degrees we're going to dunk it we're gonna dunk the bottom of the pot into our ice water and at first when it starts to boil its gonna be cooking off any impurities in your water and your sugar so it will bubble up like this for a moment but then in a few moments as soon as those cook off it will settle down and the other thing is the ones that starts with the boiling and you've tossed your thermometer just turn your temperature down to about medium now while your syrup is cooking you just want to get your molds all ready and prepared because once our syrup is ready we need to work fairly quickly and then just to let you know so when you attach your candy thermometer it'll go up pretty quickly and then you'll notice that it's gonna sit in around 220 220 - probably for about 10-12 minutes that's while it's mainly cooking the water off after that the temperature will start to increase and it will start to increase fairly rapidly so you don't want to go too far away from the kitchen right after that point so if you do need to take a quick little break and don't forget you've got about probably 10 minutes of safely way right now all right so I am 300 degrees remove your candy thermometer dunk it in your ice cold water to stop the cooking so we just want to wait for it to stop bubbling there a little bit turn off your heat and there we go you don't want to leave it too long cuz your can't it'll start to solidify on the bottom now I'm going to add in the butter now be very very careful because you are working with molten lava you're going to just start to gently just kind of get that there now if it does if your syrup does start to solidify too much on the bottom just put it back on the burner it's still warm enough to melt that and now we are going to get our lecithin and we are going to add in a half a teaspoon a generous 1/2 teaspoon of our lecithin and you're going to drizzle it all over the top of your syrup and butter and then I'm just gonna move this hold on and now you're gonna gently stir until your syrup and butter starts to combine be very very careful as it starts to combine you want to stir it from the center like this so you're pulling your butter and your syrups from the side and this is going to help to emulsify them and emulsifying is bringing them together bringing your water and your oil together as one one solution is one syrup so my syrup seems to be crystallizing it a little bit here so I'm gonna add in a quarter teaspoon of citric acid all right so once your syrup is all mixed its gonna lighten up like this and it's gonna go solid now you can add in your coloring and your flavoring so I'm gonna do this one tutti-frutti first oops I added a little too much sorry normally I'd in a capful I don't know why I just went all freestyle there and I'm going to add in the white and the white is going to help to give a solid background to him for our color and I'm going to do this one pink all right so I was having a little trouble there for a little bit there I thought this was actually gonna be a flop because my emulsifier might lecithin wasn't coming together fully with my syrup but I persevered and kept stirring and and it did come together that graininess is now gone that I was having there and now getting a nice smooth candy syrup so sometimes you might think it's a fail but keep going that's usually what's the failure probably close to way it will be failing is that it's just not am also fine correctly just not coming together so you just gotta beat it a little bit better I have just added a little more color here and now my syrups getting a little bit thick here as you can see it a little bit thick to work with so I'm just gonna turn my heat on to low just to help melt to keep it melted so I'm just gonna get this color mixed in and just get that melted I said just gonna heat it up a little bit so it's a little more melty melted and I will get this poured into our molds all right so with the butter and the lecithin your syrup is a little is a little thicker then if you were using the other when using the other method so now I'm just gonna pour it into my mold as best as I can it's a little hard off that happens just scoop it off you can clean that up later okay so this syrup I'm sorry is a little too thick to try and put into the sucker mold so I'll actually show you the sucker molds with the other one I'm just gonna fill the regular candy mold with these don't worry too much about it the Mesolithic drips on the side you can easily break those off and clean up your candy afterwards so yeah it's a bit messy sometimes the other syrup you'll see works so much nicer now if you do overflow on those just get a straight edge so straight an offset spatula or a straight edge knife and you can just scrape it off the top like so I just scrape it on my table and clean it up afterwards so that's it for our butter candies now we're gonna let this B's sit I'm gonna finish filling up the molds I'm gonna let them sit until they are completely cooled which it takes about an hour or so ready so for our texture version you're gonna have already have had pre-made up your canna sugar in your can of syrup and so for this recipe or rework what we are going to use the half a cup of Canada sugar 1/2 a cup of regular sugar the quarter cup of can up syrup and our quarter cup of light corn syrup and our half a cup of water our citric acid does not go in until we are done cooking if you put your citric acid in now beforehand you will actually make your syrup too hot and it will burn so just going to combine all our ingredients and then once they're combined I'm going to turn our heat on to medium high until our syrup begins to boil and also make sure to go all the way around the edges of your pot to make sure to get all that hiding sugar now you're gonna find the difference if you tried between the two recipes this one is so much easier to work with so I turn my heat onto there medium-high I'm going to continue stirring until our syrup begins to boil and I am going to wash down the any of the sugar crystals here that a-port got onto the side of the pot now that your syrup has started boiling you're gonna stop stirring you're gonna touch your candy thermometer and I also recommend to get the fan going just because you are cooking even though you're using the dehydrated sugar in the hut there could still be some alcohol left over and that can cause you just want to have it ventilated now if your syrup starts to bubble up this too high and you're getting a little worried there just pick it up off the heat turn your heat down to medium and place it back down and you are going to let this cook now until your syrup hits 300 degrees the only thing that you're gonna do here like I said you're not going to stir anymore only thing you'll do is if you see any sugar crystals or anything formed on the sides just clean that up and as your syrup gets close to temperature don't forget to grab your pot of ice water all right so I'm almost a temperature I've got my pot of ice water ready let's stop hitting the camera and 300 remove your candy thermometer carefully put it in your sink and then drop your pot bottom into the ice water until it the bubbles start coming down and also turn off your heat okay so I'm starting fires here all right so we've got our syrup here and now I'm going to add in our flavoring so I'm gonna do a peach mango tropical punch thingy here so I'm going to do a half a cup a half a capful of each flavor sorry a capful I lied sorry the jiggling of the camera it's a little hard to work off now in some candy hard candy recipes they'll tell you to put that the your flavoring in right away you don't want to do that I can see how that's vaping up there that's your flavor actually burning off so when you see that huge vape of smoke that's all your flavor burning off okay so those are my flavors it's gonna get them stirred in there a little bit now for the color now if I just have if I'm just gonna add in yellow I'm gonna show you what that will look like rocks I'm gonna use peach and you can use the liquid gel or the gel these gels the Wilton gels either one doesn't matter okay not quite that much so I don't use the white and I just use the peach on its own you have a translucent color but it's not very pretty you don't put some on the paper here so you can see it's not the prettiest of colors horrible but if you add the white in it gives you a solid background and it makes your the color the primary color that you want standout is the actual color and so you can see also this syrup was a lot easier to work with stays much thinner and the same thing though if it starts to solidify a little bit on the bottom there just put it onto your burner it's still warm enough it's still warming up and it'll just get that all melted in so I'm just going to finish stirring that up there and I'm going to get the get this ready to pour into the molds so once your syrup is all nicely one color one uniform texture we can get ready to pour it into the mold see that works a lot better and if you're doing these lollipop molds you want to bring them up right to the right to their edges if you don't then when you put them together you'll find that you'll end up with gaps oops not that much then to put small together just flip her over make sure that you do it on the right side put it together and squish her down and then you're just gonna make sure that it's all well pushed down and some firm I'm gonna fill up our little our little molds here and that's it you're just gonna get these filled up and let them harden up and then we'll get them out of the molds yes he's so much easier to work with alright now that our candies are cooled we can take them out of the malls so our first one with our butter the ones that were kind of messy and yucky and trying to get them into the mold just work them out and then with a pair of kitchen scissors you can always just cut around the excess and it'll just come off and then you can just save that you can also put it all any excess you could also put it back into a pot melt it down if do it in a double boiler and or just put it over low heat but be very careful and you can remount it and then recast him again now what I would probably recommend is with the butter one as I said you saw kind of how difficult it was getting in the molds is to just lay it out onto a pan and score it make score lines in it so they can break it easily you can kind of see have a look at that I did it in the cough drop video and then and then here were my the cans syrup and the can of sugar ones the same think there's any extra edges and these two edges you can just easily just snip them off they come off really easily now let's have a look at our suckers so far so good there's still a little bit warm same thing though just cut off any excess around the edges like so and also top them off there you have it two different versions of hard candies and lollipops so odds obvious if you have it as always not as obvious I apologize as always if you have any questions at all don't hesitate to put them in the comments then I will be back to say goodbye in just a moment oh sorry one thing I forgot to tell you if your place is your good through the humidity's good oops you can just store your candies and just put them into a glass jar or into a candy dish good to go if there is any humidity or you find that they're sticky at all you can toss them in powdered sugar or icing sugar and again store them in a glass jar or airtight container the icing sugar will help them from sticking together so I hope that helps you out so guys

Colorado I brought back some edibles that I could share with you so you can understand what each one of these products does and what's the best way to dos with these particular items this particular company Chiba chews is one that's extremely well known in the marketplace they produce edibles now for a number of years in the state of Colorado this particular product like the one I'm holding is a taffy and they make three different kinds and multiple strengths the kinds are indica sativa or hybrid they also have a CBD only edible which is an excellent anti-inflammatory for people that are treating with a variety of different pain the only thing I would say about about chiba chews is this particular product i'm familiar with for several years and a couple of years ago they changed the blister packs in terms of how you consume them i have to tell you and if the folks achieve its use are listening these blister packs are extremely difficult to get open and i've had a couple of people who have provided these to come back and tell me that and you just try it yourself and you'll see but once you open them the product is very very good and why is it good it's good because it's predictable that's what you need in edibles the ability to understand how this particular product is going to affect you over time the other product that is especially popular are gummy bears every time I go to Colorado people asked me about gummy bears and so Shiva choose produces their own product of gummy bears called Green Hornet they come in to individualized packages here and trust me one gummy bear for your average consumer is enough for anyone I really like the gummy bears because they're easy to slip in your pocket or you can put them in a car or I keep them at various places in the event I have a migraine which is sometimes what I use medical marijuana for edibles are really really good just have to be understood that you want to use them cautiously because it's very simple and it's very common for people to use too much to eat too many edibles and then to spend the next couple of hours laying on the couch with a pillow over your head so just be careful with edibles but if you are gonna get edibles I would strongly recommend that sheave it's used and I know you'll love the gummy bears we're gonna continue to write and report about fantastic products on the marketplace at News munchies follow us on Instagram or we'll see you on Facebook be well [Music]", "F6hl6Z8-5UE": "and as soon as I said that Jeff's phase change from happy magical to extremely concerned he was like on no I told you not to eat more than half bro have have you ever had magic before I'm like no but I don't see why you're trippin I hate the whole brownie like 20 minutes ago and I still don't feel anything and right after seeing that I hear yo somebody need to get me a doctor man somebody help me man yo Davey to the nurse dawg so if by now I have been completely and thoroughly shatters the illusion that I was the angel ik horrific kid that my parents believed I was back in the day this uh this video will surely fix it so this takes place back in high school back in Georgia to Jamaica Jamaica yeah man I was about 14 years old so one morning I get to school and I'm just chilling in my home classroom before the first school bell rings were one of my boys who will call Jeff comes up to me with a big smile on his face he's like yo Don how much lunch money you got today man so automatically I'm like god damn boy I just got a school man why is you begging me for money already dog can't I'll live he's like Don chill just just tell me how much lunch one you got man so I'm like 500 this is Jamaican dollars of course and at a time $300 was a reasonable amount for a day's worth of lunch money but my mama loved me a little bit extra so you know she'd often give me 500 just for context back then I 100 Jamaican dollars was equal to like one American dollar so I told him how much money I got and then he is like cool cool okay okay you should go half with me on a brown so I'm like brownie what brownies is there like a bake sale going on or something just like done no bro I'm talking about Leroy's and brownies dogs so I'm like oh snap Leroy that big dark-skinned dude I'm good I know Leroy he looks like the kind of guy that would scratch himself and then put his hand back in the batter without washing his hands I think I'm gonna have to take a hard pass on that one and Jeff was like done you know about these brownies huh I'm like what about them then Jeff's eyes lit up in that special way that people's eyes light up when they know a secret that you don't you leans in and whispers God these are magic brownies I look at Jeff and I'm like you're kidding he doesn't even say anything just stood there smiling I gave Jeff all of my lunch money you see by this time a lot of dudes in our grade were experimenting with magic but they were only using magic inhalers and that didn't really appeal to me but I was still curious about magic so when Jeff told me about the magic brownies I was like that sounds lazy so yeah I was like sign me up so Jeff takes my money in dips ow 10 minutes later he comes back to me enhance me my brownie wrapped up in foil paper he tells me that I should wait on till lunchtime to eat it and that I should only eat half so I'm like cool I got it I was pumped I couldn't wait till lunch fast forward to lunchtime and everybody has brownies like Leroy Maybank that day man so I'll find Jeff and I'm sitting with him and a group of friends and then we all ate our brownies so we're sitting there in 15 minutes or so passes and I'm not not really feeling anything also lunch was gonna end in less than 30 minutes so I started to get a little impatient on top of that I spent all my lunch money on this dang brownie tomorrow was Heike hungry I didn't have anything else to eat so I hate the rest of the brownie the whole thing I eat the whole thing I even lick the icing off the foil paper man so I'm sitting there and then Jeff comes over to me and he's like yo dumb and how you feeling bro and then I'm like hungry man and a little disappointed I had to hold brownie still pretty hungry and I really feeling any magic as soon as I said that Jeff's face changed from happy and magical to extremely concerned he was like on no I told you not to eat more than half bro have have you ever had magic before I'm like no but I don't see why you're trippin I had no whole brownie like 20 minutes ago and I still don't feel anything and right after seeing that I hear somebody need to get me a doctor man somebody help me man yo take me to the nurse dawg I look over to where the noise was coming from and I see this dude let's call him Amar'e screaming and running across the schoolyard then he gets tackled by some of the other students they bring him over and my man's is tripping hard he was sweating mumbling gibberish trying to take off his shirt just completely losing it so I'm like yo what happened to him and then one of his friends was like man that boy had a whole brownie dog I guess Leroy made this batch extra strong made this batch extra strong I'm instantly begin to panic I mean I was going to die and certainly I was I was going to die obviously here's why Amar'e was one of those dudes that was known to take part in the use of magic inhalers after school so you understand what I'm saying this this guy was an experienced magic user he was an experienced magic user and was still going insane I on the other hand have never used magic and I ate the exact same amount of brownie as he did I was so there I am just panicking internally awaiting my certain death I was sweating profusely I look sick just from the worry and anxiety then Jeff comes over to me and is like yo Don how you feelin man then I was like oh no bro I still don't feel anything too crazy man and it was like as soon as I said that BAM give me and here's the thing when it comes to eating management unlike inhaling it when you eat it he doesn't gradually come on to you one you're fine just chilling and then out of nowhere it's like a magical fairy comes over to you and bashes you over the head with her magic bit sending you straight into lala land I was on it was so bad that I ended up skipping all my classes after lunch there were three distinct feelings that I remember from being under magic spell the first was that time was moving in slow motion and I don't just mean my sense of time which did happen the last 10 minutes of lunch felt like an hour but I mean visually the best way I can describe it is like a visual echo for example let's say someone wave their hand in front of my face it was like their hand left a trail of hands as it moved along its path it completely tripped me out the second feeling was that my sense of touch became hyperstimulated I remember just sitting on the floor in complete agony because the wrinkles in my uniform hurt when my skin rubbed over there like I would rest my arm on my pants and the bulges in the fabric fell as if they were trying to pierce through my skin absolutely awful the last feeling was severe anxiety I can honestly say that this was the first time in my life where I experienced a real traumatic panic attack I was so worried about what you ask I remember in particular I was dreading that my mom was going to pick me up from school and see that I used magic and then kill me so for like the four hours between lunch and when I was supposed to get picked up from school I just sat on the floor Hannah can that my mom was gonna be just so disappointed and angry with me but here's the thing my mom never picked me up from school and I mean never she has a nine-to-five job she's a manager at Bank she's never picked me up from school but for some reason I was convinced that she was coming to get me and when she did she was going to murder me in front of all of my friends but of course instead a taxicab pick me up the same taxicab that had been picking me up every day from school for the prior three years so when I say that it made no sense that I was convinced that my mom was gonna pick me up I mean I have absolutely no idea I thought that but that's what you'd imagine community especially when you eat it at 14 years old so I get home and I immediately just went a bit I slept for like four hours got up and then proceeded to eat all the food in the house all of it like everyone's dinner that my aunt had cooked that afternoon and put in the fridge like four plates of food my G I ate all of it and then went back to sleep moral of the story kids don't do magic man it's a powerful stuff big shout out to the best squad on the internet

dispensary and sorry for the view change here we're doing some rearranging here in weeks HQ and things should look back to normal again pretty soon so what are we talking about today guys we are talking about another edible and we are talking about our third product from the folks at Chiba choose this time we have picked up their strongest product they make to see if it's gonna do us the business or not so this is Chiba choose deca dose extra strength 175 milligrams it's about as good as you can get for Chiba choo and I'm kind of excited I never really I've tried to cheap and choose in the past both hundred milligrams found them a little wanting they were okay both of them they just weren't as good as other hundred milligrams and there they were kind of expensive for what they were however this 175 milligram cost me 20 bucks which is a little expensive but not too much more expensive than say a hundred eighty milligram chocalate bar or whatever but this is obviously less substantial than that from what I understand she Batu's is one of the more popular edibles I think they exist not only here in California but they're also in Colorado Washington there are hugely popular brand and they've been around for a very long time so they probably have a lot of brand recognition which is why they're probably so popular so as I said this is the 175 milligram version I like the back here it's got all the stuff you want to see it's actually got the lab testing batch it's got the nutrition information the ingredients all that fun stuff always happy to see it on any packaging that's available out there alright guys so let's go ahead and tear this open and see how this tastes if I remember correctly last Chiba 2 I had was a hundred milligram ER and it was not very good tasting so I'm a little afraid that this one might also be a bit delicious if I could even open it well guys that's something to keep an eye out for it is this packaging is it does have little tear slits but done they don't really work and that'll do it will just rip it to pieces okay so we have gotten our 175 milligrams chocolate taffy out and that is crazy to believe that's a hundred and seventy five milligrams of THC right there it smells terrible it smells like chocolate and bitterness oh here we go this is the hundred and seventy-five milligram Chiba choose deca dose extra-strength chocolate taffy Oh Oh God oh my god Oh oh good I wish I had some water on me Oh whoo well after Jason oh holy [ __ ] wow that is up there with the kirova salted-caramel blondie or the enjoy goldfish in terms of the worst-tasting animals I'm a rat that was disgusting I knew it was repulsive oh it was a tiny little package and it does have me optimistic though that that a tiny little package producing that much of it tongue twisting tongue turning vile taste result might actually be as potent as advertised so on taste you don't get much worse than Sheba choose extra-strength deca dose but we'll see about the potency and for that guys I'm gonna come back to you in two hours as I do with all our reviews or for you just wait a couple of seconds and we'll catch you right after the break thanks for sticking around see you soon the BAM we're back guys it's been two hours since I had Chiba choose deca dose extra strength 175 milligrams and it's definitely more potent than a normal Chiba chew but it's not quite as good as say a kiva bar or the Jose or a 4:20 bar I did not find it to be as good as that I am pleasantly hi ants in like a 6 but not where I hoped to do it been especially for how bad it tasted oh my god it is awful tasting guys it is who it is Dukey licious [Music] but it is a very small little thing and I always say I love small potent edibles and it's small and reasonably potent so that's a win in its category however I think this one costs roughly double what a normal Chiba chew costs and I'm not sure it's I feel twice as high as and almost you at you maybe it's hard to say I don't think it charts linearly you know I find what I'm saying highs higher high as in a linear relationship it's uh it's exponential maybe I don't know actually I don't know what the what the shape of the curve of a high is boy um this is not chiba choose that's making me talk like this this is exhaustion i have been up for i was looking at my watch which i dont even fun yeah I've been up for 25 hours right now so that's part of the reason I'm acting a little crazy but I am looking forward to this Chiba choose ability to hopefully let me get some a salamba because that is where I am headed to next to fairyland dreamland yeah if not fairyland dreamland boy oh boy if I had it and if I ever edited these that would this would be quite a job but I'm not going to so I'm sorry you guys alright guys but before I go and maybe cuz I'm just feeling tired and making you know being tired makes you feel a little pessimistic I want to share with you guys my cherry on top which is a terrible way of pitching that idea let me tell you something's gonna you feel awful no I want to share with you something might my cherry on top which is sort of how I should have started saying this something that I love to watch or do or read or see or whatever the case may be that is unrelated to weed that I want to share with you guys just a little something extra that I can tack on these reviews that hopefully you guys will enjoy and this review I want to share with you and this is why I said it's gonna be a downer this is why I said being tired might have influenced this but I saw in the bookshelf and I it's it's phenomenal it's it's another it's another game changer it's another one that will shift your thinking and thinking and that is the sixth extinction by Elizabeth Kolbert not Colbert but Cole Burke I think it is a book about mass extinctions and how there have been five mass extinctions throughout life's history on earth five times where what life was nearly wiped out and evidence suggests we are currently in the sixth one of those it's really good and and really well-written and and just a gripping read and it's short to like 250 pages so get on it guys I normally I'm not that forceful and I'm not that forceful about this one but if you if it sounds interesting oh my god I've been going on for four minutes and 15 seconds sorry but that does sound interesting yeah give it a shot I think you guys think you're gonna enjoy it it is pessimistic however I don't know if there's I can't remember if there's any optimism if there's any light in that book what am I talking about oh I am looking forward to some sleep hopefully provided brought to you by wherever the G Batu's wrapper is all right guys I am so sorry it took so long to spit all that [ __ ] out to anybody who's out there still listening thank you so much you're really kind for making the end of this one I not even I want to make it to the end of this one and I'm the one speaking have a wonderful day guys we'll check you out on the next review thanks so much for watching weeds we'll see peace", "gS33fXqIBqU": "now this next question can revert to smoking or any type of drug but when someone gets high not every high as a good high sometimes there are bad highs have you ever experienced a horror high story of that experience while you were high that was a great question because I have went to LA once again LA is deaf went out there on a shoot me and my man cooling hit the plug for you know me a little widow and oh you know he hitting us with the edibles in the note of the lemonade and all that he liked easy online trainings popping these little gummy bears and all he like bro man is this let me do what I do you feel me going crazy bro that probably was the worst thing I could have ever done in my life that I was and then you keep going high so you keep going high and high and high and you like are you even gonna come down my home he was in the whip with me doing the same thing Costra phobic hopped out the car took his shirt yo I can't do it man I'm like damn we lost one but overall like after hours and hours and hours on in the high starts to settle but when you get that high I didn't think you could get that high but when you get that high it's like literally like an out-of-body kind of experience man never again those smalls no edibles for me when it comes to edibles people have to understand somebody watching this they have to know how much they can take of that in one sitting for their body mm-hmm and not every person could take the same amount food acts and for somebody doing it the first time the stuff that the edible is mixed with tastes so good that you're not thinking about it it may just be like okay if you're having a cereal bar now it's laced with some sort of medicinal it's just going to taste like a cereal bar you know till it kicks in and if you took too much you experience what you experienced and they keep the and see the thing too small is it kicks in about two three hours later but it you don't pop some after that it just keep cuz this in your bloodstream your dick so once you start floating you know Casper five you know you're like man when I'm not coming down so it could be a little scary sometimes you dick and it's a high that has no turn off switch so you hear and you ain't coming down to lick your body really just thought yeah I'm saying you can actually some people think they can sleep it off sometimes that high can be so serious that you can wake up and you're still high now when it comes to being high and the munchies are in play that's when you get a craving for something to eat while you're under the influence whether you can have it at that point or not what's at the top of your list is there some some wigs what up though may I need to hit me you know I'm plugging y'all land on as small as tip you feel me but Twix man I got a had a tweak a Twix in the Gatorade I'm Gucci I don't your guy eat nothing knows is it a certain flavor carry yeah I love the UM the purple joy I don't know what flavor that is great so I'm like that but it's incredible I like that you", "wDEe9C5786s": "[Music] you show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking our fourth look third look at a syrup lien that is I think the kids are calling it lien these days which i think is a take-off of when you used to do scissor with codeine in it this is not codeine this is just weed just good old-fashioned THC straight from the earth the good stuff none of that none of those opiates or opioids or anything to get you addicted so this is a pro methylene liquid syrup two fluid ounces watermelon flavored and it proclaims to be 600 milligrams of indica THC I guess they're saying it has 1200 milligrams of syrup total and half of it is indica of course we're gonna be doing the entire bottle 600 milligrams is a dot I'm not gonna do 600 milligrams right from the get-go although I'm pretty sure this might be another scam so I picked this up very cheaply I think it was 35 bucks for a 600 milligram syrup which is a very good deal if in fact is true but let's take a look at this bottle and just see what kind of red red flags just sort of pop off look how cheap it looks just a gross little cheap sticker poured out on there you can barely read what is you know what's on there because the printing is pretty awful shake well every use it's very muddy muddy is the adjective they use fair enough in THC We Trust so again this little bottle it proclaims that 600 milligrams hc' but I am skeptical because of the price because of the size because of the packaging all of that leads me to believe that this might actually be a another scam but I am certainly hoping to get quite high off of it and I realize I probably should have brought something to drink with me in case this thing tastes truly wretched which it might very well so let's go ahead and take a look at this Pro methylene liquid syrup let's shake it very well because it's muddy now it suggests that for a beginner to do half a teaspoon it says for an expert to do 2 to 3 teaspoons or 4 Club meanies whatever the hell that means 4 to 7 teaspoons which is what we're gonna be doing I have no idea what Club MIM is is maybe you guys can help me figure that out come on let's focus camera there it is 4 to 7 teaspoons tablespoons rather Club em I am eyes II don't know all right so our muddy stuff is shooken oh it smells really bad and it looks really gross look at the top there ah oh it is muddy as they said it is muddy well maybe I should go get something to mix it with [ __ ] it here we go 3 2 1 down the hatch see how much we can get down ooh ooh we got a lot of it down we got most of it there yak it's actually not super super gross it's not good tasting by any stretch but I'm gonna finish it off I'm gonna give my second self a second to let that percolate through my stomach and then I will be back to you guys like all of our reviews I'm coming back to you guys in two hours to let you know how this promy Faline what a dumb name is actually hitting because that's the most important part of this edible review you don't really care how it tastes because you're gonna CAC it down no matter what it does if it gets you high so we'll find out soon guys I will see you in just a bit thanks for watching wheats see you soon welcome back to wheats guys it has been two hours since I had the pro me feeling whatever it's called I don't need to say their name anymore because I don't need to give them any advertising it is a bunch of gar [ __ ] 600 milligrams my booty look at those eyeballs white as the winters snow I fell feel roughly infinity more times hi doing a cannabis 100 milligram syrup than that six hundred milligram syrup from Pro methylene and my buddy squids here to join us hey squiddy so yeah do not give them any money just like I thought it was a total total scam an absolute trying to fleece you for your money there's nothing in there it tasted terrible at the bottom because there was a lot of like ground-up plant matter or whatever in there it was disgusting I don't know what it was probably wasn't actually weeds I certainly don't feel hi disgusting I at the very bottom tasting does didn't get me high at all an absolute it's like I took $35 and lit it on fire an absolute travesty of a product do not buy it if you see it at a dispensary tell them not to carry it because they're just doing their customers a disservice by carrying this [ __ ] that is Pro methylene I think I'm not going to look again because I don't want to if I have it wrong great they don't need the they don't need the endorsement they don't need the free advertising but I wanted to share with you some little message of positivity something something something to look forward to so I even though normally in these quick short bad reviews they don't come with the cherry on top this time I think I'm gonna go with a give you guys a little cherry on top a little something that you can take with you uh something to enjoy over the next week or so just that can be enjoyed with or without weed something that will just bring a little bit of a joy or a smile to your face so on this cherry on top I want to just recommend a youtube channel that I like quite a bit and that is PBS is eons PBS's eons PBS has a bunch of really great like science channels that all range from about seven to fifteen minute videos and all kinds of different topics Aeons is a great one talking a mixture between geology archaeology paleontology and a bunch of other cool subjects and topics all sort of rolled into one giant eon uh I think that's that's right alright so yeah check that out PBS is eons ye ons and just search for that on YouTube you'll find it it's a great thing to watch well hi just let the videos rule and and learn some cool stuff and that guys is gonna do it for this cherry on top and that's gonna do it for this review here on wheats sorry it was such a shitty one we've had a real run of losers in a row here but good things ahead I'm so guys thank you so much for watching weeds and we will see you on the next review peace", "bQ7XcdwVTe8": "hello all city candy fans welcome back i'm nicole and today we are going to be trying the sour frunias so right away looking a look at it well here's the packaging it instantly reminds me of a now and later so it's just a little different version but this is a sour one we're gonna give it a try so as we pop it open take a look it's got a nice blue color to it this is perfect if you got like birthday parties or like even like gender reveals this will add a little fun to it and it's a nice light blue color perfect for that baby theme and it's got a little flecks in there you can take a look and see and if you like sour we're gonna go ahead and give this a shot oh it's very good it's actually very soft so you know how noun layers they start off hard and then get softer as you go this is soft very instantly and i actually personally like that the flavor is instant the sour is there but if you're afraid of it being overpowering don't worry it's just a little bit of a kick and it's very nice if you want to try one of these today you can come in store visit us or you can buy it online at allcitycandy.com", "X4O60iQXJho": "[Music] 500 milligram lead cereal bars for 12 bucks 300 milligrams of bags of chips for 10 400 milligram breakfast cereals we breakfast cereals for $11 and not only that but all the products are pretty tasty too this is just a small sampling of the great value you can expect from lol edibles and nearly ubiquitous edible manufacturer here in Southern California sounds too good to be true right well that's because it is welcome to wheats everyone the marijuana edible review show where we do our damndest to help you make sense of your dispensary this is a show where we try to save you from throwing away your hard-earned money on dud ass edibles and speaking of gun ass edibles today we're going to take a deeper look at LOL edibles where LOL presumably stands for lies on lies we have reviewed a variety of LOL products on wheats and so far have found them to be all greatly exaggerating their potency LOL edibles conveniently does not have an independent tasting testing laboratory rate their product or if they do they do not display it anywhere on their products packaging or on its the website without an independent testing body there are seemingly free to make up whatever dosage they want to put on their packaging and while I certainly cannot prove at this time they are exaggerating their potency my extensive experience with high potency edibles leads me to believe that they are full of [ __ ] so one of the cardinal rules of edibles is you get what you pay for with a few exceptions and we pay $10 for an edible that claims to have 400 milligrams of THC unless you see that independent laboratory verifying those results I would be pretty skeptical of that claim and lol edibles is the king of these shitty shenanigans an another tip-off that they may be less than honest is the taste of their products they usually print is pretty great but a 500 milligram edible should taste at least a little terrible these don't why well most likely because they're lying about how much THC is actually in the product let's compare them to say a 500 milligram kuroh an\u00edbal the kirova product will likely cost and double the lol edible or more and it will taste far Wars and while this might sound weird to say that's very much a good thing two hours after eating an lol a 500 milligram lol edible I'm stone-cold sober like a lifetime lifetime teetotaler but two hours after a 500 milligram Korova edible and I'm [ __ ] over the moon and probably under my covers passed out asleep so let's go back and talk about their website again it's [ __ ] laughable and that's four tabs products about contact and order there order tab seems to it seemed seems to be in good working condition which makes sense because I see this [ __ ] everywhere everything else on their website though god damn what a [ __ ] show the products tab only Keynes contains a small sliver of their products and the pictures look like they were taken on a crusty iphone 3gs by some bored seven-year-old the contact tab of course doesn't do a goddamn thing it's a completely dead link no way to contact them on their contact me tab my guess never worked they don't really want you to contact them they know you're pissed at them why don't they want to hear from you and actually if you really really really do want to get ahold of them just look at the bottom of their page and there's a link to their email and Instagram so you can contact them there psyche those are dead links too they just want you to think that they're able to be contacted but they don't really want you to know they're your feedback because they know they [ __ ] you they know that they're lying to you and they know that you're pissed they don't want to hear from you and finally let's talk about that about page that shows up on their website here's what it says on I quote the medical cannabis industry needed a well respected brand of edibles that patients can rely on for quality and reliability while tasting great lol edibles aims to take the industry by storm by providing great customer service and amazing products you can find LOL edibles throughout the Los Angeles Orange County and San Diego regions at fine reputable medical dispensaries ask your dispensary for LOL edibles today what a load of [ __ ] horseshit let's take that sentence-by-sentence here so I agree that the medical cannabis industry needs a well respected brand but lol edibles sure as [ __ ] ain't it they have the audacity to say that patients can rely on their quality and reliability they also brag about their customer service you know the one you can't actually reach out to or get in contact with them in any way shape or form so guys ask your dispensary the opposite ask them to stop selling these products tell them they are inadvertently ripping off their customers or maybe intentionally ripping off their customers I don't know the only true thing about that sentence or excuse me about that about page is that you can find them throughout LA and Orange counties as unfortunate as that is so I've tried the majority of the Ella Buhl's products but not all I will confess I've never tried their boob cubes or G bars but you know what at this point I never will and I don't care if they're actually good these guys have taken enough money from the pocket of consumers wheats will never review any of their products again their name is lol edibles but the only one are laughs the only ones laughing are them and they're laughing all the way to the bank let me just be totally here to click totally totally clear here to wrap up do not buy any lol edibles products do not let your friends buy their [ __ ] tell your dispensary not to carry this [ __ ] garbage leave

bear recipes the DIY how to out there that you will find videos or in text are gonna tell you basically to make jello jigglers it's not the same thing as gummy bears but I'm gonna give you some tips and tricks on how to make real gummy bears not just jello so stay tuned and now but I'm the one that has the culinary arts degree and does most of the baking and cooking in the kitchen anyway this is going to be a bit of a review and how-to video all in one I was given a free sample of this here bear mould and it is silicone it's machine washable and it makes 50 little gummy bears now it really only contains like for retail spoons with of liquid when I measured it out that's if you're just pouring water in there but we all realize you'll definitely need a recipe that has more than three tablespoons cuz trust me I tried to do like a micro recipe and it didn't get me very far but so far I really do love this mold I haven't had a spray it I haven't had any problems they just come right out so there's two main camps of homemade gummy bears there are people that are just making their own for the fun of it and they're gonna be using jell-o unflavored gelatin water then there's a camp that is usually doing it for the health benefit so they might have some kind of eye they will probably have juice and honey and unflavored gelatin most likely beef gelatin which is higher quality more health things to it so I that's what I'm trying for I don't have a special gelatin but I did try to do this with juice and honey and a couple of failed batches with double die vitamins but we'll get into that so this mold actually came with a pdf recipe book I really didn't find it very helpful but you can look around and find different recipes kind of experiment with what you like especially if you're doing a juice phase to go me what kind of juices do you like they do say to frown away from pineapple because the enzymes in it do not work well with gelatin just a heads up let me show you how I went about making some gummy bears myself so this is the ingredient list off of your store-bought gummy bears and you'll see here you know there's sugars there's gelatin but there are some extra waxes and that I just don't have in my kitchen I don't know about you but I'm going to give you two big tips on how to make this as close to legit gummy bears as possible less like just jigglers the recipe I have makes about 80 to 90 gummy bears and it calls for 1/3 cup of juice so I used some orange juice and lemon juice to top up that last little bit but it's primarily orange cuz that's my favorite and then it calls for two tablespoons of honey and 2 tablespoons of unflavored gelatin I did try grinding up some multivitamins it was foul and profusely disgusting so I haven't mastered that yet I'm going to show you how to do it without the vitamins take your juices and honey mix them together and then gently sprinkle your gelatin the unflavored gelatin on top and wait several minutes it'll kind of soak up like you see here and that's called blooming you don't want to add it directly into hot liquid or you'll have problems then I just slowly warm it up in a pan I'm warming up a larger pan to the side and then tip number one is boiling you are making a candy so with taffy with that sort of thing you have to boil the sugar and water to get basically a soft ball to get to the right consistency there at texture so since this is a really small batch I only did it for a couple minutes I was afraid of burning I think the consistency could have been nicer if I had done it longer but I was great so you can kind of experiment with how long you let it boil next I keep my smaller pot in side of that larger pot and just let them sit there with the spoon and dropper that they give you just so that they stay warm so they don't start setting that because then it becomes a real mess this little dropper that they give you with this set is awesome and yeah just fill them up one by one no big secret there try to fill them up as big as possible because they do shrink a little bit as you'll notice there are some bubbles you can try to skim off that before you put them in but I like them and then I put them in the fridge for just a few minutes or even the freezer and they pop right out didn't need to coat that with any oil or anything so here's the mold and I will say tip number one is to make sure and boil your sugar tip number two is to let your gummy bears sit let them dehydrate a little because in the factories where they make them they actually do put them in a drying room for a couple of days and so letting out a little bit more of that moisture should help them have a little bit more of a chewy consistency than just thick jello and here's the final product next to a Haribo Haribo gummy bear so it's a little smaller slightly different design but I like it I think it's adorable and I think it's tasty I hope that the video was helpful for you here are some of my orange lemon honey gummy bears you know they're not 100% like this stuff at the store I know they're gonna be healthier and they're cute and I still taste good so I'm gonna enjoy these snacks and if you don't want to take the time and effort for gummies even though these are awesome that you can make your own healthy version or custom flavors and colors if you don't want to do that you can also use this mold for chocolate bears make a little bag for your sweetheart for your kids throw it in their lunch a little bag of gummy or chocolate bears that says I love you very much I'm cheesy like that I would totally do that so all in all I definitely give this mold a 5 out of 5 recommendation I don't have any problems with it I really like it I love that it came with the dropper to help fill it up and if you follow my tips I think things should go smoothly let me know down in the comments below if you enjoyed this video what you think if you've had any problems or if you try

matter but i'm just trying to give you guys as much detail as i [ __ ] can um it doesn't say how much [ __ ] thc is per little little um little gummy or whatever the [ __ ] you want to call it but it

all that happy um [Music] you know what they taste like or this one or basically all them they taste like those one [ __ ] long sour ropes with like different colors and [ __ ] like blue it's not like different ropes that are different colors but they're like a [ __ ] rainbow i don't know what the [ __ ] they're called but it tastes like that little sour ropes one two three four five six seven eight i just ate half of these [ __ ] it's still earliest oh no it's early we'll take a shower right now um hopefully you should snack we're gonna see if they make me feel different um or if they don't i'ma just be honest i have no [ __ ] hate against any company if it doesn't smack then it just didn't smack this it's not saying that they don't have any anything that [ __ ] smacks but i'm gonna just let you guys know if it just didn't hit me or or what's up i'm not gonna lie to you guys either all right we got two left that's all of them i enjoyed myself eating them for five the taste i gotta give it a 10 out of ten honestly i give some [ __ ] ratings on here i can say i'm not attending [ __ ] but my [ __ ] opinion doesn't [ __ ] matter speak from your own experiences and just try them honestly what i'm trying to do is like see if like if you guys seen these in a local dispensary if you guys are thinking of trying them but you guys wanted to see someone's review first that's all i'm trying to do you know um i'm not telling you to try them i'm not telling you to go out and buy them right now i just want to give you guys more insight on these [ __ ] or if you guys ever like haven't heard of them and then you see this video and then you guys [ __ ] find out about them or find them and you're like oh [ __ ] they actually [ __ ] smack i want to try um that's all i wanted to do or um get out of this video my [ __ ] ratings don't mean [ __ ] everyone has their own [ __ ] ratings um but it's currently uh like 10 10 40 now or 10 yeah i think it's 10 40 because when i started recording it was like 10 35 and it's been like eight minutes so it's like 10 40 um i'll pick up the camera like around 11 50 or some [ __ ] or an hour from now and just let you guys know how i [ __ ] feel so hour by hour i'm going to be updating you guys um i don't know if it doesn't smack within like usually i get smacked within like the first hour two hours um but who knows the [ __ ] sour patch edibles took like four hours before they actually [ __ ] hit me and [ __ ] um so we're just gonna go with the flow and see what's up see if these are actually 500 milligrams or what's up but all right guys i'll pick up the camera later alright guys i currently just got out of the shower um you guys can see um dude i got a comment one time someone said that my [ __ ] perm looks goofy um it's not a perm i have natural curly hair it's just that sometimes it should just be looking goofy as [ __ ] because i have some thick ass [ __ ] girls and my hair just gets dried out sometimes um but i know i don't know i just wanted to mention that [ __ ] someone said i got a permanent [ __ ] it's not perm natural [ __ ] curls um but anyways it's currently like [ __ ] 12 [ __ ] 12 30 i think um i didn't pick it up within the first hour um but i'm just here to [ __ ] let you guys know i i don't know if i [ __ ] feel something or not um i want to wait a little bit more longer give it another hour or so but as of right now i just feel relaxed and i don't know it's just [ __ ] weird i'm not gonna say i'm smack smack but i'm also gonna say like i don't feel a little something it's not drastic but i can't say that i don't feel relaxed and i feel like i'm just chilling you know like i'm just vibing and [ __ ] um like if i had to rate it it's probably like a six six point five right now where i'm at i don't know um i'm feeling something chilling [ __ ] vibing um but i'm just give it another hour or so and see what the [ __ ] happens cuz right now uh i'm not feeling [ __ ] but yeah man we're just gonna [ __ ] let it run and i'll pick up the camera within another hour or so and see what's up i still haven't ate anything so we'll see all right guys as you guys can see i just made um my tea i got a maca and ashwagandha tea mixed with some with two tablespoons of honey um just to get that vitality up and that energy up um but that's just gonna be pretty much it it's currently 115 um 120 or some [ __ ] or some one something um but i i'm gonna rate those edibles on my personal scale 6.5 doesn't mean you shouldn't [ __ ] try them um but honestly i'm not gonna say that i didn't feel anything because i do feel like some haziness in my eyes and usually that's [ __ ] an indicator one like one of the indicators for me that i'm [ __ ] like high and [ __ ] but like i feel hazy in my eyes my eyes feel like low-key kind of [ __ ] heavy but nothing major you know i'm [ __ ] chilling i'm rocking um i would suggest some more if you have a a lower tolerance um and then and if you have a lower tolerance and it may [ __ ] hit you a lot more harder um but it wasn't nothing crazy for me it was just i was just chilling um but it's cool trying out these different [ __ ] like candy um replicated edibles or whatever how however you would wear that um it's just cool to try out like [ __ ] like a wonka bar [ __ ] sour patch [ __ ] flavored ones warheads it's [ __ ] crazy uh mixed with weed that's crazy as [ __ ] that's just dope um but yeah just because i give it a 6.5 doesn't mean you shouldn't try it if you have a lower tolerance or an a [ __ ] tolerance then go for it give them a try they're [ __ ] the taste of them is fired um i'm pretty sure it will [ __ ] smack if i like gave it to my sisters or some [ __ ] um but yeah i'ma just go ahead and end the video here man um if

excited because we are taking another look at flourish the first time we have taken a look at flourish in almost a year we are going to be reviewing their new flavor their hybrid grand-jury n-- gummies so a mixture of tangerine and cranberry really excited about this if you've seen in my florist reviews before these are my favorite gummies hands-down there are no gummies that come even close to the magnificence of flourish I love them love them love them a lot and I hope that this cran Jurina gummy does the trick as well so this is a 300 milligram edible picked it up for the leave $20 at my dispensary so a pretty good deal for a 300 milligram edible and it is for show it is a if it's like any of the other so it's gonna be tasty and it is going to be potent on the back here you got everything you want to see you've got your nutrition information your ingredients all that wonderful stuff there on the back this is a hybrid variety so it doesn't tell us what strain but this is a hybrid strain that they used so let's go ahead and open it up here and take a look at what we got oh it's different than it used to be this is not the way they used to have a package they used to have a package in one thing now there are four individually packaged gummies just like this still in there ziggurat shape let's go ahead and open up this cran doreen hybrid here and give it a taste new smells wonderful smells so good hmm now there is a slight weed taste to this one which I actually encouraged by means that there might be as all of that milligram \u00e4j-- as promised but it still tastes really good good solid fruity flavor like the texture like everything about it mm well flourish hits it out of the park again when it comes to the taste texture packaging all that love the packaging love this little box love it all but the most important part is it still gonna get me high cuz it's been a year who knows if they've changed the formula what the case may be for that guys you're gonna have to wait two hours oh no you're not gonna have to wait two hours I'm gonna have to wait two hours I'm gonna come back to you guys and let you know exactly how this flourish cran Doreen 300 milligram has landed I'm gonna finish those other two pieces off and for you guys it'll be just a couple of seconds so thanks for watching wheats and I will see you in just a bit several hours since I've had the hybrid flourish 300 milligram cran Jurina gummy and I am pleased as punch to say it is as potent as it ever was another knock it out of the park homerun sports metaphor for flourish I really like this one real quick it didn't have the most cannabis II taste of any of the flourish gummies I've ever had then again it's a 300 milligram edible certainly that potent at least in my estimation I got me up to like eight and a half somewhere in that range or maybe even a little higher and that was actually spread out over about five hours I only had about the first half of it over two hours and then took the second half two hours later just in the circumstances I was in it has sustained me there's 300 milligram edible has kept me high for about going on about five hours now so really we're impressed with its longevity with this flourish again just the taste outside the cannabis part was good I like the consistency like the like the texture of the gummy it's so much better than at a pure or infused creations even with that slight cannabis taste in terms of that bitterness that awful as cerebral cannabis tastes it's not present here just a slight cannabis taste and I'm harping on it too much it's just I surprised me I've never really tasted any cannabis in their products before but there was it was here but it lets you know it's gonna be as potent as it is I really really enjoyed this one another absolute - thumbs up for flourish for me sorry I've been rambling a little bit but before I go I want to share with you guys my little cherry on top something that is not necessarily weed related but could be really weed related that you guys might want to check out and on this cherry on top I want to share with you an excellent movie from 2017 one of my favorites from 2017 and that is Briggs bbear starring Kyle Mooney of the Saturday Night Live Fame he always plays this sort of dorky guy long kind of curly hair anyways it's the story of a guy who lives in a fallout shelter and every day gets a new tape of his hero Briggs B bear who tells him a different story and adventure about his galactic life and it's about this kid's obsession with this bear that he knows brings B bear and I don't want to spoil too much more because the movie goes in unexpected places and it is easily spoiled so if you are at all interested in something and this probably goes pretty well with weed to be honest so if you're interested in something that's gonna be a little bit different than most movies that you've seen be sure to check out brings to bear I want to make sure that it let you know that this is one of the most optimistic heartwarming movies I've seen in some I'm there are adult situations and language and all that in there but this is not a cynical mean-spirited movie even though it does feature some again adult situations check it out again Briggs to be there really really enjoyed that one and that's gonna do it for this cherry on top and that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds I appreciate you making it to the very very end guys thank you so much and we will see you guys all on the next review peace", "Vu774A5ckG8": "so

minute and then it kind of went away but fantastic flavor now like i said not my preferred flavor but it was still pretty good i was actually quite surprised so my overall view of the macaroni cheese

book I got from high level health and downtown Denver and these were recommended to me because I was looking for an edible and try something new and I was asking for something that was vegan because usually a lot of edibles or chocolate base and it's milk chocolate so they're not vegan case you didn't know I'm vegan so I got you sweets ours here these are made by Eddie pewter and they're basically just like sour patch candies but um they're edibles with we like I said in the last video so um these are there's 10 10 milligram pieces now 10 milligrams is the base dose that they've actually established now here in Colorado because there's been some people out of freaked out with edibles so they say that the standard dose for an adult would be 10 milligrams and wait about an hour or two and then you can go from there you have to develop your tolerance now just because you have a high smoking tolerance does not mean that you will have a high edible tolerance this is a whole different kind of high it's ingested its processed by the body differently so just because you're dab or just because you're smoke all day doesn't mean you can come and take five or six of these and things it's okay now these particular edibles are rated at eighty eight point seven percent THC so it's actually higher than the concentrate that I did the review on yesterday now like I said these are ten milligrams there's ten in the jar I initially took one because I'm kind of new to the audible thing about hours who later I didn't feel anything so I took another one still didn't feel anything so the next day I woke up and I took three and I still didn't feel anything so I can do mad let means I have five left now and because I've worked my way up and I've been responsible we're going to go ahead and take these five today in this video and I'm gonna do a little review on the taste and show you guys the texture and everything what's going on and I'm gonna come back in about an hour or two and let you guys know and five was the right dose for me now unless you know I'm not just jumping up and being irresponsible also did some research already and people the kind of neutered down the dosage is for people that are new to smoking and things like that and I actually remember I think I said verbatim in some form ten milligrams will even get your grandmother high and they said for an average smoker about twenty five to fifty milligrams it's probably about an accurate dosage to get where you want to be so as I said we're gonna go ahead and try these five here now I'll try them the other day and they taste like if you were to take it I hated some wax or any kind of concentrate or oil I saw definitely very concentrated as I just said a moment ago these are actually at a higher percentage than concentrate that I did a review on yesterday I've got a few here I don't believe the flavors are different I got some some yellows and some greens and some blues here consuming on there and see the little sugars just like a little sour patch kidding me so Cheers I'm good pop now first it is really sour but then the sugar comes takes over in the Whedon tasting this is better I've had flour per pie flour prepared edibles before um brown using cookies and things like that in the past and this taste is a lot more pleasant it's a lot stronger and I mean I just like the taste of concentrates better than flour now but um pretty good pretty solid no one sticking your teeth as bad as most this is a positive for me but um one time just will remind you guys I don't think you can buy these and just pop a whole handful of them because and you will freak out I got a will teach you a lot different if you've ever been to high before anybody serving it too high they know exactly what I'm talking about these last two ring and pop these down playing a sentiment check back with you guys here and buy our oohs whoo and see how we're feeling and these still don't work come to conclusion the edibles aren't quite for me I'm gonna take a couple more trips out of the bait sound good okay I'm at these back up check back with you guys here in about an hour or two ghost God mile-high marijuana signing up I was some guys back now it's been a couple hours trying his uh Eddie Pierre of sweet and sour now if you remember we took five of them and I'm actually ashamed to say didn't really get stolen again this time um I got really tired though and I actually found out that these are actually uh indica heavy and that's probably why I had the tired feeling but I definitely didn't feel like I was ripped and I'm definitely preferring the flowers and the concentrates at this time however in a couple of weeks and we'll go ahead and know I'm gonna get a little bit more a higher dosages and I'm gonna get something that's the Teva heavy and we'll try that out but as we promised go ahead and rip the rest of this job Walsh berries and um we've got another video coming up real soon I made another little stop today and I got something special for you and these guys are gonna like that so that means that unfortunately what's the game I don't I don't think edibles really work from you and I got a I got a fast metabolism and I'm onna they work this time but we're gonna try them doing a couple weeks one last time though with this odd job balls berries there's nobody love this you guys know the deal though man comment like subscribe share all that let me know what you want to see me do any strange you guys might win let me buy I mean I got it all on my disposal here right now so anything you guys want to see me review just let me know certain things aren't like medical like I don't think I think achieved she was I think those are medical only so you know just let me know hit me up in the comments once again no ghost of God mile high marijuana signing out", "5U52H45VOnM": "[Music] what up YouTube is your man Sam back in the building [ __ ] did I get nothing you serving fries you never knew [ __ ] so today we're gonna have a good look at these [ __ ] candy king this one's blue razbolo mac'n now you guys already know I don't have a really good reputation with candy King because they used to do a lot of cartoon in Chow like appealing labels and [ __ ] but I don't know I mean this one's not that bad but when you put the word candy and like emphasize it that much it just irritates the [ __ ] out of me thank you guys gonna go check that out right there it's in six milligrams up okay and you guys can see the warning there it is there you got Callie prop 65 good to go alright and as I said this labels not that bad because it's not really - it's not cartoony at all I just think you know their logo sucks and I just think that you know they used to do a really lot of bad [ __ ] in this industry so I picked this [ __ ] up at a juiced-up deals because there's really not that much left in [ __ ] stock and I picked it up at a Jew's deals don't forget to use the code to play for 15 B so 15% of your entire order I don't know what the [ __ ] that was at ejuice deals courtesy of EV oh this one here I picked this one up for $9.99 $9.99 is cheap maybe there's a reason for that chief nests will [ __ ] [ __ ] will [ __ ] [ __ ] and [ __ ] and find out alright comes in zero three and six milligrams of I don't know and I can't explain it I don't what why what you [ __ ] losing it I think the cheese is definitely slipped off my cracker all right so this one here candy King Live as bubblegum e-juice features of profound inhale really profound sweet tartness from the blueberry and raspberry mixture all right all this unnecessary description [ __ ] is unnecessary so this one is blue raspberry bubblegum sour candy bubblegum all right I'm not gonna read you the paragraph in 3/4 there it's a blue raspberry sour bubblegum all right it's gonna give this [ __ ] a good shake are we getting a vision family effect yeah and I gotta be careful cuz there's a six and you can you can fake baby name ha I don't really get much maybe the fans blowing my [ __ ] face off what's that about and this one is weird I was just tasting the garbage that I just tasted this product may contain trace elements of Nuts Deez Nuts Deez Nuts daddy all right I know all right that doesn't taste like blue raspberry taste [ __ ] weird it's got like a spiciness to it which I'm not gonna ruin a good atomizer I'll use the cheetah version too on the flavor chaser this one is the dna200 this one's the old-school one I've been using I love this [ __ ] and I will always love this [ __ ] anyway you guys already know what's next we're gonna get it read Nemo wicks and I'll see you [ __ ] minute almost forgot this one's an amber colored ELA Corden it's I don't know if they were going to much for that sour [ __ ] but I don't know yeah it definitely smells we yeah I [ __ ] know close the airholes off this one is candy king blue raspberry a sour [ __ ] this one's 100 watts let's give this [ __ ] a weed you definitely get the blue raspberry but no well that's a 6 milligram [ __ ] does me in good mmm the nicotine I think it's just I don't know at six milligrams I shouldn't be getting that much but that one really does me in tastes like a creamy blue raspberry I gotta give it a fair shot I don't like the way it tastes it just tastes like a creamy blue raspberry and blue raspberry it's not supposed to taste like that especially if they're claiming it's a bubble gum that definitely doesn't taste like no [ __ ] bubble gum give me a minute I got that spiciness on the back I don't know what's up with that [ __ ] yeah that's weird I think they were going for that sourness but too much blue raspberry I don't like the way it tastes just based off that and not not because it's candy cling it really could give a [ __ ] if it was good I tell you but it just has this weird taste it tastes way too creamy last last shot and I'll get I'll let you guys go yeah it's weird it's definitely a blue raspberry but it just has shitty on the end so that's where I'm gonna leave it anyway thank you guys so much for watching if

feel so awkward right now I don't know why but welcome back to video hope you guys are having an amazing day today and if not I hope my video is able to make your day a little bit brighter I'm super duper excited for today's video I not only have half a blind I'm so butthurt you guys I have shout out to King palms send me more because I thought that I was too cool for school and that I didn't like hemp blunts and that I only like tobacco blunts but after smoking so many tobacco blunts and getting like headaches I [ __ ] with the king poems and so I try to like stuff it and I had it ready and when I was walking out here to set up my little filming it broke in half like literally in half so lively and as type [ __ ] I got a little Roach first a smoke and then I also got a bomb muhfucka a drink this is so refreshing you already know I got that double cup because honey Google today is a multiple game for toy edible loot bag video oh yes we've heard it here part two part two the first thing I pulled out is this rice krispies treat this is what it looks like I don't think the cameras focusing on it but looks like this this is one of my favorite edible but I feel like rice krispie treats and like treats like this like cereal bars I feel like they never hit me awhile back I went to dabba thon and I bought a 400 milligram at a bowl and it really didn't do much to me so yeah I have eaten this before in a my part 1 video but it was by a different brand I like to try all kinds of different brands and none of them seem to hit me too well but they're super super tasty so if you're more in it for the taste these are both then I got some soft beat thugs I never tried this brown before so I'm SuperDuper excited I love trying new brands of all kinds of different things and especially freaking edibles so in my part 1 video I had some different brand of chips so where is pretty much the same thing wheat hot cheetos and these have a hundred and fifty milligrams in this whole bag this has 500 milligrams so you got a great fight I also got oh my gosh I am so excited for this you guys these are sour belts candies and I love blue raspberry like flavored candies like airheads the blue but skittles the blade skittles is a happening but like anything blue and this is blue so I'm really I'm really stoked and I've heard from a lot of people that these were really really bomb so they hyped me up they hyped me up when I went to go get this stuff I was hyped up to try this because I guess you only eat one or two strips and you get super high but I have a high tolerance so honey a 300 milligram one or two bites is not gonna do me justice but if it tastes bomb I'm with the ships and then this is more my style you already know we might beat us this is a freaking la lucha that lon mmm okay so I really want you to this like right now okay I also got for the last but not least you guys oh by the way this has a hundred and ten milligrams so a little bit over 100 milligrams my everything really so last time we did a lemonade edible for the drink in the first new thing and then for this time I really needed to freakin go in with the 1200 milligram THC syrup because I've tried to CV syrup I've tried codeine I tried it all you know and I even tried filming a video trying this but in the fruit punch flavor and YouTube decided to delete my video so you know LBD famine stoppable honey and I came back with a great flavor so when I went to the dispensary and they had grave I was like put back on my shopping list cuz I gotta try so I'm really hyped up for this honestly like I'm pretty pretty pretty pretty hyped it's 1,200 milligrams this is the most potent edible I've ever seen on the market and that I've ever consumed you guys have seen probably my previous videos of me eating a thousand milligrams brownies trying to do my makeup and all kinds of different things and I really am NOT a fan of brownies and you know I like the rice krispies treats but they just don't hit me as hard you know sour belts are bomb but I usually like little gummies or something but something like there's like a beverage gets you so [ __ ] up you guys if you ever want to try any of one of these edibles please try the syrup do yourself favorite so I'm just gonna hop right in by mixing up our syrup because I'm just so hyped so I have my double cup my my sprite with my sprite and yeah oh actually I'm gonna take a thumbnail damn taking it thumbnails kind of hard okey-dokey well I literally could wake up the whole neighborhood anyways step yeah just so you guys know like what time it is it is 12:30 exactamente 12:30 exactly so let's see how long it takes for these edibles to hit why don't we first gotta you know consumed that no mm-hmm so I have this syrup I'm gonna just shake it because I bet you it's been sitting for a minute make sure you shake that hole nice and dandy Wow look at the cap it looks like th season there alright I'm gonna show you guys up close personality wait it off when you have no groups and you don't want a nip slip it's kind of a brown I wish it was a prettier shade okay so I used a lot I don't know if I'm gonna like this one I'm licking the syrup and taste a great I don't know okay so a lot of people like to come at me like dest you swear like you're sipping lean Jaime its [ __ ] syrup same base okay therefore you're supposed to make like I want my [ __ ] to be mixed honey mixed Loki I'm making a mess [Applause] pretty mother [ __ ] bomb I can literally see the THC in my soda like it kind of looks green like if I wish you guys could see it but it literally looks like wax on my ice it looks good though it doesn't look like what the [ __ ] is in my cup it looks like ooh that's bad again me so so far so good you guys I would give this syrup a 10 out of 10 if I had to pick one edible that's like my favorite edible technically it would be the syrup because [ __ ] bring your spray whether you're going to [ __ ] Six Flags [ __ ] Disneyland like no I'm just kidding I don't know if you're a lot of bringing drinks to Disney but sticks legs I know you're allowed to bring your own drinks honey so best believe I'm putting this in like a little canister my hydro flask I actually just recently ordered a hydro flask for college and I guess I have a six like season pass so if any of you guys are trying to go please hit me up cuz I ain't got no homies to go with and I'm fine I bring this Sara you know pour up and a hydro guess you popular okay um I don't know should I smoke or should I eat the rest of the edibles this is a mute thing I guess I should just use edibles you know I have to try that you guys I I've been dying to try these hot cheetos like I said I've tried different brands and other Browns were bombed on fire so let's see if this Alito's friends compares hmm ooh smells like like a [ __ ] spicy cheese ball with a little bit of weed it doesn't really smell like weed though that's what it looks like got a [ __ ] hot cheeto this [ __ ] looks like our normal hot cheeto it tastes just like the other ones hmm these ones were a little bit cheaper cuz the other ones I tried were 300 milligrams these are only 150 milligrams so less potency the artist Lee is still super bomb hmm smoking a blunt eating your chips and then sipping your [ __ ] lien just kidding tasty syrup it doesn't get better than this you guys like Yuki a highest [ __ ] by sipping this this tastes so good it tastes like a grape flavored sprite I love it I kind of want to add more syrup you added to do it just so I could be like really [ __ ] up you killed me cuz this is 1,200 milligrams like the big if I wouldn't take any of the other edibles and I just drank this I would be dead I would be dead but the fact that I'm eating this and I'm eating edibles like Wow I never even added up the amount of milligrams that I'm consuming but let's see 150 the syrup is 1200 I probably won't drink the entire bottle of syrup because I want to mix it also in this sprite I'm going to a family party later at a pool best believe I won't be chilling by the pool with my sprite so later I'm gonna finish the rest of that but right now I'm putting like just the perfect amount I actually added a lot more so I'm gonna mix it so 1213 50 and then the rice krispies is 500 milligrams so B 1850 and then the sour belts these are three hundred so that'll be 2150 yeah and then this is a hundred and ten oh my gosh oh honey wait twenty one fifty plus one ten twenty one fifty plus one and 21 carry the one twenty to sixty right I'm already feeling it now I'm just getting back right am i right I believe it's around 20 160 so 2,000 160 milligrams that's insane other thing mmm and these chips are so bomb if you guys like to medicate but like microdose EPS look like a sandwich and you'll be chillin won't I'm obsessed with these chips homie bomb but else is gonna say oh yeah somebody tried commenting in my other neat thing video saying that Oh a thousand milligrams ain't [ __ ] that's equivalent to one gram honey honey honey let me just sit my soda these are spicy I got the extra flamin hot ones they had regular hot ones and I got the extra hot superbomb um honey what the [ __ ] you talking about 100 1000 milligrams is one gram I'm not trying to call you out or anything much love to you but you have nothing but good intentions but that's just insane hundred milligrams is equivalent to one grab so eating a 100 milligram edible like this most likely since its 110 they used about a gram and a half maybe probably less than that excuse me they probably used about a gram to make this to make this now they used a hundred grams to make it a thousand milligrams but it's actually more than a thousand to this 1200 so there's more than that for this 300 milligram edible it's around 3 grams do you feel me you feel what I'm feeling so yeah 500 about 5 grams so as a human as a [ __ ] Union who smokes every [ __ ] day you know once I get to the first second balloon I'll be chilling so it's about 4 grams in you know the third blender mice so that's around five grams of weed so evening around 500 milligrams of an edible will get me pretty chilling but like I said the Rice Krispies don't usually hit me but that's why it 100 milligram edibles don't really hit me because if I only smoke one blood one gram I'm not gonna get that high cuz I have a high tolerance but for someone who never smokes and eats even 20 milligrams of an edible will be super fun but you know it's not always about the number it's kind of about well what's your what's your past like what's your what's your tolerance like have you tried edibles before did you smoke a lot but you've never tried edibles like yeah oh okay so I'm trying to open these and I'm super excited to try these these are the styler belts damn if I can even open it wrong it smells like cotton candy let's try it I know that flavour rx makes some like these I mean my sister tried I may really like them hmm sour I don't like sour candy but I did it for the bike for the milk bank drop them on the floor five-second rule hello wrong number wrong number the [ __ ] why you calling my phone yeah so I was told that if you eat one or two of these you'll be [ __ ] up so I'm kind of gonna save them so I can eat one or two and see if I get [ __ ] up but today I just wanted to try them out and they're pretty bomb you guys like they don't taste like weed at all none of these edibles so far it tastes like weed I hate edibles that tastes like weed I've gotten hate in my past videos where I eat the 1000 milligram brownie because people are like why are you gagging so much like it's not even that bad the honey of course you're not gonna [ __ ] know because you ain't the one eating it but when I was eating it it tasted like I was eating weed and that [ __ ] tastes bad you know this it tastes like I'm eating a [ __ ] airheads and I get high smoke it was so that shit's pretty tight same with the chips it tastes like regular hot cheetos you know it doesn't taste like I'm eating them a nug so I feel like that's really important when it comes to edibles it's just like at least for me personally is like one is it gonna get me [ __ ] up - is it gonna taste like [ __ ] cuz I don't care if it gets me [ __ ] up if it tastes like [ __ ] tastes like [ __ ] and I don't care if they taste bomb if it doesn't get me [ __ ] up you know that's again [ __ ] up so this is the little logic become behind the life beam des and me picking my edibles knees are pretty bummed I like the blueberry I like the flavor it doesn't taste like weed aiyo there's a little hit of an aftertaste but not really stay what's on my Cheetos you know like you're gonna get those little aftertaste but it's not bad at all if I could tolerate it you could part ollar a because I have a really bad like if it tastes like weed I won't eat it I'll give it away straight up and that's right today I didn't buy any brownies because brownies and cookies no matter what Brad how potent it is you know I've eaten the thousand milligram IV the 100 milligrams from the best friends from kirova to enjoyable - lol edibles like I tried it all and I'm just not a fan of the cookies and brownies especially because when you make a fresh batch of cookies at home how long do those cookies taste bomb for you guys for the first [ __ ] five minutes that those cookies come out the oven after 5 minutes those cookies taste like hard [ __ ] breaks and they're not bomb same with the [ __ ] edibles they're gonna have it in the refrigerator for months weeks months years and then you're eating it and it's hard and it's just it's not like a fresh bomb [ __ ] cookie so until I find a company who makes a bomb cookie that's like super potent I'm gonna stay away from the baked goods I really like these though these are really really really good really good and I'm not a fan of sour candy I'm not a fan of candy I have a sweet tooth too but I have it in a way where like I crave hot cheetos I'm not one to crave chocolate or sour candy and like skills like every time I go to the gas station I don't buy candy I buy water and chips super spicy chips and water so I don't I don't pass out I want to spark my blood already but I still have two more edibles to try freeze so I'm gonna try this one I'm super excited for this one this says Tama reand oh so this is a tambourine dough you guys if I ever have a me angry I'm gonna have a pinata and it's gonna be filled of these you know let's give it a gander my shirts already [ __ ] up this should taste like [ __ ] there's like a bunch of the product in the cap like that's already my 50 milligrams right there homie the [ __ ] this edible is too messy honestly it's not even that it tastes bad it's just that it's so hard to eat pbbbbbt I remember being little and thinking that was so fun to like push up these like normal candy I says it has sugar chili THC extract caramel citric acid I'm an enol egg corn product that's so weird I don't like it I'm kind of like like I don't know it's kind of like when you think about it it's like yeah like caramel and like what else did you see corn acid the [ __ ] Beach I bought this for you guys honestly I thought that maybe you guys would want to see it and it was like unique and it was cheap so 300 milligrams but honestly I don't really [ __ ] with it I wouldn't buy this to be like Tiki I wanna get high like no [ __ ] I'd rather just buy a topic rather by the sour Bell just cuz that's so much easier to eat like this it's already coming out from like the bottom right here it's all over the cap okay you guys have one more edible to try and that is this Wow crisps fruit [ __ ] so it looks like this I tried all kinds of different brands of the same Mountain milligrams oh I guess smell the weed I get smelly smells beautiful these are my favorite he's like if I can eat this every day I would Bob this is pretty bomb I really do like it it tastes a little bit like weed though out of all the edibles here I think this one smells the most like eat and taste the most like lead so really full all right you guys honestly [ __ ] the [ __ ] my camera just stopped recording for some random ass reason probably cuz I'm taking too damn long but let us spark my roach I haven't smoked all day and I honestly do love smoking obviously do love smoking but like I'm not an addict no but like you know you could eat edibles all day you know get high as [ __ ] whatever whatever but I like smoking like I like smoking my ganja and chillin so we finally get turned up on the life being dead you kill me I know you do wait I think I was imminent just to get to the big bucks ain't got no bad intentions just occupation I don't know how to so I'm gonna go do something productive like that but I hope you guys enjoyed this video I'm gonna take a little bite of everything before I go whoa first book is 10 o'clock so I'll be back at 10:30 and then it would be like an official power ok maybe at like little past we'll see yeah it's so [ __ ] saying hey I really want to go to sleep like I feel so [ __ ] tired I just I probably look all like dead right now but um I have two little Tommy Party and I looked at the address you days and it's so far cuz I live far you know and make family looks like so it's like far it's like driving on ago they do we owe you no honey there are red ants there are red ants [ __ ] girl and um I'm just gonna say that I'm high as [

these guys be sure to thumbs up the video if you guys liked it and I majored a little bit brighter [Music]", "SAk4UlHayMI": "it was so heinous this is the story time of the first time that I ever did edibles and how traumatized I was oh my god [ __ ] this [ __ ] boy [ __ ] hey guys welcome back to my channel it's a Rochelle so I am filming another storytime and this is going to be a like part 2 story time because I already did a story time on one of this um on this topic Bob doing a part to story time because I have another story to tell so this is edibles almost killed me part 2 I'm just gonna jump right off into the video this is going to be about the very very first time that I ever did edibles and how bad it [ __ ] me up and how I was not ready to get that [ __ ] up who was snapchatting me it got a little distracted no biggie so the very first time that I ever done edibles was sophomore year with Arianna of course it's Arianna pretty much any story time I tell has to do with Arianna she's been my [ __ ] she's like she gets me she's crazy like me she just gets me so yeah pin which every story time has to do with her yeah first time I read at edibles was with Arianna my sophomore year I had a volleyball game at our high school with a couple of our guy friends so I'm sorry the lighting changed but a couple of our guy friends had gotten rice krispies edibles and we had all like split them up they were like they liked the guy for like warning us something like being careful like don't need too much like it'll it'll hit you all at once or whatever and I was like I thought I was just gonna be like smoking you're like taking a DAB or whatever and you know I was wrong a [ __ ] was wrong so we're in our friends car me like I don't eat our rice krispies hi Cooper before we went in to the volleyball game and we left the volleyball game cos was boring as [ __ ] and we went and walked around the track and pretty much two hours had gone by and we had not felt it yet so you got two hours had gone by we still had it felt it and we're like this is stupid like [ __ ] these other balls they're weak and we end up going to like the in and out in our town like that was like the place to [ __ ] go like after any sports game or like any party like in and out was the place to [ __ ] go so we got to in and out and that's when it hit us it hit us like a [ __ ] train we literally went from like zero to a hundred so [ __ ] quick God's so high off these ahead of bull I'll insert some pictures right here from that night right here I'll keep inserting some different pictures I'll insert a video of Ariana and the in and out back through let me pretty much we just got really high and we could have stopped [ __ ] laughing we laugh for like 25 minutes straight Ariana was like eating fries or something eyes my eyes had never been that bloodshot my eyes have never felt that heavy in my life so we all sudden got so hot and as we're at in and out ariana is like Rachelle take me to the bathroom right now and I'm like why and she's like I'm about to [ __ ] throw the [ __ ] up so we run to the bathroom in and out and moment of silence for ariana that night I have never witnessed another human being throw up that much she literally threw up for 10 minutes straight not just like throwing up like [ __ ] exorcism vomiting like a stream of vomit out of her mouth like vomiting in the toilet in the bathroom like I was what guarding the door so no one [ __ ] come in because she was like it was so bad and like in the middle of her throwing up she's like scrappy it was so heinous and so we call another one of our friends and her boyfriend to come pick Ariana up because it was a school night like you know it was a school night like [ __ ] it right she throw for about 10 or 15 minutes and then her friend or our friend and her boyfriend come pick Ariana up and then the guys had to take me home because it was a school night my parents like where the [ __ ] are you [ __ ] Ariana it goes into the parking lot to get picked up and she starts throwing up again throwing up again so we went from like not being high for two hours to having like a really fun like we're so high in and out to just like [ __ ] hit the fan she's throwing up unexplainably and I'm not throwing up at all I just like feel really high and at this point I'm like [ __ ] I have to go home to my parents never fun never just never good idea and then as we're in the car driving from in and out to my house I'm sitting there and I'm I'm just sitting there and then I zone out and then all of a sudden it feels like I can't breathe and it feels like my throat is closing and I know this happens on a lot of drugs where like you can't swallow like it's like really hard to swallow to me like in my brain that was [ __ ] you can't breathe so you start death curdling screaming in a car with three guys like I have never screamed that loud it went from me like zoning out for a really long time to like me zoning back in thinking oh my god I can't breathe and then just screaming like like screaming so [ __ ] loud and then we pull over on the side of the road I'm still screaming my hands are cramping up doing that damn thing that they always [ __ ] do and I'm screaming I can't breathe I can't breathe and I'm yelling at them to take me to the ER I kept screaming please take me to the ER and I'm crying and all the guys are trying to calm me down the Durbin so nice but they were like freaked out themselves we're just like they were troopers that's what they were eventually I want to say like 10 or 15 minutes go by and finally like I've calmed down I know I can breathe I know it's just the edibles probably I took too much I go home to my parents and I walk in the front door and I start talking to my mom after I just had that panic episode and this is gonna sound crazy and I know like it's probably not gonna make sense to anyone else but me but when I was talking to my mom I swear to God I can't even explain it because it sounds so stupid but I swear I could hear myself talking to my mom like it sounded like I was listening to myself talk I don't know if that makes sense whatever I'm just gonna not even try to explain it and then I go to take a shower because I was like I just really need to calm down and then as eyes as I'm in the shower I feel that hot burning sensation again which is like what initially made me feel like I couldn't breathe like the burning sensation in my throat was like not swallowing and I was like no no it's just the edible sweetie you just gotta stay calm mm-hmm you really just easy calm because your parents will freak out if they know you're on edibles right now and in the shower my arms start feeling like [ __ ] noodles like I was like [ __ ] just swinging my arms around they felt like they were like dangling like it felt like I like tentacles and people are gonna be like really [ __ ] like all you did was eat rice krispies edibles and it's like I out of every single thing I've taken edibles is what [ __ ] me up the worst like the worse I do that I get in bed and I just knocked the [ __ ] out like crashed out I've never slept that deep in my life and then the next morning we all meet up at school and all of us are still so high like our eyes are still so heavy and we're all just like laughing about like what a [ __ ] [ __ ] show the night turned into pretty much the story about how edibles almost killed me for the first time yeah I never I've never had a good experience on edibles never
