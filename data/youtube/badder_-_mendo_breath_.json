{"Z0Uwl-eK1Vg": "I've got a rare strain of smoking on today it's a strong indica guaranteed to knock you on your mother ass this is meant to be smoked when you ain't got to do afterwards today I'm

thank you guys very much for that all right so now back to it so Mendel breath is actually a cross between og KB which is OG Kush breath which is supposedly the father of all the cookie family genetics strains so you know that's guaranteed flames and Mendel Montek the strong genetics of both parents force Mendel breath to be incredibly dense and have frosty frosty frosty buds and you would want to make sure to save this strain for after work because you definitely won't be able to function that 100% after smoking something like this so don't underestimate this this strain is meant to give you a powerful body high to help aid and comfort your chronic pain and discomfort this is one of those trends that will give you incredible munchies as well so if you need to gain some weight this right here is for you if you're trying to loose weight this might not be for you the effects you can be expecting a feel on Mendel breath our one relaxed euphoric sleepy happy and uplifted some medicinal benefits are to treat some stress to treat pain to treat insomnia depression as well as headaches some negative effects you can feel from the strain hard dry mouth dry eyes dizziness paranoia as well as anxiousness so make sure not to do too much so none of those things happen to you and flavors you can be expecting a taste are earthy pungent sweet and smooth bye guys it's about that time if you guys got it and go pull out your bombs your blunts your joints whatever you got to smoke out of so we can hit this together so I'm gonna break some up right now and we'll do the smell test alright guys we just finished grinding it up real quick so let's give it a quick smell test man so that's incredible this is like one of those smells that just kind of slap you in the face this is very dank very strong credibly pungent slightly piney but really really gassy beezly great great smell absolutely because it does have that og cush breath in there it's really really strong and that's one of my favorite aromas so I enjoy the smell a lot this is great smell wise I probably give this a 9 out of 10 this is fire all right guys we're gonna pack some in a little bit here in this Kemper rig thing that I got here the hipper bubbler let's hit this alright guys Cheers [Music] alright guys I just took the hit so I am gonna start the timer right now and I just want to say right off the bat the taste is really really nice it's incredibly smooth so I didn't actually COFF that entire hits wish I usually doing the coughing halfway through so that shows you yeah it's very smooth tasty the OJ or not oh gee my bed oh gee very prominent that's like number one thing that I taste which I love so flavor again I'm gonna give this thing probably a 9 out of 10 it's great so I'll check back in in a bit it's uh I could start to feel a kick of it yeah I can start to feel a kick it out here a second alright guys it's about a minute and 30 in and the effects are still coming in pretty strong I can feel it behind the eyes my head is getting kind of like it feels like it's under pressure yeah the indica effects are really really strong it's not really it's kind of coming to my body but mostly in my head right now not like in a sativa way but just feels it feels nice very relaxing oh yeah I just wanted to say I did not actually have to purchase any of the weed in this video that you see here I'm not gonna tell you exactly how much I got but I did get more than this this i picked up from freddy down at Secret Circle in the Union City / Fremont area so if you guys are ever there or around that area go ahead and give him a call I will definitely link all this stuff down below in the description so definitely check it out oh yeah and by the way this mando breath I'm not sure how much it is cuz he said it's on the menu but I don't see it on his menu so definitely check them out and ask him when you do see him it's fire alright guys it's about three minutes in and you know I have to plug it if any other services out there delivery or dispensary dispensary delivery or dispensary services out in the Bay Area want me to review any of their strands go ahead and hit me

gonna say in my past videos you've seen i've said yo they got some fire get it get it get it something happened just like in all of cannabis it seems we have these waves sometimes it's good sometimes it's bad certain companies they come with some serious consistency always drive right always trimmed right and they're doing it right in some places it's up and down it seems like there's more up and downs than there is consistency right now in the cannabis game because pheno fam this is unsmokable when i bought this for my saturday enjoyment it's saturday video drops now i'm gonna go try to smoke

bunch of stoners my name is Jay one in today's video we posted a community post maybe about a week ago now asking you guys what you would rather what you would prefer to see as far as a string review we had the granddaddy purple the Mendocino breath and both option most of you guys chose the granddaddy purple but the majority of you guys I think it's like over 80% over 60 votes I voted for both so as you all know at this point I'm pretty sure the granddaddy purple should be public on YouTube all depending on when this actually uploads but today we're going to be smoking some of the Mendocino breath now I know this isn't as og as like you know say the Maui wowie strains or the Acapulco gold but I know this is a very well-known strain I have heard many things about it and I have heard many stoners smoking and talking on it so really stoked and excited to be able to smoke some myself today set up the tripod show you some understood at our icons and proceed to get baked as a cake on camera with you all so I'll be all enjoying your Saturday enjoying the weekend so fat that's not what you're getting up to attend in the comments and also what you're smoking onto this strain review let's get the first bong rip of ad Amanda seen or breath so the dome she is now I do really like this strain purely for the simple fact of some reasons that I will get into after the the close-ups as you all know - rips for the string review one prior to some close-ups show you some of the UM of this mendocino breath up-close-and-personal and then finish the video with one more combs so sit back enjoy roll yourself a split pocket comb to get into some close-ups so the Mendocino breath is a 70% indica dominant strain testing out at about 19 to 20 percent THC it's across between the OG Kush breath or otherwise known as the OG KB and also crossed between the mental montage effects from this you will get will be relaxed creative and sleepy and the taste also includes earthy citrusy and very sweet as you can see here from some of the close-ups that we are getting of the Mendocino breath absolutely amazing medicine here shout-out to Brian from GM GP delivery services and as you can see those understood trichomes in all their glory absolutely amazing strain and stoked that I am able to try this today so as you can see from them close-ups from the old tripod absolutely [ __ ] amazing medicine really really nice what I do like about this medicine is we used to smoke a string back in Australia by the name of mango weed the person who did grow this spent seven years perfecting at this stream this does smell and taste a lot like that in my personal opinion obviously most of you guys wouldn't have a [ __ ] clue what I'm talking about but shout outs to everybody that's tuning in from Perth and knows exactly what strain I am referring to so there we have it the Mendocino breath you saw it first on the channel make sure you share it to a friend so they can see let us know down in the comments if you've personally been able to try this strain yourself I would love to know what you guys personally think of it and what you would rate it out of 10 so last rip cheers to you all now let's [ __ ] get it oh [ __ ] it's the [ __ ] gate abuse for the daily driver Oh woohoo well there you all have it everybody one way to spend the afternoon to a nice little

thing you know what is Mendel breath so we can be specific with you guys you know I'm not trying to rate the tip right now strange to lay this one window breath string right here so Amanda Brett 19% of THC we're doing this official now 19% of THC is supposed to give like to make you calm so must be Endicott so minnow breath is an interesting mix of OG Kush breath oh gee cush bread whatever that is yeah that's what this is that's all this she says like right here it says a bunch of other stuff but let you know but it's OG Kush breath and mentos montage that's what it is the two buds that make this this OG Kush breath and mando montage this is on leafy yeah I know simply saying that you don't know is that fire in it for after work you know it's a heavy high powerful body high you know even for me leave this fire reviews everybody likes it top three yep it's mental break even the comments right here it's the the OG key B times the window montage I don't know if I'm pronouncing it right but you know I'm not American [ __ ] it by a middle breath 19 percent THC that's an indica and yeah bro let's get let's roll up now we know what will be smoking which crosses they are red some bayberry don't know what crosses they're so in yeah bruh I gotta drop that video of the real rose and the fake rose for kids like you know at least for me that's an interesting video because I like to know what I'm smoking by LinkedIn the like because I like to smoke roll papers especially like real roll paper and I don't forget she so if I'm smoking think I would like to know at least somebody you know I would like somebody to tell me if I'm smoking on the freakiest shits or not so that video is coming out soon I still got that fake bake in their room I still got it over there and I got a bunch of real ones in you but like you're gonna see the difference oh yes this train is super key for your original like is leaving a lot of Keef right here but like the butt is not drying meaning like when you grind it up it doesn't turn into Keef he just has a lot of trichomes but like this thing you're like you can see that it grinds up nice it does it doesn't turn into like you know dust like I hate weed like that I hate me there's been like dry it out too much then when you break that [ __ ] up you just turns into [ __ ] does this come over in the we do you fam you already she's right too much I am NOT saying like if I get it on smokey real because I've had it personally like you [ __ ] choose I will not get there and I can always choose you just imagine if it's a full game from a dispensary or something like you get with you kisses here you can't even see the plant imagine you get like you buy something from a dispensary over here and you can't see it we're gonna Massachusetts is that some thing only when you get home so the only time I got that [ __ ] dry was from a dispenser and I was like damn Brock paid 60 bills for this [ __ ] and Superdrug 60 I'm gonna do that video to grow that dispensary video like the space reverb versus plug but with this thing like that the spacer is not as fugly you gotta wait outside and [ __ ] [ __ ] that like I want to do a video that I'm going you know show you guys the [ __ ] thing is nicer like today we're gonna use a filter let's see if it fits if you fits in there nice if it doesn't not even gonna force but everybody's coming out to

you can smell the grape in there like you know you can smell their little grape in there and the nut structure like to me I don't know like this kind of looks like a sativa but I don't quote me on there cuz you see these nothing like they're hella wrong you're like I don't know kind of looks like mr. t but I mean we're like I'm not sure I'm gonna go over there she knows yeah so these are the notes okay see they're purple in there I don't know why the [ __ ] doesn't focus like that when the camera is nice BFM y'all can see this completely frost out it's like dead it's dance but it's like [

__ ] one fell on the floor see you then [ __ ] it but yeah if MLC oh this one is great pile I see everything right here can we gonna start doing this for the stream reviews we're gonna make it official let's see this see it's a sativa he got 14% of THC not a lot of people know it's a hybrid in cyber yeah it's a hybrid right here it's a hybrid so like you got 14% of THC so it's not as strongly that thought it was cuz like when I smoke this one will look kind of like it doesn't give you a like but it gives you a high just like they like it makes you talk peace it's nice it's nice so yeah this one's just a TV gray pipe comes from the genetics there's a cross of cherry pie in grape stomper then cherry pies fire rubber that [ __ ] is too little well cherry pies fire family already

a youtube I have video something like on histogram and [ __ ] for sure oh just got to go look for sure I got something that's nailed it make thumbs from this hand there's like what we're using that raw organic I prefer the raw classics but like the only classics I got his King side in the right here Umbra sheet or you smoking a king size right here for King sizes to the face with like right now I'm nothing like I wouldn't have a good time but this wrapper is still like gone rogue Hawaii's founding from Portugal if y'all see them around I'll let you borrow this one but this one mean like this one you went rolling up it already formed the cylinders and I don't understand like how did this got 14% of THC like what the [ __ ] is this [ __ ] gives me like leaves me high but is it hey but you can see the next structure like it's different than the [ __ ] then demand over the middle is just too short take note that she's gonna [ __ ] hit you in the head some fellow here already got two rolled up right now you already have the great I rolled up you know all of them are looking pretty like to the same size okay suicide right yeah yeah I see that come on this demand oh that's the key makes them well I got a flavor you you could tell definitely like if you smoke like Lupita especially like the mimosa brother Moses like when you open up the bank of the mimosa like you know it's mimosa I'm just gonna change up this music gonna put some uni in you want is that Portuguese stuff bro like if you're like the vibes like you respond like on the comments ask for music like we're minute y'all listening to in your vibe but I can tell you every name of the music because this is a Portuguese stuff bro so now I student almost we were talking about that I'm also like to do with the most the more song looks it does not look as appealing as the other ones but on smell beats all of them family got the most orangey smell like daintiest fruitiest smell to it Berlin it's so good and when you smoke it like it tastes you're like yeah you smoke it leaves your mouth feel it's all I ever like so tasty like so far my most aspiring I want activity with an Iceman TV is another only like more dilemma for the got some beats to bro alright alright my wrench I'd been looks at this and look as appealing as the other ones but right when you smoke this you smell this like if you smell this lake is so gassy the the strain like is so dance is so nice it grinds up super perfect smokes even better the ash y'all gonna see I'm not gonna talk about it you already know it suppose you but [ __ ] you boom just a mimosa let's get it somos right here let's see what the cross is my most a two leaf so most of the hybrid two with that 20% of THC good but those are that gays you know it's energizing so you already know like there's more on that sativa side is it is a hybrid but it's more than that sativa side who knew right cuz it looks like a [ __ ] indica rate buggy mimosa so it's herbal piney and citrus this when you get Snell the citrus more row I you just smell like oranges bro is fine young so it's a cross of Clementine in purple punch breath part of the bunch is fire I know what most of us cross with purple poncho so it's Clementine crossed with purple plunge I thought it was changing I thought that this [ __ ] had a little touch of tangi on it oh so it's Clementine and purple punch both with those strings I never tried Clementine I've tried purple punch a bunch of times purple punches on my favorite strangely there's no kind of room under great PyCon is a little smell just a little hint of a vertical punch just a little paint run okay bye yeah you already know so most of there's a mix of what Clementine and purple punch you already know it's a hybrid more on the sativa side cuz it's it's it like it's a lot of like energetic I shall see that Barlow right there yeah she was a changing mix it's Clementine well still fire still Friday if you ask me purple punch a [ __ ] 21 time bro like what you know in this that's why is they have fruity fruity smell good like both of those strangers gotta clean this one and I gotta get a [ __ ] move ring through this and everything fam the smell it's just crazy like it's so strong so you can smell this all day basically if you like oranges like this that's what it smells like bro I like an orange peel I know kid Sheena dropped it right there because it's getting harder to take out of the paper to take out from the tray because the trees didn't feel W maybe this is gonna be like the [ __ ] what's it called the thumbnail okay this is looking nice like every strain in every joint right here - all right so I'm gonna try a different thing let me try to drop it like this this already on the touch like you feel so nice to smell a little like you know put this on a meat like as a little seasoning you're gonna think like that they won't think you salt me or something bro you gonna be like oh you put a little extra touch on the lasers suddenly like something light so we got so you got to wait filters cerebral - without filters to be like 2v2 just to make it equal but then the smoke all the same my effing let me know how you guys doing in the comments let me know what you guys did for 4/20 ah like ya'll commented on my last video to becoming on this one then we gotta let me know no I got you hope you see that video didn't I got and now I didn't even recorded that part like I rolled up like a for grammar three filters on them up or they she was true if you go my histogram you yo can still see it cuz it's AMA how it I don't think you know I think was about merging okay see I always I think what it wasn't all for them but it's still highlights on Instagram so go beep - April low-key dishes my histogram is right there yeah sure right there yes sir yeah you don't forget to subscribe to the channel alright you're watching the video with your photo ligature there subscribe anything if you don't have an account I don't know if you can see this so if you can well just make that account is have Fred we're gonna start getting notifications ah I don't think so good playing you to just say no bye yay we are here well so that one's rolled up damn this one I rolled it tight as [ __ ] I mimosa because this one it is a little bit dry to know kid I was about to grab a lighter and push this down because I used the better for my king sizes but is not in this world I've never seen this I've seen it like looks weirder like but it's nice because it likes the bowls and look on the ball perfectly you don't burn yourself and the joints too sometimes but isn't for me it works better for the mom because you don't burn Yolo I handle so you can see that we got some extra filter so if you sounds Greek sounds a [ __ ] Greek this one is pretty good like it's no super like breath I don't know like it smells Greek yogurt ooh me burn okay but you smell super dude got some touches of purple well smells like a little Greek yogurt okay so let's see what this is let's see the mixture of this so [ __ ] doesn't show any does not have shows only MIPS now we have to stick in the W believe me you got a update you [ __ ] bro I know I mean II thought could be so that shit's a hybrid we're on wheatmadge now we're on wheat maize now so all right all right all right so ii thought goons it's a hybrid it's a cross between Mandarin cookies which we already had in here in cooling OG never tried that never try them and then never try this year but mandarine cook you know I've tried that [ __ ] bro that [ __ ] was like go and I got it on the strain review go feed [ __ ] those people a [ __ ] this is so gas and like smoke Supergirl never tried the cooking cookies ma'am I did not know that this [ __ ] was for again mandarine cookies time enough and now that I reminded myself like it kind of smells like that man the ring dude he's okay buddy God they ain't a big Greek yogurt family you got a Greek yogurt on it okay yo so yeah all right it's a [ __ ] it's a hybrid like I said more on the OG side I don't know how this is a hybrid cos I didn't know cookie was a [ __ ] hell I didn't know cookies was a teeth with cuz like oh jeez not sativa so like the other extraneous who and og og cannot be sativa so the only explanation is that man during cookies is a sativa which I don't think so level let's go to be real fish we see the [ __ ] series what the [ __ ] how many cookies in a row all right ready show the show all right show - oh yeah they sing it's a hybrid - and it's more than 34 side so will I see like on the only free saying there's a cut from the cookie mandarine sunset in the memory cookies it's not saying that it's [ __ ] from the cooler hoji so I don't know which one is right Leafly we we Mabel get your face right I don't know which one is right but I'm gonna go that the right one is the hybrid so both of them are hybrids both of them say that it's hybrid so this high it is Mandarin cookies so that's what I'm going for a nice tight cookie bro that's their fire so let's go we won't roll that [ __ ] up I did not know that bro but now that they say it kind of smells like their mandarine cuz I had that go chamber interview outer lash that weed was beautiful beautifully y'all go and check that I think that was my first string of you was with that string in another one in

like the middle bread for me the edge was the best one on there one the other ones kind of laid me down on the edge but they're not harsh bro that's the thing like this amazing but in case you usually means they like that is hard you know and it's not enjoyable to smoke imagine if it's breakage and it goes out like a [ __ ] always gotta be lighted that's some [ __ ] that's like oh there's like a

body effect uh it's pretty relaxing yeah good relaxing effect does make you a little bit tired but you have to smoke a couple bowls to get that effect yeah you don't it's not a one-hitter type strain

Walker if you have something to do it's like yeah you're gonna want to sit there a lot more very good relaxing though it does help you get good sleep looks amazing the beautiful flower got it for $20 for an 8 so as far as it not being super strong I'm not really - to bat down that price can't complain yeah over a few different things at that price range one of them didn't look near as good as this didn't smell as good as this but I think that one had a good effect a lot of times when you get those cheaper the lower cost herb if it doesn't look good a lot of times it's gonna be pretty strong and if it looks really good like this it's not gonna be that strong but this stuff has great taste it was grown well it burns clean great taste though it's got that earthy almost like bubba kush type smell to it that earthy Coase smell that's a bit of that skunk eNOS yeah yeah really good effect was great too snug Oakley beautiful trichomes this stuff is very nice-looking great sample looks great look at very good trichome covered love the bud density not to dance not to fluffy it's just perfect yeah very crystallized Tufts good for sleep but not super strong like Irbid very potent where you

comfortable these strengths are good to drink with the drink some tea with it a little bit of that caffeine not too much caffeine just enough just enough so you don't feel like just laying around

"u4dKIZFK7RU": "welcome to the show everybody and an extra welcome to our 5,000 new subscribers this week really guys I'm flattered the show's been growing really fast lately so getting to today's topic when I did my big nutrient overview episode I probably spent 10 seconds talking about adding different types of carbohydrates to cannabis meaning adding sugars and I decided to give that one subject more attention since a it's a relatively common additive that people do use and B there is a lot of misunderstanding about how to use sugars and what they do or don't do so let's start with when do you use sugars during your growth the answer is during flowering time up until the point that you start your pre harvest flush my favorite sugar type is molasses and the average NPK value of molasses is 1:05 so there you go that's why flowering phase which form of sugar do you use well like I said in the nutrients video on sulfur molasses is considered better than brown sugar corn syrup or honey using molasses over anything else is especially important in an organic grade medical grow room in case you're wondering of the options that I listed corn syrup tends to be the least expensive I'll try to link to a few different types of sugars in the description for you guys how much sugar should you add well generally just follow the instructions on the box if there are no instructions or you're using molasses a tablespoon per gallon of water will do some go as high as two tablespoons per gallon what will the impact be basically bigger buds a fair range of size increase that's attributed to sugar additives appears to be 10 to 20 percent now this is important plants do not absorb sugars they actually manufacture them plant roots cannot take in sugars either raw or refined but soil does absorb the sugars and it increases the soil lifespan and the chemical processes within the soil the carbohydrates are food for soil microbes also decomposing sugars release co2 which is a great booster as well all that means is that using sugars is really more useful in soil growing not in hydroponics and also as another downside the whole flavor thing that it makes the bud taste sweeter as far as I can tell it's false at least nobody's proven that connection scientifically as of a year or two ago and finally if you're using sugars like molasses outdoors do be aware that they may attract animals big and small so there you go guys my quick and detailed breakdown on sugar additives in cannabis and extra special thanks to Jorge Cervantes and is incredible encyclopedia it's extra useful from complex topics chemically like this a link to his encyclopedia in the description as well on that note guys if you enjoyed the topic you should subscribe and hit that like button see you next time", "1c1QmAxxCmc": "oh right holes great everybody we were out here we're just about to do another strain of you and a stranger we've got for today's Mendel breath and we picked this up from true bliss organics out here in Mesa and this has been some pretty nice stuff man I'm glad I got to mess around with this drain she still smells good brah she's got a nice sweet kind of a pungent earthiness there's something else in there she smells wonderful man anyhow we are almost done smoking this and these are what the nuts looked like kind of man you guys can see - well that but they are father's solid man and from what we know about her she's a 70/30 in the codominance drain and the THC levels on this thing gets like 20% so she's not kind of mediocre levels as far as the genetics go this is a cross between OG Kris breath and Mendel montage and we had a good experience with it man I'm not gonna lie I did smoke this throughout the whole and a wee puff this on our wake and bake when we had our day off but after that we've just been smoking or after work in the evening time right before bed so afternoon and evenings have been what we've mostly been familiar with she's good in a wake and bake she's really nice actually because she's got that hazy euphoric high to her man she's stony bra and she is a good functional wall I shouldn't say he's functional I found myself kind of hard to focus and forgetting where I was sometimes although most Eli's driving I've missed my exit and missed my turns and whatnot so she does kind of have that effect on she kind of dulls the senses but she's great for washing away the day but the same time to kind of wash away some other stuff so it's kind of be careful of that but even though you're like that you're in that kind of a mood that kind of a mindset we're just kinda like whatever man you know it's fun you know it's there's no regrets in hell's got to wash this bad boy out we've just been so busy man and now we finally have a nice clean bomb to smoke this stuff out of put a little bit more in there anyhow let's get this party started ba Mendo breath man I'm already feeling about that first hidden anyhow as far as our experience goes with this strain she was wonderful she's having a good anyhow we did enjoy this strain she made us happy she got us to today she took care of our needs wiped away the pain washed away all the residue from work sometimes you come from work you still pop it from work he's still in work mode so serious still maybe all the frustrations from work the seriousness of work the anxieties the rushing that all that stuff kind of follows you home you carry it home with you you know you got to leave that stuff for the doorbell don't bring out in the house and this is a good strain that kind of come in the garage with yourself off of that stuff man because because she's kind of a Lewin station and she's not really good for focusing but I don't even know how to explain it I like the internet intelligence I lock the intelligence to relay this type of information it's almost as if I can't even explain it it's not like a zeroed in focus it's definitely not it's definitely kind of hard to stay focused with a strain like this but at certain points that was attentive it's almost as like how would you have a tea a DD ADHD it's hard to stay focused on something that is just not interesting to you and it's almost like as if your your boredom your your wanting to think of something else it's just a symptom of like interest but you might have in whatever's going on it's not really interesting anymore and things that are interesting you can definitely be attentive on I guess that's the best I could say to describe that I wouldn't know how to say it's almost focused but it is kind of attentive which doesn't make sense but when you're dealing with issues like a DD ADHD you know you can't be focused but it's only on things that are of interest to you but I don't know it's hard to explain but that's kind of along the lines of it but this tree and I kind of felt like she was like that and I kind of feel like she's supported the adv the ADHD you know and she didn't have moments of like where things would seem very uplifting and happy and there'd be moments of just kind of chilling zoning out kind of like you're stoned so I don't know that's just the best way I can describe the strain and we did have fun with her man she helped us out she got us to she she definitely is a medicinal strain of smoke on she definitely helps out with the issues like pain relief stress anxiety and definitely depression because I kind of felt like there are times where like you would feel down you wouldn't feel like in the mood of anything and you could smoke this stuff and it definitely takes you right up you know and sometimes it's all really sometimes don't even know why you're sad why you're worried you just having these these feelings you're like I'm so worried about I don't know what why or what a what I'm worried about this get that out of here get that out of here this is this is good we kind of you know shoot that stuff away so anyways mmm as far as this train goes she's nice she's got like you could kind of feel the 70/30 she feels a little bit more balanced than that though but you can feel the head buzz you can feel the body buzz it's kind of tingly and she feels wonderful bra and she's got this really nice like hazy you for kind of a height or you're definitely stoned man you've got the stone enos about you and it is I wouldn't say it's functional because it is kind of I feel myself being kind of clumsy forgetful kind of dulls the senses not something I would smoke before work but definitely something to come home and rinse off with you know rinse off the day rinse off the towel work everything you know so you'll be back at home and being home with your family you know be the good guy you know don't come home all pissed off and still have work about you you know he's doing that work mode I'll come home and chill man these are civilians do you know you're not like they're not employees they're not Oh cheapies I'm glad we have that title my hell yeah freaking og og Burrell OG peas means online grocery picker but I was just safe online groceries I see Cochise we don't change bro such a wonderful towel it stares this jug just at that

freaking part brah and I said like gang compose in a parking lot like man and I go in there and I'm chilling and we're doing all kind stuff just to get our mind off way to movies and I came home so

forget family do but it was like this isn't about 200g mmm this is about freakin Mendel breath but it's part of the og family this is og cush breath cross with Mendel montage you'd even notice when this pain goes away but right now the pain in my legs is gone so this stuff this stuff works by this stuff is good on a pain relief make a note of that Mendel breath Mendel breath is good for pain physical pain came home from work where feet was so busts up my feet was hurting at ten o'clock in the morning bra and I just keep pushing Bowers they come on big guy come on man could make that chana it ain't easy being cheesy but we did it we got through the day we came home my wife say there's meat toy house let's do a barbecue so I'm like I've got to get some freakin drinks and since we don't drink alcohol the closest thing to a beer that we can drink is root beer so I got some nice freaking Harry y Narns six-pack long net bottles but I love freakin root beer I love them off the bottles up here John Kerry freakin what the cost is I loved you got a ball over some [ __ ] can man so one time I went to this house I guess movie in this Park movie the bar everybody bring your chairs or

breath and she's wonderful she's got some uplifting buzz you know she's got room to play around 7030 in the car she gets comfy but you can see that if you've got good company you can talk you can chatter you could giggle and laugh and you know back the fool it's all in good fun you know light-hearted and wholesome entertainment I guess in such a way that you behave but as for us I like this train um what I get her again I don't know what I ever want to use this in a situation this would be good if my promise was around Thanksgiving Eve or probably like I don't know two hours an hour before you know Thanksgiving dinner everybody's getting together you know how much longer for learning stuff oh there's about 20 30 more minutes we're gonna go get something for home go to the garage burn this bra this would be a good thing to face it on laughs talk and then after that let's go eat mmm and then get our writing food and laugh and joke and you know be jolly and merry that's kind of how I feel with this train at least right now then you can sit around and reminisce on the couch why you you know let your food digest and you're like variety of time ago see that's how it is if every

earthy we just wait just wait wait wait there's a heavy heavy indica feel and it's been like three seconds my hands are starting to droop it's awesome honestly I wish my breath smelled and tasted like that", "1PLm8w3xQ0w": "[Music] cannabis strain from scored this is breath mints and this is some fire just like the last scored that we reviewed which was the hidden pastry or I myself reviewed he wasn't here I wish I was here random fire well yeah the breath mints is a Mendo breath and sin mint cookies and the breeder on that is scent city seeds and this is a indica dominant hybrid strain the very potent very strong has a super sweet flavor also it's kind of minty that's why it's called breath mints it has a convincing earthiness to it yeah yeah there's so many men so you can smoke and man I have some more mints skittle myths from squirt as well you guys let me know should i it doesn't end should i do a review on this should i do a review on this let me know in the comments yeah and I better be there when you review it too oh yeah always always go through but this breath mints though here try that man that's where this fire the breath mints is uh I'm gonna say it is gassy it has a good flavor to it the buds look really good it's a like dark green buds with extremely orange hairs that like it's covered in orange chairs and frosty eyes crystalline it's like broke it down it was hella sticky I kind of had it for like a week and I felt like it cured up a little better - in the jar it's real sticky it's got a super sweetness to it to crack that open oh yeah sweet beautiness it's like a sweet mint - yes oh you like this like very like yeah like sweet kind of like whatever the pine turkey news it does only has that it's like a sweet minty piney freshness know is I was building [ __ ] in my nose you know what I mean oh yeah that's how I am but that I was like piney acid yeah exactly I was like yeah yeah I like it I'm feeling I was living a little bit of research earlier on it um it I was hearing like you know there's like some euphoric like calming effects I'm I definitely feel that from it oh yeah it definitely has me in a place of like where my mind is a little hazy but I'm still like functioning it's it's indica dominant so like I'm ripped it's got pretty [ __ ] bags on this [ __ ] already and yeah where'd you get the hooded I picked up these from green theory and on bail red those guys are always pretty chill every time I go in there they're always got good suggestions for me tell ya you know I'll tell them exactly what I'm looking for I want that gas I want that super flavorful [ __ ] what's the new [ __ ] you guys have and always took me up they work like most clubs do on a point system or whatever you know as soon as you hit like 250 300 points 20 something percent or something like that but I mean it's affordable I got these for like 45 minutes believer 15 don't like that not bad that's gasps yes gasps there's some Street like this is definitely up there hidden with the with the best of them that's for sure oh yeah squirt has got that [ __ ] and the good thing about score is they have a site you can go to where you can look up there they're different strains that they have and where they're being like dropped at what clubs are beans it spends - it's called ice core calm I mentioned that in the last review but I wouldn't look since then so I sk o are d.com I scored calm and it'll pull it up you can go look up these strings on there and see which clubs have them in your area or wherever but yeah that's pretty cool our stuff that was stoked because oh I look for the Instagram pages that tell me where the drops are most of the time because I'm trying to find where the weeds that like it's cool I'll follow the clubs and [ __ ] and you know they'll tell them we'll have them on there too but I want to get those but step up on people yeah no I feel it yeah make sure I get something rebuked man you guys be buying this [ __ ] up yeah yeah this is definitely kind of weed you want to have like a drink nearby I could definitely feel a little bit of cottonmouth coming on here it's coming on so you gotta give you vitamin water it's true hey it's got me stupid bags I might not even like I'll probably watch a movie do this yeah this is the couch Locker oh yeah I'm like a Marty's own and out right cerebral yeah like I feel like right in the front of my face I'm high as [ __ ] this is that hazy head high guys like euphoric that's that's not even that's not a good term this is just like you know this is just like mine bendy kind of this is that [ __ ] right here we have a Devon smoke the fellas would look at this and went to bed I'll grab it don't pass to me oh yeah true oh yeah once again man I'm pleased with scored I've always known they've had good weed since like I tried them like the Wonka bars a while ago and I was like yeah we need to do review on that but I'm glad I picked these two up and also the pig pastry as well that was super flyer I still got some of that look forward to smoking but a overall rating on this this is [ __ ] strong man I think I'm gonna give this like a 9.5 I think is like this is like tastes good looked good like I said it about the price like $50 and ages like that's what I used to pay for weed like back in like in late 90s early 2000s so like I feel like the price should be a little better but yeah that's the market we're in but it's this decent that's you're getting quality weed for what you pay for it so definitely this one kind of like hits at all fronts for me kind of like I like the pine eNOS I like it's pretty gassy too you know you just got that like full flavor it hits yeah right [ __ ] way yeah this is like you know this is like one of those you know weeds of all caliber I guess but uh I'd say it's probably nine point five nine point six it's just like it's hitting in the right way you know top tier sought after gas think if you what I like about scored - there's like there we'd always taste very natural like it tastes [ __ ] like good we'd like you taste the earthiness in it and actual like yeah it doesn't taste too like nutrient it down or treating with that chemicals and [ __ ] I really like that like I like when plants and flesh good and they taste [ __ ] super fresh and green I like that about this the end so you said like nine point five nine point six yes colby solid nine point five yeah oh yeah man breath mints from scored nine point five that's let's talk to you the hidden pastry I think I gave that like a 9.0 it was him it just was more of a mild flavor to me and be innocent even I wasn't really like to turn on by it this [ __ ] right here got me [ __ ] ripped off my ass like you said this pizza time yeah it's busy time for sure that's all that's on my mind now oh yeah thank you guys for tuning in and let us know if we should do the review on the skittle mints and yeah there's been another one strain tasters kangaroos peace out", "HMK65blcMeY": "today on the nightly blood we present to you the highly sought after in the codominant men dobra the original Mendo breath f1 phenotype was bred by gage green genetics and consists of a unique cross between OG Kush breath and Mendel montage Mendel breath offers you extremely dense nugs that flex the white feel the trichomes that make you want to

floral scent so if you're ready to have your breath take it right from your lungs and fill up with six liters of pure bliss and grab yourself some endo breath and enjoy the holidays this has been the nightly bud", "3bJ5U7tdmis": "[Music] good morning everybody welcome to another episode of tastes my name is Alvin and today we're gonna taste the legendary strain Mendo breath man so uh let's check out this profile Mendo breath is a cross between oh gee cushion breath and Mendo montage the information that I have is that it is bred to by a gauge green group but if you guys know different please let me know this is groaned by Pharaoh Farms and I purchased it over at the Garden of Eden in Hayward California this is an indica dominant strain and stress pain insomnia depression and nausea some of the medical uses of this particular string now remember I'm not a doctor and just some folks smoke this strain and those are the elements that had helped them with me but without further ado let's check out the sensing some of the senses according to Leafly it should have a sweet vanilla caramel and earthy smell to it I always like to pop it open and see for myself [Music] very sweet sweet almost like a chocolate sweet [Music] smells really good when I originally smoked that I only bought a gram of this so there wasn't too much I could do but I did smoke one small joint of it but [Music] a lot of funk very pungent sweet and pungent very similar to that pie the pie face that was smoked lat that we tasted last week not a sweet though but definitely pungent when you break it up yeah definitely when you squeeze a little a lot of the pungent sweetness comes out I can see why they say that has a caramel hint to it it is a sweetness but not like a berry sweetness so it has more of a candy sweetness but like I said I got a chocolate vibe to it and I think I mean that's really a for interpretation just grind it up and see if we can get a better smell from it yeah I could definitely get a caramel smell to it [Music] not very very sweet I get a lot of that pungent smell smells good definitely smells good not again not a sweet I can't get a little bit of those caramel tones sweet not too sweet about very pungent let's take a closer look all right so as you can see nothing too crazy nothing too out of the ordinary about this strain typical color typical bud structure but I will say that if you look at the tip it's very frosted at the tip but again nothing out of the ordinary in regards to appearance but let's get tasting we looked at it we smelled it now we just got to taste it so put it in my little trusty vaporizer here my desktop easy vape it's my favorite way to taste all of the terpenes and honestly save a lot of you but Ben solo let's practice initially and get the sweet spiciness has a very sweet vanilla flavor to it spicing it's like a spiced rum or something almost yeah definitely get a little bit of that caramel tone on the aftertaste I'm not bad not bad sweet not too sweet I think that it is it does give off that again the caramel chocolate tone again not overpowering sweet and I can definitely smell and taste a lot of that funk a lot of that hundred from the og so yeah man let's move on to the hive all right man 510 rule chief for five minutes relax see what my head my body is at chief for another five minutes at a ten minute mark see what my head in my body is that y'all know the drill let's get the chief in alright man so we are at the five-minute mark right now and a Rando breath is a potent one man it's hard-hitting indica look at my eyes man those are my eyes let's smooth it has a smooth good tasting indica but it's heavy one that's for sure it is late super early in the morning so only time I can't record this but I don't think it's that man I think it was a very heavy incident at the five minute mark it's pretty interesting so um yeah man I'm gonna keep on hitting this and Oh Mahalo shot the ten minute mark I chopped so ten minute mark man Mendo breath is a hard-hitter I am duck I am pause I mean it is a very very strong heavy avian to go sometimes you need those man sometimes you just need those really good for again I can see why it's great for insomnia it's great for depression is great for stress and kinda knocks all that [ __ ] out of you man but yeah man if you're looking for an indica definitely the way to go definitely the way to go I like it I like it with that said let's take it over view Mendo breath is a cross between oh gee cushion breath and mando montage I purchased it over at the garden of eden the original breeder is gage green unless y'all know otherwise and this batch was grown by feral farms again this is an indica dominant strain stress pain insomnia depression and nausea on what it can be used for medically um sweet vanilla caramel and atheist kind of the flavor path that I got or that leaf Lee tells you I got a little bit more of that chocolate actually I did a sweet caramel but I got a little bit of a chocolatey taste maybe that's just my palate and I did get a lot of the pungent smell when you broke it up you got a lot more of the pungent when you popped open the jar it gave me that sweet smell did get a lot of the sweet but just not in like you would get and say you know a wedding cake or a purple punch or anything like that again this is a very mildly sweet smell if I was gonna score it on a 1 to 5 a 5 man I love me some indicas man and this is one of those indicas that will knock you out I can tell I can tell this is just in 10 minutes I keep puffing on this I reload the ball I'll be asleep in 30 it is good it is good it would definitely put you on yes I respect the Mendel breath man but with that said rattling all loop I meant so uh

little bit left or the right back in the jar at the end of journey like I said I work from small to big click into the jar the last mud is so [ __ ] the best but it's fantastic system that works great

great shame for that it's more balls your you sit there like shit's not gonna really value can't even be [ __ ] fogged up heavy heavy like justified me fighting sense let me sneak out another Bowl

inhaling house hold the head in did you do two walked up the head you [ __ ] tapped it all in the wall I did a [ __ ] nice little [ __ ] box wired the switch shut that [ __ ] right off done huh won't

cut all your [ __ ] off just gonna be oh I have some [ __ ] on sound like a babbling we've the [ __ ] out here we're doing this piece", "4_syjlOyKWk": "welcome to the sheds I stock images coming at you with another review today [Music] work on that [ __ ] over the next couple days so this one Cushman is the last one I did Cushman's videos up in live now peanut butter breath and supposed to have like a citrus peppery floral flavor definitely got the surface and the peppery part true [ __ ] flank the peppery and in the citrus thank you so much the floral just gonna [ __ ] it and get into this because I want to record a video is the one that cuts out on me I can switch it up I'll reshoot it so if any of you guys watch that before this one before I get a chance to [ __ ] double Chuck and all the new snobs say welcome there's a [ __ ] channel guys I appreciate it appreciate the likes the comments the words of encouragement everything everyone that's been inquiring about the Zuzu farm stuff like I don't know what specific delivery service or dispo these guys have been using but I just know that they've all told me that this is Uzi farm so I'm hoping this tastes real good my girl's kid was [ __ ] out here last night just [ __ ] ripping off my [ __ ] G pen I can see then it looks like it's [ __ ] clogged again and my coil looks like it's [ __ ] birth so we're gonna see what the [ __ ] he did to my [ __ ] last night probably nyhavn my door on my [ __ ] little office area already you can still get in here without my [ __ ] knowledge we're gonna have to g-pen hit a pedo you can see it's leaking right down here definitely getting like a um like an earthy type tone that probably comes from the peppery in the citrus not like super strong but you get that like almost like a peanut buttery paste from it and not like straight like take a peanut butter off the drone putting it in your mouth or anything like that but you definitely get a tone of the peanut buttery like the nutty we told not to put the other [ __ ] wax through the coil he repeated it the other day I said okay at least me right we have an understanding you you know that I don't want that [ __ ] going through because it just made it seem like it darkened my coil it tasted gross didn't burn so I've only been putting like the live rosin and [ __ ] through my new coil put this [ __ ] through it and then break my coil or nothing but definitely without what the [ __ ] moment that's for sure come on find out somebody's been using [ __ ] but then they've been using it the very way that they weren't supposed to be using whatever it's gonna be an expensive lesson for him because he's gonna only a $35 coil that's just [ __ ] way it's gonna go so we're gonna rip this again morning dance hopefully some of you having some early morning damn especially during this [ __ ] quarantine [ __ ] well not [ __ ] about it just the boring [Music] so at least the coil didn't taste through burnt otherwise all I would have been super gross but yeah definitely get a peanut buttery uh you know flavoring flavor its own to it otherwise you get a little bit of the citrus at the end it's not a bite it doesn't hurt you no butter breath Isuzu farms get your hands on it try it I see no reason why any of you won't like this it may you might and this goes for some of you you may be getting better stuff than this like you may be paying on the top dollar and you're getting it and this is better than this and I get that obviously there's [ __ ] on the market right now that is probably 10 times better than what I have in front of me take that into account that I know that but for people that buy ship budget so you buy in for for the little envelope packets from say healing tree Wellness Center 400 and then you go in another place and they're selling these for you know for 400 there's a lot of resin this is better than the get-go than the other [ __ ] my opinion my opinion and based on things I've heard live rosin is supposed to be better than shatter and your normal crumbles in your normal ship but I guess that that part also comes down to personal opinion I know a guy that swears my shatter shatter is a [ __ ] that's what he likes it seems like I just don't like the consistency I don't like trying to break it up and then all of a sudden my should go everywhere you know it's happened it's happening you guys this happen to me but uh I recommend them I see no reason why you guys won't like these a pretty [ __ ] on point in my personal opinion because that's really all I can give you at the end of the day I can't tell you that this is the best [ __ ] on the market because I don't [ __ ] know I haven't had the absolute top dog on the market they got [ __ ] going out there like canna guards and went out there for like 3,600 bucks you know [ __ ] 410 for one like some ridiculous [ __ ] if I had $400 you know [ __ ] blow on one of these yeah give it a go for a [ __ ] video so we'll see what happens in the future but that was on 2 Chainz most expensive his [ __ ] he just did one where they were showing a bunch of counter guards and ambassador or whatever was [ __ ] 3,600 bucks it's got [ __ ] diamonds it's a 24 karat gold [ __ ] edible [ __ ] Kanna guard and he's got little diamonds on the top and every diamonds you hit it changes the string that you're smoking on you can go on youtube and watch the video that I'm talking about but being in a financial position that I'm in right now I could never just drop that kind of money on that but one day in life we'll figure that [ __ ] out start ripping some and [ __ ] I guess it bounced with some of these big names and just have some obsessions just [ __ ] whatever whatever can only dream right with that being said Zuzu Farms hogs bread you have zero banned on this channel everything it's good just obviously within these ones that I've tried you know something just are a bit better than the others it's just the ones that are not as good as these ones are still way better than the [ __ ] down here damn and as I said in my opinion but love you guys thank you for watching comment below if that Cushman's video is the one that cuts out at the end I'm gonna go check it out in a few minutes I just want to try to get some video shot before I do all that um actually I'm just gonna reshoot for Cushman's video because I think I'm like 90% sure that that's the one that I [ __ ] up on my phone just all of sudden cut out um like sub comment hit that Bell I'll catch you guys in the next video everything else about this will be in the description below love you guys thank you for watching", "n777LiiXiaA": "what's up y'all this your boy Shelton with another fire ass episode of wake-and-bake ain't baby this morning we have a new strain for you I've tried the Strand before I'm sure you guys have - this is mindo breath men don't breath look at the bud and my hands are actually again it's from washing them too much so there's Mendel breath Mendel breath is an interesting mix of OG Kush breath which is the supposed patriarch in the cookies fan of genetics and Mendel and Mendel montage their forces combined made it's frosty buds that reeked of sweet vanilla and caramel but no matter how good this smells save it for the saving for afterward this stumper can pivot your entire day's plans with its powerful body built high ok let's give it a shot guys so yeah the bombs kind of dirty again we're going to get that cleaned out and we got another packed bowl right here for that so if you're new to the channel thank you for subscribe to the channel if you haven't subscribed to channel go ahead subscribe to the channel hit that post notification bell so you don't miss any of these fires videos you don't know what I'm saying hey also maybe tell you guys that I have another Facebook page besides booth I'll be walking my other Facebook pages but it literally you guessed it wake-and-bake only it's not waiting big Inc this is just waking bait on Facebook that's my other um Facebook page you go in there and see I've been there been on that for years you haven't go there and see all the all the delicious but I used to have way back in the day like 5-10 years ago I had some buds boy telling y'all let's go he could just ice up in here once again you guys loving and appreciating the comments so yesterday I had to go to them I didn't have to go to office for lunches I wanted to get some awesome cream for this rash that I got on my arm anyway so before I get there I'm walking up there and I see the woman sitting outside the building with a chair a table and she got this mask on she's got this thing in her hand and I'm walking up looking at it like I hope that your doesn't think that I'm gonna get a vaccination today I hope you don't think that I'm gonna get any type of shots today I'm not doing no flu shots I'm not you know what I heard yesterday if you did the flu shot if you took a flu shot then you've been injected with Kovac 19 do you know that all animals have a corona all animals so that's why they don't test animals it's a normal thing that's like it's something new it's an animal disease the hell there is a pause you guys for a second okay I'm back so if you're into finding out all the information you can about the k\u00f6ppen 19 like I am there's a video called the hidden agenda behind Cobra 19 then it says p1 endemic I don't know if you guys can see that right here but here's what the videos the front of its gonna look like like two people walking so you guys watch that man and it tells you so much information about about Koba 19 man it's ridiculous I mean it's ridiculous the things that they're doing this up this one doctor had figured out how to cure AIDS and he disappeared quick on this woman she was um they arrested her because she had a cure for AIDS too they arrested her kept her in jail and then they told her that you can you can't speak they gave her a gag order for five years you can't say [ __ ] about this if you say something about this we're gonna make up another [ __ ] charge and lock your ass back up so she waiting her whole five years and yesterday was when I first seen the beat up she came out naming names telling all the [ __ ] the she even had some doctors on there doctors were talking about how [ __ ] up this cover 19 is and how [ __ ] up the process is of what they're making us do the process of washing your hands 20 30 times a day do you know that's actually introducing the virus to you because our bodies supposed to have a certain amount of virus and bacteria in it to make our immune system strong and if you're costing washing your hands washing the viruses away from you it doesn't give you a meal system a chance to strengthen so it keeps it weak its weakening and weakening and making it more weak because we're keeping ourselves clean so when they do open up the country again it's gonna be full of diseases watch what I tell you that's not that's not my words that's what one of the doctors say anyway let's get - this min dobreff y'all I got sidetracked let's go stomp lay waiting big baby oh no did you guys ever had that happen to you you keep your light in your pocket and you get a big ball - living it and then it doesn't light here we go a little bit because I was admiring the flavor so much it was like street living in my mouth - tastes like that tasted pretty damn good man oh wait what I did knows I shouldn't try to hold it try to hold it smoking and busting my lung damn man uh-huh let me go and get some air you guys yes sir you already know what I'm saying about last night I slept like a frickin King last night I'll tell you guys I tell you guys this just about every day because I

wrong y'all we're almost at 800 by the timer but it's on the end of the day is we should be at 800 subscribers I'm gonna need a thousand guys actually honestly I need 10,000 but let's work on a thousand first man y'all go tell you homies there's a new kid on the block waiting baking go tell your friends that tell your friends to tell a friends and so on and so forth y'all come on man and subscribe to the channel hit me up I still have that lemony taste in my mouth is this supposed to change lemony I don't know let me see let me see it says nothing about lemons doesn't know he said vanilla and called caramels I don't know about that but I taste some goddamn limit of bliss [ __ ] oh I have a slight burn on the back of my throat I feel the buzz coming right behind my eyes in the top of my forehead it's making me feel it feels weird but it's making me feel light like like I can you know I'm saying and it made me feel pretty good when there's a job I do say so myself then it's really tasty oh I can't put my my taste buds on every taste that's coming through here but I definitely taste some real slight of vanilla it's real slight I taste more lemon in anything or citrus you can say but it's actually more lemony this tastes like I've had Mendel breath that takes it like this but it was Mendel breath in something else hmm obviously this is not dispensary great it is really good though it's mellow it's not like dis pension rate in my lungs is kind of modeled like it doesn't like boom I'll be smoking boom Minda breath is not exotic it's just some fire as sweet and I love the name um because y'all know where I'm from well from I'm from California but what part of California mindo I'm from Mendocino County Oh middle breath hi oh yeah Oh Macarena oh my goodness I don't know what's going on with this Florida weather again I always tell y'all that this one is bipolar s ma look day before yesterday yesterday day before yesterday day before that it was like 93 degrees out there [ __ ] day before yesterday it was like sixty degrees in the morning now since the degrees in Chicago it ain't cold 60 degrees in Chicago they wearing short sleeves and shorts they try to go to the swimming pool in Chicago but 60 degrees in Florida [ __ ] I got on a puff jacket I got on thigh high boots and boots come all the way up to here man didn't strap over my shoulder like you're fishing Charles man I got first rounder [ __ ] man I got this big-ass cat that got fur around his [ __ ] he got goose ass around in this [ __ ] man telling you man [ __ ] be wearing some [ __ ] man I got Oh ostrich booty gloves no shits is the [ __ ] though y'all Austria booty I'll never ever had ostrich booty man is better than gator keep your warm up take that much yeah sir okay it's getting kind of weak that burnt up really quick didn't help that I was burning it up with the freaking no lighters but you know what you guys I think we got time for some more let's go ahead and get some more up in here and see how that does it's kind of dry it's crumbly but that makes it better for me to smoke on it up in the bowl then when I got to put it in a grinder I hate putting [ __ ] and grind it cuz you got to know that you're losing some of the some of the goodness out of your bird I eat Keith off your bud the crystals when you use a grinder it's just like if you break your bud now to fajn with your hands you know that most that shit's getting on your hands so I try to keep my [ __ ] intact as much as I can I don't like smashing bugs I hate when if I go to somebody like one of the vendors and I buy somebody from them and their buds are all smooshed up and [ __ ] like they don't pack it down in a jar something nagamma that [ __ ] man all your [ __ ] is the best [ __ ] you got man I don't want this [ __ ] you guys disrespecting the bud my nephew used to do that [ __ ] man you know the jars a whole like maybe two hours or something you want to push like trying to push a pound in there dude what do you know on man there's 32 jars over there what the [ __ ] okay on a scale of one to ten one being worse ten being the best of the flavor critique of this mindo breath it's really tasty it's really tasty that burden on the back of my throat is adding to that lemony taste I don't know how it's doing it but it's like making lemons open up in my throat anyway so on a flavor critique of this mindo breath I would have to give this the person over that popped in my mom was nine but I'm not gonna give it a nine I'm gonna give it a eight because I'm sure the flavors could pop a little more than this the the other the reason why I didn't give it a 9 or a 10 as far as flavor goes is because there's got to be room for dispensary grade this is not dispenser grade so it's not primo in my experience every every dispensary that I've been to has had primo weed except for Florida in my experience they've had better weed than the streets except for Florida so let's get back in here you know no wait we're gonna give it an 8 we gave it a 8 and it's a high eight this is quite flavorful you guys guys if what I recommend this to my friends perhaps perhaps the dispensary greater than I would I would recommend this right here to friends - because I'm actually pretty hot but yes I would recommend Mendel breath to friends now you guys know that I'm wearing a habit of of recommending exotics so it's kind of stepping back for me to uh to of recommend some just plain ol ow and that's what this is just playing allowed this doesn't fall under the exotic mark so but it is it is tasty and the high is it can be compared to some exotics men because it is a nice it's a nice even high it's not a jagged high like I'm sporadic with it it's a nice mellow I'm gonna sit back and listen to some jazz while smoking another blunt type hard you're on to do what I'm saying man it's one of them has it maybe you want to jump in the car and go catch the Sun some rods over by the water you know I'm saying to sit back and smoke another blunt you know some [ __ ] like that anyway let's let's get back in here I recommend this to y'all two months real I got all serious and [ __ ] [Music] my poor he got a little hot there I almost called the papers almost but he did raise that higher blow but I'll tell you that much with the smoky smoky chili y'all I think heart is gasps oh my gosh I everytime I breathe out my nose I taste this it's just [ __ ] just limit all in my throat it's like lemon and vanilla it's like gum Oh ballooning LaBella or limited vanilla I am high I am pleasantly hi guys let's get back in here oh ha and gasps really damn did I snort y'all remember call oh [ __ ] like old Pete over this [ __ ] somebody stop oh yeah y'all almost Whitney birth almost witness the rebirth of my breakfast huh Mickey whoo yes that time I did catch the Vegas [ __ ] cut diamonds get up off your ass in jail oh I'm sorry y'all that was that old people [ __ ] dad jokes and [ __ ] y'all know me I can't wait to the day I've come to one of y'all spot and smoke like you said you have to be over 18 and you have to possess a marijuana card if you're not in a legal state you're in California I'm pitting smoke with you all day so I get over it but um yeah you gotta have a card man I told y'all I got it got my card man it's so weird when you get cards in places for the first time like when they first legalized it it's so weird because they don't know what the [ __ ] they're doing they're just bumbling through [ __ ] man how much should we charge let's charging the thousand I'll break that too much no it's not bill come on turn up shut your mouth 600 right I have $600 for [ __ ] cards you guys you know what you guys can keep that but everybody went in demand oh so many people in there yeah I had to pay one for good was it $50 just for the class what I need in class for what why don't you in class then I had to pay $175 for the doctor okay I understand that but what's the class for the classes that tell me that I need the doctor the doctor was right next door I don't know if I told you guys this part yet so I go next door and I have my my medical papers my medical papers say I have COPD I think I don't see a PD on the medical papers say I have COPD misdiagnosis so I'm really games adopted she said yeah you have chronic pain that's again really hurts when I breathe she said it over when you bring people to have COPD they don't hurt when they breathe [ __ ] do you got Sione PT bitching just inducted what you mean to her we briefed you asked me what the problem was not I told your funky-ass what the problem was [ __ ] and you telling me it ain't the problem she said well I'm not giving you a card do you see this can call it [ __ ] do you know we crazy no I'm just playing I would never hurt anybody y'all know me better than that man I'm a non-violent person I am nonviolent to the point of you putting your hands on me you can talk [ __ ] you kick dirt upon my shoes I wouldn't give a [ __ ] you talk about my mama you know I would give her a damn man if you're talking about my mama that's the dozens that's a game like people play that [ __ ] talk about my mom and they got better I got a better joke about your mama see that's how I was gonna do I'll make you so mad you don't wanna put your hands on me and then when you put your hands on me it's gonna be a sad day for you brother I've been practicing martial arts since I was eight years old on 53 it's gonna be a sad day for you and not no American martial art CD all this [ __ ] ha ha [ __ ] out here the hell is that what is this an exhibition huh huh I don't need to do all the [ __ ] I plant this oughta be yes as quickly and as efficiently as I can you gotta also remember I have asthma so the ass beating is gonna come really quickly it's gonna in really fast you better have some a base of maneuvering I don't care if you got a knife don't care if you got a stick and if you got a gun if you're within reach of me you won't have that gun for too much longer buddy I promise you done it before locally put the gun right to my head and said don't even move needless to say he didn't have the gun too much longer it felt like somebody was pulling him out the door cuz I grabbed the gun and we trusted him with the gun like this and he's a boy behind me my uh my roommate son is behind me like 10 years old and the gun went on here because I can see how the corner meiotic going when I pull to come back like this trying to get the gun and that [ __ ] pull the trigger I heard a go click man up soon that going quick I get like this and put my hand in his chest had his gun down here put my hand in his chest and started pushing back - I swear felt like somebody was pulling him out the door it felt like angels I was just helping me so I weak let go of his chance open the door and he just like smoothly exited out the door cutting oh I closed the door locked it this brother wanna kick the door he kicked the door twice I ran back to my spot lifted up the chair grabbed my two guns I had two guns these were some weak-ass guns but they were guns nevertheless they were [ __ ] high points never get a [ __ ] high point I take about thirty second anyway so I hear them kicking it on a blue blue blue I grab my 200 380 s men and now it's radio um high points of [ __ ] I run to the door I open up the door I'm like this out the door man and dude is just going I was like how did he just disappear now I know I just told you guys that I know that I've been practicing martial arts since long but you guys got to know the only thing that was on my mind I wasn't thinking of no maneuvers the only thing that was on my mind was this kid that's the only thing that was on my mind I wasn't in fearing for my life I wasn't feared for his life I was thinking about this kid that's the only thing I was thinking about and [ __ ] if you pull this trigger and it hit this kid I'm gonna put everything I know on your ass I promise promise was a good thing I had to slide there when I had this slide he pulled the trigger this went click see see how that worked out yo whoo oh yeah about those two are hot points the hot points so uh I just keep my gun so clean that I could call him like this like you could just do that real quick and actually put one in the chamber so whatever I can do just like that that's how clean the [ __ ] was so one fourth of July man I'm out you know you shoot up in air with your guns you know guys I don't condone shooting up in the air because you gotta realize what goes up must come down so anyway we're shooting in the air where the save location is over water so we're not tripping I'm walking in a start shooting man and I got maybe four shots out of these two guns that hold seven in the clip and wanted to know so I got eight shells I got maybe four shot bunk but never get a Hotpoint you'll be dead so I don't even know but gave me the critique of the high of this let's do it again if I did I don't care on a scale of 1-10 would be the work and being a [ __ ] best on the hard critique of this Mendel breath we're gonna have to give this see if I were to stop the video like five minutes ago I would've gave this a seven maybe possibly eight but because I smoked some more and children's you guys I'm gonna give it a nine I'm gonna give this particular mindo breath for nine not comparing it to a head knocker but this is a nine if you guys get a chance try some endo breath get dispensary great if you can but also Street great is delicious too y'all like that commercial spot anyway you guys I really appreciate you guys I love you guys the pieces man group hug thank you guys for subscribe to the channel I'm gonna try to keep bringing you this far as content as long as I can you guys anyway you guys are enormous a man you ain't gotta go home but you gotta get the hell out of here and guess what else stay back", "wtpTfEVkbcU": "[Music] here's a little piece of the purple monkey or a purpose but whatever [ __ ] and here's a piece of the Meadowbrook and just by comparisons like now I only bring this up because I do want to bring two people attention that if you go to a dispensary I've gotta realize that there's still the weed pretty in every because I'm curious on whether I bought a separate strand or if I just bought the same thing and sold the only other way to figure this out is of course to review it in a try now I enjoy the space one I enjoyed that one and like I said in the way I ended that video I felt like those more of a sativa dominant hybrid or indica hybrid I mean either way to go it just was a floor indica so as always I'm gonna go ahead twist on my blunt I'm gonna have some music going on our good toads right hey bro you watch a lot of TV I'm listening to music man y'all watch the video I'm a twist go up I'm a roller I'll be back to talk yeah she said I see you here but tell me where your mind is I said a beach we use somewhere on an island so you could be the food that I'm trying to fight in well you could be the one I'm trying to spend the night in yeah I think she's like sick so when I'm I think she liked the way the vibe is with hardly fussing and we barely ever fight in it is a bar man we hardly even try alright so as you can see here we are I got my looks we grow in mindo bread it's marketed as an indica it has an earthy smell but it still is familiar with the last strain I did to where the smell is earthy but there's still a flower fragrance lingering um visually appealing and you all have seen it's purple it's a couple key fragments of green up in there is beautiful now my main concern is how it's gonna work as far as the effects of it and not only that I'm kind of curious as to you know is this the same thing I really hope this is nice so there's only one other way to tell the [Music] [Music] [Music] it is definitely different definitely do it now yes alright so yes this is definitely not the same [ __ ] strand looks oddish it on the [ __ ] smell though I stand corrected when he came down to the taste bro this tastes like weave this is a light like that you take I don't the best way I can describe is like up but the best way I can compare this taste wise is like army when you take a bum grip and you have that lingering smoke and cannabis tastes up in your mouth that's what this [ __ ] tastes like like um smell like I said is its earthy but it still has a flower fragrance but once it's lit this [ __ ] all indica I'm sending up I'm kind of questioning because you can see is daylight I'm not gonna sleep up on them no more so we're good that's just three pools in far as effects I feel the initial effect like wait when you smoke indica you're gonna know you're smoking in the in Dakota's you're gonna feel it like that so tea but you're gonna feel it like this some people are probably arguing say you're that good week you're supposed to fill it like it yo everyone's different and my tolerance is a little bit higher than some Lourdes but gonna get back to enjoying a blind I'll give you the full review when it's gone song if it's hard for me to even wanna sing along most of the time I just really wanna feel alone I pick a fight when I know that she is an evil wrong and we're so she ain't even gon high so yeah men dobra I like it I enjoyed Mendel crook but thank God today is my rest day from the jump because that is a real indicator I like the smell was a bit very confusing especially I mean I smoke a lot and just oh no it's that is that consumer and me where it's like yo I'm spending money I want to make sure I'm guess I'm definitely no I I assumed and therefore hours in the wrong and the only thing was that was going to change the respondent taste the concert window breath versus the multi box and the preference y'all have a wonderful day I love you all be blessed continue to motivate and inspire come up someone always watch me a little stone I'm starting to scramble my words yeah I have a nice day [Music]", "PYpB7HCjm-s": "[Music] mama I knew I was about it we're evolving you was crowded way before Kevin pull up with the Reverend I told him to level go [ __ ] on the feelings don't not on her face trust me I feel like the me trust me I feel like the wasp rock you can depend on a stock watch [ __ ] I got a young [Music] fresh frozen okay I'm gonna touches my fingers don't get mad it was a fine white powder is now basically caramel I think it's a little bit more pliable than caramel but it's like it's hard you see when I put it on my finger who just wants a stick and dissolve into anything as soon as you start on the nail violently reacts I'm going to see a lot of a lot of clear domes and yeah I just it melts away to say I'd say some of the best level I've ever seen this is the naughty micron so of course I'd say over the whole backs it's probably our favorite this is the 120 on 73 is really nice as well but this and the 122 see - juicy grapes that at least way more oil than residue you know what as soon as you can have it yeah they must be some of the thinnest eyes you've ever watched before they literally we're just like dissolving in the water don't want to be too violent generator making nice slacks or bow ha it's really really a delicate process that's such good because the heads they just explode so you want your returns to stay up you just gotta be a little bit nicer to the product you'll probably see some some better things happen for yourself this stuff is crazy though the terpene profile is yeah I don't think special it blows your lungs up right away it's I'd say this is about a month old now when we first ran it it was super super caustic you know blew your lungs up and then also you talked your brains up that one I'd say it's a little bit more mellow now so but easier to ingest you know I'd say it took way to be without there and think killed me but definitely wrong my head plus we just filmed four minutes before this you know and our camera died so I'm like seven times right now of this 90 days rather in its head yeah this anchor is like it's it's really different it's kind of sweet but it's also fuelie without being like an old party on art but by saying that we do hit a good size that you're gonna notice it there are a lot of terpenes in this and I can't wait to be running again and hopefully test gets the test for you guys BC for the turkey profile does something like this is very unique and getting to try a lot of the Moon River terpenes yeah we've tried a monitor means and I've I've never tried anything like this in malformed it's in mouth but even just the smell of it is that familiar yeah it's it's something different the phenotype is super unique they call it dragon's breath yeah it's definitely that it's like all the parts of my tongue yeah it's like when you put like a song vinegar chip in your mouth just kind of takes over the whole but we play with this in particular strings well I haven't been dipping that strange that's I dip another string into terms of course being out of all these on them you ever right now I'm on some crisp clean air and some great rose they're both super super fired this pushpin has been my favorite for months yeah that's why I go to very very exotic it's like very fruity very tropical [Music] the cleaners by far the best yeah some of the reviews we've had on this melt as well just from you know patience and effort you know I've heard it's very good for sleep very good for nighttime relaxation for a movie or you know and you know with your girl yeah this is even sick even me and Adam I don't think you've got this like crazy before you went make some hash just because I feel halfway through the day they're pretty zonked out you're pulling bags they're wet well that was one of the things about extracts when I started to dad you know we started adding pho at the beginning and everything and certain strains you know wouldn't give you most beating show I thought it wouldn't give me that burnout yeah that's super nice so enjoy or something yeah no if you ever say anything you're hungry yeah this stuff almost gives me that same like it's like yeah it's it's strong yeah I mean for someone you know I know someone who was close to me who was alder and you know it's taking a lot of opiates painkillers and you know we've helped her just switch right over to you know to eating it and smoking rosin or melt and they have you know have no problem getting off of you know any medicine that they around before and this is an older lady as well so it's not like you've got you definitely there's no age demographic to you know how good this medicine can be in you can use it like an atom are right now enjoying each other's company on a sunny day or you can use it because you're in you know severe pain you need to sleep or go to bed then this thing's breath is definitely I just dipped in this cush cleaner I just I don't know we were talking than I did it you know this is definitely gonna be one of those so the Blue River Terps we combine them with something like so powerful like this it creates its own flavor so for instance if you had a you know an OG and then you had a sativa dominant that you dipped into these Turks the outcome of both of those flavors would be different the high in my opinion would be different so yeah let's yeah it's a the cushion cleaners definitely something that it over its said one of the terpene profiles that overpowers or whatever else you're smoking you're gonna taste it more but the other things are still there so they're also going to affect the way that you feel you can get these turkeys from dossier you can order them right to your house it's all good tel aviv oh it's all set up pretty really well done properly yeah pretty big are all in 808 in Canada as well so you're not gonna find any to be your the sea breeze from the river up here at this time anyways but the drippings are on point and unemployed cruise ship we use them all the time most of my friends use them it seems like whoever has access to them it seems to you know concur that it's a great way to you know help a flavor profile that is lacking you press rather than too harshly early way to enhance any rosin or melt that isn't up to your flavor standard or maybe maybe just is that a flavor that you have a lot of and you want to change along the way the Terps are definitely you know a great way to do that that's what I'd say I use them for we normally run three strings at a time and then you know if we have left over from previous ones but I'm a type of guy that if I have something that's fired versus something that isn't I'm not the type to like hold on to the one that's fire I hear smoke the fire the best one I have and I hope it goes wrong and then I just delegate down that down the road mind you nowadays were running such beautiful material that everything is amazing so well milk is a is a great product it's it's quite an expensive product honestly but it's it's not easy to exactly and so the nice thing about yeah you want to keep it cold I mean unless you enjoy that degradation process because this right now was when powdered as soon as Adam walked over and then now it's I can and if we left it on this table for I don't know that's like four or five days it's going to turn into butter that's just you know nothing about great it's still gonna taste a nibbler but I see a lot of people poking fun that you know it's still wet I mean it's sad enough for you strata for 40 hours there's I dealt any moisture it doesn't taste like moisture it only it tastes way better than mud with me before I'd say almost because the dryer is just so long you're only getting the flavor from that what those plant wanted you to get you're not getting all those other you know degradation flavors which comes from you know six days in the drying room bubble block I mean to each is own but since we've been been running with the freezer I've you I loved it I'd say more than any other mode we've made it's been more inspiring to look at but more inspiring to see the degradation process because it happens so quickly with freezer and it's super inspiring to see the head still be intact you know yeah we'll put up a bunch of different pictures we're calling caramel or you know just grease but there is a stage that it's gonna go past this if you don't take care of it even in here your fridge or instead of you know if you live in a basement or something like a cold cellar it doesn't need to be like freezing cold you just don't want it to be warm or room temperature and you'll see a video right now of you know me putting my mouth on the nail I like that process when my mouth does butter out I'll melt it down a bit and then throw a drop of Terps in or you can just mix it up so that's what you guys are seeing right now and two weeks ago I see a lot of people on my Instagram post saying why do you keep covering your mouth and for me I would never do to a big jar it's when I had a little bit left in a jar it open excrete you know or it's all coming on as butter and you know I don't have a scoop around all literally just put it on the top of my nail let it down a bit and then scoop it up and hit it it's a lot easier times back to care so yeah that's my yeah we'll make some more videos in the future just kind of there's just it sucks when you see people get stuff that we're necessarily the way you know take care of it the right way or the way half my costume makers or the company or the dispenser was selling it in terms of storage that's the reality of it and we just try and battle through and educate the best we can and show you what you do with it once it has butter or if you know the best way to enjoy it's fine but some people are so nice on Sunday [Music] I'm Cameron [ __ ] with heavy rain piss on your family [ __ ] was heavy [ __ ] I might so camera this how much [Music]", "aJChdQUbAxo": "[Applause] welcome to the next episode of the blind taste turf challenge this time i have shaman extracts lemon meringue [Music] gmo fuel gmo ice cream cake two of them are sugar diamonds and two of them are batter chips the way this works is i'm gonna mark them so i don't know which is which take a hit of each and see if i can match the strain name with the turks that i'm tasting and rank it from first to least let's get that [Music] yo yo here we go first hit i don't want to turn it too much kind of like some crumbly batter chips [Music] that's the green sticker all right shamans [Music] [Music] oh that's a fatty [Music] let me guess lemon meringue for now get a slight lemon taste to it all right here we go hit number two more of that batter you know how we do we got the blue for hit number two [Music] [Music] so a little bit gassy on that one [Music] we'll go gmo feel say like the one with better or one more a little better all right third head this is more like on the sugar type so kind of a little whitish got the white sticker too [Music] similar smell to it [Music] [Music] uh i'm gonna go with the ice cream cake on that that's similar ice cream [Music] taste wise i'm gonna put it third i think the other two tasted a little bit better [Music] one more to go all right final head of the shaman all club together [Music] that's the yellow like my tank top [Music] do [Music] similar the one before again i kind of get a little gmo taste maybe oh like garlicky that could just be my brain i guess we'll find out in the end i've been like sarah i don't believe i'm right i don't know it's all i get let's get to the results all right time for the results so these are my guesses and the boxes up here the stickers are on them so let's see what we got here lemon meringue green sticker for lemon meringue we have green sticker on the bottom of this we do that's one right i mean these two got to be right because they're the two that were the butter so blue that's it gmo jet fuel blue and then we've got ice cream cake with the white sticker let's see moment of truth this one's right that one will be right white sticker there we go my palette was correct gmo yellow yellow four for four even though they're all very similar you still can pick up just that slight little difference [Music] and i just feel like the taste on the batter was just a little bit better on the taste on this even though this i feel like it's a little easier to dab with than this other stuff over here so let me know what you think all right so here's the overall ranking coming in first place lemon meringue batter chips [Music] second place gmo fuel [Music] third place ice cream cake and last but not least is really similar to the other ones just the other one just had a little something a little bit better gmo sugar diamonds [Music] uh sometimes the garlic paste gets me a little off putting i'm not a big gmo fan but that's what they had and i really wanted to try shaman i used to get shaman back in the day sesh is a local delivery guy used to have some shaman so i really enjoyed their turks so i had to try their recreational turks got an antioch cocoa farms check them out if you're in the area if you see them around pick it up shaman extracts next time you", "MTeZGSFSXHE": "[Music] [Music] hello guys welcome to CCC I'm Shane Danny we're back once again for another string review today we are checking out some Larry breadth from turtle PI company that's right this is the famous gelato 33 crossed with the Mendo breath the Mendo breath I've been noticing everything has breath in it kind of like everything has gelato in it yeah we were talking about the other day right Vado is becoming one of the most heavily cross strains where you're seeing it involved in a ton of new genetics coming out what I've noticed is whatever it seems to be crossed with gelato seems to be really dominant right always yeah yeah but you know honestly who this has a perfect mixture this has a smell like I have never ever smelled before this stuff smells like a freshly cracked box of cereal tricks being the cereal yes I'm glad you said that Rick's bro tricks being the cereal man this stuff smells like tricks bro yeah I real they so you know we crack the bag bag appeal smell both of the it's checking both of those boxes for me it's kind of got some of those typical gelato type nubs that you're gonna see where they're big chunky mixture of some dark purple color with some dark green and light green I got some smaller nugs over here use the ones that we got the close-ups of were the biggest nubs that you save from two ounces yeah and I gotta say they look amazing you know some would argue that it could look a little frosty er but you know the the taste and the flavor makes up for it 100% this is one of those strains I feel like we've a lot of the stuff we've been reviewing lately has had good good nose but it's been more like type of weed where you got a really break into it that full funk this one is a full slap in the face the second you open the bag yeah I mean it's two great parents like we touched on earlier the gelato 33 being honestly my favorite gelato cut it's one of the harder ones to get your hands on I feel like when it hits the shelves it's just like BAM it's [ __ ] gone but and then the Mendo breath being the other parent which again is being poured out kind of kind of frequently these days you know we reviewed I think some garlic breath and there's others you know the layered Allari breath that we're doing right now there's still ton of other ones I can't really think of right now that have Mendo breath as a parent so obviously it's a very stable dominant genetic not saying that it's bad at all but you know that's kind of how Blue Dream eventually lost its popularity and all that was just like it got poured out and I'm saying or just got over produced and I feel like that's kind of what's happening to gelato you know not so much Mendel breath yet cuz it's newer Wow but you know that's that's kind of what I'm hoping that gelato doesn't get hoard out too much because it's a great string the flavor on this is dead-on yeah ompletely true to the smell he literally does smell sweet like a kid's cereal Trix is probably the perfect one to go with something like that Trix or that Lucky Charms you know why I like this weed you know what it kinda reminds me of look this is almost like the best world taken from two of my favorite strengths for those of you that have been watching my reviews for many years you will remember the first time we ever reviewed the pure Kush the Malibu and Hollywood pure fish from MMR spoon which is now green we've reviewed it a few times over the years I've always loved smell and the flavor profile off that we always used to say like it was the cereal milk left over from Lucky Charms you know yeah this has that type of crazy funk but also has like a little bit of that candy purp thing yeah in there right definitely got a little bit of perfection going on that tasted amazing I really just want to touch on that again I just took a bomb grip and it literally tastes like the milk that was left from a bomb bold tricks dude like it's funny that you just said that because I feel like I think even burner has a strain out now called cereal milk if I'm not mistaken but that's a great way to explain these really good indica sweet creamy strains especially this one I'll be the first to come out and say right now you can call your strand cereal milk and call Lucky Charms we were the first ones to say that any type of weed tasted like that and it was that original Malibu a cure cush that stuff like you said it tastes like straight cereal milk you know this is the only other screen I've ever found besides that pure Kush that gives me that same that even touches it on that same flavor so I'm gonna go out there and say it I know there's been a lot of nines and tens thrown around on the show lately but we just been smoking fire on it so if we got a new little plug and you know it's honestly some of the best we that I've smoked on in a minute but this is my favorite stream right now Larry breath I would have called it bird breath I'm sorry I'm gonna knock that that was kind of like look flew right over their head sorry turtle pie but uh I regret this Larry breath aka bird breath is my favorite weed at the moment man I need to go cotton some more ASA just wondering where the Terps came from like obviously you get that sweet kind of grapey candy thing I get that from some gelatos but that sweet cereal milk thing we're talking about I don't know where that's coming from because that's never a Terp I've really associated with gelato even though gelato can be very creamy definitely not a mango correct I'm just like I'm smoking this and I understand where the punch came from I understand that the look came from where did these terms come from I don't know but I am so happy that they came to us on this fine day shout out the turtle pike oh man Larry breath is kickin on all cylinders right now you know the taste and the smell make up for the slightly I guess you could call it enough of these strikes I don't know I'm really [ __ ] high the effect is amazing on this stuff it's giving me like very fork very giggly very giggly high like I said before with a lot of these nutrients especially this stuff with the gelato type genetics I'm not looking for that crazy strike coverage those big heads you know it's not really what I'm looking for with this type of weed this type of weed actually when I look at it maybe doesn't really look like the type of weed that really agrees with my system or that I really like I feel like after smoking this much weed for this long can you almost just kind of look at a bud and smell the bud and be like this is the kind of weed I like look at that that looks like cereal yeah usually don't like weed with this much orange hair on right usually a ton of orange hairs is not really something that I'm looking for personally when I'm shopping for bud but this stuff has a look all its own a flavor all its own it's honestly one of the most unique strains they've come yes in a while dude that's a good [ __ ] word unique this is so unique man it's like honestly it's not gonna pass the stick test at all cuz but dude it though it's another one of those Waunakee those another one of those ones where if you break it open yes right let's break this open and then see it's trapped in there see that'll stay there as long as you and honestly that is a perfect cure and I feel like when it when it is cured right when it does have this texture a little bit not dry on the outside but not as sticky or whatever reason this stays better longer honestly a good cure this should the outside should be a little sticky like this and then the inside should stick just like Shane the inside I could have held that there for five minutes and it would you know it's very very sticky and very stinky once you get into it yeah and if it makes any sense at all this [ __ ] looks like cereal just look at these close-ups and tell me this stuff doesn't look just insane it looks like cereal yeah like fruit loops or something that's insane but yeah Larry Bret I'm putting it on record right now it is my favorite strain at the moment and so at ten for you for sure ten ten yep honestly yeah this one it looks good our first glance first smell I liked it the more I smoke it the more I like it I think this might be the one of the first ones where we both given a 10 I'm giving this one a 10 as well 10 out of 10 it's got me sweating a little bit over here yeah you feel it settle in right behind the eyes yeah I will say after we've been smoking on this for five or six days now yeah I got a few things in the rotation but I keep going back to this one this one hits me quicker and it lives longer this is just amazing lead I mean it's there's no better way to put it guys Larry breath is a win it's a 10 from both of us that's pretty rare he's usually a pretty [ __ ] big stickler over here so tanky men across the board definitely some fire check it out you guys get a chance turtle Paco Larry breath Lam let us know down there in the comments what you guys would like to see on future strain reviews if you guys have been enjoying these strain reviews make sure to smash that like button turn on the belt with notifications so you don't miss future video because we'll be back in the future with more videos that we we're smoking it may be Green and maybe purple it's most like again it definitely won't be brown no no brown weed over here no brown in this town but we'll be back for more next week catch us then to the CCC I'm Shane I'm Danny and we are gone

get the job done look at that just melt right down beautiful all right cheers folks oh wow oh wow the taste is good the taste is really good oh yes i like this it's a very interesting flavor the terps i'm gonna have to go back and look at the profile again but you know what now that i got the jar out i'll do it while i'm talking to you folks here let me pull the rest of this and i'll go through the profile i know i said i wasn't going to do a [ __ ] i'm in a good mood i love it when a plan comes together definitely a little fruity citrusy i like that it was very nice i'm definitely going to go in for another one before we finish this video but let's break down the profile here okay thc 0.66 thca 84.87 thcv 0.72 cbd 0 cbga 4.09 uh cbda zero cbd v0 cbn 0 cbg .87 d8 thc 0.58 with a total cannabinoids of 91.79 it doesn't have the terps listed again i thought it would but you'll have to go check it out on the moxie pen instagram page they do have it there just look for the post that has a stack of these boxes and it'll have a swipe for the full turret profile uh yeah it's not as high as like you know some rhythm and stuff but i'm very pleased so let's go in for another happy dab shall we another happy dab little moxie 710 hooking it up like i'm oh i'm i'm just so happy with this purchase i don't like i said i don't buy their products often and it's not because of the quality it's strictly because of the price and i'm a boy on a budget so it is what it is but when you can get it for the right price hundred percent worth it at all cost every time i get their sand whenever i can usually however this time i did pass up the sand because i bought this that's how much i wanted to try this stuff and as good as it is i'm so glad i got three and a half great jar oh yeah it's not very often i can truly stock up so i'm grateful it's so smooth it's truly a unique flavor i don't even know how to really describe it to be honest with you i just really like it it's sweet without being overpowering it's not so mildest to be unnoticeable but not so strong is to be just crazy in your face nice happy medium for flavor very smooth no throat burn not really any tickle i do enjoy that i'm already getting a nice buzz going to dab in and i'm i'm happy now to be fair i did vape a bowl of flour before i did this but that's it that doesn't really affect me like dabs do i don't do flour that often so it's definitely the jesus og kicking in which is sweet i'm glad i did it worth every penny so with that said thank you very much for tuning in for watching i appreciate all the support i've been getting all the feedback it's been awesome uh instagram facebook all of it i hate facebook so i don't get on there don't even bother but here on instagram are the places to interact

puffing have a great night", "q68boARkLtM": "[Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video I'm at the homie Ben's house he's gonna be playing well in the [ __ ] basically cheating not insane but he's not cheating he's basically leveling up his weapon how come this guy keeps doesn't diet hit you he's for a quest you have to press this thing to kill him for all you allow people if you guys are in the same server as Ben which is probably not likely because there's like what 20 50 s hundreds of servers yeah so most likely you're not gonna be under it's crazy like how many people per server while he's looking at that what I'm going to be reviewing today is this loud packs sativa super Silver Haze and I'm gonna be transparent I did try to review this in my room at night and the lighting was trashed so I am doing it again that's why it's open but even before that that review I opened it before it so it's not really like next guys dog look at me but we got super Silver Haze 70% THC and this was twenty dollars and this was actually so we have some loud pack right here what yeah it was smokin quick and this is live resin sugar he knows 22 out the door oh yeah no dude oh you can you calm down mark alright so right here you can see they're already had no kick at it you feel me but overall from the taste I mean this more like to you well we have this loud pack it smells very citrusy I like it it's a subtle citrus taste later that's probably why I couldn't put my the tip of my tongue on it but let's see hey so very nice consistency like a sauce but sugar at the same time no sauce sugar [Music] we box them [Music] so yeah very subtle citrusy taste but then there's like a weird I don't I described see that's why don't really describe face manwich because not good at it but there is a subtle like fruitiness to it I don't know it's not it's not citrus [Music] I mean by the weight this is the sweater that came out but it was kind of shitty so I am going to do that have another real go ahead it because it's like actually I can't even see [ __ ] so I'm thinking maybe it was like some sort of uh maybe I didn't put the image too big but nonetheless I mean it looks pretty cool and the sweater is actually thinner than you expected so that's why you see me wear a jacket over it because I mean it looks nice still far away but this is like why I designed first and it's not going to be the final thing I'm not even linking or anything so but this is a rough draft of what it's supposed to be looking like it's supposed to be much more detailed than that I mean what can you do I couldn't really like preview the real thing unless it's really ordered and in my face yeah but nonetheless looks pretty dope for what it is I am going to have a better version of it and there's other game there's going to be more designs in the future as well so if you guys are interested in that I won't be posting a link for this because this is not what I want to be selling to you guys something better so actually paid 30 bucks for this that's why I'm wearing it I paid 30 bucks for that city yeah sometimes you just got to make it work you know then take another hit and then give Ben a hit you know laughs we ought to say [Music] you want a regular down down lamb we're gonna let Ben try and see what he thinks on the stuff you know as I figure [Music] [Applause] actually don't taste the citrus it's that's why see that's why I didn't say you said citrus that's like a half your taste I guess but it just tastes like wax yeah there you have it guys yeah just taste like wax I wouldn't be able to tell you by pasted wax that was similar right just like you [ __ ] it I'll try a real dad - you know man yeah and I'm not saying that this isn't as good as a real dad but this is what a real dad is [Music] so like Ben says we are going to sack today so I will try and vlog as much as the day as possible you know alright and hopefully you know we get more than just me and him her cheats you guys missing the are cheats yeah you guys haven't seen that last episode take it out yeah yeah other than that check out our Jays newest video pretty dope just a cute little nephew you know I'm saying and other than that yeah loud pack pretty good for $22 I would recommend it I've seen that pack price for much higher for for less of the mount to so be sure to look at the amount because I've seen loud pack 25 for like 20 something for like 18 or some [ __ ] before so it's definitely I thought why I seriously thought why was this $22 but honestly I'm not I'm not disappointed you know it's pretty good right yeah and it's 70 percent THC so it's definitely up there but not too strong where you get stuck but this is a really good sativa so other than that and I can't drive a fancy car can't afford me [Music] the only person in the world", "a6YtbbzwqrE": "hey guys what's up this is recreational 420 where we give you the most in-depth reviews as efficiently as possible and today we're checking out this lemon breath by sweet as cannabis so with that let's hop right into the numbers so THC comes in at seventy two point eight nine as you can see there and I won't really go into the rest of it because as you know I don't buy my cannabis based off a THC or these numbers back here i buy it based off of the look and a couple other factors which I'll go over in other videos in the future and with that let's go ahead and just get right into it so as you guys know I really do enjoy these guys or this brands packaging just because it's simple it you don't need a lot it's just about the size of a business card and you're good to go it does everything that means it's got their branding up here all their like social media down here and so I just enjoy it I think it's cool this right here doesn't that just look right alright so here's what we got so this is a live resin and let me go ahead and just zoom in for you guys so as you can see this stuff has a nice kind of like pan this is like a sauce almost because well it's got some granules in there as you can see but that once you kind of put them together it turns into one giant like calab so I would call this marva it's like between a sauce and sugar and as you can see that nice little drip there so let's see what we got for as far as smell is concerned oh so this is a nice deep skunk enos ooh with citrusy and piney like sense mixed in there so this is gonna be some really nice and flavorful stuff with that I'm really excited to go try it and I'll be back again with you guys in a couple of days to let you know how this went [Music] [Music] [Music] so I went ahead and tried that lemon breath and as far as the flavors concerned it really just had a nice kind of like lemony citrusy flavor on the inhale once you exhaled you got a little bit more of the skunk enos that kind of lingered around so all around for flavor this was a really good product that I'm happy we picked it up as far as the high this is a functional indica and what that means is if you're a more regular cannabis consumer especially it concentrates this is gonna be something that you're gonna be able to go about your business and enjoy throughout your day I wouldn't recommend this for a newbie throughout the day just because it's still a concentrate and concentrates regardless of how casual they might be or a more experienced smokers somebody who's brand new to concentrates you're gonna get floor it every single time no matter what it is so just keep that in mind and make sure that you take it easy as a newbie but if yours is so again if you're somebody who's a regular cannabis consumer and you like your dabs then this is definitely something worth picking up the flavor once again was amazing and with all that if you guys enjoy what I'm doing go ahead and hit that sub button if you're watching this on Facebook make sure you follow the page this has been recreational 420 and I'll be back again with you guys soon", "vpanwvl64Ro": "[Music] ah [Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you can tell from the title it is a urza video i haven't had urza cartridges or wax in quite some time now and i've seen that they had white tahoe cookies and for those of you who don't know why tahoe cookies has been on the top five strains of uh the potent strains of all time and i've had this in flower form before but never have i had it in concentrate form so when i seen the opportunity to get it well here's the back story it was actually not on display and they said they didn't have any left and i was going to get some other [ __ ] i think it was like sour sour tangy mango or some [ __ ] and then when she was checking in the fridge apparently they still had some white tahoe cookies so i lucked out [ __ ] happy for that and we're going to be hitting it out of the smoke ski and i'll be playing a video it probably is playing already but a video of me opening the package because it is open but you get to see what it is it's running at about 72.93 thc and uh yeah manufactured date october 5th expiration date october 5th next year or this year so it's definitely uh still pretty much new three months or so um and yeah we're gonna take some fat hits uh i will be getting a melt shot of of the ursa you know what i'm saying so you guys can uh have some eye candy i guess for this video because there will be milkage or not milkage uh meltage melted yet so you've already seen it we're gonna be taking a decent sized dab for the homies that's a big one and we're gonna just hit out the smoke ski so with the smoke ski turn it on five times double click you guys know my method i usually let it chill for the whole um session and just to heat up and then the next one i put that in so but yeah like i said i haven't had urza in a while and right off the bat smelling it it smells really really sweet very earthy very uh i don't know how to put my the name on it to it or like the scent to it but it smells i would say a floral but a candiness towards the end which is weird because i thought white tahoe cookies didn't have any fruity smells but that smells fire i don't know definitely some fruity notes in there but some earthy notes as well so turn that off run that and like i said i'm gonna do some melt shots for you yup oh that smells hell of fire you carve that up time to hit it cheers guys so oh there's still a puddle in there that means you can keep going right off the bat when i'm tasting it very um herbaly taste but not bad you get the sweetness that fruity notes towards the end but a very uh urban taste from the initial hit but not bad i've tasted this taste in most live residents but this one's a bit stronger than usual but still good like a vegetable herby taste you know i'm talking about are we chilling i've been loving this thing it may not give the fattest hits but [ __ ] i'll be getting [ __ ] stoned there's still hell on there hello oh you could really milk this thing there's a learning curve with this there's definitely a huge learning curve but once you know how to use this bad boy like i don't know there's something about it there's something about it where i just keep wanting to [ __ ] use it because it's so dope you know and i've been a guy that was like you know i'm not a e-rig person but [ __ ] man i'm sorry to say i switched over but i do like wax pens as well this doesn't last as long as i would like it to so uh having my gobi on me is still [ __ ] the way you know i'm saying so [Music] cheers [Music] [ __ ] yeah they're still hella no there's no always i was gonna clean it but i'll take one more hit for the people you know it's not every day you get white tahoe cookies in a concentrate form so let's get it let's get it not a big one not as big as that first one but we're gonna get it here definitely something i would buy again uh i've been a fan of white tahoe cookies ever since i tried the flower and also since i've seen it on the list it made me want to get it even more than i've already wanted to you know and it was 27 out the door uh finos so it's definitely not bad and let's just milk that [ __ ] [ __ ] up [Music] cheers guys okay all right the last hit because i know there's still some we're gonna let that show but i spoke about this before how these hits may not be as fast as the wax pens but it's all about what you're accustomed to you build up a tolerance to what device you use i'm used to the go b i'm used to the utility five i'm not used to this so i'm coughing the hits may not look as fat as you would see from the go beer from the other wax pen uh utilian but like i'm telling you i still get high and i feel like i cough more i don't [Music] know cheers guys all right damn i definitely feel it it's because i [ __ ] was taking these long ass hits making me no oxygen in my brain i think i'm lightheaded because of that mostly but i'm definitely feeling the high acetylene oh [ __ ] but yeah it's just easy as that cleaning it oh wow guys that is it for the urza hopefully you did enjoy the video it is definitely a must cop i've always been a fan of urza's products you know i've never had a bad urza like gram of wax or cartridge other than that hopefully you did enjoy this video peace out guys [Music]", "Du6zVZs9XbE": "okay hello everybody um I am at day 20 a flower with this mindo breath it's all going great it's all gonna be this what you see on the screen right there in the middle there's gonna be one giant bug these will be pretty big too they're already quarter to perhaps a half dollar size flowers and they're not even in real true budding stage yet so yeah that's that's gonna be good all right that's really all I got that's what I got left as you see Maui hash bud has been harvested and it is over there just chilling dry in one giant bud it's pretty much an ounce of good stuff but um yeah Mendo Brett that's what you'll be seeing now for the next few weeks the next five weeks it's been a while yet to go so alright thanks for watching everybody all right hello everybody here I am a day forty of flour with this Mendel breath everything's going great you can see the transformation that has happened in the last 20 days gorgeous bugs on this it's only gonna yield about a 20 grams or so it's gonna be very very good stuff trying to get as much as I can big old buds they're about the size of a golf ball on the side and then this main one here is about a six inch just mean cola so um still got a little bit of bulk enough to do maybe another week or so and then after that I'm gonna start flushing so for two weeks and then after that we'll be all done we're on the 25th of May I expect to harvest so that's all I got for now I'll be back at about day 60 when it's time for Arvest okay everybody here I am day 62 flower with this Mendel breath everything is going wonderful and it is harvest day stuff looks absolutely amazing and it is super super dense I mean it's rock hard especially this Mane bud right here yeah rock hard super dense even these side ones are like that some of you might say it's an early harvest but no not really it's it's pretty much Darren I like to harvest a few days earlier than most anyways because I don't really like the [ __ ] lock I don't like to have amber trichomes or all 100% cloudy trichomes I like to have kind of a 50/50 mix of clear and cloudy trichomes like I have now as you can see zoom in to that see how they're mostly cloudy but little mixed just like I like mostly cloudy inside and then they're kind of clear on the outside which is just how I like most of the hairs are still our orange now so earnest time has arrived go ahead and turn it so good man smells proof very strong just like that cherry pie only it doesn't have the nutrient burn quite as bad kind of the little bit on the tips of the leaves but that is absolutely nothing to worry about that little bit because I'm harvesting today I'm cutting all those off so here's the bud size proportionate to my hand not quite as big as the Maui hash bud but it's still a pretty good size bud that's like from this point forward there there's probably about 10 gram bud right there may be the total harvest will probably be about 20 to 25 grams not bad for a 1 quart Cup once again Mendel breath", "Gr5HJi8KZgM": "my name is trina i'm a medical cannabis patient i retake of cannabis on a regular basis for ptsd arthritis in both my knees and ankles social anxiety and a few other conditions you can learn more about to watch in the previous shows on this channel this is the productive cannabis connoisseur a channel dedicated to medical cannabis patients and adults 18 and older so today i'm going to be reviewing the strain called mendo breath i've never tried it before uh i just bought it today it was on on sale so i love those sales so i'm just going to open it now for the first time i'll be trying it for the first time on this channel so here we go um so some nice sized nugs in there it smells really good let me show you what it looks like looks really nice this one's shaped like a heart look at that i've been i've been finding a lot of things shaped like a heart for the longest for years and it's funny because my astrological sign says i have to pay attention to my heart you know and look at that awesome so um i found a review on wiki on that wikileaks so here we go um i'm gonna fill up the bowl with some of this minto breath i almost don't smoke this because it's shaped like a heart i wish i could take a photo of that it almost seems like i shouldn't smoke this and just take a photo of it let me find another one or maybe it was meant to be because of my heart i'm just gonna do it okay i'll drive the bottom part of it at least hope you guys are having a good day today my day is going okay i went on a walk um got some sunshine on my skin and uh yeah it's pretty chilly here in sunny california right now it's not quite spring yet um it's getting inching its way there though all righty cheers and thanks for joining me today oh yeah that's delicious um that is very good that's excellent and for what i paid for it oh my god so let me read to you mendo breath um so it's saying it's relaxed these effects you'll get you'll feel relaxed happy and sleepy mindelbreath is an indica a marijuana strain made by crossing ogkb with mendo montage this strain produces a euphoric high with powerful body effects that help relieve pain and discomfort middle breath smells like sweet vanilla and caramel while it may be attempting to smoke this strain during the day it's important to save it for after work or before bed growers say mendel breath comes in dense frosty buds and has an average flowering time of 60 days so yeah the feelings they say like i said relaxed happy sleepy euphoric uplifted and then they say uh not much on the dry mouth or dry eyes or paranoia anxiousness or dizziness none of that it's not really high up there actually on the dry mouth it's high up there like 22 percent so drink lots of fluids but you want to drink lots of floats anyway when you're smoking so that's just a given um then it says uh helps with stress pain anxiety insomnia and depression so there you go mendo i like this this is really nice um it's an indica strain and i like indica strands i like all kinds of strains but indica is my favorite and today i did buy a another strain that isn't indica so um i'll do a review on that soon but yeah this is a really good strain um it's saying that it had hints of vanilla i think they were saying with this in this review [Music] uh sweet vanilla and caramel let me see if i think that that's what i experienced from smoking this hold on okay now i know what they're talking about yeah i tell i can smell the caramel coming out of my nose the smell kind of smells yeah it kind of has that smell like caramel corn kind of smell it's nice it's very very pleasant i think if people aren't used to smoking indica then probably this would not be your first choice um but maybe it would be your first choice if you want to alleviate pain right away this may be just for you so um i like it it feels very mellow and it didn't feel harsh on my throat when i was smoking it i noticed that with a lot of indica strains that they tend to be metal on the throat a lot of the sativa strains i've smoked have been pretty much more harsh on the throat but here's the exception when i grew some sativa strains back when i used to grow cannabis i grew cannabis for four years with my husband and we grew some sativa strains and none of those sativa strains were harsh on our throat so i feel like probably what's going to hap what's happening with the harshness of the throat experience is because people aren't flushing out the nutrients towards the end of the cycle the growing cycle so um really get yourself a good book if you're having a problem with that and experiencing that with your herb that you're growing get yourself a good book on growing and one that i always keep saying over and over to get is the cannabis encyclopedia because it has everything so anyway thanks for joining me for this quick little review on the string called mendo breath i really like it a lot it does have that caramelly vanilla flavor and aroma to it it's making me feel really relaxed and um yeah i'm going to be looking forward to working more on this drying i've been working on so yeah so yeah thanks for joining me i hope this helps anybody that needs help finding the specific strains for their needs as i said i prefer indica the most um i do smoke some sativas here and there but i do prefer indica for what i'm dealing with so yeah so if you want to look and learn any more about any of the more strands that i've smoked before you can check out my playlist for uh medical cannabis strains and education under that playlist and you'll see all the other strains i've smoked before and what i think about them and what they do for me my body mind and my soul so thanks for joining me very

Michael Papa Papa chiropractic centre so he can clarify all the confusion surrounding this particular type of first aid then a story that asks where will help be ten years from now will you be as healthy as you are today is there a possibility to be even healthier well let me tell you it is possible we'll be doing dr. Michael dou T of Doty chiropractic so he can share with us his keys to achieving the goal of help over the next ten years so plan ahead and your planning however I hope that you will plan on paying attention to a very important story that most people are plainly uncomfortable talking about well for that reason we have invited once more our nutritionist Susan Schofield so she can sit down and talk to you about the importance of cleansing our elimination system not exactly the common table talk if you know what I mean but it is so important to what often happens behind the table I mean all the things we eat and their effects on our overall health and well-being trust me you'll want to stay for this one then a more sensitive subject that affects many children in embarrassing ways often isolating them from their peers and causing infuriating frustration for their parents I'm talking about bedwetting bedwetting a gravely misunderstood condition that has often seen miraculous results through chiropractic care that is why I've dr. Rob Senate a family chiropractic clinic is here to dispel the frustrating myths correct false notions and offer hope to millions of children who would just love to know for themselves what all the fun of childhood is all about they deserve that don't you think bedwetting however is just one of many childhood conditions chiropractic has been successful in dealing with chiropractic could make a difference in your child's health from the day they are born and that exactly what our next guest dr. chrissy otto of otto chiropractic will touch upon should not only share why it is so important to have your children checked but also the moms to be daring and after their pregnancy listen I know it's not exactly the subject I'm really qualified to talk about even though I'm a father and was there for my wife side during my child's birth I recognize however that it will never equal knowing what it's like to carry and give birth to the baby so why don't I hand the story over to dr. Christie now a mom and a chiropractor now how great is that [Music] is chiropractic safe for pregnancy and kids well today I'd like to talk about that I do have personal experience I do have three children that I received chiropractic care from all through my pregnancies and dealing with what you go through as a pregnant mom all the changes that your body go through so that you can adapt and and grow this perfect little perfect baby the prenatal care that you receive from a doctor of chiropractic is safe and it's probably the best thing that you can do for your body not only from a biomechanical standpoint you have the ability to grow this placenta grow this baby and of all the changes that are going on in your body and you have this you have a lot of you have a weight gain you have all these hormonal changes that are going on perfectly normal and you have to have them but sometimes with this extra weight you may have back pain or neck pain or inability to sleep at night just with the tension on your spine what a doctor of chiropractic does is analyze the spine and it maybe look a little bit different than a normal visit for someone who's not pregnant chiropractors have a unique tables designed so that when you lay face down you have an opening for this this growing baby of yours and so it makes it absolutely comfortable to get adjusted the other aspect of things is when you get adjusted by a doctor of chiropractic yes to restore function in that joint so that you can get out of pain and have some relief and I personally had that I was I've had three kids and I gave them I gave birth to them at home by my choice I chose that because it was a beautiful setting I didn't have people rushing around me and strangers in my room it was a beautiful relaxing experience I was able to labor I actually had very short Labor's and most women that are receive chiropractic care throughout their pregnancy will report that their Labor's are not the average 24 mine were 45 minutes two hours and my longest was four-and-a-half hours and that that tells me that chiropractic helps with your efficiency of allowing the pelvis to open up and then the least traumatic way to get this baby out and this so you can enjoy this beautiful little baby from a nutrition standpoint of prenatal care and receiving chiropractic care if if the mother is getting adjusted she's able to absorb the food better so she has less heartburn so she can digest the food so that they can pass through the placenta so this Fitness growing baby can receive a nutrition that it receives I also want to talk about even postnatal care I used to be able to go out and check patients while they're in labor they come to the office they get adjusted to go back to the hospital and have an easy birth because what if the spine is locked up or the pelvis is locked up even adjusting that spine wallets and labour allows that pelvis to open up even ten percent more ten percent is the big thing when you're dealing with with delivering a baby but allowing that pelvis to open up so you can have the least traumatic birth on the mom and the baby I'd like to talk about postnatal care also the trauma of a birth process for the baby is probably hope one of those traumatic events that baby can go through there's a lot of molding of the skull just the pressure the torsion on the spine the neck the best thing that you could do for your baby if you want to give it to the gift to last a lifetime is to get adjusted by a doctor of chiropractic the doctor of chiropractic analyzes the the baby's spine and and adjusts it so they can restore this function if you think of some of the normal processes birth birth process that I hear coming into my office even with a vacuum suction when you when they pull on the baby it takes a hundred and twenty pounds of pressure to decapitate a baby 120 pounds is most doctors weigh more than that so when they're pulling on this baby's neck the torsion that the trauma that this baby's neck receives well in any wonder why the baby has colic or torticollis or cries excessively I had one patient that drove 45 minutes because her child had had nine-hour crying stance it's sleep for 15 minutes and it cry for nine hours the baby got adjusted and the mom called me after six hours the baby was sleeping for six hours and she was like is he supposed to be sleeping this much yes it's been crying this much lettuce sleep and in fact that's one of chiropractics best success stories the other things I want to talk about is even just nursing if I hear a lot of women having trouble with their baby in their nursing or it didn't work out for them getting the baby adjusted getting the mom adjusted so that they can work together as a team I thought it was the most natural thing in the world and then when I had my own babies nursing was a challenge they don't tell you this get support get help ask your doctor of chiropractic to help you they will do great if they needs to adjust a jar or whatever it whatever it is out there whatever the problem is get it adjusted so that you can enjoy this baby not a crying baby a peaceful sleeping baby some of the things I want to talk about with kids getting adjust with kids I hear so many patients coming in and their kids are on a DD Ritalin Adderall they have all these labels but they're on all these drugs and I guess the most important thing that I want to stress that getting that child adjusted takes that tension off this growing need five six seven and eight year old child so they can sit if they don't have the ability to save mom my neck hurts and some do they'll tell you but when this child is under tension their spine their you know that they hurt but they don't have the words to tell you and the teachers say oh they have a disruption they can't sit in class why don't we put them on a DD meds or Ritalin or adderall from a neurological aspect what that does is it totally changes the whole brain chemistry you talk about a drug problem in the United States right now it's starting with these kids they need a chiropractic adjustment to get the kids to function better they function better they'll do better in school I want to touch base on the the adderall and Ritalin the studies out there right now show that when you when a child takes adderall or Ritalin or these speeds them up so fast it calms them down so thinking you know be happy Johnny in class and get along and not be disruptive in the classroom when a child is on that it doesn't even take that long three months that they're on Ritalin or adderall it totally changes their brain chemistry like I said it speeds them up so fast that it calms them down but the longer that that child is on these medications you have it totally changes it creates all these receptor sites in their brain now as the brain matures say 16 17 18 all of a sudden they're still taking this they step they the brain matures and it flips so instead of speeding up to slow down it works like it does it speeds them up is that's what a huge epidemic in the colleges is out right now the taking adderall so they can study longer what that does it creates a huge drug problem in the brain you have all these receptor sites these receptor sites that are you've been taking this drug all along it doesn't change these receptor sites are there you your brain says oh my gosh I have to have this and studies show that it's not a matter of if that child will become an addict on meth or heroin or whatever the drugs are out there it's a matter of when they have the receptor sites their brain says feed me I need these drugs oh there is another solution out there if your child has these symptoms please contact your doctor of chiropractic ask questions they're on your side there are other alternatives out there so just to reiterate chiropractic is absolutely safe and effective well the most like I said the most effective thing out there is getting getting the spine analyzed by a doctor of chiropractic so that when they're in school they can actually function and learn like you want them to and also behave - um so I guess I want to leave you with a couple things I'm just restoring that function allowing the body to work like it should suffering is optional and chiropractic is absolutely a safe and and effective [Music] Thank You dr. Christy if you are pregnant or know of someone who is whether it be family a friend please share this information everybody has a right to know the importance of chiropractic care during this crucial time of pregnancy embassy and childhood if you have any more questions after watching this segment however turn to your chiropractor and if you do know of someone who is pregnant or is looking to have children to come in and see your chiropractor by the way did you know that chiropractic care has had great results with infertility but we'll save that for another time right now know that you can give a gift of help to both mom and baby and all it takes is sharing the information you've just learned on our show now how simple is that now let's move on to our next story we all know an important element to help is exercise no matter how vigorous your exercise program accidents happen twists sprains pulled muscles and to be honest injuries like these can happen anywhere not just on the gym floor wrong step off the sidewalk a spring chasing your kids a strain at work so what do you do when these types of injuries happen well of course you should get in as early as possible to see your chiropractor if it's serious enough let's say a broken bone your injury may even warrant a ride to the emergency room however if it's less than that should you ice warm the area with a heating pad and for how long for either one how about slathering on some pain gel is it important to raise or lower the injured area it is really confusing there's so much misinformation out there so let dr. Michael Papa set you straight from professional athletes to weekend warriors dr. Papa has seen it all and is here to offer you a clearer guide of what you can do to help yourself dr. papa [Music] being in practice over 20 years and treating a lot of injuries on athletes as well as just general patients sooner or later when you start a workout a running program you pick up tennis golf injuries will occur so the question is okay what do I do when I first get injured that's a question that a lot of patients have then not really sure should I put ice on it should I put heat on it should I continue to play should I work through the pain and one of the biggest misconceptions is work through the pain well guess what if you're a runner and you twist your ankle don't continue to work through the pain if you're having knee problems hip problems shoulder elbow wrist do not continue to work through the pain so what should I do well everybody's kind of heard of the old adage rice which means rest ice compression elevate it's extremely important that you abide by this types of injuries whether you're at home whether you step off a stair whether you're running and down a track or whether you're following through with the tennis shot and you get an injury the initial step is very similar or almost identical so one is you want to ice okay it's extremely important that you ice that you secondly get off of it if you're standing on your foot your hip your ankle the thing you want to do is one sit down stay off it if it's your shoulder your elbow or your wrist you want to bring it close to your body and keep the weight off of it keep it elevated okay now patients say okay doc I shouldn't heat well what do I need to do I go home I can't get to my doctor I can't get to the hospital I can't get to him urgency room I'm not sure what's going on well one as we said stop doing the activity that you're doing don't continue to play like patients tell me I was golfing doc through my hip out on the second hole and it was hard to walk and my question to them is would you do they stated I continued to play well you don't want to continue to play you want to stop you play you want to stay off of the joint whether it's your ankle your knee or your hip even if it's the shoulder or the low back second is you want to be able to ice several different ways to ice and that's gonna be kind of critical based on the area of the body your icing okay one if you don't have a gel pack like this then we recommend if you're home and you have a bag of frozen peas or frozen vegetables you utilize that okay you put it over the area but before you put it over the area you want to put a towel or sometimes a towel doesn't allow enough cold you put something like a t-shirt and you put that area say on the t-shirt you put that down on the shoulder if it's a shoulder injury and then you put the ice on top okay you never lay on the ice because then you'll be compressing the joint which is swollen now back to the joint that we're dealing with if you're dealing with a swollen ankle for instance I've seen ankles which were extremely swollen I just knew if I took an x-ray of it it's gonna be broke and it wasn't why sore ankles that have very little swelling if I took an x-ray of it I thought it would be fine but we rule it out and in cases there is a fracture so never try to determine that for yourself without seeing your physician that's why it's critical it's very difficult to determine whether you actually broke something in an extremity or not so always assume you want to stop playing and you want to put the ice on now there's other ways to ice the other way is you get a bucket full of water with ice in it you can submerge your ankle in it - you feel it which is very effective but you can't keep it in there for a good length of time which we're going to get into in a second then you want to always make sure you elevate it how do you elevate well and what is the purpose of elevation one is elevation is to allow gravity to help you pull it's inflammation and fluid out of the joint by elevating it the inflammation will go down towards the ground so you can use the vegetables you can use gel you can use water with ice okay if you don't have any of those but you have a ziploc with ice and you and it's of an area where you can't put underwater what you want to do is you want to put ice in it a little bit of water put a ziploc always put something on the skin so you don't freeze or burn your skin you don't get the ice burn you want to put a t-shirt or a towel on top of that area and then the ice on top you never want to compress or put pressure against another surface and that ice which will cause more of an irritation to it okay you want to keep that extremity with as little motion and a little pressure on it other than the ice now how long should i ice doc well you want to do 10 to 15 minutes at a session because ice over 15 minutes so long it can become an irritant to the area so you want to be able to do 10 minutes 15 minutes on 10 to 15 minutes off and you want to continue that cycle for several hours now if you have other things to do or you can't continue the ice that often then you want to do in blocks of half hours ten on ten off ten on it's a half hour and do that for a couple hours throughout the day using half hour blocks so when you're off the extremity that's one thing by staying second is you want to put a piece of towel the ice on top and you want to make sure it's elevated to get that inflammation down you want to always decrease the inflammation as much as you possibly can determining on your own whether I tore something whether I just strained a muscle whether I hurt my back or it's a disk herniation or a fracture is not up to you it's up to your physician your chiropractic can help you with that walk you through it and explain the history you give him when you go in is extremely important if you've ever had a fracture before if you ever had injury to that area before if you're an athlete just starting to Train if you're seasoned athlete and you understand what you've done and how many times this is possibly has happened before all of that information helps the physician even if it's on the phone before he sees you to give you better advice so initially when you first get hurt the rule is first 72 hours you want to ice second is you stay off of it third is you don't want to ice more than ten to 15 minutes at a time and the next is to make sure you get in and seeing you see your physician patients will say well I can put this bengay on or I can put Biofreeze on I could put these types of gels and this icy hot and so forth not mentioning product names but overall ice by itself is the best thing you can do because it works as a pain reliever it reduces the inflammation which that's why you don't want heat because heat will create inflammation okay and you want to stay off it the gels the creams and so forth aren't necessarily something I recommend to patients in the first 72 hours because it may mask it but ice is going to give your physician the best type of scenario if you go in saying I've iced it the last 24 hours then you're going to get the best results so one you want to make sure you call you a chiropractor get the best advice get in to see them and use something to help support your weight when you're getting in there like crutches or a cane if it's an ankle or a knee problem so thank you for your time have great [Music] thank you dr. papa this is the kind of first aid information that we should all know if you see someone doing things wrong like heating and already inflamed and irritated area share the information that you've learned but remember when these types of injuries happen even if you are a tough guy don't continue to exercise and get checked as soon as possible by your chiropractor and while seeing your chiropractor don't forget to mention injury to him or her no matter how small or insignificant you think it is even though the pain might have society you never know what kind of underlying problem the injury may have caused that might resurrect itself down the road remember a subluxation caused by even the smallest injury can have significant effects later on it's another reason why taking pain relievers and masking the pain is not the best choice yes the pain may have been lessened or even gone but the underlying problem is still there so when those types of injuries happen get yourself checked by your chiropractor so you can be on the road to recovery sooner and back to living a healthy active life speaking of a healthy active life will you be as active and healthy ten years from now as you are at this moment it is possible you know and to help us achieve this goal of being as healthy if not healthier 10 years from now let's join dr. Michael Doty as he shares with us his keys to help that can help you achieve this 10-year goal dr. Doty [Music] can you be healthier ten years from now than you are today today we're going to talk about some keys to healing and growth that hopefully will help you become healthier ten years from now so we know that that will be the case our first key that we're going to talk about today is laughter laughing out loud we know how important laughter is and laughter is a good medicine we know that literally when you laugh there's chemicals that are released in the body that help you not only fight off disease but handle your day-to-day stresses and you know who doesn't feel better laughing our second key that we're going to talk about today is breathing now we know that obviously breathing is very important but I think we take it for granted those day to day you know we don't think about our breathing and what I like to teach people especially our practice members is to make sure that when you're breathing we have a breathing technique that where we take a deep breath in and you hold it take a little bit more in and hold it and then take a third breath in and hold it for as long as you can and then release it out what that does is that draws oxygen deep down into your lungs so you can oxygenate the cells as the blood goes through that and obviously the oxygen obviously is very important to the function of our bodies our third key that we like to talk about is liquid energy and what I mean by liquid energy is hydration and when people think about hydration what they think about is drinking water and that is very true we want to make sure that you're drinking a good source of clean pure water we definitely need that but I also want you to think about things such as raw fruits and vegetables and the vital waters that are contained within them see when we're eating those raw fruits and vegetables we're also getting hydration from the water and in those those foods so think about adding that in as well to make sure that you are plenty hydrated obviously our bodies over 60 percent water so we definitely need to make sure that we have that water in there so it can things can flow through our body and our cells can function at 100% our fourth key what we look at is building blocks and what I mean by that is nutrients and the foods that we eat now what we tell people is if you want to be more alive than dead you need to be eating foods that more alive and dead and so you know there's a real key you know that you can think about what this is that the closer you are to the farm the better it is for you and so when whenever we have people who you know are wondering you know what should I be eating just think about this before you put it into your mouth ask yourself this question will this clog me or will this cleanse me well this moved me towards fatness or will this move me towards fitness I think that you know we pretty much know what foods are going to do that for us so just think about that when before you put anything into your mouth ask yourself those questions and if you want to be a jet you need to have that jet fuel the fifth key that we're looking at today is exercise or what we call fulfillment we need to have some kind of dynamic activity throughout the day the reason being is you know our bodies are used to what we do day to day so literally what we need to do is we need to add some extra kind of activity on to that you know whether that is you know some kind of you know working out with repetitions and weights and resistance training or some kind of cardiovascular or even you know better both of those type of things that's going to help your body handle your day-to-day stresses we know that exercise is huge for things like depression and other other illnesses that exercise literally helps us function better and definitely helps us handle our day-to-day stresses the six key that we want to talk about is catching your Z's or that dynamic rest at night those who don't get you know enough sleep or are you know can't sleep very well you know how you feel the next day it's not fun so the big thing is we want to make sure that we're able to get that dynamic rest at night so that we can not just go through life but we can growth life there's many ways that you know help you get good sleep at night and definitely if you have any questions about that talk to your chiropractor however the one thing is is if we're not getting the good sleep that's when we do a lot of our healing and we need to make sure that we're getting our healing during that sleep time so we have dynamic activity through the day you need to balance that with dynamic rest at night now our seventh key is something that we call sunshine and obviously it's exactly what we're talking about getting out and getting some sunshine and our basic level we're all light energy the fact is we need to bring energy in to function and getting even 20 minutes a Sunday is huge as far as getting you to do what you need to you know to function and getting that vitamin D in your body and what we want to you know this thing is it's free it's easy to do and it's one of those things that hopefully we can get get out there and get a little bit of sunshine and you guys feel a little bit better after getting a little bit of sunshine our eighth key is looking at cleaning up and greening up the one thing about this is we know that the stuff that we use to clean chemicals can be huge toxins and can be a huge stress and as far as what's going on and the one thing is is not only the stuff that we're using around us to clean but the things that we're using on us on our skin which is one of the largest organs of the body it absorbs these toxins and can be a really harmful for your health so take a look at what you're using to clean take a look at what you're using around you you know as far as like clean materials and also what you're using on your skin and other things that could be toxic and could be causing some major issues as far as those chemical stresses our ninth key is looking at positive thinking and it's more than just positive thinking that's the one thing is we know that what we want to do is we want to move towards something we want we want to create something why instead of getting away from something we don't want and we understand that as we what we focus on is what we tend to bring about so it is definitely more than positive thinking it's also quieting our mind we need to do that throughout the day we need times where we literally quiet our mind and allow our bodies just to get some of that quiet time so if you can find times throughout the day just to take your time and quiet yourself that is great and that that'll be a huge part to handle your day-to-day stresses now the 10th key is looking at walking the tightrope and what I mean by that is balance in all areas of your life when we're looking at all the different areas of our life whether it's family whether it's job whether it's spiritual whether it's health whether you know whatever area that we need to put into our life we need to to make sure that we're spending time in all of those areas of life now are we going to be completely balanced absolutely not that's just you know not really possible but if we spend a little time in each area that light of our lives it's going to make a big difference overall and how you're handling your day-to-day stresses and the 11th key is making sure that you have a line spine in a connected mind with this we need to know that our nervous system is functioning at 100% and to know that you need to know that we have a spine that is aligned and functioning at a higher percent so it can connect the brain in the body to do what it needs to do on a daily basis so those are the the keys to make sure that you will be healthier and happier in ten years from now if you have any questions about any of the lifestyle stuff that we talked about today please ask your chiropractor and I also want you to think of the people around you your loved ones your friends can they benefit from some of this information can they benefit from getting chiropractic adjustments please you know refer them in to the chiropractor that you're seeing so they can be stronger healthier and happier ten years from now [Music] dr. Doty thank you that was priceless information can you incorporate those 11 keys into your own life so you can reap the benefits 10 years later you know if you've been watching our show and applying our tips on exercise breathing and nutrition you may not know it but you might be on your way already it doesn't have to be hard or complicated so again I do urge you to share this information you never know how you might change someone else's life for the better now going back to nutrition however did you pay attention when dr. Doty mentioned when you put food into your body you should ask will this clog me or cleanse me well I connect that to our next story as I mentioned earlier nutritionists Susan Schofield will be joining me to discuss exactly that being or not being clogged I know it's not a typical subject for polite company but the reality is it's an important aspect of our health and we need to talk about it our lamination system and how well it functions directly relates to our overall health and well-being so please don't leave it in the dark instead let's join Susan Schofield now for a look at what we need to do to keep this important system healthy [Music] as I said earlier we're going to be talking about something most people don't want to discuss but we had today with us nutritionist Susan Schofield who will help us ease into the head so how are you I am great good to have you back you're wondering crazy stuff so mmm cleansing most people think of cleansing as going taking a shower to get a bath whatever but we're we're not talking that we're talking about cleansing the insides of your body right we're talking about internal cleansing yes what we want to realize today is health begins in the colon hmm okay very very crucial in colon cleansing is a part of your natural body's process when it comes to digestion assimilation and absorbing your foods and using your foods but there's a lot of misconception of what normal elimination is okay so I don't want to shock you now but you're meant to have three to five bowel movements a day three to five yeah three to five yep all right so three to five well done with each meal mm-hmm one when you get up in the morning and one prior going to bed and they're meant to be around six to 12 inches in length Wow okay that's a lot that's any difference because most people don't think of it that way most people don't think of the importance of it actually and I guess they don't pay attention most people don't they don't pay attention because of our lifestyle and the stress that we're under but today I know we're focusing on the colon but you also want to realize between having your three to five bowel movements a day you're also meant to naturally eliminate eight pounds of toxic waste through your five major channels of elimination wow that's a low yeah it is a lot but that's what normal that's what normal is and your other eliminating organs obviously you have your colon or your bowels you have your skin which is your largest eliminating organ never thought of it that way yeah II understand and then you also have your kidneys your lungs and your lymph system which all contribute to that eight pounds of toxic material being yeah being eliminated and people like you said they think about when they think about cleansing and hygiene they think about externally Drott internally even though we take our car to the mechanic and we have our fluids checked and our oil change analogy like we also know what happens when the pipes and our homes get clogged drains get backed up and that waste comes back into your home rather than you know being eliminated through the plumbing system in your house so the cleansing process is very natural but what we want to do is is assist that process and in today's society constipation just happens to be the number one ailment out there really so as you if you're not eliminating properly if you're not having the 3 to 5 bowel movements a day that back up that toxic waste has to go or stay somewhere and when it isn't eliminated then you're going to have you're gonna manifest other symptoms like bloating and gas and Crohn's and IBS irritable bowel diverticulitis vitina all of those things come from the lack of proper digestion and elimination Wow so I mean nobody wants to talk about it and like you're saying our lifestyles have changed I guess dramatically from a long time ago with the stress and of course the foods we eat we talked about that so much on here about proper nutrition I mean I'm sure that helps too oh it definitely helps and so for people you know if they're they're asking well where where should I start how can I assist the body in this natural process the first thing that you would do is increase your fluid intake increase your water intake okay so number one rule is you get up in the morning before you have your cup of coffee before you eat your breakfast you want to have 8 ounces of good pure clean water ok now we're good if you want to drink somewhere between 8 and 12 glasses of water throughout the days we do that yes see we're in Arizona area and we do a lot of that here so that's change for me too but and the point you made about your skin because it's so hot here I realize that too I'm eliminating a lot more water that way because what you want to do is you want to hydrate your body but you also want to assist the kidneys in their elimination and that takes pure clean water you know just everything yep which I absolutely good the second thing the second thing ok that's right you've got a lot of it so the second thing that you need to do is improve your fiber that's what I was going to ask you ok see I knew your question I know it's you know you need to improve your fiber and in days gone by that came through our vegetables and our fruits but today we aren't consuming the same quantity of whole pure natural organic you know a homegrown right fruits and vegetables and we touch on this so much here too because it's it's a natural greens more vegetables reading your labels and everything we're all back to that because there's so many chemicals out there and you were talking about toxic elimination I never thought of that 8 pounds I mean if I'm eating healthy you're still telling me there's still toxicity and just eating that waste product ok well yeah it's waste product when it's it's and it's not eliminated it becomes toxic it putrefies because it's it's not it's not being eliminated and so the fiber helps increase that mobility that movement in your intestinal tract in your colon and then the other thing today that we suggest is that people increase their psyllium their psyllium whole intake that also is a high fiber food Bachelor but yeah it's a high fiber food plus it will start absorbing that toxicity that has just been sitting there Wow so first we want to increase our our water intake second we want to you know increase our fiber intake and then along with that we want to look at our diet okay okay and we want to constantly improve our diet and when you are cleansing you want to eat more vegetarian type you know eating style so you want to increase your vegetables you want to increase your fruits you want to decrease your processed refined foods your wheat your dairy because what we're trying to do when we're cleansing is we're we're trying to give our body foods that it can break down and assimilate easier and assist in that cleansing process okay then the next step is to actually do herbal supplementation ask you that because you're also talking about natural food so for we're getting away from all the processed foods and we're getting back to natural that's going to aid a lot in our digesting and getting stuff too so back to labels and getting rid of the chemicals and everything and now herbal supplements we talked about that I take chlorella and and remember you talked about that before it has a lot of fiber and it's my greens also so that's a start that's a great story I'm getting there yep so I'm working my way yep that's a great start so what other herbal supplements possibly well there's there's a there's a lot of herbal companies out there that prepackaged specific cleanses but what's very important when you're working with someone or when you go to buy a cleanse you want to you know you want to buy a cleanse from a quality company and for example when when I work with an individual I find out their strengths and weaknesses health-wise because sometimes I have to start out very simple very gradual very gentle and then work into a more potent and specific cleanse with somebody for example that has inflammation in their intestinal tract has the IBS or the diverticulitis we might just start out with liquid aloe vera and liquid chlorophyll and chlorella and just focus on green and then once that healing takes place then we'll move into a colon cleanse which has the psyllium hulls the marshmallow and pepsin the the dog the marshmallow marshmallow and pep-talking marshmallows no no absolutely not marshmallow and pepsin you call my probiotic marshmallow I mean we joke around and wait because this is a serious subject and it is it makes people uneasy talking about your bowel movements and things I mean it does nobody really wants to talk about it it's very it's very personal it's very personal it's very important and when you start doing colon cleanses you will become what I call a stool watcher because oh no that's a gameshow here much longer the longer you cleanse which you know when I start working with someone I have them cleanse from two to four months good five days on two days off and what happens with your colon is you're going to start pulling out materials and plaque that have been stuck in that intestinal tract and what's so amazing when I started doing this early on with an individual she actually started eliminating enteric coated aspirin tablets that she had taken she told me ten years ago that had gotten lodged in her intestinal tract are you serious I'm very serious that's that's I'm not trying to be funny that's that's scary actually it's very scary and so what you want to realize is that you you know people will say to me well who should cleanse and when should I cleanse everybody everybody should everybody wait to cleanse and you should do it at least twice a year okay at least minimum and you always start out with your digestion and your elimination and then from there we would work into doing parasite cleanse we would do gallbladder and liver flushes we would maybe support the lungs and the lymph those being all the major eliminating organs Wow but again it's something serious we again we're joking about it but everybody needs to do it everybody has to really look at what goes into their body and now you're talking about herbal supplements all natural and bring them bring them I guess circle circle wife if you want to call it that but it's so important well they cuz the whole reason for cleansing is to get your body eliminating like it's meant to eliminate which gets back to that three and five bowel movements a day I'm getting there I'm working on yeah and your green your green we'll help you now the next step is to target that colon well it's been great with you again as usual lots of good stuff and it's we talked about it and we don't want to talk about it but you need to thank you again Susan thank you and wonderful I'm sure you'll be back for more exciting moments about cleansing or something it sounds great so they will be back [Music] Wow it's definitely Susan who can make talking about our elimination system so normal and acceptable I love her for that so I hope you paid attention it may not be exactly the kind of subject you might feel comfortable bringing up during a polite dinner but otherwise it is something that we really need to talk about keeping your elimination system in proper working order is important to your help and well-being and cleansing can impact your life immensely and this goes not only for you but your family and children too especially your children getting your children on the right path now educating them on proper nutrition and eating the importance of to put it simply going to the bathroom gives them the right tools for life and having the right tools today can have a great impact on tomorrow I'd like to take us to our next story and the impact that something like bedwetting can have on children and their lives just like our previous story it is something that people don't like to talk about for children it's embarrassing for parents it's frustrating and what chiropractic has to offer in this case is truly life-changing so let's take bedwetting out of the dark and take a look at what causes it and what can be done dr. Rob Senate is here to dispel the myths and misunderstandings and finally offer clarity and hope really it's time so let me move on and bring on dr. cynic [Music] bedwetting is not something that your child does on purpose quite often they think it's something that's their fault and what I want to talk to you about today is a mechanism that where chiropractic and step in and help some of these children because they have a they have a terrible problem that needs to be addressed and it's something chiropractic can do if we look at the structure of the way the body is made the bladder is like a balloon and in the bottom of that bladder there's two sphincters and what sphincters are is they they control that opening open and close so there's one sphincter that 24 hours a day that sphincter is under under control of your brain the other one you only consciously control it it's like your arm when you're asleep your your arm you're not writing you consciously have to think about writing the same thing with this sphincter you consciously have to be awake for your body to be able to control that that second sphincter what happens sometimes is these children is that bladder gets to a certain size it starts to distend it starts to grow fill fill with fluid it stretches that bladder when it stretches the bladder the muscle in that bladder sends a message up to their brain that says I'm starting to get some pressure here and it sends a message to them that they need to they need to visit a restroom when it gets to a certain size past that sometimes while they're asleep if you consider it this way when they when they sleep and that bladder fills which normally would do anyway that sphincter that's there 24 hours a day make sure that that fluid stays there but what happens sometimes is that's that sphincter that's twenty-four hours a day seven days a week it's like your heart it's constantly working constantly working when that when that sphincter is is not functioning properly let's think about that if that sphincter opens just a little bit then when you're awake that other sphincter is controlling everything and doing a great job but when you go to sleep that second sphincter starts to it starts to open because it's only consciously controlled and now the one that 24 hours a day is supposed to be doing its job it's incompetent it's not doing its job properly urine leaks through and the way our bodies work is as soon as urine starts to travel from the bladder it kicks in that muscle around the bladder to squeeze and that's why as you've probably noticed yourself it's hard to stop once you start and that's because that muscle starts to squeeze and propels the the fluid out of the body so that those as you would think those are controlled by nerves there's a nerve that controls that 24-hour day bladder so that it stays competent and there's a nerve that controls the conscious bladder just like your arm so when you go to sleep if that conscious if that conscious sphincter is functioning properly in the unconscious one isn't getting the message to it because there's an interference to that message that flow of information isn't getting to that sphincter to tell it to tighten up and to maintain continuity to maintain its integrity so the child doesn't bed wetter so an adult doesn't bed what it's the same principle that they're contained and controlled and the reason we see this so much in children and until they get to their mid-teens it's pretty common it's more common than you'd think but you don't hear much about it because people don't like to say boy I've got a kid that bed wets because it sounds like an embarrassing thing and it's not it's just part of physiology it's like a it's like having a cold or hay fever or anything that can go wrong with your body it's something's not functioning properly it's a functional problem this is why chiropractic is so important what we do as chiropractors is we look for that interference and there are several places in the spine that are particular importance in a child's bladder there's that the one that controls the conscious finger and the one that controls the unconscious finger there are two separate supplies because our body has ways of protecting things and protecting mechanisms to make sure that they they have constant integrity but down by the tailbone quite often there's a segment of the spine that can shift backwards and that part of what that nerve controls that were that where that subluxation takes place it interferes with the flow of information to that sphincter and if that sphincter has that information that tells it to keep a certain amount of tone if that's not getting there properly it's not going to have the proper amount of tone but as long as they're awake they're not good they're gonna be able to control their bladder it's when they start to fall asleep that they start to lose that control this is where chiropractic comes in it's such an amazing thing to be a chiropractor and to have a child come in with something like this and the stories they will tell you it's it's it's they can't join Boy Scouts they can't go on camping trips with their friends they can't do overnight a pillow parties with the other girls in class because they have this for this issue this functional problem and it's such a simple thing to take care of it really helps these children it changes their life they're they're kind of social outcasts it to a degree because they can't be part of the other kids what they do so you're really helping your child achieve a socialization that they feel kind of that they do really don't want to do because if they make good friends then their friends are gonna say come on over we're having some of some of the some of the other kids in class are gonna come over tonight well now they can't because they know if they fall asleep in that house during the night that there's a good chance that they're gonna wet the bed and they don't want their friends to know this this is red this is a tragic thing for a child it's tough for them to go through I have a I have a lot of kids that I've seen like this one in particular that pops into my head was a very recent case this little boy had told his mother you know you you need to punish me and he was about 11 years old then he felt so bad about this and these kids they don't get anything to drink with dinner they don't get anything to drink after dinner because obviously they have fluid in their body there's a fluid in your body whether you have something to drink after dinner or not that has nothing to do with it the problem is a functional problem and you know what you might think why does this stop then when they're when they hit their teens you never hear 20 year olds having a bedwetting problem very very rarely and that's because the bones of the sacrum the tailbone that triangular set of bones down in our lower our lower backs down by our pelvis that there's one of those bones the way it's shaped shaped it can shift backwards and it's five separate bones until we hit our mid teens once we hit about 15 years old give or take it's pretty close to about 15 those those those disks the spaces between the bones they seal over and turn into bone and that that sacrum that tailbone turns into one solid bone it can no longer interfere with that nerve and so the child stops there bedwetting problem on their own but why wait till they're 15 or 16 that's a tragic thing you can make such a difference for a child today whether it's your own child you have to know a friend or a neighbor or someone who has this problem they're dealing with this is a tragic terrible problem and if we can if we can move forward with this you can change a child's life talk to your chiropractor they can give you more information and help you change a life [Music] there are many times we asked you to share stories with friends and family but sharing what you just learned from doctor Senate can truly be life-changing so I urge you if you know of a child who is bedwetting please don't be embarrassed about bringing this subject up with their parents tell them what your chiropractor and chiropractic care can do it might literally be the answer they didn't know was out there and you could be the person that can change their lives forever with that said I would like to thank dr. Senate and all of our guests this month for taking the time from their busy schedules to help us show you a path to living well and just as our guest took the time to share their knowledge and passion with you don't let it end here share the information you've learned on this month's show with people that you come across in your life by spreading the word you may help someone else find the benefits of chiropractic for themselves and their loved ones and with that change their lives for the better so pick up a few of your doctors cards and spread them around hand them to your family and friends and tell them about the benefits of chiropractic care meanwhile if you have any questions on what you've seen on this month's episode of life path talk to your chiropractor he or she is a great source of additional information that can help you in living healthy and well so until next month enjoy the path of a healthier natural way of life and don't forget turn the power on to your own health and healing and someone else is too so spread the word and live well [Music] [Music]", "NpNIOSxaEDw": "[Music] [Music] No whereas I'm a little dab tool crack in [Music] okay Oh tissue paper use that for

that's good I think people do know now that we're looking at some revisions to class K so I think that's why finally we're we're getting we're getting some input from members of the public and we do have quite a bit of Correspondence that we will be talking about this morning I think some of the people who sent that correspondence fortunately are here and can can speak to the Standing Committee just so folks understand supervisor McAllen or not as much as we'd like to or not the decision-makers on this what we'll do is make a recommendation hopefully a pretty unified recommendation as unified as possible to the board of soups and then the the entire board will make any ordinance revisions that are called for I think everybody in this room probably knows that class K goes back to 1982 am i right two or three I think it was 82 and I know I was there but that doesn't mean I remember it's kind of like the 60s you know if you remember it you weren't there but the 80s were you know really falling falling directly in the wake of or coming directly in the wake of of clean slate we came up with with the class k ordinance and of course there was kind of a statewide phenomenon going on then we were not the only County that was having folks go back to the land and and trying to shelter themselves and you know many people in this room or maybe even people listening to this remember the building code Wars of the late seventies and early eighties and and clean slate in class K played a big part in creating some measure of peace in the county and we don't I don't think it's it's the intention of the standing committee and I'll just take the liberty to speak for supervisor McGowan want to get rid of class K we still see a purpose for class K but it was pointed out to me some months ago that an ordinance that was passed in 1982 based on a 1976 UBC uniform building code or California building code had not been revised in you know 40-some years meanwhile of course the building codes have changed and changed and changed many times and then the other thing that was brought up to me and this came from the local builders exchange was that what at least I had thought and I think a lot of people had thought back in the day of of class K being past the purp what we thought the purpose of the ordinance was which was limited density rural dwellings mostly mostly owner built or at least there was that owner built kind of overtone to it and and mostly smaller dwellings had morphed into something where you know people were coming in with plans for 8 and 10 and 12,000 square-foot homes and doing them under class K and you know is that wrong I mean I was talking to one of the people who will address his later who's saying what difference does it make I mean why shouldn't people who build huge homes be and and maybe there's a good argument to be made there but I do know that at least back in the day that was not the intention we called class K the euphemism was was the cabin code and it was really for people who wanted to build a shelter and be able to subsist in that in that shelter not for people building you know huge homes on on more urbanized Lots I've some of the input that that has come in over the weekend contained information that I that is not necessarily true and I hope I'm sure there's a lot of rumors out there about what we are doing and aren't doing with class K and I think all that will come out today in our discussions and with that I think maybe we can get to it unless my colleague has any opening remarks before we go to staff and in particular his comments regarding that originally class K was limited density rural generally owner build mostly small the idea I think was that property owners would be able to build an affordable structure and that this was a way to help them be able to do that and it's kind of morphed into something else where we see 10,000 square foot dwellings being billed under class K that's doesn't exactly meet my definition of affordable so I appreciate very much the comments I think we're gonna have a pretty good discussion here supervisor Hamburg and I previously gave direction on a number of items that involved a little give-and-take by each of us to arrive at a consensus so far I believe and whether at the end of the discussion today we're still all in agreement on all of those points we're not I expect we will forward this to the board for their consideration and almost every one of these points involves policy decisions that obviously I think the full board is going to want to weigh in on so that's all I have now thank you thank you John with that I wanna welcome Nash Gonzalez who's our who's our director of planning and building and and also our our planning director Mike Oliphant and I think Mike's going to start off with some remarks sort of catching us up and where we were you know we we have I think three meetings on this and the committee and then the fires happened and everything kind of you know went toward dealing with all the aftermath of the fire so we're just kind of getting back to class Kay and I thought it'd be instructive for for our building official to kind of catch us up on on where we were at that point and what will be our starting point today Mike good morning members of the board my colophon building official I'll start at the beginning class K the regulations for limited limited density rural dwellings was first adopted in 1981 and so here we are we are considering proposed revisions to the class K ordinance there are basically six items that are under current consideration and I presented these on September 25th to the board and then shortly thereafter the fires happen and like supervisor Hamburg said that the fires happened and we had a big interruption very unfortunately the first proposed revision is that all new single-family residences will be required to have fire sprinklers and we need to remember that we're talking about new single-family residences not not existing structures a new single-family residence shall be limited to 2,000 square feet of habitable space wildland urban interface otherwise known as w UI requirements shall be required for all the new single-family residential structures that involves all siting materials and window treatments and covered soffits and does involve many types of siting a perimeter foundation as required by the California Building Code shall be required under single-family residential habitable structures and accessory structures greater than one story in height and just briefly that the reason that the perimeter foundation is in therefore habitable structures or four and basic engineering principles of transferring shear seismic and wind loads to the foundation now a perimeter foundation would be allowed on a new single-family residence with proper design analysis by an architecture engineer the next one a minimum parcel size slide excuse me Mike let's make sure I understand that you're saying that a perimeter found a would be required for the SFR similar family residence and what would be the exception to that something that was engineered that was right different than that so if you have a design professional such as an engineer and architect design your foundation you may have an alternative foundation such as a post and pure but they're the ones who calculate the transfer of the winded load and seismic designs to the foundation so would you see that the current section which is eighteen point two three point three three Oh would remain in the ordinance no it would not it would be struck out and it would say that all new single-family residences habitable space would need to comply with minimum standards and would require a perimeter footing and stem wall foundation but you're saying there's also this since this exception for using other types of foundations if those are if the evidence is presented by an engineer by an engineer and architect and currently that's that's how we handle all foundations currently we have for many years out of the title 24 Building Code okay we're just merely moving the the minimum building code standards for the foundation into this class k ordinance that that's my proposal the next one is a minimum parcel size of five acres shall be required for any structure and then the last proposal is a minimum of three inspections shall occur on all structures that as a foundation inspection a rough and inspection which false framing plumbing electrical mechanical and then lastly a final inspection that's three inspections total mm-hm and those are my proposals for the class k coordinates mm-hmm questions yeah well I would just say you're calling them your proposals but I believe they reflect the recommendations of the committee to this point I'm sorry that you're you're absolutely correct right so they can blame us yeah yeah and and you know as far as I'm concerned they're also not written in stone I mean that's what we're doing here today is we're looking at this I knew but I do know John that we did consents on those so with that yes mr. Gonzales please mr. chair members of the board you know before the Flyers occurred we had had extensive meetings with the fire chiefs we had spoken with various fire officials and a lot of their concerns were centered around what happened on October 9th and we had started talking about some of the fire safe some of the wildland interface issues and so on they understood that class K was an alternative that it was there to assist folks and again in 1981 when this was conceived it was as you pointed supervisor Hamburg it was a way to create an opportunity to create these affordable housing units but since then we've had a lot of changes in in the building code we've had changes in what's occurring around us and so for these reasons this is why these recommendations are put forward but again it'll be up to the to this committee to make a recommendation to the board based on what's happened but some of the things I want to share with you over the years of folks coming to me and talking to me about both clean slate in class K is that they they feel it was a good thing at the time that they went through the process and a lot of them say that they probably would not have had a change of heart but some of them actually have found that as they go try to obtain insurance or try to refinance their properties they've they've also had a difficult time in doing that and so a lot of them have that as long as those services are available to them they they obviously welcome this program but the ones that had difficulty you know wanted to express their frustration they said it really wasn't the county's fault it was just something that they chose to go down a certain path and I'm not sure if you folks have heard anything otherwise but these are just things that I've heard over the years as to some of the difficulties because of these types of things that aren't that aren't in the code or in class K at this point in time especially dealing with fires and I just wanted just to you know throw that out as far as how some people are looking at this mm-hmm well it seems pretty self-evident that given what Northern California has gone through with with these wildfires and of course now it's in Southern California but it's going to become that much more difficult for people to obtain financing and obtained insurance quotes if they don't have fire safe you know measures in their in their in their structure on the other hand everybody in Mendocino County has any attention to housing those we have an affordability crisis and you know it's just trying to trying to balance two things that are very very difficult you know I mean we all would like to live in perfect houses that are you know perfectly safe in every condition and boy if these wildfires told us one thing you know it seems to me that even if your house had that a world-class sprinkler system you probably would still have been consumed would probably still have been consumed in these wildfires would you like to dispute that no I would just like to I would just like to comment on that mykola font building official that is that fire sprinklers are not designed to stop a fire they're designed to allow the occupants to get out of the home the w UI requirements are designed to slow down the fire or potentially stop the fire at the exterior all right thank you yes John I agree with your comments again you know the the fire safe standards may have helped in some cases in many cases there was simply nothing was going to slow down without fire under the conditions that were operative but that's kind of a once in a generation or two event hopefully I also agree with your comments that the class K it may help people get into a structure it may later create problems for financing and insurance and so striking the balance is an issue and then another issue that came up last time was I believe we had requested that County Council would and staff you know I think we made directives to both to examine to what degree are is the county able to exempt new construction from the fire safe standards or is that something that since klaus k was first initiated here that the state has occupied more of the field to where there is limited leeway to exempt new primary dwellings new dwelling units from from the fire safe standards and i don't know if we have information on that or not but that's obviously part of the discussion well I think this would be a good time to ask County Council for any input she has on that so Thank You Katherine Elliot County Council I did check in with mr. Kudrin ski just to see where he sat on this so far were not really finding an exception in terms of going forward but he has not completed his investigation and I my understanding is this will be coming back to the full board and he is he will have an answer by that point and the comment thus far not finding an exception would indicate that as far as we know the county may well lack an ability to exempt new construction from the fire safe standards that's what it's looking like so far and I wonder if we might ask if our building official has an opinion yeah and I'd also like to add to that question do do we know of any any counties of the 58 counties in the state that that are making the kinds of exceptions that we might want to consider here and I will tell you that mr. Kowalski's looking specifically at that and that is actually where he's gaining some of the information we actually I think he was telling me that we actually see some of them changing what they're doing to accommodate state law so with respect to things like Willie and and yes Mike I have reached out to other building officials and other counties in Northern California and I've heard it from one extreme that they will not consider the limited density rural dwelling ordinance out of 25 or as we call it class K they will just stick with the minimum California Building Code as written title 24 as to other jurisdictions who have it but they have amended it and they have included the fire safe will we and the fire sprinklers as well so they've stayed with with the class K title I mean they they've continued to use class K but they've incorporated standards that didn't exist when they first put it into place that is correct to be clear Marin County is the only other County that I could find that call it class Cate Marin County in Mendocino County or the only counties that call it class K the others humble calls it rural homeowner builders ordinance and but if we all call it the density world dwelling ordinates they all know what we're talking about but yeah so that's what I found one speak when speaking with other building officials that they have amended their ordinances are you aware of other jurisdictions that still maintain exemptions from fire safe standards no I'm not aware of any jurisdictions that do okay I think with that I'd like to allow people to come up and and address the committee oh good we have some I'd like to make a one correction supervisor McGowan just to his question there was an exception that was the city of Santa Clara and because they have a paid Fire Department within the city they they do have some unusual exceptions but they're fired they have the paid Fire Department on staff and legally by code they're not required to have W UI chapter seven a in the building code is explicit as to that okay I want to thank everybody who submitted speaker forms the speaker forms are in the back if anyone else wants to fill one out you don't have to fill one out to speak it's just a convenience to me as chair and I'll just take these in the order they were handed to me and start with Stephanie Stephanie cold yes please and just give your name for the record hi I'm Stephanie gold Thank You Anderson Valley not much of a public speaker but I was very much concerned about this I wanted to come and share some thoughts so I am a counselor at Anderson Valley High School and I'd like to speak to the need for affordable housing from my perspective I know that California Housing Accountability Act requires counties to facilitate affordable housing and I really see the need at our schools I know that there are families who technically are considered homeless because they can't find affordable housing and it's an ongoing crisis trying to find housing for new teachers and health center workers so I really question the wisdom of requiring expensive sprinkler systems and perimeter foundations and requiring five acres instead of one for Class K permits I think we need to be encouraging affordable options rather than putting up obstacles to affordable housing I urge that you reconsider the proposals and keep your focus on affordable housing as the Accountability Act mandates and regarding the the concern for refinancing and such it's just nice to have options for builder owners you know a person can always choose to go with a standard permitting code but it's nice to have an option if that's not going to be an issue for them to have a more a more affordable way to pursue it so thanks very much thank you Stephanie okay mr. Ward Scott good morning Scott Ward River Valley members of the committee mr. Oliphant mr. Gonzales I appreciate what Mike has done here I think it's an overdue to begin to revisit the ordinance is written in 1981 so I'm just gonna go down the letter that I sent you with some additional comments I think the size limits unnecessary I mean how many McMansions were really built I mean to change a policy that's been existence successfully Mendocino County based on some anecdotal evidence and somebody built a giant house I don't think is really pertains to what we're discussing if you're going to limit the size of the house I would suggested to be 2,500 square feet with thumb additions up to a total aggregate of an extra thousand square feet people that big families that may have bigger families they may bring their folks in and need to expand so that if they have a 2,000 square foot class k house and they got to take care of their elderly parents where are they gonna go they got to make their house bigger you can't have an amalgamation of a uniform building code addition in a class K house that doesn't make any sense to me so I think you if you're going to limit the size make it a maximum 3,500 the initial house being 2500 then whatever successive editions up to an extra thousand square feet the perimeter foundation I can see Mike's point as a retired building official I totally get it I think it's contrary to the intent of class K for imaginative construction and a little bit of flexibility people are aware that they're they have to fill out a deed waiver when they get a class K house and it is says that the house has not been reviewed or inspected for resistance to lateral forces produced by wind and earthquakes there notice sloping terrain is generally where you're going to have a shear transferred with earthquakes or wind and I would suggest that you require perimeter foundations for slopes greater than five to one if you're gonna require engineering for post and pure foundations not only will the foundation have to be engineered but an architect or engineer to put their stamp on that set of plans will also require that entire house framing to meet current code because you can't you have to transfer the shear from the house down to the foundation you can't just engineer the foundation resist this year you have to injure do the whole thing that that's their duty as an architect or engineer it through a complete structural analysis of the entire building inspections three inspections I totally support that I wish that was there when I was here well land urban interface I totally support but it's only the code only requires in the state responsibility areas so say the red valley floor the potter valley floor is not required so i do support that fire sprinklers they're a good idea to get you out if you have a spring and you're off-grid pretty hard to make a fire sprinkler system work consistently that you can rely on the code allows you and 106 I think for alternate methods of material I think that should be an option where the applicant has a spring that he can wrap his house on the inside with 5/8 type ax fire business or sheetrock on the walls in the ceiling and I appreciate your time thank you thank you mm-hmm and Mike I just thank you Scott after we've heard these comments I'm gonna ask you to reflect on these so I know you're taking notes while these comments are being made it's pretty good okay John did you well Anna's question is Scott but you know what why don't why don't we take the speakers and then we'll we'll have Mike take notes on what they're saying and then we'll try to come back to them because I think we you know we may have some that are repetitious or whatever but we can gather them all together and deal with them at once Dennis Tunis mr. Toomy yeah my name is Dewey I'm a 35 year old I mean a 35 year contractor and Anderson Valley and I'm not going to address individual issues because they've all been spoken to I just like to address the well basically comment on the the terriblest standing up and speaking excuse me Oh take it up all right so take your time the the ordinance says as written and standing in the community has been a very very valuable instrument to the community both the residents and the community of builders who well you could say take advantage but you could also say provide a valuable service to the people that are are taking advantage of this instrument as far as I can see by reading the proposed changes here I think that the ordinance should stand as it is because it is a very valuable tool to to the residents that you represent and to the building community who live and work here I think it would ultimately weaken the position of class k and I think if these proposals were implemented would probably ultimately destroy the the spirit of class K and its future because it seems to be opening the door to swinging the the entire weight of the new building codes and new regulations into the class K and where do you stop where do you start so I don't think that door should be open I think you should you could more effectively serve the community by addressing education and encouragement towards visiting fire regulations visiting structure regulations maybe even having some type of seminar available to people that are are thinking about going this direction I think that might be a more valuable solution I just really hate to see this ordinance screwed with because it's been very very valuable to the community for since its inception and another quick comment about the insurance issues I don't think that's your job you know I mean your job is to really let people do what they need to be done the financing insurance is on the people you know you could educate them to the effect that their insurance rate might be going up there might have a little bit more trouble financing although I've been involved with probably 40 class care residents and involved with the people that I built for and that's never been an issue for any of them to date that I've heard from and they they talk to me all the time you're not there they become associates so I'm at a time anyway thank you I would like to see the ordinance stand as is and not even screw with it mm-hmm okay thank you Robert Salisbury how you guys I've been a 40-year occupant of Mendocino County and been a carpenter for 35 of those years and I've worked on plenty of regular code houses and of class K houses I'm here speaking in terms for affordability I could quote from the recent legislation that's come down from California G's course I don't have it here that encourages counties to make affordable housing you guys I think it's 157 the legislation that just came down and here you have in your hands you have class K which is a good vehicle for that I would really like you guys to perceive class K as an avenue to create or allow you already had the tool affordable housing some of the things the interior fire suppression systems that would be required under class K well it wouldn't have saved one house in Redwood Valley or Potter Valley and the additional cost I've heard numbers floating around it's not coming down of contractors I've talking to interior it's just working on the interior of a house is ten thousand dollars and then people have to work on bladder systems and tanks and water supply we're talking ten to fourteen thousand dollars additional cost for these interior fires systems which wouldn't help in a wildfire situation perimeter foundations around houses I think some people have spoken to that one thing I'd like to add is that that would add the cost on say a fifteen hundred square foot house according to contractors I spoken to - between ten and thirty thousand dollars so between these two things you guys are increasing the cost of houses by thirty forty thousand dollars and yet you're mandated to - and I think are in favor of creating affordable housing I'd like you to see this as an opportunity to help people who've been burned out of their homes to be able to afford to come back and build here the fire suppression thing if I mean trailers I believe I mean we could become a county of trailer houses you know because fire suppression units aren't required in mobile homes or manufactured homes I've read that and so well so people maybe could afford trailers and an owner builders wouldn't be able to do that we would lose work for people building the houses they're created outside of the county etc etc so that's a wrap up if you could I see this as an opportunity for you guys and please think of your constituents who need affordable housing and look at it from that perspective rather than governmental and other influences on your case thank thank you James boo Doris I'm not sure I'm pronouncing that correctly hi my name is James Buderus and I own philo saw works which is a construction company over in Philo of course I established the company in 1976 and worked during those early years for many many young people who had moved to Mendocino County and we're attempting to build a life here on a shoestring budget times haven't changed much since then we now have many people young and old trying to build a life in our County still on a very modest budget class kay has been a great benefit to these people allowing them to build a home that they otherwise might not have been able to afford we have a tremendous shortfall of homes throughout California and it's especially exacerbated in our County were chah's one of the poorer counties in the state I strongly urge the supervisors to maintain class K as it is without modification and support our fellow citizens who need housing desperately thank you thank you Blair Phillips hey good morning everyone my name is Blair Phillips I live outside of Willits I wanted to address class K and first off appreciate the elders who paved the way who made it possible and and just note that I'm one of the three youngest people in the room I'm starting off and starting off on my land and really struggling already with all the the costs that are associated with trying to do things and wanted to note I can tell that a lot of things that I wanted to say are already gonna be said so I'm gonna kind of skip to the generalized ideas and first off I want to note that class K is a primary reason that I chose to live in Mendocino County secondly I think it's important to consider that in these times of increasing fire and a sad loss of craft culture that we remember that proven and successful examples of natural building all over the world and earthquake zones like Japan and non earthquake zones alike buildings are still standing today that are over 400 years old that are made entirely of wood mud stone without the use of concrete or metal these places obviously have fires too and here in California and a lot of the areas that have been destroyed in fire by fire some of these are the structural buildings are the structures that are still standing the ones that are built out of cob for example are really well plastered straw bale with metal roofs so I'm hoping that instead of making class K look more like standard building codes we use the class K for rural residences to exemplify the inherent and resonant beauty of Mendocino County by leaving room for a renaissance in the natural crafts culture I propose that the the board community community and to the community to start a natural building working group over 2018 that can draft up a proposal of how to make class K represent the needs of rural people in the Hills and potentially even an overlay of how to look at ways to ease the overburdened housing shortage I also would like to propose that the amnesty be extended till June as local architects are overwhelmed with cannabis and fire rebuilds leading them not to be able to complete jobs when they say since 2016 I've worked with two different architects who both failed me I've paid one of them out and they've delivered me plans that were completely incorrect and that's a reputable reputable company that I won't name here in Ukiah and I've been working with the second one who's been dealing with other issues regarding to personal stuff so in conclusion you know let's let's let's make class case something that potentially can be a leader in new ways to find fire resistant building that don't require expensive situations thank you very much thank you oh one last thing let's make class case stand for craft culture kindness to the environment and keeping it simple thank you thank you very much Darius Richmond be followed by Kacie O'Neill hi my name is Darius Richmond I've been living in the county for about 20 years I owned and operated a restaurant in the Anderson Valley and it's not a very lucrative industry the food business so my concerns center around affordability of building and parcel sizes and things that would make it so younger people would have difficulty and getting established in building a home I've utilized the class capering process in the past I've built a class gate building myself and like I feel like for me for people in my position building would be kind of unattainable because I wouldn't have the kind of income to hire an architect hire a contractor so I and I'm in the process of designing a house for my family now and and hope to utilize the class K permitting process to do that so I can here interested in what the changes would be and how that would affect me personally and affect the community at large so yeah my concerns are how it would impact people that that don't have a lot of income you know I mean people they're building those 10,000 square feet houses aren't the people that that were concerned about because they can afford the architect most likely but yeah that's basically my concerns are how how it would affect people that that are in a position where they where they they don't have a lot of options and yeah in the house that I live in now is built probably a hundred years ago and it's way worse than the buildings that I that I take on and and have basically learned how to be a contractor and chose Perimeter foundation just because that was my personal choice so so you can choose to build fully to the code or not but that I'd like to have that option and be able to continue to have that flexibility and yeah so that's basically my concerns I'm not open or closed on all the potential changes but I'd like just know what's going on and how that affects me yeah yeah okay thanks stories mmm Casey good morning Casey O'Neill local farmer you know one of the things I'm always really keyed into is like making regulations that work not from a government perspective but from a human person people perspective what we've seen a lot of times is people just build without permits because the process can be onerous it is onerous even with class K it's still not a walk in the park and you know I have significant concerns that if we want to see buildings built with permits and we want to see people participate in the regulated process for buildings it's got to be functional and if it costs too much money by definition it's not functional and we are a very poor County you know I think the calling at the cabin code is is dead on like I built a little tiny box and then when I got some more money I tacked on a little box and then I tacked on a box and now I have a house and and so you know I think it's important that we create the opportunity for this type of process and that we maintain it I think it's been working pretty well and and I'm a little dismayed to see the the required upgrades for instance you know I got a quote on a perimeter foundation that was something around $30,000 and that's not gonna happen plain and simple so I'm not you know it puts me in a very awkward position in which you know I'd really like to participate but I also can't do something that I can't do and so you know I'm very very leery of requiring these significant additional costs you know an engineer to engineer my post and peer foundation you know at a certain point you start to say well a lot of people I know are just not going to do it and so it's you know I'm always I'm really wary of these these suggested suggested changes and I think you know there is a difference between something that's already built and something that's being applied for it and that's a really really consideration because if it's already there it's a lot more difficult to retrofit when I was a kid my parents did the full building permit and I was the guy that crawled under the house to put the backing on the foundation boards on the on the frame boards so that we could pour the perimeter foundation that was a nightmare and you know it's it's I think it creates a potential for just flawed policy that doesn't really accomplish what we want and we need people to have places to live and right now it's it's it's hard right now you know I'm talking about a lot of people who are really really struggling so the more that we can you know I'd like to just see it left as is I read the ordinance a couple of times and it reads like a breath of fresh air and and I think that the significant changes in UBC's since 1982 have exacerbated the housing problem in a major major way and you know I'm a big fan of a Joel Salatin quote that says if I want to raise my family and a teepee to be able to so I think we should consider not adding more onerous restrictions thank you thank you bill Barksdale thank you my name is Bill Barksdale I'm a real estate agent in Mendocino County I've been practicing real estate for over 25 years and have served with the county as on the assessment Appeals Board for three years the original intent as I understand class K was health and safety issues for substandard structures for bringing unpermitted structures into the fold so that they could be safer for occupancy and for people and for the creating of affordable housing the the some of the proposed upgrades seemed to me like a way of kind of changing the code into the International Building Code which is the code that we use now and I'm not sure that that's the intent of class que although many of the state structures were have been bribed in many of those have not as a real estate agent I still see structures that are unpermitted that need to be brought in and to be made safer and I in the with the intent I myself lived in a house that a former owner had built and it was clean slate and it was a great house did not have a concrete primitive foundation it was very structurally sound I did do some reinforcement of the foundation and so forth but it was a wonderful house and I questioned some of the things like the sprinkler systems I've seen ceiling plumbing in houses freeze and caused huge damage to houses sometimes houses are unoccupied for a period of time I've always questioned the effectiveness of in housing of ceiling installed sprinkler systems I don't know that that's necessarily a good thing we've had housing for thousands of years without ceiling sprinkler systems I understand the importance of concrete perimeter foundations I'm not sure that a fight that a five-acre minimum parcel size may start encouraging people to move into fire zones wildland areas that are subject to fire prone type of situations and I and I I'd like that to be looked at a little bit more I I think the class K system is a good system maybe needs some tweaking I don't know it needs this much tweaking thank you thank you Jeff Ellis thank you all for the opportunity to speak my name is Jeff Ellis I've been for about 25 years of renovating buildings in Vallejo Contra Costa County Mendocino County - the reason I started this business was to make money and to provide for my family who I moved to Mendocino County in 2005 and I have seen a lot of buildings that were in terrible shape after a hundred years of existing in Vallejo from water dripping in causing dry rot causing issues people still living in them I often bottom is foreclosures and I did the stuff that was necessary to make them say these address the board Thanks I did I did the stuff necessary to make them safe so I have exceptional experience with dealing with low-income housing as a person that does it as a business financing working with contractors working with laborers working with tenants some buildings I still have some buildings I've sold I have a class case structure that I renovated in Mendocino and out on Albion in Albion and I had no problems selling it there was no problem even though there was that on the deed that said it was a class case structure I live in a classic a structure here now in Boonville and I have since 2011 wonderful beautiful building and one of the reasons it's a beautiful building is because it was allowed to be built with Class K it was allowed to be built in a way that was safe and yet it has open space it has light it's and it's sited on the land with another class case structure so there's a couple things I want to just just hit hopefully you understand my my perspective is one that's rather educated and is in the trenches five acres doesn't make sense at all to me and the reason 5 acres doesn't make sense to me at all is because you really need to take some time to ask people and go go down to the folks that are a clerk or working at a gas station or in a restaurant they afford five acres no they can't afford five acres they maybe can afford a few acres with somebody else or with a couple of their families we should not be looking at whether or not we could do class K we should be looking at how many how many buildings can we put on one parcel so that people can actually have housing that's one of the problems we really face here we have a lot of people that not have housing three inspections I have to say that makes sense rough electrical and plumbing along with the final I think a perimeter foundation is a bad idea because it takes away the opportunity for somebody to build a structure for less money people have been living and building structures that were posed in here for years I don't think that needs to be engineered I think if you give a owner the opportunity to learn about how to build a structure as mentioned earlier that should be enough three minutes really isn't enough to say what I'd like to say today refinancing and insurance that's up to the owner that's our decision finally looking at the importance of providing the average person the chance to build their own house and having people come to our County that want to do that those are the kind of people that we want here thanks for your time thank you very much chef Greg Kraus followed by Angela do it and that's all the speaker forms a half so after Angela I'll just ask anyone else who has a comment to come forward hi I'm Greg Boston from Anderson Valley also I'm concerned about this I I cut I actually started in this county who obviously didn't start there but I ended up in Compu for about 15 years in a property that was was cleared with class k with clean slate and all that stuff and we were able to bring the building into compliance and it was pretty good it was a neat system and we couldn't have afforded to do that if we would have done it in the upgrade that you're talking about so I'm concerned about that I think that uh I think the comments being said over and over again is affordability and that's what class K is about and I think you really need to examine that that's the most important aspect of it I think that this these things that you're talking about you could make them online videos advisory stuff that people could read about see if they want to do it see if they can afford to do it and a lot of the stuff Boehner builders can do they'll do that kind of stuff they'll build foundations whatever if they want it they may not want it so the other thing I'm concerned about is if you do this you'll make a bunch out loss a lot of people that just won't do it they won't get them two permits and that's not what you want to do I think that the key is that you want to keep people in the system making good decisions and if they get if you give them information they can make those good decisions so kind of back there again the sprinkler system I work for the client in coxy who had a sprinkler system on his roof plumbed with copper pipe had some big tanks and that worked pretty well for men his happen to have slit what he called a redwood shake roof so it was really important it would probably gone up in flames but if you notice what happened in the fire the fire was started from little fires that appeared so if you had a very minor outside sprinkler system you actually could contain control things and if you inform people like where our fires districts do about how to take care of their property to make sure that that the trees are cut away from things that information is really important as well so let's see the other thing I wanted to say was oh I'm also concerned that your if you make this more complicated you're going to require that the County Planning Office work harder and calling out that the office is already working a little too hard it's hard to get the planning people out there to do things and so I think that's important to look at as well and I think that that's about it for me I know the only thing is I really think it's important to advise brother than dictate thank you it's important what was the last thing you said advised instead of dictate okay thank you thank you okay Angela hey there thanks for having this opportunity to talk about class K stuff today I'm here to represent the energon Valley Housing Association our Board of Directors has written a letter which I believe that you have a copy of did Stephanie give you a copy when you arrived I just want to make sure that you've got that it addresses each of the individual points that came up in on the minutes of the last meeting I think and so I'm not going to go over those because you can take a look at it in the letter and also everybody in this room is pretty cogently addressed each of those so our mission is to provide affordable housing in Anderson Valley and this is something that's a more and more of an uphill battle every day when I first accepted this job I spoke with a former supervisor to find out what he thought about it and he said that our best bet for affordable housing in Mendocino County was the lack of accountability and enforcement and that people should just kind of build that doesn't really seem like good policy but it seemed actually pretty realistic and the more onerous that class K becomes the more that that will be a realistic policy you know Gregg addressed making out laws and I am afraid that regulations like this will leave people feeling like they have to be underground and their houses will be outside the system and less safe California is known for being onerous in its regulations in general so rather than trying to align us with the standards of California we can set an example for the rest of California for being driven by the will of our community that's something that people come to Mendocino County for that they stay in Mendocino County for its who it's who we are as a people it's a very deep culturally so it would be nice if we could create some sort of a metric for every change that's proposed for class kay and every change if it meets these criteria will it discourage owner builders from participating in the permitting system will it significantly increase the cost of construction and does it honor the original spirit of class k additionally I would like to just remind everybody in here that the median income in Mendocino County is 45,000 but it's less than $45,000 so when we're talking about it requiring changes that add an additional thirty to forty thousand dollars to a building project what we're really doing is excluding so many people from home ownership and this becomes a class issue ultimately I feel that very deeply housing is really deeply rooted in one class so I think that that's pretty much it also I'm not speaking on behalf of this agency but I am a volunteer firefighter I've seen enough structure fires that I fully recognize the the importance of fire suppression systems and homes and I would like to encourage the County Board of Supervisors or whatever agency it is that's able to implement such a system that rather than have this be kind of a punitive requirement that we can empower people to place those kinds of systems in their homes through tax incentives through grant programs through outreach and that kind of thing so thank you so much for your time I appreciate it yes sir just gonna ask that anyone else who would like to speak come forward Kawai mr. chairman hello supervisor I didn't know any my name is Larry my yard I knew nothing about this until Saturday night late yeah but I started walking into some information I was given and listening to these other people this morning I would like to just address some of the issues I think if you do change the class k ordinance moving forward that you grandfather anybody that is already there in existing I can't see going retroactive on that I think that would be devastating sprinkler systems I didn't build one in my house when I built here in the county if I was forced to I would have turned it off because will do more damage to your house then then I think save it in the spirit of class K I think it's a cost item there would be prohibitive for most people parameter footings yes very expensive but as a 20-year firefighter Allison know that a perimeter footing will help save a house a post in your situation with an open access underneath the house will almost guarantee you in a wildfire situation your house is going to go by very minimum why I mean if you have the capabilities breaking a piece of property off of your larger piece and allow someone to build class K what what difference does that make I think that should be waved three inspections I think is good and I think that should be minimal or the minimum square footage y 2,000 feet I think that's that's a on the small side I think you should be more concerned more in the 2500 to 3000 foot size but I guess the main the main thing is the class K provides is the ability to people in Mendocino County and I think that's that's why some of these things I think there's totally cost prohibitive and and unnecessary thank you hi I'm Anna Farnham we're trying to strike a balance here between affordable housing on one side and safe housing on the other and I think there's a way to do it I understand that post and peer is allowed if the plan is engineered but then that puts the affordability you know so now it's not affordable because you have to pay for the engineer but we still want it to be safe so if there's a way that we can take some of these engineering standards and write them into the code so for example with limitations on post height and proximity for example that would go a long way towards providing an affordable building option with guidelines on how to build your post and pier building also the post could be wrapped in fireproof materials are fire resistant materials like corrugated metal or like cement board or other things to increase the fire safety as far as the sprinkler systems I would echo what Scott Ward said we want systems in place for people to escape fire safely but we want those systems to be effective if a property is off-grid with low water flow it makes a sprinkler system harder to install and maintain and potentially less effective as in it may not actually work when it's needed building out of fireproof materials makes much more sense to me if someone can prove that their house is fire resistant or fireproof on the inside and the outside it seems they should not be required to install it a sprinkler system since the fires I've been in touch with many natural builders and we've been conversing about the fireproof potential of cob super Adobe and earthen plaster I've been in touch of the cob Research Institute and Marin who are currently conducting tests on cob for fire resistance and earthquake resistance kal Earth Institute down in Hesperia has already done many of these tests on Super Adobe style of construction and has been proven more effective than traditional stick-frame buildings I would echo at Blair Phillips said about having a natural building working group as a way to facilitate rebuilding after the fires in a more affordable safe and effective way I'm sure everyone would much rather have a community of fire and earthquake proof low-cost handcrafted earth and cottages than a community of prefab modular homes with less fire and earthquake resistance I'm currently on an email list with 15 natural builders some from within the county and a few experts from outside the county who are talking about all these topics and proposing a natural builders colloquium to be held here to discuss the fireproof potential of natural building and how to get streamlined approval through the building department to rebuild quickly affordably uneffective Lee thank you thank you very much are there other speakers mr. Howard didn't want to flee Howard North Coast Builders exchange I'd like to start off by at least saying that maybe the county missed and Mike probably went there but didn't scratch it down far enough Butte County is the only County in the state that I know that has an exemption to the sprinkler system the only one that somewhat doesn't enforce the fire safe standards Butte County also has a minimum lot size of one acre they require the sprinklers you're exempt from sprinklers if you're a thousand two hundred square feet there's a thousand two hundred and fifty square feet or less you're exempt from the sprinklers that's again that's the only County in the state that has done away with this or changed it so these standards don't apply I really disappointed in the fact that you would ask for a legal opinion regarding what the standards are I think a lot of our discussion here today would be null and void if that discuss if that opinion was setting out here with the C it's my understanding that the county has no option in the fire state standards I've talked throughout the state most P in most counties that did there were in this position have gone back and rolled it back the other way into the fact that they've gotten to the fire safe standards do I agree unlike the Building Code no I think the building the California National Building Code now used to be a California Building Code is one of the most draconian pieces of garbage that's out there and it's being pushed and shoved all the time by special interest every three years we rewrite it and is it gonna get any better no not unless somebody like the county goes to the International Building Code conferences and argues the fact that we don't need that but to say that we need to just do away with it doesn't fit the mode it's the law and we are a country a loss I hear today here that you know we're going to if you're gonna change this and I again I don't think it's an option on some of these things whether you change it or not I think that it's state long and especially in SRA areas now in the local jurisdictions inside the valley floor where you have LRA maybe it isn't but I would I would really look forward to a legal opinion and hopefully that will answer a lot of our questions that are out there for us Thank You Lee are you aware that butte county has had any pushback from the state on there's one area of butte county and i've actually talked to them at links over that has really pushed back there the area the locals are pushing back even against the county and i say you know all the power to you but the problem is it's a real losing situation when you're bucking the state on some of this stuff you know the a couple other things the the sprinkler systems the sprinkler systems that we're talking about today in this system are not what most people recognize the sprinkler systems they look at g that sprinkler is gonna dump your everything is gonna be flooded you know they've come a long ways in sprinkler systems they're not for a fire like we just had in Redwood Valley they don't do a darn bit of good I think most people that get up here and and recognize that but the the single fire and when you look at this you have in front of you the State Fire Marshal's presentation the life-saving effect and those sprinkler systems you can't argue with they're there and then we get into the cost of it you know we need 400 gallons of water to back up a sprinkler system oh that's expensive well I just had one that went in above me that they spent probably thirty thousand dollars in tanks for the grow area and didn't want to spend anything for a fire sprinkler 400 gallon so these are the kind of things that you know reality it's I recognize that we really have a hard time making affordable housing but not at the jeopardy of life and safety and the rest of us and some of these the fire safe standards themselves do save and do stop fire we saw that in Lake County in 19 2015 the houses that were boxed in and carved out fire safe standards a lot of them a lot of them survived mm-hmm thank you Thank You Leah appreciate it oh I think we have a question Li Li Li I think supervisor McAllen has a question and so to the fire say standards and you did submit to the committee information from the State Fire Marshall information bulletin 16-0 zero one and reset the previous information on sprinklers but I believe your interpretation is that if you're in a state responsibility area there is no leeway on the fire safe building standards there might be some leeway on sprinklers or no again don't ever get me close to being a lawyer because you know just throw me out the door but that's a legal question that need answers correct yes that's my belief that the fire safe standard is a state C D F crews come around and inspect for the fire say standards in SR a state responsible areas all summer long correct but then when you get to a local responsibility area if an area has been designated and here it may be only very high fire severity and then if if that's what it says on the map there may not be any local leeway that you're absolutely right you're absolutely right and we have a lot of the the high areas in this county thank you okay thank you okay so anyone else who would like to speak or say more or anything else at this point okay go ahead I just want to note that there are certain areas in the county that I don't totally even understand how it's set up but there's like fire zones and I live in one of them where I can't get insurance even if I had a permitted structure I can't get fire insurance based on the zone and I think it's important to note note that that okay thank you thank you and oh wow now we have a lot of people when it does be okay I'll give you give each of you one I'm sorry just one comment yeah I think that there needs to be some effective outreach necessary about the planning and building process some kind of seminar program because people don't understand the permitting process and it's it's off-putting and there have been a number of building inspectors in the past that have been intimidating and not cooperative and I think those building inspectors I would hope would have some kind of a training program so that they interface better with the public so that people can understand how the permitting process works thank you thank you bill and yeah Robert I just want some clarification please on this one point I'm not sure we understand this it says class k ordinance shall state that the most recently adopted version of uniform building code UBC would be the operative code doesn't mean that class K yeah we'll get we'll get an answer from Mike on that okay that's just want some clarification yeah you bet and yes one more yeah Jeff Ellis thinks Boonville I think that one thing that maybe we should consider is taking half a year or a year to make a decision on what we're talking about here because it does have far-reaching effects into the future of the folks of Mendocino today and tomorrow thank you yeah okay I do want to give staff a chance to to respond to some of the comments that were made one thing that that I think we can clear up right off the bat and and it came in and and the question came in and several letters and also mr. Meyer brought it up this morning it was a question of grandfathering and I hope everyone understands that existing structures that have applied under class K would be grandfathered in this this new you know if there is a new class K it applies to new construction okay just to clarify that Mike how long do you need do you want to you want to take I would like to take a break at 10:30 for 15 minutes just to give staff a chance to unwind do you want to do you want to start I'd like to respond to after break so I can be organized okay well let me give give you that time to organize and we will take a 15-minute break and we'll come back at 20 minutes to 11:00 and we'll hear from staff and then the the committee will talk about some of the input we've gotten thank you very much you we're going to go to our chief building official Mike on who's going to respond to some of the comments that we've just heard and Mike would you just go ahead with that thank you I'd like to begin my response by reminding everybody that the primary role of the building department in Mendocino County is to provide minimum fire life and safety issues and that is our standpoint having said that as stated earlier we will abide by what the board ultimately decides on this obviously the number one issue is affordability and that's a big concern to all of us we want affordable housing we really do and so with that subjective topic I'm gonna leave that to Nash Gonzales our director to respond to the affordability issue because maybe he might have some some ideas pertaining to that having said that there was some mention of Cobb rammed earth peas a those types of structures those are fire safe structures when you use those methods but they are really not cheap structures they're they're expensive structures and that's all I'm going to say about that but Mike before we leave that because that is something that that's come up numerous times regardless of the expense those kinds of materials constitute fire retardant materials and be allowed under the woolie standards for siding so right now we has a website under cAL FIRE they have all of the approved siding materials there are many many siting materials with the underlayment and I don't think they would have cob or rammed earth in there but obviously that's something we could look at in class k as an alternative material that would be approved because obviously that's going to fireproof if it's called around earth we can safely say that mm-hmm so do we have to incorporate that into our ordinance as acceptable under we if we did incorporate you know we could have a statement with the class K if it were a material that conforms with 7a whoo-wee or equal to or better yeah okay something like that okay supervisor Macallan has it well good question Thank You mr. chairman I just wanted to drive home at one point that if it can be demonstrated that certain materials are equal to or better the listed materials then the county could write them into our class k ordinance as approved materials is that accurate yeah but then you you might be limiting those materials you could it would it would be a lengthy list and we don't know what's going to alternative materials that are gonna be developed that people may want to use but if we amend this this ordinance every three years with the amending of the California Building Code we could build that into it well I'm thinking the way we would write it our list of materials that we consider equal to or better would not be considered exhaustive but it would be considered you know these specific materials or you know including but not limited to are considered to meet the the standard of equal or better that's a very good point so it could be written flexibly that if something isn't on the list it could still be considered and I imagine that'd be an individual over-the-counter exercise that's a very good point and I think yes that could be achieved okay I'd like to bring up Scott Ward's he was he had mentioned the five acre minimum he was a first one to mention that and I won't mention all the other people who were opposed to the five acre minimum that's going to be up to the board to dis that issue one way or the other he did mention a sprinkler cenk holding sighs and I remind people that if they have a spring or a shallow L or a low producing deep well you can get a holding tank that says little as two hundred and fifty gallons that will provide all the fire suppression need that you would need for a modest single-family residence the next speaker brought up about amending the CBC every three years and I believe that the class K should be amended every three years also to prevent what what we're going through now just so we can ease into things and and amend it as the building codes just have it built in to the building code amendment Blair Phillips brought up the Kraft culture and alternative structures and I think we can still keep that we can still keep that Kraft culture and alternative structures by writing in that that those siting requirements into the ordinance and possibly not require the engineering of those alternative structures and we'd have to look into that how we would how we would possibly do that now let me just drill down on that a little bit you you're talking about one of my concerns about class K is if you start to require engineering for every alternative that you use you're raising the the cost out of sight so specifically where what are you referring to in in this discussion well possibly if we could see a structure of meets wind and seismic loading with shear walls and the / - Foundation anchoring we could determine during our plan check process that that meets minimum standards and we necessarily wouldn't go to engineering as easily as we would with title 24 California Building Code mm-hmm and might that also pertain to alternatives in terms of foundation well because I'm concerned and I've mentioned as before with removal of the section which allows it seems to me more flexibility in terms of foundation stone masonry footings and foundations pressure-treated lumber poles etc I'm not sure why we need to take that out of the ordinance as an alternative to to the perimeter foundations which seem to be very costly right and that section certainly could stay for all accessory structures or as the ordinance calls it all a pertinent structures we can definitely leave that I don't know about stone and pressure-treated wood foundations but we could certainly leave post and pure but inhabitable structures where people live and sleep I think that the minimum foundation stem wall foundation standard should stay annapurna had an interesting idea that that I hadn't thought of before as about a pre-engineered post and pier foundation for in class K if we had a boilerplate foundation and of course that would have to be on on flat Lots no no slope lots greater than five to one but that that's an interesting concept mm-hmm well I guess I still don't understand why that why those alternative foundations could not be allowed and again I suppose it's up to the board to decide that but on on SF ours that are not on these five to one slopes I mean in in in Scotts his language a perimeter foundation would be required for slopes greater than five to one and for all accessory structures that are over over one-story but that would allow for alternatives to be used where you're dealing with flat ground and again we're talking about affordability I mean when I built my first cabin myths you know County it was on Pierce because that was the the cheapest and most expeditious way to go and you know 40 years later that little cabin is still being inhabited I don't know if it's being legally inhabited or not but I know that thing is still standing and people are still living in it so you know I do have some very up-close and personal experience with with class K and with alternative structures and I know you know so I'm I'm trying to be as inclusive as we can possibly be so that we meet some of these goals of affordability supervisor Hamburg I'd like to respond to that point so after the foundation stage after you have dug and formed your perimeter footing and stem wall foundation and poured the concrete in there and you're ready to proceed how much more concrete would you have used in that footing stem wall foundation as opposed to the post and pier and and labor also how many man-hours would you have more into that concrete footing and stem wall and I think if you totaled that it wouldn't be that different and we're talking about new structures not existing structures so we have existing structures as opposed to new structures so we're talking about new single-family residences and the reason for the engineering on the posts and piers just because you can't transfer that that wynant size make an engineer and shear transfer to that foundation on the post and pier unless it has been addressed by a design professional mm-hmm and that's that's where we're at with that okay keep going another speak supervisor mechanical sorry to that issue of a member of the public raised could we build in effect the engineering standards into the ordinance or half a datasheet that if it's built to these standards than that that would replace the need for everyone to go out and independently get engineering and then if they wanted to deviate from what had been included in our information that we're putting out if they wanted to deviate from that too then they would need engineering I think you kind of indicated that could be a workable approach I thought that was a very interesting idea mm-hmm I really did so maybe between now because I am pretty confident we're going to refer this on to the full board so between now and then if I I would certainly appreciate it and I think my colleague would if you would explore further what that would look like if we incorporated engineering standards either into the ordinance or to an appendix that would you know relieve the burden on every individual applicant of having to secure their own engineering and you're specifically referring to the post and pier foundation mm-hmm yes okay and then one of the issues with the perimeter foundation was also fire safety so the post and pier by itself that might be structurally sound but then if it's exposed underneath so that you know embers can readily get under there so I don't know if we're if we're allowing post and pier do we want to do something that still provides that defense ability against fire well do you simply require skirting if you're going to do post and pier right so you would have to continue that vertical wall surface to grade and and connected to great to prevent the embers from circulating underfloor and you have to do that on any structure now as well anyway yes I'll guess you'd have to do it anyways but it would leave an opportunity for people to do something other than perimeter foundation yes but then when we get to something like Cobb how would this fit into the picture there's still a pathway to approve that consistent with everything else we're discussing to allow that alternative I think that goes to the same or better standard maybe as far as w UI standards the wildland-urban interface yes I'm very confident that that Cobb rammed earth Peas a they are all equal to or better than any materials offered in Chapter 7 a for those standards and there's no reason that you couldn't combine those alternative materials with posts in pair if it was engineered properly and if the siding went all the way to grade well I have yet to see a hay bale structure Peas a cob rammed earth that hasn't post and peer they all have deep thick puddings mm-hmm yeah okay so well the post some peer is more related to a wood frame structure yeah building code calls that a 5 B non rated frame okay I just want to leave whatever room for creativity we possibly can here yeah okay that and the biggest point I got from Casey O'Neil was the affordability and and I just want to be clear about existing as opposed to new ok we're talking about new construction and the existing structures that are built before this ordinance is adopted will be under the current class K ordinance and that's for the board to decide as well hey John well just to refine that point if someone previously came in secured a permit bill to the class case standards then they're they're you know grandfathered in to use that term we would not retroactive Lee impose a higher standard on them what has been very common and of course people are saying well don't make us be outlaws will the octaves many of them did not secure a permit when they built a structure so in terms of how we currently interpret our ordinances and I think the way the state fire marshal looks at it if you have a non permitted structure and you're trying to do anything with it today you would be expected to meet the current standards because it would be considered new construction and are you suggesting there's an option the board at its discretion could say we're going to exempt those existing structures that may have been built without a permit and we're going to allow them to comply with the current class case standards yes I believe that you can do that with County Council if you explore that with them I I believe that it could be written into the ordinance and as I go back to what leeway if any does the county have with wildland-urban interface standards that's correct and speaking as to that the wildland-urban interface standards are governed through chapter 7 a in the California Building Code and that's an important distinction as to chapter 9 in the Building Code which are the fire sprinkler requirements that simply state all new single-family residences shall have fire sprinklers whereas chapter 7 a relating to wildland urban interface says all structures within the SRA the state responsibility area must have these measures in place and then they have a list of exemptions so for instance if you have an accessory structure that's more than 50 feet from a property line or 50 feet from another structure you're exempt from wildland urban interface if you have an EVE as an example if you have an EVE that's over 12-foot off great those eaves do not be protected so there's a list of exemptions in Chapter 7 a that would exempt you from those ruie standards hmm Thank You Nash did you have a comment I think in my case okay billboard sorry I think supervisor Macau has another comment well so I think I hear you saying that the requirement for sprinklers is even more Universal and state mandated than the wildland urban interface standards I believe they're both state mandated they're both written into the state law Building Code but but they come from different requirements from different chapters but chapter 9 the language that you read would that apply not only to state responsibility areas and high fire hazard rated areas but also to would that apply to all local responsibility areas regardless of fire hazard rating that's an excellent point and you're right because it seems to be all-inclusive you will have fire sprinklers you're correct and you're right so local responsible areas such as local municipalities and incorporated cities must have spent also County areas that are local responsibility area that's true that's true but but the w UI requirements would not be required and those local responsible unless they were a very high fire hazard rating that's right governed by our SRA maps that we that we have thank you Bill Clark sterols mentioned about the freezing of the sprinkler pipes and I wanted to mention about sprinkler pipes generally are now plumbed with pecs and a lot of homeowners are putting in their own sprinkler systems now you can have a licensed contractor do that or a homeowner can also we have C 16 contractors who are guiding homeowners on how to install their own sprinkler systems and they're typically aqua PEX aqua pecs has a molecular memory that expands and contracts temperature and does not freeze they also have different systems that recirculate through your toilet some of them have antifreeze in them there are there are different systems that you can use for your your structure that that you have okay let's see oh I want to make I think I may have mentioned earlier that all the counties that I have contacted requires sprinklers and I may have mentioned that Butte County requires sprinklers and structures over 2,000 but it's not Butte County requires sprinklers in anything over 1,250 square feet so in Butte County is the only County I found like that if you build a new structure less than 1,250 square feet you're exempt from fire sprinklers which may or may not be in line with state law right right and that that wraps up what I have to say except for I couldn't I couldn't come to an answer on the the subjective subjective topic of affordable housing and then also the extension of the amnesty period I can't address that I'm gonna let Nash Gonzalez address those those topics okay thank you very much it's a chair we talk about affordability and I guess we I want to go ahead and start off on on the issue of having the affordability versus the health and safety and this is this is more of a policy decision than anything else we at the Planning Department understand the issue of affordability I you know along with several others back in 2009 dealt with the housing element dealt with the lawsuits and dealt with trying to work with with a lot of the organizations that are out there and ultimately one of the issues that we came back with was in order to do more affordability and this is a bigger picture and I think we've talked about this in front of the board is we really need the densities and to achieve the densities we really need to look at the urban areas or we need to look at the areas that have the sewer in the water and the facilities that are there but with that said the original intent of class K was to create affordability back in 1981 and I think his supervisor Hamburg as you referred to it as the cabin code I think we can also look at it as The Forgotten cabin code because it hasn't been updated to where it needs to be today we've been grappling with this issue and in talking with the the fire chiefs the fire chiefs have a lot of concerns about how the code is today and how if it were just looked at a little further but we could prevent more issues dealing with fire but with that said as Mike has mentioned it is you know our department will focus on what the on what this committee and what the board wants to do with with the updating of the class k ordinance merely we are just suggestions suggesting those items that need to have the attention at this point because of a lot of the issues that are that are being faced today especially with fires and especially with I'll say the the changes that we're dealing with we have a building code that we're dealing with that is a state code we have no choice but to implement it and I think what happened in the 1970s and 80s kind of set the tone for affordability and for people to move into areas like Mendocino County that provided for alternatives but I think as we have more and more urbanism occurring in some of the wild lands we are putting a lot of folks in and I don't want to use the word harm's way but but again we're now interfacing urban with rural and I think the concern that a lot of the fire chiefs have is that they don't have the resources to get to a lot of these facilities or a lot of these places as they would in their urban counterparts so I think affordability is is a is a big topic it's a it's a policy decision it is a one that were very sensitive to but I think we have to strike a balance between affordability and health and safety I mean the the reason we have the codes is to protect people but if we could we could discuss affordability all day long because it is a large topic and again I just want to point out that we are very sensitive to affordability because we basically are at zero percent vacancy in this county okay thank you okay I think the the next step is for for my colleague and I to just talk a little bit about these things that we want to see brought to the full board whether they're areas that we are totally in sync on or not certainly the number one issue or certainly one of the top two or three issues is the fire sprinklers I think it's I think it's very interesting that Butte County came up with an alternative at least four homes that are under 1,250 square feet perhaps that's something that Mendocino County might might want to look at what do you think John well I think we need to add another imperative to the discussion so we're talking about the balance between affordability and health and safety we also have to bring in their legality and so that's what we don't yet have is the definitive statement of what options the county has and we absolutely have to have that and you know Klaus Kay got adopted 35 years ago and it looks like it scarcely been looked at since then and the use of it has expanded but if it's not in line with state law require I think it not only potentially puts the public more at risk it arguably creates liability for the county so we have to have that opinion on what is legal and frankly that opinion will either narrow or expand the options that the board has I'm I'm open to the idea if if we have the option to reduce the sprinkler standard for clearly smaller structures you can make a little bit more of an argument that people in a smaller structure are going to figure out something's going on right but so again we need that legal opinion if we have it I'm open to considering that option okay I'll say another thing I think we're in sync on we would like to see staff explored that agree to which engineering standards can be built into the ordinance either directly as in a poor house in appendix so that if if the building official can determine that the engineering is sufficient based on the methods and materials that are being used they don't have to submit their own engineering okay and if I may in a reputation that would have to do with the foundation issue right whether whether foundations other than continuous perimeter foundations were allowed right and also would that be in reference to to whoaaaa standards were say other types of siting could be used right absolutely for the for the wildland urban interface requirements if you know we should those that we know meet or exceed we would include but again the reference would be flexible so including but not limited to and just spell out what those methods are and then maybe again the appendix because you might say cob in the ordinance the appendix would better define exactly what cob is they would meet the standards right is out clear enough okay okay no another issue that we been close to agreement on but I do want to revisit it is the maximum square footage and I thought that mr. Ward had an interesting suggestion of the now we had consent at a previous meeting in September on the 2000 and he is suggesting that we go to 2500 with a possible addition of a thousand four additions because and I think Mike you spoke to this that you could not have a class case structure and then add on to it with a UBC addition is that correct or not maybe maybe that maybe I misheard you know I know I didn't say so you so you could do that yes yeah okay but I believe Scott was talking about a cumulative squirt what he was talking about a cumulative of 3,500 square feet right that was my 2500 plus plus an additional thousand or not to exceed an additional thousand I mean I don't see what the big difference is frankly between 2000 and and you know in 2500 with the possibility of an add-on of up to a thousand you know it seems like our real problem has been you know people building these you know McMansions using class K but 502 as as much as 3500 still seems to me to be fairly reasonable but John do you want to keep it at 2,000 well I would prefer to keep it at 2000 and one of the arguments cited in favor of the 2500 is that and some of cited 2,600 which they say is the the average size of new construction but I'd be more interested in knowing what is the mean because that average is skewed by the people that are coming in with a 10,000 square foot structure so if again the initial impetus for Klaus K was affordability you're going above 2,000 square feet you're not building a little cabin on the rain so I I would stay with the two thousand personally what if we went to two thousand with a possibility of an addition being added to that still utilizing class K well it's piecemeal een raising the limit you know so either have a limit or you don't well I guess I would say if the limit was I don't know I'll give you well and we may or may not agree but I I would allow for a five hundred square foot addition mr. chair and I prefer we wouldn't open it up to the public but that's yeah I don't really yeah they're just going to suggest something for them for the board's confer the committee's consideration since we're talking about affordability and we're talking about creating opportunities I agree with supervisor Macau in 2000 beyond 2000 you know you start stretching the the concept of affordability but let's say you capped it at 22,000 but you decided that 500 additional square feet for someone or maybe 800 square feet if somebody wanted to do an attached second unit and then therefore you can then attach an attached attached attached because a lot of people you know will do attached units second units with a separate entry to the home and 800 seems reasonable for for a second unit with a separate and so again with with with the intent is that you're creating another affordable unit but it is attached so it does save you the construction costs of separate structure but you now are creating an incentive for second units well and we would officially call that an accessory dwelling unit wouldn't we yes as attached I mean it would have to be intended as a separate unit that would be separately occupied by a different household it could be a different household it could be a family member it could it doesn't really matter it would be an independent living unit correct and again I think then you achieve the affordability without somebody questioning the fact that you're allowing a larger structure and where is the affordability again here we've been talking about affordability we've been talking about housing units the lack thereof and we talked about second units several months ago here's an opportunity that you can still wrap second units into class K something like if it was done 750 cumulative cap or 2800 cumulative cap as long as it's per second units uh-huh otherwise we go back to what supervisor McGowan had mentioned keep it at 2,000 square feet because now again if you're allowing the additional square footage you make the finding that the additional square footage is truly for affordable units for second units I think that's an interesting idea well so I was gonna say you know 2,000 would be the cap that we would allow an accessory dwelling unit of up to 800 about 750 well I would have said 600 if if you're just asked me I'd say 600 750 sounds that's fine that's fine I can summon capsid out he said that's fine what I did I said okay could we talk a little bit about this acreage the five acre versus the one acre particularly if we're going my my thought was that we would require the sprinklers on the one acres but not on the larger acres but if we're going to go to you know this idea perhaps of the 1250 being the limitation for non sprinklers then maybe we go as low as one acre because we're going to have sprinklers on everything larger than that anyway whether it's on a 5 acre lot or a one acre lot and I know our current ordinance says one acre correct and I just sort of hate to see us you know backtrack to that extent of you know cutting off all those people and I think several people have said not not a lot of individuals in this county can even afford to buy a 5 acre piece of ground whereas a lot more people can afford a 1 acre piece and to not be able to avail yourself of class K unless you have five acres really takes a lot of people you know totally out of the opportunity so Mike jiminy comment on that yes I do our current ordinance states that to meet the class K it has to be zoned for a one acre minimum so you could potentially have a lot that is less than one acre as long as it's zoned for one acre so you would need to make that distinction as you relook at this mm-hmm but all I'm saying is that in order to utilize class K you need a minimum lot size of one acre as opposed to five acres that that's entirely up to the board yeah yeah okay John well and so currently you could actually have a quarter-acre lot if who was owned one acre and class k would apply is out yeah I haven't seen a lot that quarter acre well that you're saying so if it is owned for one acre if it's if it's owned for a one acre minimum yeah right and I you know I think part of our discussion around acreage was if you have lower standards arguably you may be increasing the danger to your neighbors the the more denser the the build-out is but I kind of think we're headed in a direction where the wildland urban interface standards are going to be required and the sprinklers are going to be required and that being the case I'm completely comfortable was staying with the one acre but we might have it be an actual acre rather than simply one acre zoning mm-hmm because when you get down to half acre quarter acre that's pretty much an urban environment mm-hmm so is that it's an agreement there we would go to we would stay at the one acre but it would be an acre right regardless is owning category of the of the areas one thing that we seem to have been able to consents on pretty consistently is the three inspections but I would like a little clarity on what those three inspections are what what are the what are the intervals at which inspections would be occurring under clause k certainly on new structures new structures they would be a foundation inspection so prior to placement of concrete after the foundation has been formed an inspection would be requested an inspector would go out there and verify the setbacks to the property lines and to other structures and then would inspect the foundation that it meets the minimum criteria as stated on the Lync plans and then would hopefully give approval to pour concrete then the builders would proceed to frame the underfloor they would plumb the under floor put their mechanical and electrical underfloor keep going build the entire structure sheet it roof it and then that's when you call for your roughs the Electrical Code requires a structure must have its roof covering on it before you rough wire it so at that point we would do all the roughs at once the rough wiring rough mechanical rough plumbing and rough framing and in one inspection after that second inspection we would do a final third inspection and I think it would probably be helpful if that level of detail is included in the staff report that would go to the board certainly I can do that at what point would you like me to have the staff report to the board is that is that my next step for you well I think that's when we bring it back to the board in the form of amended ordinance I mean that staff also would come with you know with that I would need to know what your decisions are before I create that so I think yeah we're generally reaffirming the previous direction that we're making some exceptions here to include the engineering and clarify the alternative natural building methods and where sprinklers might not be required and where siting options might be possible and then the one acre the one a stain with the one acre minimum although I would say where we are going down to the one acre regardless of what the state code says if you're going down to an acre I would say you would have to have the sprinklers because the sprinklers are protecting your neighbors right well even on the under 1250 ah that would be something I have to discuss because what I'm what I'm thinking is that for four houses under you know under twelve hundred and fifty square feet that we would not be requiring sprinklers if that is legal if we can do that within the bounds of legality yeah could I please make a comment just to reiterate the sprinklers are not there to protect the neighbors the sprinklers are there to protect the occupants of the structure and to allow them exiting time w UI is is there to protect the neighbors correct but if the sprinklers put out the fire then it isn't going to spread to your neighbors absolutely yes you know the sprinklers the information submitted by the State Fire Marshal there's absolutely no question that based on structures that are sprinklered versus those that aren't there is an incredible differential between lives lost by occupants injuries by occupants and injuries by firefighters it's like several times difference so the value of sprinklers I think a pretty well-established based on experience and some of the questions that have been raised about affordability and practicality also seemed to be addressed by the information from the State Fire Marshal and the fact that tank and pump systems are allowed and are feasible the minimum storage mr. Oliphant you said was 250 gallons I think mr. Howard referred to 400 that's not a heck of a lot of water storage because again it's just intended as an initial response to first ignition basically and is that all accurate as far as you know it is accurate and because those that the size limitation of the gallons required in the tank is so low is because only one sprinkler head goes off at a time right where the fire is your entire house sprinkler system does not go at once that's what some people think just one head okay what I would like to do is allow some more public input like maybe 15 minutes worth before we wrap this up this morning because the next step will be to take something take something to the Board of Supervisors where everybody will get another chance to respond to this but I just like to hear you know a few very few can be very brief I know there's a few people Scott I know you wanted to comment Robert maybe you wanted to comment on the inspectors okay so Scott go ahead yeah could you could you hold your comments at two minutes this time Scott word Redwood Valley on fire sprinklers not a hill that I would want to die on I do want to encourage the 1250 unless to be exempt from it mr. Oliphant is correct interior fire takes a while to get to burn the whole house inside to the outside and then spread to the neighbors by that time you're going to have response time for your local fire departments you really will take an hour to get to that point additions to do a uniform building code addition on a classic a structure if that class gate structure is relied on for seismic resistance included with the California Building Code resistant addition you may have to upgrade the entire class case structure so what's the point I think you ought to be able to allow additions on a class K structure in addition to encouraging second dwelling units when you add a second dwelling unit property you're increasing your subjects eyes your water demand and other exceda and unintended consequences of inspections I think an addition should just be an addition thank you thank you yes Stephanie thanks for opening this up two more comments one thing is I don't want to have the outcome of this really make a big separation between those who are like the we've got ours people we've got our houses either they've been they've been permitted one way or another way there's a lot of young families who are starting to have kids and trying to figure out if they can stay and work in Mendocino or if they need to live somewhere else we want to find a house have some sort of opportunity for them to have there isn't stay here as well so referring to the sprinklers thank you for discussing them and trying to come up with some sort of kind of compromise I want to say just two things one is that I'm not sure I see the value I don't see the reason for making a cutoff at 1,200 I understand Butte des it that way but if it works for 1,200 it would work the same way for 2,000 square feet in my opinion and the other thing is if the value of the sprinkler sprinklers is that enormous in terms of saving lives then maybe you need to require every house that's currently up to install them rather than just new new structures and I think that if that were required suddenly people would be saying well it's not really all that all that necessary thank you thank you thank you Stephanie yeah yeah let's see rub yeah go ahead Greg and Casey thank you Greg Kraus Anderson Valley thank you I just wanted to say two things one thing is is that one thing that's forgotten here and it's actually forgotten by PG&E as well is that families are growing into houses more so nowadays we're a grandparents are coming in and second grandchildren so houses need to be bigger to accommodate families and your program I understand that you want to keep people from taking advantage of the financial aspect of having a classic analysis perhaps a rental unit but for building for families there should be some a commission for that some way to make it work and the other thing I'd like to know is just how do you plan what is your plan about doing this process is it like a month that you're going to you know enter the board what is the time plan so that we can know as citizens if you want to respond that your idea for me thank you yeah I would think this would come back to the board within a couple of months great yeah Casey Casey O'Neil I just had a quick question about the power requirements for the sprinkler systems when the fire marshal presented it was a 220 system which you're not gonna be pushing 220 with an off-grid system unless you spend a huge amount of money on it okay Lee maybe Lee's gonna be our last commenter so anybody else want it done okay okay Robert Lee the sprinkler systems do come in 110 to 20 so it's just part of the industry they it's cost-effective if when you have to 22 plug the sprinkler system into a you know the I guess what really makes a difference here is there's been a lot of time and energy spent on these types of things the State Fire Marshal's Office looked at this in depth if you go back and start reading their some of their reports the amount of time and them changes that they've already made to the to the fire safe standards and and the sprinklers I guess they just can't say it loud enough and hard enough and they don't hear this it's going to the board but without again County Council's opinion that's got to be something that's just has to be had yeah we've been that this is it this a fifth meeting couldn't be fifth meeting that we've had we started asking this question way back then mm-hmm I'm sorry but that is the basis for everything we're talking about here today whether it's sprinklers whether it's a fire they spent all this dialogue that we're having might have been shortened a whole bunch with the County Council opinion and thank you thank you yes Robert I'd like to address a bunch of things but just one thing came up in in the number of inspections yeah that might be required changes really agree and in fact it's required in class Kate that electrical be up to UBC requirements am i right okay I don't understand the knee and and class K and the state allows us to do the minimum health and safety requirements that says right in the beginning okay of the purpose of these things I don't understand the reason for extra inspections I totally agree with the electrical and like that but it sounds like he included framing hello it sounds like almost the whole all all the inspectors need it for a regular house and I don't understand that and I don't think there's a need for it but the electrical yeah I think two inspections with the walls open it's really good final and then that electrical somewhere in there and mechanical and like that thank you but three but whiners won't make it regular code I just can't emphasize enough that this is actually an opportunity for you guys to aid people for affordable housing I really want you to balance all these other you know health and safety things with the ability for people to build the houses and live there because otherwise you're gonna create a bunch of out loss you're gonna create a bunch of trailer homes which don't require the interior and I blink believe you don't have any control about that right it's a state or federal thing that what is it mobile homes manufactured homes these addresses Robert I'm sorry any of those aren't required so you know boy it seems you we can end up with the county of trailer homes and you know out loss if you want that go for it otherwise trees please try to make housing affordable part of your job thank you hmm Mike would you address the inspections regime thank you for bringing that up I need to clarify that so that inspection well where we are looking at the electrical and mechanical the walls are all open the plumbing is finished the framing is finished the framing could must be finished in order for you to run your electrical so we're looking at all at one shot we're walking through it one time looking at multiple disciplines at once framing mechanical plumbing and electrical it's one inspection so I don't understand why we're mandating three inspections because in our current ordinance we only require one inspection right and ultimately that's the final although when we bring this up when we're issuing a permit at the counter we offer people if you'd like to get every inspection you certainly can and on new structures well over 90% of those people say we'd like you out there for every single inspection and how many is that just roughly how would it be okay it could be up to seven inspections to seven these functions okay and tell me again one more time what are the three inspections that were that we are proposing proposing underclass getting we are proposing the foundation inspection right the roughen inspection right that in the rough inspection it includes in that one inspection the rough frame rough plumbing rough electrical and rough mechanical right and then final the final inspection those three those are the three inspections okay that's what I thought yes now chairman mike is absolutely correct there are a lot of folks when they come in and they apply for the permit they opt to have this is applying for Class K and we'll call it new construction they opted to have as many of the inspections as they can what they're looking at it is if you see anything that's wrong tell us where we see the one inspection is basically when somebody comes in and says I built without a permit I opted to go through the class k and then that's when they do the 1 inspection but we're seeing more and more people now ask us for the service even though it's new construction and class K and I think when this was formulated as far as the minimum 3 it was based on prior folks utilizing the service I just wanted to throw that out from the board's consideration okay John thank you so two questions one that just came up based on director Gonzales whose comments so if someone built without a permit and they come in and they say okay I want a permit now I want to go through class K then there's only one inspection required accurate so far yes that is accurate and then for that inspection and the house has already been built the walls are closed up do we require that a certain number of openings be created to check what the wiring or plumbing actually was no we do not although we have electrical testers that we carry with us and we check the final electrical but we do not require them to open up the walls we verify that it was you know there's a ground wire etc but that that's what our electrical equipment properly fastened and all that where we don't really are the hot neutrals reverse reverse polarity as such but that's the beauty of that second inspection while the walls are still open on new construction is visually seen the circuits in the wall thank you and then the second question the commenter questioned why framing would be inspected I'm assuming we're inspecting it to the class case standard or what what's the explanation there well that brings me to the point there are still benefits to class K after these revisions if they are going to be accepted and approved and one of those measures is that the framing still can be ungraded lumber you can mill your own lumber on your site and use that all of that lumber for framing so we're going to look at that the framing that way they will not need to be graded so part of the the typical framing inspection is you're gonna want to know if there's something wrong wrong with your framing you're gonna want to know at that point but acted it was recycled ungraded home milled whatever would not be one of those things that had be called out it would not because it would still be allowed under the class k ordinance right we also carry moisture meters with us with hoe milled lumber we check the moisture in the lumber to make sure that as they cover it it's not going to build up mold in the frame so we check for a nineteen percent moisture content if it's above that we say you can't cover it until it's less than 19 percent and people appreciate those things they appreciate those rough inspections so it's your last opportunity to catch something before it's covered okay yes mash I think Mike knows exactly what the wording is on this but when when we go through a structure that only has one inspection and they're not able to see what's behind the wall basically the owner is accepting the liability and the responsibility and there is a notice that is recorded on the title what we have seen over the last several years is like Mike has described they're asking for the service they're asking for tell us is everything okay right here and so what Mike is proposing is this is service that is typically being offered is is now part of the code so that again the issue of ungraded lumber is in a call out but it's in case there's something there that somebody's not catching there's a correction notice that says okay you've asked us to look at this this is what needs to be looked at and I'm trying to think of an example where you may have a framing member that is not installed correctly that could be susceptible to I'll say an issue because it wasn't installed properly and again it's it's the service that the building department provides by saying that was installed incorrectly you may want to look at that it's there again for people's safety mmm nothing more than providing that service okay thank you okay the I think the next step really is in County Council's shop which is - pardon me Oh amnesty all right we okay we could talk about that for just a minute the board is actually considering the extension of the current amnesty period which I believe expires June 30th of 2018 is that correct discussing extending it to June 30 2018 the current amnesty expires on the 31st of this month the board has had discussions about extending it to the end of the fiscal year okay and again one of the things yes correct I was going to say one of the things that has been raised is the grandfathering and obstructions if somebody comes in today and says I'd like if the board decides to extend it until June then if people come in and say I'd like to go ahead and apply for the amnesty under the standards today then they would submit the application there would be under the current standards right and when will we be making that determination is that is that on a upcoming agenda before they no amnesty I respect Frank County Council may know but I would think that that issue could be on our agenda as early as the 19th possibly doesn't seem like it's a difficult thing to do to formalize the extension of the amnesty we previously did it we're good okay yes - I may add that as far as the extension the board can just give direction on the 19th to extend it and that's where we be at at that point we would then we publish the notification and post it and put it on a website that the the board has extended it to June that's pretty simple one other issue that's been raised with the current ordinance is that it only requires that the structure that is built be retained by the owner builder for a period of I think it's one year is that correct that is correct so it states you cannot rent sale or lease the building within one year of the final mm-hmm and is there a good reason for leaving that at one year I think the the person who brought it up to me thought that should be three years perhaps I think one year is appropriate because I believe that the current title 24 state law still has that written into it oh really okay thank you presumably however there might be an allowable exception for the accessory dwelling unit that we've discussed the and the exception would be well if the owner builder has built their 2,000 square foot structure and then they either simultaneously or subsequently build a 750 square foot accessory dwelling unit you wouldn't require them to have both is their primary residence would you you're right and that that was a little bit of a curveball thrown but but you're right so we would have to address that in the staff report right so I'd like to nail down a bit the County Council opinion brothers we've requested an opinion typically the opinions of County Council are privileged that can be waived by the full board so whether it's sponsored by the committee or the executive office it seems that it would be pretty easy to together an agenda item that would allow the board to make a decision to waive the confidentiality of the opinion related to the wildland-urban interface standards and the sprinklers because I think that just needs to be part of the product discussion I believe and the other thing that I wanted to ask of County Council is when do you think we could have such an opinion I mean is it something we could look for in in a week two weeks three weeks what's your current estimates so I think we could bring this back to you in January and again it's something we might have had today but as you know with the various things that we've been involved in we've been sent back on many goals so okay so you're saying that the opinion could be in the hands of the board and presumably the public by the first week of January the second week of January just I'd say the second week of January and the reason I'm pausing as I know mr. Kudrin skee takes time off during the holidays because of his children being at home so okay so we can we just look on the calendar and just say so we'll have that by January 10th or January just so we have a date that we're looking at you just go so I'm checking with mr. Kudrin ski he's staying I mean we could probably have it to the board by the 9th or the 10th but that doesn't give you time to notice it well and then subsequent to that we will have a agenda item before the board correct but the shaping of that agenda item will be you know will be dependent to some degree on what that opinion is of course and then that would help planning a building in terms of their staff report is wide so if I could just ask the CEO do you have an idea of when this might we will be I would say we're still looking at the public health declaration we've asked for that to be every four weeks so I say that because I'm not certain if our first meeting will be January 2nd or January 9th and so that will lay out the whole schedule as you know so I think it would probably can I safely say early February is that too late or could we say first meeting in February absolutely absolutely we could say that okay and we don't actually do we know what that those are laughs I put together a very nice draft schedule but we are still waiting to see okay but that does give the public in the first we could say the first meeting in February if that works for the standing committee I'm looking at your colleague up there yeah okay John do you uh well I wanted to come back to it's kind of a three-part issue one securing the approval of the board to make the opinion public and I've suggested either the committee or executive office could sponsor an item for the 19th which I think could be on consent very briefly laying out the issue of why it's appropriate to make that opinion public so that I think could happen on the 19th it's a very simple item I'd volunteer to draft it if that helps and then secondly County Council will produce the opinion which we're told will be available in January and then thirdly we would have the full board agenda item in February yeah I that lays it out very nicely thank you so so for the 19th we would have the opinion I'll work with County Council since this is a legal opinion well you wouldn't have the opinion you'd have the request to the board that when available the opinion be made public you know that's fine and then also extending the amnesty will come forward on December 19th so then you would have a standing committee in January where the legal opinion would come forward is that what you're thinking this whole issue from here it will go straight I think the standing committee is okay to pass us on this hot potato now goes to the board okay yes all right thank you and there's one issue still related to amnesty that I think involves a legal opinion also and that is you know typically amnesty you have your structure that you build without a permit you come in you apply for amnesty but I believe we currently require that you meet the current standards that are in place the day you apply for amnesty rather than the day that you built the structure which could have been decades in the past that is correct if you you apply for the amnesty you're applying for the standards that are in place today and might correct me if I'm wrong but that would either be the UVC of the CBC or a class K that is correct we honor the application date and if they choose to go with the class K we the current class K or the current California Building Code and it's out something that's enshrined in state law or is out something that there's an option to have a different approach locally I don't know if that's written into state law or not but I know it's been the policy of planning and building for a very long time because the the question that I believe has been raised some people would would like a grandfathering in in effect of gee I built it in 1985 count I use the class case standards or it could have been in 2015 can't I use the class case standards that are currently on the books that's what's being requested by some if I may I think the grandfathering is basically accepting what's there and not putting any new requirements on them but they would it has always been the intent of the department and I believe it's the intent section in the in the building codes as they're adopted every three years that you go by what's in effect at the time that an application comes in so let's say that the board extends the amnesty until June and this ordinance is brought forth to the board in February and the board does take action it becomes effective thirty days thereafter so we're looking at March so any time after let's say and I'll just use a after the April first then it would be than anything coming in even under amnesty would be subject to the current building code or the new class K ordinance in effect I think what if folks want to grandfather something and they need to get into the process today but it doesn't really allow for people to go back in time to when they built the structure mainly because codes changed so much you know we did we do have a position in the county that free code structures are that was built before 1974 but since that date we've adopted new versions of the code and change and so anything that's always been grandfathered in or non-conforming we say if it was built on such and such date then it is non-conforming anything after that date has to comply so again as I've said if anything is comes in after April 1st than anything that was built before that is is non-conforming and would have to conform with with with what is in effect as of the new code unless they get in and apply it now mm-hmm just don't assume that the application date would be the operative date the day that it becomes effective right yes the application date for the amnesty for the the building which was built without the permit the when they build it with yes so when the building comes in it if it comes in today it is basically subject to the codes that are right until whatever time and an amended code becomes then we go with the new code it's just like when we're now operating at the 2016 California Building Code anything that comes in today whether it was built 20 years ago or today it's subject to the 2016 code right okay so what happens in a case where our our current class K allows us to exempt a lot of the wild land urban interface standards however going back to 1992 we may not have had the legal authority to make that exemption so then if we go by our ordinance on the books you apply before we change that ordinance you're exempt by our standard but what if the state actually mandated those standards in 1992 or any time subsequent would we have the authority to exempt people from those state mandated standards so that probably needs to be part of the legal opinion as well so I hope paying attention to that that is correct if it has been determined that they are subject to those standards then it's out of our hands but if it wasn't then we move forward as business as usual so it might go back to you know though if those standards took effect at some point in 1992 then people who can demonstrate well no because it gets confusing because we're we're considering the date of construction to be the date of application aren't we for amnesty it is the date of application it's when when the application comes in is basically tied to date of construction if they build something in 1991 and the wildland urban interface standards were not yet in effect but they come in today and apply because they never got a permit before then they might have to comply with those wildland urban interface standards they may and again this is something that we're gonna have to talk to Council about because as of today they would be subject to the current class k ordinance which didn't subject them to it then but if they do apply for a building code what I call the California Building Code requirements they are subject to those requirements that's why a lot of folks who build without the benefit of a permit and they come in today they are given those choices either go through the building code and go through that process or go through the class K a lot of people choose the class K because it's going to be much more affordable in US unless erroneous especially when you have to open up walls and you have to show how you've done this and then you have to show how you've complied with with certain standards outside of the structure that's why people have gone in those directions if they come in after the class k ordinance has been amended they will be subject to the standards of the new class k ordinance but as we're discussing now even if they come man you know for the previously non-permitted structure even if they come in now even though our current class cave ordinance wouldn't require it they still might have to comply with wildland urban interface standards based on state law that is correct but only only if the state were to become cognizant of that and come in and force the county's hand that is correct well isn't it if we know that's the state standard isn't that what we are obligated to require now that the question has been raised can we pretend ignorance let's let's pretend we didn't raise it unfortunately are being recorded so with with that I think we're going to to wrap this up and thank you everybody for coming in and and as you heard we will be getting an opinion in in early February and be bringing this in early January and bringing this back to the board at our first meeting in February and John you got a final comment well I'd like to try and reiterate what I think we've directed and then have staff correct me if I've left things out or missing why don't we have staff quickly stay what they think we've agreed to might be quicker well it might not III would like clarification so we're getting on should I wait to start to prepare the staff report until after December 19th or will we have a complete legal appeal summer 19th is only going to be does the board want the opinion to become public so I yeah I would suggest maybe waiting until you have the legal opinion before you write your staff report okay and then and that's what we'll do is we'll wait for the opinion and we'll formulate the staff report and recommendations so that and I think with the opinion we'll be able to address supervisor McCowan's comment on the the fire safe standards that go back in time okay so again I've got like half a dozen points in bullet point form quickly by me okay incorporate engineering standards I'll put my glasses on and recognize alternative building material materials that are equal to or better than including but not limited to and then list those examples we know of recognize a one-acre actual parcel size 2,000 square foot limit with an additional 750 square feet as an accessory dwelling unit which triggers a little discussion by staff exempt twelve hundred and fifty square feet and under from sprinklers if allowable amnesty would apply and of course the county council opinion and i think in three inspections and three inspections yeah the balance of items not mentioned here if sales previously discussed and recommended sound out good yep and then please correct me if i'd miss stated something for understanding or does that work for you Mike yes it does yeah okay now so good yes okay but just to be clear I'm on hold until I get claret legal clarification on until we get the opinion from Carol and because it will take me some time to prevent to present and draft this ordinance right and depending on the opinion it might simplify it might be really quick right okay thank you all very much bingo almost on", "AORyULfIRe0": "yo yo yo what's good youtube welcome to another live stream i'm going to raise you up just a bit sweet so gopro updated and um my new wi-fi router is in we're showing signal strength here for the stream decent it didn't show that before so now that's pretty good to see anyways let me go ahead and share the link out to instagram and we're going to go ahead and get started uh all right cool well glad we got that up and running let me go ahead and uh get this stream up on my computer oh you're right let's see i'm sure you guys want to see some of this stuff that i have here before we even get started right let me show you what we got going on first of all we weighed everything out earlier we uh pulled it out of the freeze dryer fresh this morning fat fat nineteen point four percent yield killed it one thousand one hundred and thirty grams of nug went in 220 grams of full spectrum hash came out as well as 19 grams of 25 and 160 micron so this is our test press that we use for edibles and then we'll go ahead and press out the rest of these full spectrum pucks i loaded them by hand into the bags and then after putting them in the bags i pressed them down in a rosin evolution pre-press to make sure that they stayed nice and tight and they are evenly distributed went up from uh the small little four ounce jars and uh upgraded to the six ounce jars i got tired of filling those little small ones to the brim and i said it's time to upgrade baby so we got the jar all weighed out we'll be able to weigh this when we're done tonight and see what our final yield was on this run now i'm a big fan of doing my presses a little bit warmer than what most people would i'm using my stool for you guys today so i'm gonna do this but um yeah you guys that watch me often know i will press anywhere from 200 to 225 depending on the cultivar depending on the hash um not all hash comes out the same um for example we talked about trichome density before right we talked about just because it looks like a lot of hash it may not be a lot of hash because um the oil inside may not be full you know what i'm saying the trichome may just be partially full in that case it's fluffy hash where it looks like a lot but it doesn't weigh a lot that's why this 25 micron and this 160 micron it looks like a large puck but it only weighs 19 grams compared to this puck which is smaller in comparison by about a centimeter right and it's not as fat but it weighs more probably about five to six grams more and that's because this is the full spectrum 45 through the 159 which contains higher density trichomes that are full of milk oil compared to the 25 and 160. so just a little throw that in there for you interior genetics what's going on asteroid farms if you guys aren't following asteroid farms on instagram go follow so old homie of mine platinum grove colorado who used to have a really pimp-ass girl room the nasa lab right um one of the inspirations for me initially stepping up my garden well now it's his turn to come back and he just got a brand new house with a nice ass basement and guess what it's time for a brand new build out so we're gonna help each other out take some ideas off of each other and i'm basically gonna have him record the whole thing and um show you guys how he does his build out you know and he'll give you guys pointers along the way and uh you know show you how to build a grow room so by the time you know he's done with that uh build out i'll be done uploading my video on how when i built out my grow room and uh his will be pretty much part two of a series that i'm going to be doing where it's going to be either build-outs brand new or remodels or upgrades and you guys will be able to pay for each episode um individually and absorb all the information that went into that whole build or remodel so it was actually his idea and we're gonna do his build out as episode two so it's gonna be awesome it's gonna have amazing information in there and it's gonna be great for you guys because instead of just seeing my room all the time and you're like oh that's great but not everybody has your room like yours or not everybody has a layout like yours you'll get to see different layouts different places different um climates right you're gonna get to see it all and you're gonna get to see the different thought process that goes into building these so it's gonna be really cool but anyways go check out his instagram because he's already started posting updates on it and it's not often that you get to jump on board and watch it build out brand new from the start most of the time you hop in and it's like uh the person's halfway done they've already done a bunch of [ __ ] you kind of like feel like the new guy you know what i'm saying in a crowd of old guys that been around for a long time now's your chance to get in on the bottom floor be one of those old guys he's been there forever by the time he gets done finishing you could be like i was there when you were still drawing the blueprints yo whippersnapper some of this blue icy and then i'm going to glove up the press is set to 175. we're going to do a low temp press on our test bag it's not going to be a clear indication of how the full spectrum is going to respond but it's going to give me a good enough idea to know whether or not 175 is going to provide the flow i'm looking for or if i'm going to need to go up to my 204 temperature 202 maybe i will put a link up right now i'm not sure that you guys can do it that's what's up jinder mah what's up dude i haven't seen you in forever holy moly so yeah check out asteroid farms what's going on viper what's up slug upstate what's going on we're just giving everybody a minute to trickle on in taking dabs we're enjoying life i haven't even taken a dab with you guys yet have i ah let's take a dab i'm gonna go in on some of this blue icy first oh let's get in there who wants to get in those guts with me we've got 31 left on this battery oh let's get in there the gopro doesn't focus well close up so you guys are gonna take what you get and be happy all right first time catching a live stream viper you caught a very good live stream for your first live stream this whole live stream i've already prepped all my parchment i prepped all my bags normally i'm not this prepped normally i still have full parchment and [ __ ] i wiped down the plates i'm ready to go baby it's waiting on you guys i mean what do you think we're about to press a half pound of hash a half pound cheers at 413 on the email okay ah that blue icy i swear on the exhale it tastes just like a blue icy it is so crazy every time it never fails what's up easy labs green ranger nashville how you doing freshly pressed what's up annie oh gee what's up hidden creek we got the whole [ __ ] family here i think i'm gonna do a live stream prank and start a live stream pressing hash with the hair straightener so we can get a million people asking oh no what happened did the press break fantastic so huh all righty all righty all righty let's swap out the battery you already know we got it we gotta swap out the battery we don't want it to die it'll be another short live stream i had to find it i couldn't forget i couldn't remember where the [ __ ] i put it down now i can't remember which batteries are charged now let's see lucky number nothing they'd be lying sometimes you got to pull them out and pop them back in they're not lying tonight [ __ ] [ __ ] well one of you's got to be higher than 25 [ __ ] percent let's find out i i don't feel comfortable knowing i've got 25 percent left on the battery i just took a fat ass dab and i'm about to start pressing i'm gonna get excited forget and this is gonna die by the way if the stream does go down unexpectedly please stay tuned because i will bring it right back up this is a non-stop party tonight that battery was at 100 you [ __ ] lying ass charger all right all right so for those of you that are new here i do a [ __ ] ton in a very small space so this is where i'm going to be collecting at when i'm all done here okay we're gonna move some [ __ ] out of the way shout out to roz and inc i want you guys to look at something real close here custom product for who that is who has bags like that who has bags like that do you want to know why he carries these two and a half by four and a half bags hey cuz of me baby who wants some bags i know some of you press and some of you need some bags all right anyways we've got parchment laid out we've got our bags ready to go okay and here you guys are going to go you're going to go right here look at that just for you how's that view yeah you could just chill set you down now is a good time if you got to use the restroom you got to go grab a drink you know what i'm saying whatever you got to do go handle that let me figure out this lighting i don't want it to be too bright for you guys oh [ __ ] that's too bright all right i feel good about this you guys are ordering from rosin inc make sure you guys use my coupon codes they're on my site solventlessbnb.com let's get ready get up there get up there just a little love from my homie right there you know all right remember you guys we're gonna be doing the 160 micron and the 25 micron mixed together as a test press before we move on to the full spectrum presses here we have the uh [ __ ] puck come on turn on screen doesn't recognize my gloves oh well anyways i hope that you guys were able to see that now this uh this is just some uh edibles mix of some uh the last strain that i pressed out which is the grape cosby little dark but it is [ __ ] chirpy and delicious and it will do amazing for edibles because the flavor that it will add is not too over the top but it's definitely like you notice it notice it so we're going to drip this into that edibles jar this is probably not going to flow crazy this is a test press a low temp test press at 175 all right i honestly feel like i should go up a little so so so so oh that looks like it's gonna be good well i think i found the temperature i'm gonna try for the first full spectrum maybe it'll flow a little bit more i'll take it for edibles siezer um don't worry that was just a plate on top of the press jumping around my cold plate up there good extraction well the flow was okay wasn't quite what i want it's kind of a weird flow so all right well not quite what i'm looking for believe it or not 185 that's gonna give me that awkward drip i'm gonna hold pull my audience to see what you guys think the temperature is that i'm gonna go with i already know what i'm going with i'm gonna go with uh my usual all right well we're gonna go ahead and do the first full uh spec press now all the same size that one was at 175. small bag we'll do this one first oh jesus 224 no too high 202 202 202 that's that's where i'm feeling 202 today i can feel it in my huevos rancheros pressing some cool spectrum once cash baby all right the room temperature is 74 degrees i do not believe in running a cold room during the pressing stage now bear with me you guys this is going to be a tad bit awkward as i have to deal with not only the um press this new jar which is larger and doesn't sit on the edge so i have to hold it like this in fact i don't even know what your viewpoint is now does that make sense right there where it's at for you guys i mean all right here we go we're at 191.1 191.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 six that's how slow my press heats up i love it i don't care what anybody says it doesn't overshoot temperatures during pressing because it sleeps it heats up slowly it doesn't like jump up all crazy because it has some overpowered 150 to 200 watt heaters it just has two 100 watt heaters nicely spaced out let's take a dab again next time tomorrow it sounds delicious this [ __ ] is like caramel taffy uh oh uh oh ah excuse me i felt like my nose was gonna run all over camera i didn't want that oh yeah what's up mommy my [ __ ] that'll do good that'll do oh that gets the job done i'll tell you what how you guys feeling about this prize we're at 199.7 199.7.8.9 200. 201 i'm not there and dad just [ __ ] knock me on my ass about let's get ready to remove look at that still plenty of paper towel left to clean bangers with throw that away save that puffing my man it's a good night when my boy puffin comes to visit you're pressing yourself right now huh hell yeah get it

little bit differently here safety reasons there it is my press has a ram that can adjust positions so um it's a little bit different than most the ram isn't stationary which means that it can come out of alignment sometimes if i move it or whatever but it's all we're helping to make good taking care of your summer projects is a breeze bam summer savings on all your favorite brands make things

plates when i was adjusting it apparently almost popped out of the front no blow out though but i gotta pull it out real quick and readjust it i'm so glad that didn't blow out but somehow that slipped out that's a trip i'm so happy that i didn't blow out that's crazy what the [ __ ] i've never had that happened that's a trip that's a trip son experience saved for real he wouldn't would he he [ __ ] would let's go back on the plates you go you son of a [ __ ] that was a trippy trip trippy trip trip this thing is about i was like why is it not going like it should be leaking way more and then all

lot of work bro i know i'm saying it's already time to upgrade the jar again i just got this damn jar i'm upset it's not fun i thought for sure it was going to be good enough we knew get a bigger drawer uh bertha it's time to go squirtle what the [ __ ] it did it again something's going on here is it sliding something's happening here there's no blowout but it's sliding off pressure's not being applied evenly to the plates somehow or they're too tight or i pre-packed them at an angle never had this happen okay i know what i'm about to do fix this i'm going to have to increase the pressure even slower every problem there is a solution hmm leaned on him to apply pressure for the pre-press by doing it evenly i had to have been time to upgrade and put my bigger plates on i guess for these bigger presses right inside there i hope you guys are watching this if you guys aren't [ __ ] paying attention i don't know what you're doing right now when i mess up that's when you guys need to pay attention because i don't mess up very often not to sound cocky whatsoever but i don't so if i make a mistake that's resulting in some type of mess up it would benefit everybody around me to pay attention and realize what i'm doing wrong so i got my light that's fine before i make sure i got the jar underneath there i didn't think it was going to squirt like that still this parchment is heavy from the [ __ ] first part of the press but it's still flowing good that's all that matters and no blowout fan dumb strong on the top setting don't you get a damn hum my curl is my rocker maybe i choose you and i don't even have i don't even have um i have a couple theories for what it is lots of adjusts right now it's increasing pressure too fast and also i have the press at a a pretty good angle right now leaning towards the front and i think that the hash is melting and making the puck inside uneven and then it blows out the front like that so i think i'm just going to go ahead oops just hit the table i'm going to go ahead and flatten out the press a little bit more risky with this puck anymore how would i do on the save [ __ ] crazy giving her incredible so okay my battery at 34 okay um check the alignment of the plates one more me come on gloves don't stupid i know it's not that cold in here but then mm-hmm little 74 degrees in here oh missiles contemplating

video we're going to be talking about how to detox and cleanse your lungs are you ready let's go so before we get into the video I just want to give a quick medical disclaimer because this video is not intended to substitute for professional medical advice diagnosis or treatment so of course please consult with your physician with any questions that you may have regarding a medical condition and never disregard professional medical advice or delay in seeking it because of something you watched in this video so now that we got that out of the way the big question that you're probably wondering is can you detox your lungs and to give a brief answer yes of course you can but you have to be careful about the information that you choose to go by when referring to this topic if you were to do a quick google search you will see that there are so many products out there that are trying to sell you on the fact that you can cleanse your lungs you have vitamins pills teas and oils and the manufacturers of these products promise fast and effective results however the big problem with these types of products is that most of them are not even FDA approved and of course there is no guarantee that they will work but with that said we have compiled a list of some of the best lung cleanse tea products that are safe for consumption and if you're interested I'll leave a link down below in the description but according to the American Lung Association it is possible to eliminate pollutants from your lungs and most importantly this can be done in a safe way you should aim to use natural remedies for cleansing and detoxing your lungs and that is exactly what we are about to talk about in this video so if you're ready let's dive in first and foremost you can quit smoking there is no better way to remove toxins from the lungs than to stop smoking it's important to know that cigarette smoke contains over 7,000 chemicals so if you smoke regularly your lungs will be changed matically over time it will cause your lungs to decrease in size and develop a black pigmentation the smoke also irritates your lungs and causes inflammation of the lung tissue this is why smokers often suffer from asthma chest pain COPD emphysema pneumonia shortness of breath and many other health related problems also smokers find it more difficult to perform day-to-day activities such as simple things like walking and going up stairs and as I'm sure you already know many medical studies have found that there is a direct link between smoking and lung cancer so all of that to say this first and foremost if you want to detox and cleanse your lungs you must stop smoking another great way to detox your lungs is regular exercise and physical activity exercising regularly can improve your respiratory muscles dramatically this will help you to be able to breathe deeper and more efficiently and your body will be able to take in more oxygen which can cleanse and purify your lungs the average person should aim to exercise for 30 minutes per day for 3 to 5 days per week and not only is physical exercise recommended but breathing exercises are good for your lungs as well but let's not get ahead of ourselves we'll talk about that later on in this video but for now just know that if you exercise regularly then you will be able to strengthen your diaphragm push toxins out of the lungs and improve your lung function significantly over time what more could a person ask for that is looking to detox their lungs the next way to cleanse your lungs is to adjust your diet it is crucial to eat healthy in order to detox your lungs naturally you should strive to make sure that your diet includes foods that are rich in vitamins minerals and nutrients because they are essential for healthy lung functioning and also strive to avoid sugars and heavily processed foods so instead of the chips cookies and snacks try to eat fruits and vegetables and other healthy foods that are good for your body and your lungs and it's also important to make sure that you're drinking enough water keeping your body hydrated can help speed up the lungs healing process especially for someone who was a smoker water helps to flush out toxins from the body and cleanses the lungs in a natural way plus your body needs fluid in the blood so that it can flow in and out of the lungs for oxygenation it's recommended to drink up to six to eight glasses of water every single day and that brings us to the next way to detox your lungs and it is to monitor the quality of outdoor air that you breathe if you've been inhaling unclean air for any period of time it most likely means that it is time for you to focus on detoxing your lungs industrial factories as well as everyday activities like driving a car can have a negative impact only local air quality that you are breathing so if you live near or work in a factory the quality of the air that you're breathing could potentially be detrimental to the health of your lungs things like dust chemicals and pollutants are very dangerous for your lungs as well that is why it is so important to monitor the quality of air that you are breathing I realize that sometimes this can be out of your control but when it comes to protecting your lungs and overall health it may be worth it to change jobs or relocate to a rural city with cleaner air and if you're unsure about the quality of air in your location you can use the AQI tool on air now gov it's an online tool where you can enter your location and it will tell you how clean the air is in that area and like I said before the overall health of your lungs is very important in regards to the quality of your life so if the air quality is unhealthy where you live it may be worth at least considering moving to a new location now the next natural way to detox your lungs is to avoid secondhand smoke now we already mentioned quitting smoking and with that being said even if you do not smoke it doesn't necessarily mean that you are safe that is because you still may be exposed to secondhand smoke which has been proven to be just as detrimental to your lungs secondhand smoke can pose serious health risks due to the fact that it contains such toxic chemicals and even if you're not a smoker secondhand smoke also increases the chances of lung cancer so in order to cleanse your lungs and keep them healthy long term you should avoid secondhand smoke at all cost and last but not least another way to cleanse and detox your lungs is to perform breathing exercises now earlier we talked about how exercise and physical activity can help strengthen and detox your lungs now let's discuss how beneficial breathing exercises can be as well now as you already know breathing is a natural process of life it's how all the cells in your body get enough oxygen and of course oxygen is incredibly important for the proper functioning of the organs in the body and the more oxygen the body gets the better the diaphragm also plays a very important role in the human body's respiratory system the diaphragm is a muscle that contracts up and down as we breathe and it's important to know that the diaphragm naturally starts to work less efficiently as we age and that is why it's important to do breathing exercises regularly in order to keep the diaphragm strong and healthy diaphragmatic breathing or also known as belly breathing is an effective technique that can be used to strengthen the diaphragm and increase the oxygen carrying capacity of the lungs this technique is performed by taking a deep breath in almost as if you were attempting to breathe all the way into your stomach and as the inhalation occurs you will fill the diaphragm contract then you can exhale slowly through purse lips this creates back pressure in the alveoli in the lungs which is great for improved lung compliance and cleansing your lungs so there you have it not only do you now know how to detox your lungs you know how to do it the right way sure there may be some products and supplements out there that can help but for the most part the best way to improve the health of your lungs can occur naturally by implementing the things that we discussed in this video if you thought this information was helpful do me a favor and hit that thumbs up button and don't forget to

we have the Corolla her over her over so they started off I edible because it says Corolla edibles dark all that's cool a little swag I heard purchase basically I'm high spike I think so long just to name this goddamn car not my serious is this packaging is badass like I buyed this mostly because not owe money I'll buy this mostly because of the packaging to this max but packaging here makes me [ __ ] giddy because it's like 22 bucks for a half gram and see something crazy but to me bro my brother I did a lot for a half - kidding me I get a real kingpin full guy for $30 bro but you know you pay for what you care I guess this is a Mendel press my first one that I got was OG Kush alright could honestly say I like that way better than this one but this one's cool this is the this is this is the [ __ ] mmm you know testing Schleicher teaching cannabinoids yes composite it's a 84 89% do you see 95 percent total cannabinoids SHM actors man who can say well this is really say here I don't know what that is but for the people that know what that did in our internship climb up this bar shake do that honestly Penn that obviously Penn called me hi thanks a lot of sense [ __ ] probably that pink on me alive this so this is how you [ __ ] so I already took it apart just because I was so when I was like I saw so as you can tell it's already ripped apart in shape because I had just got it at work and I haven't been high up and I had him Dan who that's just [ __ ] peeling my god oh yeah I got locked out on my car in Sacramento and I was stuck in the heat and that's why I'm peeling till I got burnt good story huh well if I was blocking oh he was only about lucky I'm so high and I up kog'maw but this is the way you open the shits actually sick and I didn't want to open it because I wanted to do it on camera not good I'll do the yeah I'll get another one I review it again another basically just push down Oh this little piece comes off the tube and then this is holding it right there on the bottom that's pretty sick because it says the strain name says I'm in the breath and then this is 0.5 yeah this one actually came a little bit more filled the holes you push one like I hit I hit it a little bit ready but it still has like a like you know that little line that's on top and when I got the OD cuz she was it's just a street of flat line already out the package anyways you just twist this off my humming look it was like I let him a video he's like Oh give me the giraffe one holy cow it's a cow that they died like all I brought up the cow took out that they're dying now pretty sick huh I've seen post on history cambro of people Teddy this young I'm like you trippin bro I mean it's like cookie like is no I could honestly say not gonna lie low kuroh was my favorite Brad like weeds fire carter fire I haven't tried to edibles yet but I heard the fire they need wax I don't think they have wax their wax was be crazy oh yeah and also this California thing is also removable removable go yes can't really see it that good but I'll get better shots here under the right right now so honestly for the taste I know I said this tastes like gummy bears but this tastes like straight gummy bears like this is like well okay comparing organic food to like highly concentrated food that's well like I would compare these two you know I like something natural like you get the natural taste but then like you get that fake big overly exaggerated taste in some food you know type [ __ ] like no I like the OG Kush a little bit better though not gonna lie just because I like that weak taste but it takes a bit softer [ __ ] so this maxpro small likes more than mine so I need to Betty smack special money I'm not [ __ ] yeah a little goes for you guys [Applause] your nation and they don't stop ain't gonna [ __ ] my [ __ ] side donate [ __ ] my a [ __ ] you [ __ ] y'all don't know bro shot like I've been during that tour [ __ ] [ __ ] don't y'all stay call they don't know what she's been I mean this is my second time buying from Korova like carts at least and OD cause she's [ __ ] crazy I was out got the OG Kush again honestly but they had right now and I forgot the other one was it was orange I'll find it I'll put a picture of it but um yeah I think I had read or in Quran Carabas Instagram that the men's of breath was the highest THC I mean though I think the object in the middle breast was the exact same I forgot to say the price I paid for this car which is a half gram with $23 on the door I'm not sure the price is that other people pages because I hear I hear like prices over here you know you actually come visit to an eye sometime just load up load up fellas Shana don't smoke or not not even don't smoke but you know something down [ __ ] he look for like a month boom no load up for like two month worth you know just stay out here for like two days three days get your med card in you can go in there two times bro cash had a 200 cat with the 30% off which is basically the price you see on weed maps is a price to pay you know so yeah I mean that's it see guys really wants it but but I don't got to do that because I live here so oh this is wrong like she's crazy look this is the bubble test I'm around get the bubble test and the b roll shot little thingie but yeah this is pretty much it for the video guys mama she say about carts you know I'm gonna do shape like a I mean I know what I'm gonna do I got something a story I literally just came to my head right now bro there's gonna be a sick idea nobody else has watch just wait you

"welcome back guys it's lunar reviews coming at you with another video and i'm hope you guys are excited to see this product again because i am super excited to go ahead and give them another try and it is earth bam i have the battery this time to go ahead and give it the ultimate review because you know the battery goes with it mendo breath for those that do not know that is a mendo usually mendo anything is a as far but mental breath specifically is one of my favorite strains when it comes to indica thc is coming in at 75.2 percent absolutely no cbd and terpenes is at 6.39 percent so no cbd so that means that the cbd is not going to interact and interfere with what i'm feeling thc wise for those that don't know cbd mellows and kind of like pretty much like weakens the high that you will experience from thc i don't want to say weekends but it like it mellows it out like it it pretty much balances it out like i don't know it's hard to explain but those that know what i'm talking about no i don't know what i'm talking about and it was just opening in opening and eating opening this package which all you do is rip off the little sticker at the bottom you click this button on the side and you pull to the bottom you get this beautiful looking cartridge beautiful oil terps are on the back so you can uh you know know what to uh what you're expecting to taste pretty much and the terpenes in this mental breath is going to be mercying relaxing sedative kerophiline anti-inflammatory limonene uplifting and energizing li na lua it's very weird word calming anti-anxiety and then pinene which is anti-inflammatory that's the leela lou it's a really weird word but love the packaging real nice just pull it right out of there and let's see what this is tasting like let's see what this is feeling like guys i'm really excited i've never had a ursa in their actual with their actual battery but my with my battery this ursa smack so i'm really excited to see what this is all about and what i should be expecting i'm go ahead and open the battery and it's all big tube and you just get the charger and the battery battery is already fully charged already fully charged at my house before bringing it over here so let's see if i get any taste and any uh aromas from this very excited so no taste and no um no no taste and no aroma right off the bat but that's gonna change as soon as i start vaping it you guys already know headspace not that bad you're always going to have head space in every uh any any cartridge really that you get take this out curious guys i'm curious i'm going to screw this on and i want to see if the i want to see if this okay does it i was curious i wanted to see if it did but it doesn't alright i just wanted to know it doesn't fit on there if you uh you can't fit the cartridge in there with actual tube let's put this away let's see what this is gonna be like this is the battery liquid diamond battery 1.2 one point it says 1.3 volts 1.6 volts and 1.9 so those are the three voltages these little dots right here are actually like grip like you rub your finger on it and it kind of slows it down it's like it's actually grip it's kind of insane actually i've never felt that on a battery before that's ursa right there one two all right let me see it's already okay it's already on one two three green one two three blue one two three red okay i'm assuming red is gonna be the hottest so i'm gonna yeah let's go on red one point um let's go ahead and hit on 1.9 that's bare that's barely below 2.0 so let's see how this is at i'm excited guys let's go for this first hit ursa the full kit let's go cheers guys let me know if you guys have had ursa what you guys think about them and how you guys feel about the products boom let's go for this first hit of the day first hit of the day let's go huh wow the tarps on that is crazy tastes exactly like mendo breath wow wow i had a high expectations for that and that exceeded my expectations lung expansion is there i'm starting to sweat a little bit already that's on 1.9 guys not even on 2.5 with my normal batteries on tasty mental breath to the t like i need to take another draw just so i can get a flavor profile for you guys that all i all i got was a straight up mental breath i feel so i feel like i'm already sliding all right wow smells so good that's a hard scent to describe it smells just like like you it smells like a the natural the normal form of cannabis like it smells like the flower but then you get that mendo breath strain aroma to it as well it's going for that hit though that's that [ __ ] right off the bat i already feel it cerebrally i feel it in my body lightly and it's already starting to soothe me it's already starting to sedate the body and wow that was a really really good hit this is why i love ursa man like i'm telling you guys you guys got to try ursa you guys got to give them a try this is why i will always vouch for that man they got some good [ __ ] good products always the first hit and i'm already like exactly where i would want to be you know let's go ahead and go for the second hit this is at 1.9 uh i'm surprised at how big of a hit i'm able to get was with such a low uh voltage well guys those two hits i'm already gone and by gone i mean i don't need no more this is why wow all right it fills your lungs up as if you took a dab it's not harsh at all very clean very smooth going in and coming out you feel almost nothing but you feel it expand your lungs and you feel this like you can feel the vapor like when you get a big hit and you're like like that feeling that that that's exactly what you feel and as soon as you exhale it gives you just this such a strong cannabis mental breathy just taste it's hard it's such a hard taste to describe but it tastes just like flour like just like the mental breath flower man it's that's why it's so hard to describe because there's nothing else to there's nothing else to it it just smells like what it smells like you know but all in all potency vapor production for being such low voltage everything about this cartridge is just amazing and the fact that you can pick these up for up to 55 to 60 grams that's just out of this world man there's some stizzies live resins that go up to like 70 80 and that's that's ridiculous this is not even on my top five and they're then they're extremely expensive so ursa i can't wait to try another one of you guys cartridges because every time i try one it's like my new favorite it's crazy but ursa compared to every other cartridge i would say every hit is flavorful every hit is potent some every other cartridge for some reason not every hit is as potent as the as the previous one sometimes you'll get a bigger head sometimes you'll get like a like a it's like a hit or miss but then again you know that's other companies so who knows what they're doing with their products and what they're doing with their with their live resin i just know that ursa is doing the right thing because i'll be honest every other cartridge i've hit i've smoked there will be some hits where i get no flavor i just get that resiny taste and i've never had that with ursa never the terps they put in there they put six almost there's almost seven percent terps in this dam in this cartridge and 75 thc yet it still feels better than some ninety percent and eighty percent that i've had of other cartridges so that it's just all all in all just a wonderful experience i would highly recommend getting the battery i can i can uh imagine this the oil is to last so much longer burning it at such a low temp while still getting a mad amazing flavorful hits like i'm over here stuttering now because this is how this is how medicated it has me i'm there let's go ahead and go for another uh hey guys i wanted to see if i get that next level every hit is another step you know a staircase you every step you take you go higher that's how it is with this cartridge guys every hit you take you get a step higher i feel like with every other cartridge there's a cap to how medicated you can get and but what i mean by that is for example raw garden if i hit a raw garden once and i hit it twice and then i hit it twice i'll get lit more lit after that second hit but if i were to hit a raw garden three four five times after that four or five times it almost feels almost feel the same to nothing it's crazy with this one every hit i take i get a step higher and that's how it's supposed to be in my opinion and if you guys uh if you guys haven't noticed uh check check ursa out ursa extracts on instagram they they lowkey gave me a shout out and they have a challenge going on right now uh for ursa so you guys check the challenge out and go ahead and uh and you know check check check check them out in general guys shit's uh amazing it has me stuttering like i'm over here stuck or let's go ahead and go for another pull wow i don't know if you guys noticed but every other cartridge i hit it so much more i take the hits are so much bigger this one i've taken two hits not even that big of a hit just two normal hits and i'm already i'm already where i would be with the other with other reviews so this is amazing i'm definitely gonna make this one last as long as i can i'm not gonna be chiefing it like crazy but let's go ahead and take a big hit and i hope you guys enjoy this video man i hope you guys like comment subscribe interact with me and yeah check your boy out cheers foreign wow there's just a bomb of flavor in my mouth and it's the good kind too it's not that [ __ ] fruitiness that you'd be getting from all the other [ __ ] it's not that [ __ ] none of that [ __ ] wow i could just i could just put my seat back and just go to sleep this [ __ ] has me gone guys that was a big hit another positive about ursa which i love their oil never gets stuck at the bottom every other cartridge for some reason their oil is always there's always air bubbles stuck at the bottom and that causes so many hits to taste burnt and it causes hits to not be consistent you know so every hit is as consistent as as hell with when it comes to earth so they're very consistent with their product wow if these were more available in my area i would only stick to these you know but the dispensary that's near me they've been out of ursa cartridges see cell cart no cecil so i'm i'm medicated guys they've been out of these ceramic uh coil ursa cartridges for about two months now it's been two months they haven't called me i told i tell them to give me a call whenever they re-up on ursas and they haven't called me so that means they haven't gotten any you know and i'm i call the time to check even to just to check and they still are always empty so i've had this ursa cartridge for like a couple weeks now just been holding off on the review just because as soon as i review it it's probably gonna i'm gonna you know go through it in a week or two and i didn't want i wanted this to last as long as possible so that's why i'm reviewing it so late but i i couldn't be more happier with this product it has me stuck i don't know what to say just because of how medicated i am in terms of taste i haven't been able to give you guys a big description and i apologize but just just know that it tastes exactly what mental breath tastes like and it's so it's just it's so good guys like i don't like saying good but this [ __ ] is good shit's amazing wow i don't even want to take another one just because i'm pretty much where i need to be and i don't need to go get any higher but why not let's get in let's get higher if you guys are go if you guys got a pen on you and a cartridge on you go ahead and take a hit with me this oil looks amazing i love the oil man look at this beautiful all right let's go guys let's go this time i'm going to take it on the lowest temp i want to see the difference all right let's go guys 1.3 volts cheers wow so like exactly like you what you would think the lower the lower you go the more the more you taste it wow it was it was it was a heavier on the mendo side than it was on the on the cannabis side and when you burn it at a heart attack it's heavy it's heavy on both sides you taste the cannabis just as much as the mental breath so let's see wow i'm very soft on the throat the lungs it's just all all in all every hit feels very clean and that's what i like about this you never get a harsh uncomfortable hit it never happens it's not it's non-existent with this product doesn't it doesn't happen it's not a thing so hope you guys have enjoyed i mean there's nothing to be said about this you know you guys already know what what's up with this uh what's up with ursa you guys already know man this is a a product that deserves a million followers right now but you know they're they're they'll get there one day one day they'll get there definitely putting out [ __ ] like this in no time i hope you guys enjoy this uh product as much as i do i hope you guys enjoyed the video let me know what you guys uh what you guys been up to what you guys have been smoking on let me know how you feel about ursa because i hear uh some mixed thoughts about them but that's with every product right you know you're gonna have different uh opinions on everything so there's you know doesn't surprise me and i would expect that but this is ursa this is liquid diamond sauce live resin mendo breath 75 and my next video guys for anyone that's watching up to this point is going to be my top five cartridges of 2020 uh cartridges it could be distillate live resin whatever most likely won't be any distillate in there but yeah i hope you guys enjoy yeah i look at i'm i'm so medicated i'm over stuttering again look out and uh keep an eye out for my next video and i hope you guys enjoy man this is looney and your boy is gone peace", "zVQruAIpxWk": "[Music] welcome to wheat entertainment and we love talking about grandy flora strains and this bud is something called yada da and it's really a unique looking bud but it was crunchy dry when i got it i opened up this bag and then i set it down and now it's even drier because i think i got this thing i don't know three weeks ago a month ago it just sat in the back i don't know why i didn't review it but i didn't do it so today's the day for yada da and let me load my little scooper into vapor cup straw i've already got two in here we're gonna add the third then we're gonna tamper and we're going to stick this down in the vapor cup then we're going to talk about yadda da yada comes in this bag and i got this at cookies maywood i got this at the apples and bananas drop down there i ran down there they held that for me and there were some comments on wheat entertainment so i grabbed it when i was down there and this flower has 26 thc and people are asking for the package date and uh so i'm going to give it that but to get that date i need a magnifying glass because my eyes aren't so good anymore so this is the package manufactured it is 9 29 20. oh no wonder it's so dry it's been in this bag for months right and you know what's crazy you would think that they're saving money on the jars right so at least they would give us some kind of moisture pack in here so these flowers when they come out of this bag are more fresh so let's say i got this the beginning january was harvested three months before crazy just crazy but anyway it's not about the dryness i don't wait for that so even though i note it that has nothing to do with my ratings my ratings are all about the something something and everyone's got their own something something that they're looking for but what i'm looking for are heavy flowers with focus that could grin me out i have to stay active i have a lot of responsibilities have to take care of i need flowers that can let me do that now i'm also a heavy hitter so a lot of the flowers even though i call them focus flowers they could stone you to the bone but it doesn't necessarily do that for me but certain ones do like the couch lock flowers but this isn't about catch lock i'm not looking for those type of flies this is about focused flowers that can grin me out so today it's jan dada turn to get the review we're looking for the best well let's check it out so you can see that's about amount a time it takes for vapor cup to work you can see that right there that's the terpenes the cannabinoids the water vapor and the oil vapor you can see it condenses right on the straw it takes about a minute and 20 once this cup is hot and also a lot of people have vapor cup so make sure your cup is hot if the cup is hot you need less time in the chamber if it's a fresh you just start it up you're going to need more time in the chamber and that's one of the things when you get vapor cup you got to learn use but i love this thing this thing changed my life but today it's about yada da so let's check it out yada da by grandiflora at 330 degrees out of vapor cup let's do this again so this flower's got a light og taste with a pungent pal but there's much bigger pungent pals than this one but it has it and the pungent pal it's i'm gonna say it's something like the chicken wing you know when you go buy chicken wings you smell it it makes you kind of like the ammonia taste people say ammonia but if you try vapor cup i'm going to tell you it's a pungent pal this flower took me a lot of flour to get stoned actually but it definitely got me stoned this flower's strong enough but not super strong and i thought it was good so what did i rate yada da i'm looking for the best and this flower you know at first i'm saying it's not strong enough but i used a really lot of it i used up half an eighth on the session i mean i really used a lot of it and in the end the feeling was actually kind of good it wasn't heavy it wasn't you had focus or didn't have focus i would say it was like a cruiser a little bit i wish it personally would have been a little heavier this flower gets an 8.65 which means it's a good flower if you're not a super heavyweight yeah it's a try but for someone who's a super heavyweight this flower may be not strong enough for them it was good but there's definitely better out of granny flora if you want to get a vapor cup this item right here and i'm telling you instead of smoking your flour up and joints get one of these things that little bit of flour that i put into this cup can last you 10 minutes and stone you to the bone i love this thing makes so many opportunities for use i love it and you can see it at vaporcup.com if you want to see my favorite picks you can see them on wheat entertainment.com that site's just getting updated right now it's going to have my top 100 strains in la out of 1500 strains i tried this is my journey i'm looking for the best thanks for joining in if you have a tip for me leave it below the video i'm the doctor i post every day but sunday it's my day off party on my friends [Music] you", "UVnFAtLmhco": "from microbetv this is twip this week in parasitism episode number 192 recorded on february 11 2021 [Music] i'm vincent bracaniello and joining me today from fort lee new jersey dixon de pommier hello vincent and hello daniel when you say hello and from new york daniel griffin hello everyone you know now with the zoom with the visual i guess i'm always here exactly exactly yeah we're never going to go back to uh the way we used to be with just audio now that we are used to zoom we can see each other and people this is a remarkable transition i think i i'm very impressed i began my course last friday i have another one tomorrow and um you know you see all the students you get to know whether they're awake or asleep you can tell when they go out for a pee or something because the screen goes blank and then they come back on again but it's it's a different world because you can you can really uh i think you can learn this way i'm thoroughly convinced that it's a good good technology for uh not just remote learning but just learning well not everybody can learn unfortunately there are some people who can't handle screens actually and i have that in my course and oh is that right is that yeah i mean you have something about the i don't know what you have to you know so it's not for everyone it's too bad yeah i'm not sure my 15 year old son barnaby is thriving in a virtual learning environment to be honest very few teachers are catching covet 19 that way that's the reason why this is working out so well i think i mean i think teaching is good in person other things are good on zuma like meetings and this sort of thing is fine on zoom absolutely yeah all right speaking of meetings let's uh do twip daniel remind us of our case yes for everyone um tuning in tuning back in or tuning in for the first time um we we went to malawi um i don't know if i gave much of the background but i was in malawi um a few years ago i went there with the family because my wife's sister was living in the long way you know so it's took the whole family and we spent a couple weeks in africa the kids actually loved it they didn't really want to come home so uh we thought they would appreciate everything they had here they they loved malawi um but this was a case um this is a teenage son of a usaid worker and his urine started to turn red and this usaid worker was somewhat new to malawi and i use that mainly he was not sure what was going on and we got a little bit more of the history and that on weekends the family the usaid worker his family would drive about two two and a half hours east to a lake lake malawi and they would actually go swimming so when this happened the usaid worker took his son to the clinician there the embassy clinician um the clint the clinician there was familiar with what this was um and as i mentioned last time uh was given pills take these pills in the morning take them at night cleared right up and we were left with what was going on exactly right all right should i mention that lake malawi is famous uh for many things one is the it's a living example of radiative evolution from cichlids it's geographically isolated from all the other lakes although they're connected by rivers they're not really connected by wildlife so you can study the fish life in each of these lakes and make speculations as to how species arise based on their geography and lake malawi has played a huge role in that process it's like almost like darwin's finches for fish and it's a very very very very very old lake that's the reason and it's tropical so it really it's it remains the same year-round basically it's an unusual chain of lakes actually so uh it's worth noting that by the way yeah well after we after we run through the emails maybe i'll even share my personal experience when my family and i went to like yes we would love to hear about that i used to uh raise cichlids in my aquarium years did you know yeah when i was a grad student i used to have a salty you know slightly salty water and they were beautiful beautiful they are and um quite fascinating to look at i think dixon can you take the first one please i would be happy to eric writes greetings and thank you for your fantastic flora of podcasts and online lectures there is so much to learn and you are such pleasant educators since daniel said this was an easy case i thought i'd give it a go my guess is that the poor teenager had been swimming among parasitic flatworms just to sell only hematobium and contracted urogenital schistosomiasis also known as snail fever or bilharzia treatment is a short course of prasiquanto fascinating little worms don't go swimming with snails in other people's pee i humbly bow to your knowledge and expertise and your healthy approach to science well they're from lin tripping sweden i've been to lingarping that's a very interesting little place where it's 2 degrees c a light snowfall with a class 3 warning of severe snowstorms for the night eric just a curious listener oh ps i managed to find this rather amusing pearl on the web and i haven't had a chance to download it but um i will it's a really interesting article about the difference between case fatality risk rate and ratio ah right it's good and i've also been to lin xioping in 2019 i i passed through lovely little town dixon really it is it is nice daniel all right so i've never been to sweden but i do want to go david writes hello team twip wonderful episode as always thanks for continuing to provide the listeners with your insights into the world of parasites parasitic diseases and scientific research into the same the show is an intellectual diversion from the realities of the pandemic and political divisions at least for a few minutes given dr griffin's statement that he was throwing us a bone i'll go for what looks like a good match schistosoma causing schistosomiasis the symptoms seem like a very good match and the disease is treatable quickly as in the single day of treatment that dr griffin states for this case with prasiquanto of course the seventh edition of parasitic diseases has a thorough discussion of various aspects of the schistosomes starting on page 379 highly recommended thanks again for the wonderful content i look forward to every new show stay well david tim writes daniel dixon and vincent the red urine post swim in lake malawi is certainly schistosomiasis brought on by an infection of schistosoma hematobium medication is prozy quantum brand name biltracide the life cycle diagrams from your book are helpful thinking about each of these worms i spent a couple of hours reading up on this after a good read through the seventh edition of pd i'll spare you the very many odd facts i learned but i am ready for my first post pandemic cocktail gathering to say the least unfortunately there are no cell assays of s hematobium to match that of s mansoni uh from when xiao collins that al on the paper discussed today a single cell rna-seq atlas which we did last time but certainly these technologies will yield a different view of these parasites and biology in general in the coming decade it is a good time to be a parasitologist as human encroachment is widening niches for these buggers i had not realized the scope of the problem until this evening it might have been an easy case it was a good lesson and tim sends a link to an article on on this in the uh the cartercenter.org oh great yes where you can see uh interesting photographs which we'll mention later carterson's a nice nice place good people down there dixon you're next samantha although the the letter is addressed just to professor raccagniello i will read this anyway i would like to start off by thanking you for such a wonderfully informative and entertaining podcast series i am a second year medical student and the night 2018 barnard graduate uh who has been binge watching your videos for the past week since rediscovering your channel your podcasts are ten a thousand times more exciting than my online pre-recorded medical school lectures it's nice to feel like a columbia student again after three years listening to an expert in his field share his knowledge with enthusiasm and purpose and i am very thankful for you and your mission to bring such high quality educational content to the public regarding dr griffin's challenge i believe the teenager is just a somiosis caused by schistosomial hemitopium the main clue that made me think of schistosoma infection as the patient cematuria schistosoma is known to infect the bladder resulting in such in such bloody urine furthermore this parasitic fluke uh blood fluke is endemic to sub-saharan africa among other regions which fits the patient's recent geographic location just as some hematopoies hosts are snails cecaria from the snails penetrate the skin migrate to the liver to mature into adults and then into the visceral venous plexus which surrounds the neck of the bladder the patient's history of fresh water swimming is also pertinent positive since this indicates a potential source of exposure we just learned about this parasite in school so perhaps i have some cognitive bias all the best samantha a very curious medical student with a newfound love for all things viruses and parasites lovely well samantha you um i think you're referring to the fact that you go to school at columbia also um i used to teach there a lot and miss miss the contact with the students and i'm glad to hear that the subject is still doing well daniel all right rachel writes good morning twip team it's overcast and about 25 f negative 4c here in indianapolis and i'm just trying to stay warm i'm a longtime listener but this is my first time writing in because i'm terrified of getting it wrong my interest in parasitism is newfound but strong and i'm so grateful to have a backlog of episodes to go back and make guesses on with instant certification of my answers but the young man in malawi urinating blood i think it's safe to say he was infected with schistosomiasis specifically by s hematobia the tricky trematode hatches in water and is commonly found in lake malawi especially especially affecting taurus and ex-pats with less experience with this pathogen once infected the patient will notice blood in the urine as the adult worms infect the bladder one day of treatment with prosi will effectively clear up this infection which i suspect to have been the drug prescribed this isn't a a lot of differential for this particular case as it is pretty cut and dry and can be clinically diagnosed fun fact this parasite was what initially got me interested in epidemiology and specifically medical anthropology as it was used as a case study in my introduction to biological anthropology course seven years ago of course now come the trials of grad school and my eventual phd so i can get to the point where i just hang out with worms all day thank you for everything stay safe rachel hang out with worms dixon is that a good idea um if you know by a first name basis yes if you don't i'm not sure i'd have to think about that one a.k writes good evening esteemed hosts a welcome reprieve from all things covet i find myself looking for it to twit more and more i'd say it's just the samias hematobium until proven otherwise incidentally one of my absolute favorite parasites if such can be said about a disease-causing pathogen it has an absolute fascinating spectrum of symptoms we actually find quite a few among our immigrants from refugee camps with diagnosed active or latent tb though we find even more strongholdies as i recall we also had a remarkably interesting case a few years back though quite tragic a child with neuroscistosomiasis with transverse myelitis of which the details have slipped my mind stay safe ak is an id physician dixon byron writes hello twit hosts it's 32f here in napersville illinois and sunny here is my guest for twip 191. schistosomiasis caused by schistosoma hematobium gotta say it really helps to have the latest pd on hand thank you for all the hard work it has been a lot of fun listening byron daniel michael writes i'm relatively new to twit but i thought i would give a guess to dr griffin's case study in twit 191 about the teenager swimming in lake malawi my guess is at the end of this email i started listening in may 2020 to twitter to learn more about the sarsko v2 virus while in lockdown and soon started listening to all other shows on micro tv as well i especially want to thank you for the virology 2020 videos on youtube which are both informative and also make me wonder at how inventive viruses are through natural selection to adapt and multiply they are truly amazing and i wish there was a greater emphasis on funding basic science keep up the good work thou oakland california and then he says urogenital schistosomiasis by parasitic flatworms schistosomes also known as bilharzia or snail fever and i want to keep that in mind that's that's an interesting that is a slightly different guess that we've had so far caroline writes bonjour as a first time guesser i hope this try isn't too bad especially since you implied it may be easy i'm guessing it's just a somiosis a bit of research led me to find that this parasite is endemic in lake malawi and so causes many infections in tourists one common symptom is blood in the urine the typical treatment for schistosomiasis is usually one dose of prasiquantal sometimes this is split into two doses taken within 12 hours this treatment matches what was prescribed to the patient in your case thank you so much for all these podcasts i've been listening to you for a long time in the episodes keep getting better and better stay safe caroline is a water treatment operator dixon ida writes dear team at twip ida here writing from barcelona i listened excitedly to each of your programs but this is my first time attempting an answer well phd student in archaeology at cuny conducting an archaeoparasitology research that is the study of parasitism in asian populations archaeological parasitology is an interdisciplinary field that combines parasitology and archaeological methods to investigate specific patterns of ancient parasite infections in relation to environment diets behavior and disease it also has an objective to trace the origin evolution and dispersion of different parasites worldwide and and offers epidemiological insights that can help model modern trends fascinating field my answer to your case study for trip 191 is bill hearts infection caused by the fluke parasite schistosoma hemantobium this parasite is widely spread in many countries in africa including malawi and it is endemic from the shallow waters of lake malari where there are diverse species of snails that serve as intermediate hosts after sexual maturation occurs within the snail and the parasite reaches the effective larval stage secaria these are liberated into the fresh water humans who are the final host can get infected when their skin gets in contact with the cycaria in contaminated waters these will penetrate the skin finding final home in the urinary bladder the symptoms range from pain during urine urination to inflammation of the bladder including bloody urine as is the case for this week's patient the miraculous treatment mentioned in the program is a 40 to 60 milligram dose of prosecuental per kilogram of body weight administered in one or two doses six hours apart fun fact the first ever archaeological archaeoparasitological analysis conducted was undertaken by roofer in 1910 in a 5 000 year old egyptian mummy that gave positive that that was positive for schistosomia hematobium and she lists the reference there as well thank you for your fantastic program i don't know if i'll win the book or if my answer is right but it was sure fun trying best aida cool daniel all right alexander writes dear trippers the young man new to malawi has probably contracted an infection with schistosoma hematobium while swimming in lake malawi their cicaria swimming in the water during the day penetrate the skin and migrate to the bladder among other places where only this species critically causes hematuria praziquantel is the drug of choice here interesting the characteristically bloody urine was interpreted as a form of male menstruation and a rite of passage for young boys by the ancient egyptians unfortunately efforts to eradicate this disease in egypt by mass injection of medications may have led to widespread hep c in the country all the best to you and all your fellow twippers alexander enjoying gentle snow flow snowfall at negative 3c 27f here in vienna yeah i know that that hep c spread by the schistosome medication is such an unfortunate incident it's just horrible they didn't stir up properly sterilize the syringes horrible horrible jay writes i'll start with my guests just to somiosis hematobin regioning rest of the family are well but visiting sun is not i assume they had repeated exposures but the sun had not and he showed symptoms the two and a half hour drive would take you from li longway where a visiting aid worker is likely to be based to the south of the lake the paper below shows us hematobian to be endemic to that part of the lake paper number two points out that s hematobiam targets the urinary tract with hematuria as a common symptom and the third paper linked to the cdc shows praziquantel twice a day orally as the treatment which again tracks with given pills taken morning and night clears up have another challenge for you in this case i am the patient i was about five years old and traveling by passenger liner from colombo ceylon as it was then to southampton uk via the suez canal with my parents and younger brother and sister in the early 60s my mother took me to the ship's doctor with apparent blood in the urine early in the journey the md took blood and urine samples but did not have equipment to run tests but took them ashore in aden and we picked up the results in cairo after the visit to the doctor my parents became much nicer to me and far more forgiving of the problems a very active five-year-old caused them on the ship including diving into the ship's doctor in into the pool and knocking him out this lasted until we picked up the results in cairo this ship was entirely to blame although my parents seemed to think it was my fault in the dining room there was a big plate on which there was a jenga tower made of wafer biscuits i liked the pink ones and you could help yourself and the staff rebuilt it ready for me to return for more had the doctor asked me how many pink wafer biscuits i ate a day when my why my urine was red probably would have been solved years earlier just a long time twiv listener dipping into twit that's fascinating love it i think that's funny dixon yes sir andrew writes good evening twip hosts it is a wonderful 12c and clear in greenville north carolina which would sound fairly pleasant if my classroom's heater had not broken down here recently leaving the room temperature to be a brisk 18c thankfully the county board of education finally transitioned to 100 virtual this week after several harshly written emails about their mishandling of the pandemic i have been listening to microbetv podcasts for about two to three years now and figured i would give this a shot please don't expect anything spectacular for me as i'm a high school science teacher and i work part-time at the local hospital running the rt pcr tests for sars cov2 granted with the volume tests the volume of tests being run it certainly does not feel part time on the guess i suppose after consulting dr google who and ncbi i am going to postulate that the teenage boy has schistosoma hematobium i come to this conclusion primarily based on location in the treatment plan the whose website matched location and symptoms to the case study when looking at treatment i found prosequently as the drug of choice meeting that description for some odd reason i feel the need to make sure that the weight of the boy matches a typical teen given the treatment so again back to google a typical pill has 600 milligrams times the four pills given leaves us with 2 400 milligrams seeming how the dosage is 40 milligrams per kilo divided by two doses in 12 hours that would make the child in the ballpark of 132 pounds or 60 kilograms this makes me feel better about my non-medical diagnosis if it would have been way off i would have kept looking for another alternative just for fuzzies or funsies i did come across a meta-analysis paper on ncbi suggesting that this treatment may not need to be split into two doses over 12 hours and that having a single dose may lead to less vomiting and dizziness as a side effect from the medication thank you for your time and if i happen to win a book i would love for it to be given to my high school here it would be a fantastic tool to get students interested in other fields of biology many of my students until we get uh our disease unit don't even realize humans can get parasites except for relationships thanks again all right anthony writes schistosomiasis is endemic in make in lake malawi perhaps due to overfishing evidence of infection has been found in ancient egyptian mummies the disease was common in egypt up into the 20th century a physician with napoleon's army described the blood in the urine as male menstruation did the one slash nine parasites without borders facebook post propped the selection of this case thank you and then anthony's got a few things in here about theodore maximilian bill hearts being a german physician an important pioneer in the field of field of parasitology and then a few other facts below all right i think anthony wants to be the new kevin i think so sophia writes happy new year thank you daniel for giving us a case that i can actually answer i had no clue for the cases presented recently but i was impressed by the number of people who guessed right they bring the level up don't assume that the rest of us are as good anyway my guess is schistosomiasis i love diagnosis that can be made with no tests and treatment is easy and available you will get loads of answers for this one so i'm keeping this short stay safe and thank you for all that you do dickson leo writes dear distinguished professors greetings from the village of mendocino in the northern california coast current temperature is 57 fahrenheit with fog clearing uh he lists the weather website i am just a former winery manager with a lifelong interest in science and discovery i watched my first twiv last january and have become a fan of all the microbe tv programs as to dr griffin's case presentation in trip 191 i think that this adolescent male contracted urinary schistosomiasis caused by just assembly hematopoietic the blood in the urine is the result of bladder perforations as the parasite releases eggs to be passed through the urine i have no idea of why the rest of the family did not come down because or become infected should they be given a dose of prosecutor just because it would be fun to use as a differential the african version of a case that allegedly happened in the amazon a man was urinating into a river when a small carnivorous fish followed the urine stream and became lodged in his urethra that's a candora this reportedly caused pain and a profusion of blood with or without urination i look forward to the big reveal wishing everyone happy health happiness and long life sincerely leo is that true dicks and daniel that this fish does swim up the urine stream canduro it's a it's a small uh catfish that actually infects the gills of larger catfish by rubbing its spikes along the gill rakers it elicits the blood to come forth and it actually feeds on the blood that comes out of the gills yes this is a very very tiny organism uh it's a less than an eighth of an inch long and i think kevin gives reference to it as we get to kevin's letter you'll see that he's referenced that as a one of his many many diversions all right thank you daniel yeah no unfortunately vincent and maybe we'll get to this it has a morphology where it goes in but it can't come back exactly right the spines go they fold back as he goes in but then they they lock lovely lovely yes yes love lovely things in the world um katie writes dear all i'm writing from chile north central wisconsin where it is a sunny 6f with a real feel of negative 3f negative 14c with a real field of negative 19c you know the type of weather where you wonder why you own livestock my first thought for the case study in episode 191 was schistosomiasis but i thought that'd be too easy given that the paper in that episode was also on schistosomes however i did not realize that there are many species of schistosome i love learning from you all the three most common species are schistosoma man sonai s japonicum and s hematobium according to pd7 in the case of s japonicum an s-mansoni infection the injury occurs when eggs are deposited in the walls of the intestine and in the liver whereas infection with s hemitopium affects the bladder bladder infection can result in hematuria or blood in the urine which was the main symptom in this patient after spending time swimming in lake malawi according to the cdc website fresh water becomes contaminated by schistosoma eggs which infected people urinate or defecate in the water i know we all know that this happens but gross people are gross the cdc website also states that vigorous towel drying after an accidental very brief water exposure may help to prevent the schistosoma parasite from penetrating the skin daniel did not make the comment that perhaps the boy had been swimming and maybe hadn't toweled off quite as vigorously as he should have treatment for schistosomiasis is with a one to two day dose of prasiquantol this all seems to fit so i'm going with schistosomiasis caused by s hematobium as my guess diagnosis could be confirmed by urine sample although i'm guessing that if the infection is endemic the medical professionals in the area have probably seen it enough that they don't necessarily need to confirm the symptoms with a diagnostic assay i have made it one of my new year's resolutions to write in for every twit case study this year i'm also training for a half marathon and i find your podcasts keep me much better distracted from the pain and misery my legs are suffering than music does as always thanks for all you do martha writes do you twip people when listening to this episode's case i was sure i knew the parasite in the treatment but as my usual practice i decided to poke about on the internet a bit i thought i remember that the disease had been mentioned in ancient egypt egyptian papyri and wanted to check it out for some reason it had lodged in my brain that the disease was so prevalent in egypt that there was actually a hieroglyph for it and that the ancients equated hematuria and meant to menstruation in women it turns out the ancient egyptians did have a word for it that word apparently is ah ancient doctors seemed to recognize the association with water and advised against standing in polluted water not easy with an agricultural system that depends on yearly flooding of the fields however the conflation of hematuria and menstruation was made by the french physicians in the napoleonic era occupation and i just learned archaeologists are finding the agent of this affliction in ancient mumbis bladders so enough digression you have a lot of male to read i think the young man had schistosomiasis caused by schistosoma hematobium and was treated with a one-day course of praziquantel thank you for all your work i thoroughly enjoy your podcast dixon well i got lucky you got kevin's email yes i love reading kevin's email anyway and aloud it's even better so let's start kevin writes when you hear hoof beats look for rainbows now if i were doing this of course that would be rainbow trout but for him i'm sure that means something else i do detest a chestnut likewise for easy phrases such as slam dunk or no brainer call me a contentious pendant i can take it it wasn't too long ago that lake malawi was considered no risk for schistosomiasis just consult the 1992 lonely planet tourist guide for africa centron's 1996 review schistosomiasis in lake malawi also reviews the early 90s consensus opinion that the area was very low risk for transmission his descriptions of neurosis schistosomiasis in two peace corps in 1992 quickly changed these perceptions the immediate reflux or reflex in our current case is to say schistosomia hemotopia by the way this worm should have an identity crisis having been known variously as dystomum hematobium bilhazia hematobium and let's not ignore this worm's erotic potential two suckers a gynecophoric canal and a copula and an incapable lifestyle as they say what could possibly go wrong what i find most disturbing in this case is the fact that no diagnostics will run on the patient even in the face of the overwhelming likelihood that s hemitopia infection uh was the answer the importance of objective and definitive demonstration of the diagnosis is never to be devalued simply centrifuging the urine and fighting oval would be sufficient though this may be low sensitivity in light infections serologic testing six to eight weeks post-suspected infection should be attempted obtaining hard evidence is crucial in the event that rare complications arise in the future such as neuroscistosomiasis occasionally i'm sorry additionally as we have repeatedly stressed in previous trip cases the construction of a differential diagnosis is important to avoid premature closure and to account for the possibility of simultaneous or co-occurring pathologies non-infectious causes of hematuria in adolescence are listed in the endnotes other unusual and unlikely parasitic causes of hematurias are ascoriasis trichinella meiosis renal echinococcus reference in endnotes in our case the patient was doubtlessly uh no yeah doubtlessly given prosecuental though the cdc states that the repeat treatment may be needed two to four weeks after initial treatment in order to ensure effectiveness additionally if pretreatment a urine exam shows ova a repeat urine exam should be performed one to two months post treatment which leads me to those rainbows colored urine seems rather fanciful even if red especially in view of popular dolls such as poopsy slime surprise unicorn rainbow bright star something about this trip case and a desire for urinary equity with technicolor feces led me to search the string technicolor urine why was i surprised to find a 1974 jama article containing that phrase i took a chance on rainbow urine well the exact phrase wasn't found but euroscopic rainbow was now digression has been carried to the level of vice but there may be a pot of gold at the end of this euroscope rainbow i mean i'll read that again but there may be a pot of gold at the end of this euroscopic rainbow see a terminal curiosity and towel off vigorously even though there is not but anecdotal evidence to suggest that this works exfoliating is invigorating thanks for all that work you do so vincent what part of the endnotes would you like me to skip to just go down to a terminal curiosity and read terminal curiosity sure okay a terminal curiosity trip 191 put me in the mind of a pretty of of pretty colors and the strangeness of body fluids that are the wrong color it harkens back to simpler times when the diagnostic apparatus was a flask in a physician in a physician's eyeball hopefully accompanied by some experience and common sense meditating on urinary colors transported me back to the early 1990s when i would see the urine rims in the cook county hospital public toilets that were often be speckled orange by wayward urine drops from medication adherent tb patients as hinted above urine can take many hues from almost anywhere in the rainbow a modern year urine color chart is reproduced below and it's a very colorful chart indeed it is you have some other plates showing 14th century scripts being read to a bunch of interested listeners and a chart showing flasks with various samples in it colored differently of course to indicate various ailments associated with those colors uh 14th century euroscope bodellian library from the daniel library and you can see the urine illustration is from 1506. as you can see from the above illustrations urine was big business in the middle ages your uroscopy jug was called a matula in latin chamber pot urinal there are many examples of the urine we know a primitive diagnostic aid the example above is in the munich university bibliotheque okay you can stop you can stop i would be happy to stop now he has a lot more information on colors of urine which is great i recommend that people read it uh daniel you're next certainly james writes writing from la jolla california where the sea breeze is blowing a gentle 50 f-10c back in denver it's snowing those poor people my guess with red urine in africa is just a soma hematopoieum common in lake malawi in the pathology review course they give us the pneumonic that schistosoma egg looks a bit like a urinary bladder in shape associated with the bladder cancer worldwide i remember an amazon fish that's reported to cause hematuria candera catfish that supposedly swims up the urethra and lodges there with its spines makes a great legend probably not true but still causes a reflex crossing of the legs there are other causes of hematuria of course lots of bacteria a few fungi drugs etc but this is twip james m small well we have a lot more when is our guest coming on daniel do you know so he's going to come on at 6 30 and what i'm going to do is i will shoot him a text and he will jump on so have about what 18 20 minutes to uh yeah power through all right let's try and summarize okay good idea chad writes uh just urinary's just a samiasis lake malawi um prozzie quantile my apologies if this guest is out there i was trying to investigate using my wife's textbooks usually i play her the podcast and she just gives me the answer i think that's great okay dixon can you summarize andrew andrew writes chaora from pangora we've had a lot of emails from andrew in the past and we're glad to get another one you list the weather it's up and down of course and that's typical for new zealand no matter what still immense not having won a book well who knows maybe today's your lucky day andrew and then he guesses of course correctly that it's just the same hematobiam in lake malawi and he gives all of the common features that we've already reviewed in other emails and then he says there is a possible way that the infection could have occurred quickly and that is to do with a report in the ifl science of the parasites presumably gravid crawling up the urethra in a british tourist think about it this is a no i don't okay if i step through that one and by the way he says see you later nice to hear from you andrew so i was on a i was on a live stream and i and andrew was there because he said kia ora from pongaroo and i said is that you from twip he said yeah cool daniel's funny uh allen writes esteemed whip whip stirs and aloha from kona hawaii and also we are seeing here a water contact disease schistosomiasis or bill harzia a little bit about uh studies out of cameroon um and i will i will call it there so that's from university of the nations from kona hawaii it's interesting it says in cameroon only the wealthier boys would show up with hematuria because the poor ones had to work they couldn't swim it's interesting it's interesting i like that i like when there's that social aspect at least writes dear twit trifecta at least riding from lower manhattan in the snowstorm teenager with red urine uh schistosoma hemitopia prasiquantel given that one family member was infected but the whole family had been swimming what happened to the rest that's a good question vigorous toweling off how to prevent future infections did the family continue swimming as always many many many thanks for everything you do dickson uh anthony writes i can read the whole email because it's very close very short it appears someone did not take the doctor's advice for vigorously drying off after having fun in lake malawi final diagnosis just a soma species anthony self-taught biochemistry nerd and pharmacy tech hopeful daniel shawn writes gentlemen loved dixon's story and the devil is really in the details size matters that was about the worm in the eye and let's see what his guess is i love africa and the zebras that come with it lake malawi is well known for schistosomiasis all right i'm just reading his email it's cute uh kayton writes greetings from the upper peninsula of michigan fellow tippers he thanks us for twip even though he's not a doctor he's a country farmer he wants to learn about parasites um [Music] as i listen to daniel how will i figure this one out so i did the following google and he got urinary schistosomiasis touched daniel prasi quanto thank you daniel for your work with parasites without borders now caton is a owner of a grass-fed beef company i'm getting hungry sounds good dick said yeah rebecca writes and she is just his dear professors and she's a member of a parasitology club at the university of uh central lancaster in northwest england and it's cloudy of course and she and the group guests just to some hemotopia which is their answer we're not saying that's correct mind you and it gives the proper medication except in this case it's three times a day and uh other family members were also swimming but they did not become infected and she tends to say why not necessarily the right answer but nonetheless glad to hear from you and keep up the good work josie dear triple trouble twippers after two not too terrible but still two wrong answers i like this one and she goes with schistosomes lake malawi and prozzie quanto and then we get a little bit of a discussion about uh egyptian men egyptian women and let's see incidentally the episodes on schistosomes have also revealed something that i had always wondered why i only developed red spots during my second year of girl scouts camp so i think there she's making a reference to avian schistosomes and the allergic reaction to repeat exposures uh josie's in library hell shows he won the book last time all right melissa writes just some hematobian from a windy toronto that's it for that one dixon lauren writes uh hello tripp she's a uh let's see yep she guessed the same thing um hematuria schistosoma uh traumatochistic selma and doesn't seem to mention a species here i'm reading down trying to find it uh it doesn't commit to the species but she still says schistosoma has the life cycle correct um okay then now she apologizes to vincent for anthropomorphizing but you know she just can't seem to help herself i guess i don't know let's see owen i got a short one here daniel is going easy on us this month he maturity after swimming in lake malawi makes me think of urinary schistosomiasis most likely due to schistosoma hematobian all right the last one's from erica you guys seem to be getting quite popular so i'll keep this short schistosomiasis brazi quanto but she doesn't give the species right dixon right vincent and she also hedges on the drug because oxyoxamniquin is a different drug than presequential all right all right so uh you want to give away a book or you want to call in your guest dixon what do you what do you think it is i don't know i was stumped on this one i i had to read the emails in order to get a hint no i'm just joking of course no it's pretty obvious what it was and um too bad for the kid but i guess he got better right away and uh good question about the rest of the family maybe they were a lower in infection than he was they spent less time in the water maybe they had light infections or not infections at all but but i'm pretty clear that it's just to sell my hemotopia what about you vincent you want to jump in on this yeah i mean i i've took the easy way you know because if you go to the carter page you see little kids in there with vials of their urine that's red exactly exactly yes all right actually um yeah i have to say hopefully yeah people i'm glad people got this right um i said i was going to share my experience when i was uh there in malawi we of course decided we were going to go to lake malawi you know it's hot right so i'm explaining to my family listen we're going to lake malawi you can't swim in the water because parasites and then we get there and it's just so darn hot so we all went swimming in lake malawi but we're there you know and i'm of course thinking about the parasites but i noticed there's a lifeguard and i go over to the lifeguard and i ask them i say so can you swim i'm trying to figure out why there's a lifeguard no no i was like well what what is your job then he said well if i yell really loudly it means one of the crocodiles is getting too close okay you should run out of the water so apparently the real fear was the crocodiles but no when my uh my sister-in-law brother-in-law their three boys uh came back from malawi um they were really presented with two options one is to do blood testing everyone the family because they've been going to lake malawi like so many other expats um or you could just go ahead and just treat with prosti quanto once and then do another treatment we'll say two to four weeks later because you know you're going there and even though other people might not have hematuria it's just so endemic you're swimming in the water so you can either check serology but yeah no when i got out i vigorously toweled off i don't know if that works but that was my that was my approach all right while we guys were chatting i ran the random number generate our winner is andrew our high school teacher nice from north carolina so andrew send me your address twip microbe.tv and we'll send a book down you can give it to yourself give it to your library well okay then um my pick this week is a a man that i knew very well as while i was a graduate student at notre dame he was a rising star in the field of medical etymology his name was george b craig and in fact one of the authors on our book robert quads got his phd with him um george craig was a very unusual man uh in many ways and he had huge intellectual interests in genetics in ecology in virology in fact vincent because a lot of the mosquitoes that he was studying particularly 80s albopictus and lots of other aedes species which he learned how to clone in the laboratory and study their genetics for he became famous and he was a national academy of science member he was also a member of the cosmos club and he loved fishing so we used to go up to the northern uh peninsula of michigan at the notre dame biological station and fish as well as you know discuss science and have a good time and um a remarkable man in every way and devoted to his science so devoted that uh he actually passed away at a medical entomology meeting not that the meeting killed him is the fact that he was he was a young man he was only 65 years old when he died he died of a heart attack he was a college wrestler and as a result he said he used to wrestle in three different weight classes he could change his weight remarkably fast and he became really well known for that and unfortunately when he got to be an adult he was unable to change his weight it just kept getting heavier and heavier and unfortunately he ended up as a uh as a very obese individual and uh regretted it but didn't know what to do about it and eventually it took his life but uh he was he trained numerous graduate students he's a world famous name in medical entomology still today and was basically the same category as theodosius debshansky was to establishing the fruit fly as a genetic organism george b craig's established aedes aegypti as a genetic organism and um he was a truly interesting man and a wonderful gentleman and that with with a uh i can't tell you how enthusiastic he was when we went to basketball games he was embarrassingly enthusiastic his voice could be heard above everybody else they knew who it was they appreciated it and he was he was their biggest fan and so um i loved him dearly and um and everybody misses his presence because he was such a driving force in in lots of other things besides just science wonderful thank you so it looks like we have a fourth uh a fourth box there uh indeed do you wanna your name is behold we will join you in we'll loop you in hey everyone uh nice to meet you i'm alden happy to be on the show how do you pronounce your last name uh lear like leader jet lear so uh daniel are you buddies is that how this came about i like to feel where uh we're colleagues a fellow i guess you're more early career than i am in your infectious disease pursuits but a really interesting case that we were talking about that um we were hoping would be shared with our listeners um and i was hoping we won't talk we won't tell too much about who you are today okay um but my thought is when we bring you back to do the unveil then we'll give a little bit more of the background who who is this exciting mystery individual with such a great case you're happy to oblige all right let's hear it so yeah so we have a case here of a older gentleman who presented to our hospital with chills muscle aches headaches and a worsening shortness of breath and notably had had several family members who he lived with who had also had similar symptoms he did have a history of hypertension and diabetes and was pretty on uh pretty poorly controlled with that um but i think an important part of his history is that he was actually from and had emigrated from rural part of ecuador where he had previously worked in the timber industry and he had spent some time on on the farm as well sodding the soil um the family and snoke did not have any pets no dogs no cats no reptiles or other animals of any sort and he lived in and around the hospital area and kind of this urban area so he came to the hospital he was ultimately found to be positive for covet and was it put it into one of our coveted isolation units and was treated and received a cocktail of intravenous steroids and antibiotics and ultimately ended up doing getting worse uh over the course of the next two weeks he got some more courses of iv steroids and antibiotics and developed a bloodstream infection and pneumonia and then about three weeks in the infectious disease service was ultimately involved because one of our technicians the tansy had actually noted that on the agar plate he's seen this very interesting creepy crawly serpiginous kind of trail and had alerted us to uh what was going on and we actually had daily microbiology labs so he had called us in and this was during kobe time so we couldn't come in person but we joined in via zoom and so he was able to show us that uh via video and then we'd asked one of our resident colleagues to who was working in the microbiology lab to take a look under the microscope and so he had taken a look and sent us some photos and they were very very interesting and we had a strong suspicion at that time what it was but we're ultimately blown away and we were able to start this gentleman on a course of appropriate treatment and he did ultimately have a little bit of a rocky course shortly thereafter but he did recover and then i'm very happy to say that he made a full recovery was ultimately discharged from the hospital so this this this plate this sample it was a it was a blood sample it was a sputum sample exactly yeah no it was it was a sputum sample and this gentleman um is hiv negative right he was hiv negative yes and vincent likes to ask that that's his [Laughter] now and he's living with his family here in the u.s correct yes that is correct the best of my knowledge and you say did his family have covet also or they had some uh something else that you didn't diagnose i bet they did yeah yeah the full the family was ultimately also uh several members including the wife and two daughters were ultimately diagnosed with covet as well but nobody was ill enough uh to go to the hospital aside from him hmm can you talk about the blood work at all or should we guess at that later yeah um i can talk a little bit about the blood work so he did not ultimately have this organism in the blood uh but had uh a couple of different bacterial uh species that were associated with what we thought was a pneumonia and also potentially from elsewhere as well and then perhaps the gi tract and i was referring to the differential actually okay any unusual features about the differential blood work like neutrophils lymphocytes eosinophils things yeah that sort of thing so interestingly when he came in he had no eosinophils and about three weeks later had then developed a fluoride eosinophilia uh he had a little bit of a low lymphocyte count which was kind of common with covid when he initially came in but otherwise that was kind of one distinguishing feature and i understand stool was set as well and that was completely negative stool was sent off it was completely negative serology was sent off for various organisms that came back negative right i just want to verify that you do not work for the bronx zoo this is a human being this is an andean condor very good yeah you may not get the joke there we we had a case where it was actually a uh it was a penguin at the bronx zoo with exactly the fellow who presented it was uh was director of the zoo and he came out we didn't say we didn't tell anyone who he was right wow that was fun and then we went to the zoo uh a few weeks later and recorded there for the reveal and he was right in the middle of the penguins when he revealed that it was great that was a great episode yeah that was fantastic it was fantastic on site too it was like it was great to just visit there was an avian show we should have gone when the cats all were getting covered right but yeah right yes that's right so what would you say what was the exposure for the penguin was it penguin doing some traveling yeah it's actually it's interesting it is a little bit of an aside but um you know most of the birds that you see 80 of the birds that you see flying around actually have different species of um of plasmodium the avian species and so you bring these um these birds either from remote islands or from arctic areas where there are no mosquitoes and they actually are susceptible to different forms of malaria actually i published a paper about a year ago oddly enough on you know which subspecies of avian malaria can actually cause the penguins and the arctic you know the different birds to actually get sick and get ill and you actually have to you take the frozen herring and you put medicine in there and feed the birds to get them well again wow yeah how many herrings per it's actually kilo interesting is how you treat the uh the birds but oh wow yeah i was going to ask if there was artemisinin or malarone or whatever but interesting and the penguin recovered so i think that's probably enough right for people to uh yeah that's good to figure this out should we you want to wrap up this episode is uh should we close it right here guys is that good yeah i think all right and then in a month we're going to come back with the exciting unveil we will all right that's uh twip number 192. you can find the show notes at microbe.tv twip if you like what we do well first if you want to make a guess on the case or send us an email to whip at microbe.tv and if you like what we do consider supporting us microbe dot tv slash contribute daniel griffin's at columbia university irving medical center and parasites without borders dot com thanks daniel oh thank you pleasure as always dixon de pommier trick at trichonella.org and the livingriver.org thank you vincent uh and dr lear is from a mystery institution we will learn more yeah i'd like to actually pursue that a little bit next time thank you dr lear we'll see you next time thank you as a pleasure i'm vincent dracqueniello you can find me at virology.ws i'd like to thank the american society for microbiology for the support of twip and ronald yankees for the music we've been listening to this week in parasitism thanks for joining us we'll be back soon another twip is [Music] acidic [Music] you", "0iqCwMb48Fk": "hey how's it going guys [ __ ] Jason here easy med life who else would it be it is my channel checking out some venom extracts blueberry cheesecake shattered right now really looking forward to this one had some of it earlier definitely super delicious assuming it's the same to be a little bit different its consistency it's like more of a pulling snap not to shattering but it still makes for a nice nice dab yeah oh yeah I'm extracts that's what's up", "0c4G5sImNTU": "hey guys what's up how you doing got another reset nice little review for you guys all right juice IPAs we did the Moxie review yesterday this was thirty to fifty four and a half grand package 6:30 2018 good for one year they say check out that other review today we're gonna do this this is $45 for a full gram of Sun be soul extract Sour Diesel OG everybody said that Moxie was probably gonna be the better one but the strains here on this one seemed really good so Sour Diesel ug can't beat that tree the box it's our diesel og oh [ __ ] this one is packaged 323 so this I'm definitely older one really nice packaging these are extracts our diesel this looks like another applesauce really like going there oh gee maybe hints of some sour who's ready to get faded alright guys these electric Sour Diesel Gogi review so far smells really good again guys we can get some of the best concentrates around but I've honestly they're not strains and stuff that we're gonna like or enjoy we're gonna have issues with that and you guys all have issues of that sometimes make sure you get a good string you like and enjoy I also understand your different strains are gonna have different terms are gonna have different terms which would be your flavors which would have different she's gonna modulate your hi again it's not indica sativa guys that does it it's the terms that's when people say they have quote-unquote hybrid it's because the terms probably got a little mixed up because honestly your THC to CVD on the indica for hybrids minimal to no debt change in because obviously have a little more CBD than the sativas that sometimes have a zero to none but again any cannot modulate your high as much as the chirps and are gonna do it so always remember that we're gonna get you strains get a good flavor you get a flavor you like it gets you the high you like and go with that I mean up and see if it's just came when I was up a mini thrive back in early two-thousands I got Durbin poison and I loved it I just get it as much as I could probably once a week it's sold out pretty good sixteen ounces juice IPA got my 562 beer belly shirt on you guys ever get a chance check out beer belly really good spot they have the deep-fried Twinkies deep-fried Oreos deep-fried pop-tarts I got really good food obviously good beer that's like that I get your balls full rolling joints where Chuck Lorre joints turn on your vaporizers just putting these poor shots whatever you like when he got out he the ball disturbing vaporizes three shots of it again the back in itself little rusty [Music] who's gonna get faded and enjoy this I think it's gonna actually be really good again both these are kind of looking to applesauce I'm gonna try to find more diamonds next I try to be a little more picky take my time it's kind of a last-minute thing and again I sometimes even if you get good doesn't mean it's gonna be like everybody's out and about Saturday taking care of sure eight sixty sixteen ounce beer guys oh I haven't even dabbed today so all right yes Sarah diesel og we go to smaller dabs since I got a slim 16 years 16 ounces 16 and United 16 all right guys cheers you guys have a great weekend let's keep Rocking Wow good real tasty doesn't say no trunks neither does the moxie that's the other thing you gotta worry guys how much of this is done with shrimp run that's gonna save them some money and then they might try to upsell it more towards you as being more of an accreta or you might think it's not crying sometimes our packaging even says no grown woman isn't and there's reasons for that sometimes they're Eddie got the packaging sometimes they're trying to pull the wool over here.i but price pointed none to trim runs huge difference huge huge huge huge difference maybe even four times you know as much difference because again I've told you in these other videos before when you're making any kind of extracts you got a calculate how much it is if you sold your weed as opposed to actually processing it because if you can sell your ween and make the same amount or maybe even a little less about having to process it you're gonna come out ahead because once you do the processing you got me see you got to figure out then you got to figure out your yield how much you're selling or for this that in the other so there's a lot that goes into price points and stuff like I said I was sewing up sales rep so I did price point and you know especially for products and shelves cuz they've been shelves have you know stores have per foot you know how big your product is how much space it takes up you gotta allocate for how much money you need to sell for that at that point but you concentrate to be the smaller gonna take a blotter show me and so that you know they should definitely not have to worry about that but trim was like I said so many people actually rip people off so much with this and I wonder how much it's still going on today definitely got my nose running better now maybe is that sixteen ounces of rapa the goose check out my IG Nick 420 CIA guys see what I'm up to I'm gonna try to get some pictures of this I mean it's not super fancy it's just a applesauce well yes I always think about that guys in union shops think about your price point I mean trim run can smell as good and tastes almost as good as a nut run but your high is gonna be different guys every time I've ever done a trim members not run it's only difference is the high granted I didn't do a super big dab on that but I got a big dab Marina so I would have thought it would have been a little bit higher one more time the other one honestly the slammer I felt got me a lot higher this one I would do the slime when I did like an eighth in the half for the high this one I probably get a seven yes seven for the high so definitely moxie stronger taste ways again that's gonna be preference I think I did four on the Moxie if I recall this one definitely tastes better I do maybe a six I think that's not gonna be true run I'm serious I'm going a little lower it doesn't like it's not as loud as I felt could be it's also older so that's effect this one six thirty that was in like June that was in March a little difference than that alright guys but I guess there's a couple more clubs out there one lives back open out on Broadway out by Gallagher's in Long Beach we also got the chronic over and seen a PHA right over there so chronic one loves and then we get connected so I'll be trying to check out some one of these different shops trying the different things I'm gonna try to get a little more picky and take my time again this one was the last minute I can only want the flavors usually back in the day man I used to go to all these shops and literally would be on their menu on weed Maps double-check and triple-check and everything and then you know every this is a good little tip for you guys going to shops get on weed Maps double-check it find something you really want and you go in there try to make sure you get that what you want there's a lot of times up Cesar a popular seller or something they try to redirect you guys so you know very be specific get what you want don't always let those but genders and people on the shelves intimidate you guys cuz they're just trying to sell stuff and sometimes though they're just gonna waste your money at that point so get what you want guys trust me you get value one gonna be happy as opposed to not get what you want get what they want and then get home and be pissed and it isn't as good as you thought or wish you would have got when you were you know intended we I said how would they run just the girl at connectives real nice so he's enjoyed that sometimes I get like that I would think I mean that's nice I guess asking for their advice and stuff you can ask for their advice you don't go it's taking us together I've asked for advice and don't give me attitude like the same thing they like again we're all different but what a default day or Long Beach we've got some overcast days supposedly so to get a little rain but been in like the mid seventies or so really nice no I saw the clock in the walls really good maybe yes check it out a few minutes are interested didn't think I've liked it as much as I did to be honest it's a family I don't know if I don't know pebbles I'm applesauce my girl I made a mess of teams might be like the new [ __ ] so far I still enjoy some diamonds and herbs just cuz I could kind of modulate my flavor all right look at both or any times triggering your vaporizer three beers please shut so whatever you'd like to do does let's give fate a guys get those vaporizers Rocking and then remember the volcano from Raider Nation Cheers definitely not as strong nice pressure on guys they kept my eyes closed good flavor 45 for a grant bad worse you know the thing is guys as all these guys talking price point I don't know how long you guys been going to shops and [ __ ] but you know back in my day when I used to go to shop especially early on these YouTube videos 45 bucks got you something usually some pretty shitty concentrates usually it was up to 10 50 60 bucks for some shatters so I'm a bad one to judge these prices did I don't think they're too too bad I was looking at the few that actually have the diagnosis of terms I think one was only $30 for a half a gram so 60 bucks for a grand ain't too bad but that being said we're gonna go back to it for 60 bucks a gram hopefully it's not right because using back to the day that's the number in the stuff you don't even pay them these high prices if it's gonna be chirps or trim because it's honestly trimmed should be 30 bucks 35 maybe a grand cuz you gotta figure they're gonna whole sell that [ __ ] well Trevor maybe like 10 15 bucks a gram double it 30 bucks a gram usually I'm gonna figure that's usually how they do it he's always a [ __ ] about that if you guys remember those old videos I'm good charlie we double the pricing because they're getting in you know pretty much the same amount of money as you're getting and it just does they have a storefront but you gotta have all the equipment risk all right guys I'm faded hope you guys are to check out my teammate 420 CA I try to get some more review some more shops again this is bezel extract Sour Diesel

I'm a professor in the\nDepartment of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences, and I'm the director of the Program on Reproductive\nHealth and the Environment. And today I'm doing a talk about Climate, Pollution and\nPrenatal and Child Health. The mission of the Program\non Reproductive Health and the Environment is to create a healthier environment for human reproduction and development by advancing scientific inquiry, clinical care and health policies that prevent exposure to harmful chemicals in our environment. I have nothing to disclose, except I'd like to say thank you to Drs. Linda Giudice and Marya Zlatnick, who helped me with the content of this presentation. Climate change is here. We know that there has been\nincreasing temperatures, which have led to ecological changes which have impacted wildlife. And due to rising temperatures, we have seen, also, contributions to extreme weather events and conditions such as droughts, which have led to many different types of disasters in our environment, including the increase of wildfires and other types of natural-related events. Contributions to climate\nchange in the United States from greenhouse gas admissions are primarily made up of transportation, which contribute about 30% of greenhouse gas emissions, and electricity production and industry, which contribute almost 50% of greenhouse gas emissions, primarily through coal and natural gas emissions and use. These sources that emit carbon dioxide, which is a contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, are also sources that can increase the levels of air pollution\nin our atmosphere, including ozone and particulate matter. These air pollutants can also contribute to warming effects, and then these increasing temperatures can have the feedback loop of also leading to more stagnant air, which can trap ground-level pollution, like ozone, and higher temperatures, which also can contribute\nto ozone formation. The impact of climate\nchange on health is many, including changes in vector ecology, so increasing infectious diseases, increasing allergens,\nwater quality impacts, impacts on water and food supply, environmental degradation, extreme heat, severe weather and\nsomething I'm gonna talk a few more minutes about,\nwhich is air pollution. Climate change can influence pregnancy. The problem is that climate change can worsen air pollution\nand extreme weather, which can have severe impacts on health during and after pregnancy, including increasing\nrisk of preterm birth, low birth weight, stillbirth, and can also affect brain development. Particulate matter air pollution, which is one of the primary\npollutants of concern for health effects, which are fine inhalable particles, are mostly formed in the atmosphere that come\nfrom the same pollutants that contribute to\ngreenhouse gas emissions, including power plants,\nindustry and automobiles. Prenatal exposure to particulate matter air pollution, particularly these fine respirable particles, PM2.5, can increase the risk of preterm birth, low birth weight and stillbirth. This is from a study\nthat I participated in that was published in 2015 that looked at the influence\nof the Beijing Olympics on air pollution levels in China. As you can see from this chart, that during the Beijing Olympics, because of controls that\nthe Chinese government put in place on industries\nand transportation, the levels of air\npollutants went down in 2008 during the Olympics, that were lower than they were in 2007. They subsequently started\nto increase in 2009, after the Olympics were over. We were able to look at the change in low birth weight due to the changes in\nthe air pollutant levels that were due to the\nchanges that were made for the Olympics in Beijing. And what we found, that as the levels of air pollution increased after the Beijing Olympics, we also saw an increase\nin low birth weight. So in, for example, a 20\nmicrogram per meter increase in PM2.5, which was in increasing levels after the controls were taking off for the Beijing Olympics, led to a decrement in birth weight among the term births in this study. There have also been a number of studies looking at aggregating the many studies that have been done looking at prenatal\nair pollution exposures and preterm birth risk. This is from a study that was published showing that globally,\nusing numbers from 2010, the number of\nPM2.5-associated preterm birth was estimated to be 2.7\nmillion preterm births, which was about 18% of total preterm births globally. Air pollution is also associated when exposures occur\nduring the prenatal period with heart birth defects, autism and neurodevelopmental delays. Air pollution exposures during pregnancy can also increase the risk of maternal health complications. Studies have shown that air pollution is linked to pre-eclampsia and hypertension during pregnancy. These are both important\nmaternal health outcomes that are also leading\ncauses of maternal death. There's a very important other link between the contributors to climate change and other types of chemicals\nin our environment. That is the relationship\nbetween fracking gas, cheap oil, unburnable\ncoal and the plastics. Plastics generation and\nrecovery in the U.S. has been increasing since the 1960s. And with the increasing use of fracking and natural gas, these\nare a feed supply chain to intermediate products that are used as plasticizers. Intermediate products include chemicals like vinyl chloride, ethylene glycol, styrene, polystyrene and phthalates. These are then used to make plastics that are pretty ubiquitous\nin our everyday lives, including plastics used in cars, adhesives, coatings and films, plastics used in food packaging, plastics used in your\nhome, like pool liners, sealants, carpet backing, insulation, and plastics used in footwear, clothes, diapers, stockings and textiles. I'm gonna talk a little bit more about one of these feedstock\nchemicals, phthalates. Phthalates are an industrial chemical. They're produced from the same sources that are used in fuel\nproduction or fracking. And they also are an industrial chemical that are used in many different types of plastic applications. Phthalates are also an\nendocrine-disrupting chemical, and they have been shown\nto adversely impact testosterone levels in the body. Some of the health effects that are linked to phthalates include male\nreproductive health effects, such effects on sperm quality, reduced fertility, learning\nand behavior effects, and obesity and diabetes. Each one of these effects are also chronic diseases that have been increasing in the population. Further, because of the ubiquitous use of phthalates, everybody is exposed to some different types of phthalates. Studies that we have done have shown that when you measure phthalates in biological samples from people, they're found in pretty much 100% of the people that are measured in the United States. Phthalates are just one of\nthe many industrial chemicals that are linked to fossil fuel production that we come into contact with every day and in many ways in our everyday lives. So chemical production is increasing in the United States. We know that pregnant women are exposed to multiple different types of chemicals and plasticizers, and that these chemicals pass the placenta and the baby is exposed even before being born. This is why doctors globally are recommending that we do more to prevent exposures to toxic chemicals. This is from a statement from the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetricians, and they say that environmental chemicals, pollution and climate change are adversely affecting\nprenatal and child health, and they recommend advocating for policies to prevent exposure to toxic\nenvironmental chemicals, work to ensure a healthy food system, make environment part of healthcare and champion environmental justice. Societal change is possible. This is an example from the Clean Air Act, which was updated in 1990. And what that law said was that we had to identify primary pollutants, how they were affecting health, and then take actions to\nreduce those pollutants. So as you can see on the bottom chart with the green line going down, that because of this law\nand the public policies that came from that law, there has been a reduction in these common air pollutants, which include ozone and\nPM, since the 1990s, while at the same time growing gross domestic product, vehicle miles traveled and population. However, we've also seen an increase in energy consumption, and this is where we need to be focusing in terms of contribution to both climate change and pollutants that can\nadversely impact health. So in conclusion, there is a link between contributors to climate change, and air\nand chemical pollution. We are all exposed to\neffects of climate change through increasing temperature and exposures to air pollution\nand chemical pollution, and these exposures can impact maternal and child health. We need healthcare\nproviders to be prepared to address these\nclimate-related disasters, as well as effects of air pollution and chemical pollution, and to advocate on\nbehalf of their patients. And in particular, it is necessary for us to have strong public policies in order to create lasting and\nfair solutions for all. And with that, I'd like to thank you for participating in this\nvery important event. - Hi, my name is Dr. Singal. I'm a pediatrician down in the Santa Clara Valley Medical Center, and today my talk is gonna be on Children's Unique Vulnerability to Climate Change. So first of all, why children? According to WHO, across the world, one in five deaths each year occurs in a child younger\nthan five years old. As these graphs illustrate, children suffer a much greater burden of the disease of climate-related disease than do adults. A much higher percentage of their deaths are due to consequences of climate change, including worsened malnutrition and food insecurity, diarrhea, malaria and other vector-borne diseases, and lower respiratory tract infections. As precipitation and\nflooding events worsen, as air quality deteriorates, as droughts worsen and\nfood scarcity grows, all of these are expected to worsen. We can also look at DALYs, or disability-adjusted life years, to understand the disproportionate impact that climate change has on children. One DALY represents the loss of the equivalent of\none year of full health, either through death\nor enduring disability. Using DALYs, we can see\nthat when factoring in both climate events that cause death and those that cause\npersisting ill health, children bear an even\ngreater share of the burden created by climate change. To understand why children have greater vulnerability\nand health impacts from climate change events, we'll use this great framework from a climate and health\nassessment conducted by the U.S. Global Change\nResearch Program in 2016. We'll explore each of these categories: exposure, sensitivity and adaptability, in more depth. So first, exposure. Exposure is contact between a person and one or more biologic, psychosocial, chemical or physical stressors, including stressors\naffected by climate change. Children have a higher exposure to toxins and climate change disease than do adults for a number of reasons. Kids have higher exposure\nper unit of body weight. They breathe more air, drink more water and eat more food per unit of body weight compared to adults. This means they have a\nhigher proportional exposure to all the contaminants and toxins in that air, water and food. In fact, in the first six months of life, children drink seven times more water per kilo of body weight\ncompared to adults. Children also have unique behaviors that put them at higher\nrisk for exposures. They spend more time outside than adults. They crawl around, put\ntheir hands in their mouth. Up to 11% of toddlers may\nexhibit pica behavior, which is the consumption\nof non-food items, including soil and dust, that put them especially\nat risk for exposure to lead and other toxins in that soil. Next, we'll cover the unique sensitivity of children as pertains to\nclimate-related illness. We'll spend the bulk of our talk here. Sensitivity is the degree to which people or communities are\naffected, either adversely or beneficially, by climate\nvariability or change. Children are not mini adults. They have differences in\ntheir baseline metabolism and physiology that puts\nthem at increased risk for climate-related diseases. For instance, young children may not have yet built up a functional immunity from repeated exposures to mild illness. As such, they may suffer from higher complication rates than adults when exposed to serious strains of the same disease. For instance, children often have higher complication rates from malaria than do adults, with problems ranging from severe anemia,\nirreversible hearing impairment, cerebral palsy, epilepsy and more. Children are also at higher risk for complications from heat waves through a combination of factors, including increased surface\narea to body mass ratio, which causes a greater heat gain from the environment on a hot day, increased metabolic heat production from physical exercise, which increases their core temperature, and decreased sweating capacity, which reduces their ability to dissipate body heat by evaporation. The impacts of these were demonstrated in the 2006 California heat wave when emergency department visits for heat-related causes increased across the whole state, but\nespecially in the elderly and in children younger than four. There are also unique\nwindows of development during which climate-related events can have especially lasting impacts. For instance, malnutrition. 35% of excess child mortality is attributed to malnutrition. a risk factor expected to\nworsen with climate change because of increasing food insecurity. Malnourishment and vitamin deficiencies can have many lasting impacts on health, including rickets, poor bone health, blindness, immune deficiency, poor wound healing, loss of\nbrain neurons, et cetera. Early exposure to toxins can also cause irreversible damage, such as lead. Lead can have lasting neuro problems, including loss of IQ, learning\nand behavior problems, and also kidney and bone health effects. Children are especially at risk as they absorb more lead due to the fact that they often have\nconcurrent iron deficiency, which can predispose\none to lead absorption. Mercury can also have toxic effects on the nervous, digestive\nand immune systems, and on lungs, kidneys, skin and eyes. Endocrine disruptors may contribute to increased risk of testicular cancer, hypospadias and early-onset puberty. Air pollutants are also a large concern, as from wildfires and\nmotor vehicle emissions. In the short term, such\npollutants are linked to increased asthma exacerbations. Asthma is already a large contributor to childhood morbidity across the world. According to the CDC, in\n2013 in the United States, nearly seven million children, or about 9% of our pediatric population, suffered from asthma. And in that same year, asthma accounted for over 13 million missed school days. In the long term, air pollutants can cause irreversible damage to lung maturation through airway inflammation,\nsuch as bronchiolitis, similar to what's observed in the airways of smokers, and also\nrestriction of the growth of alveoli, which are those tiny air sacs in the bottom of lungs that allow for the exchange of\noxygen for carbon dioxide. Lung development and the growth of airways continues into adolescence, but is almost fully complete\nby 18 to 20 years old, so it's unlikely that\nclinically significant damages could be reversed as children transition into adulthood. The psychological impact of climate change is also tremendous in children. Exposure to traumatic events, like floods and wildfires, can\nimpact children's ability to regulate emotions, undermine their cognitive development and academic performance, and contribute to\nposttraumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, panic and phobias. Even chronic exposure to\nnon-traumatic climate events can have psychological impacts. A 2015 study out of Cincinnati, Ohio, showed that on days with higher exposure to fine particulate matter, children had higher rates\nof emergency room visits for adjustment disorder and suicide. It's thought that perhaps\nthat fine particulate matter can cause inflammation of the neurons in the central nervous system, and in turn affect processing, anxiety, cognition, and behavior. In addition to the psychological trauma of climate-related\nevents, repeated stressors can result in biologic changes. To understand these, we'll touch briefly on ACEs, or adverse childhood events. ACEs are those events to which intense, frequent and/or sustained exposure without the buffer of\na caring and able adult can lead to something called toxic stress. Toxic stress is essentially\nthe dysregulation of body systems that\ndo not return to normal even after the adverse event is over. This is, again, because of children's sensitive periods of development. Exposure to ACEs in this time can have lasting effects. In children, ACEs and toxic stress have been correlated with dental problems, lifetime asthma, ADHD, autism, obesity and learning difficulties. They've also been associated\nwith violent behavior, including delinquent behavior, bullying, physical violence,\ndating violence and more. The more ACEs a child experiences, the higher their risk of these and other health problems\nthroughout their life. Traditional ACEs fall into\ndomains such as abuse, neglect, mental illness or incarceration of caregivers, domestic violence and substance abuse. But there's an increased understanding that climate change creates personal and family trauma that contributes to toxic stress and\ntriggers the feedback loops that expand and aggravate these ACEs. So finally, we come to adaptability. Adaptive capacity is the\nability of communities, institutions or people to adjust to potential hazards, to take advantage of opportunities or to respond to consequences. Children have a very limited ability to adapt to hazards associated\nwith climate change. They may understand less\nabout hazardous situations, have less experience coping\nwith difficult situations, and have less actual and perceived control over events. They are almost completely\ndependent on caregivers, with very little independence. They're deeply affected by the health and well-being of their caregivers and the decision-making\nof those caregivers. Finally, adaptability is hugely affected by the context in which we live. Children often have no control over their geographic location, which may put them at higher risk for certain climate change disasters. Low-lying coastal regions are at much higher risk for flooding. Drier regions, like the\nSouthern and Western U.S., are at higher risk for heat waves. Bread basket regions are at higher risk for droughts and the attendant malnutrition and famine. Children may also live in poverty, which has been shown\nto decrease the ability to respond or to escape from extreme weather events. There's also the question of environmental\ninjustice, which is defined as the inequitable and disproportionately heavy exposure of poor, minority and\ndisenfranchised populations to toxic chemicals and\nother environmental hazards. Environmental injustice contributes to health disparities,\nespecially in infants and young children. For example, in New York City, six of the seven diesel bus depots are located near\ndisenfranchised populations in Harlem or East Harlem. These depots are places\nwhere buses may idle for hours while emitting pollutants. And unsurprisingly,\nhospital admission rates for asthma are 21 times higher in these poorer communities compared to their wealthier ones. The effects of climate change on children, on all of us, are real and they can be overwhelming, but there are things that\nwe can and need to do to address this issue at multiple levels. We'll frame things in terms of primary, secondary and tertiary prevention of climate change events and disease, and discuss each of these\nin the next few slides. So first, we'll talk\nabout primary prevention, which refers to slowing or stopping the development of climate change. This type of prevention falls into two large categories: our personal choices and systemic decisions. Action at both levels are both important and necessary. In terms of our personal choices, we can act to shrink our\nown carbon footprint. We can invest in renewable energy and in energy-efficient appliances, decrease our food waste, use public transportation. But we can also promote systemic change, holding our leaders responsible for regulatory standards that ensure clean soil, water and air. We can also support\nmeasures that make it easier for us to do the right thing through things like smarter urban planning that promotes public transportation, mixed residential and commercial housing, bike lanes, et cetera. Even as we try to prevent climate change, some events will still occur that we must contend with. Secondary prevention refers to the actions that we can take to help\nprevent our children from being affected by heat waves, vector-borne illness and air pollution. Parents can help protect their children from negative effects of heat waves by reducing their activities on very hot and humid days, making sure they stay very well hydrated and having them wear light colored and lightweight clothing\nthat does not promote as much heat absorption. To reduce the impact of mosquitoes and other vectors that carry illness, we can use mosquito repellents, wear long sleeved clothes, use bed nets and check children for\nticks after play outside, especially in the warm months. To reduce the impact of air pollution, we can monitor air\nquality and pollen counts, reducing outdoor play on days when those levels rise. And finally, we can act at the level of tertiary prevention. These are the actions we\ntake to reduce the impact of ongoing climate-related\nillness and disease once they've already happened. For instance, once air pollution has already contributed\nto a child's asthma, we can help prevent further asthma flares and exacerbations by teaching families what the warning signs\nof an asthma attack are, what medications to use, et cetera. We often use a red, yellow,\ngreen asthma action plan, like the one shown to the right, to help parents understand\nwhich meds to use when and when to seek professional help. As a society, we can\nhelp support communities most affected by climate change. These include coastal communities after flooding events,\ncommunities in drought after heat waves and those affected by other natural disasters worsened by climate change. Support could be in the form of advocacy, monetary donations or\nother creative means. We can also help kids who are affected by climate change and disease. Specifically, the CDC offers tips on caring for a child after a disaster. They recommend giving\nyour child opportunities to talk about what they went through, encouraging them to share their concerns, limiting their exposure\nto mass media coverage of disasters and its aftermath, helping them feel safe and calm, and allowing them to be\ninvolved in volunteer efforts to the extent that's appropriate to their age and developmental stage. And, of course, children\nshould always be referred to a professional\ntherapist or psychiatrist if they do not seem to be improving, if their schoolwork\ncontinues to be affected or if parents have any other concerns. So in summary, children are especially and uniquely vulnerable to the disease and illness wrought by climate change through their increased exposures, increased sensitivities and decreased adaptive capacity. While it may sound daunting, there are things we can and must do to act at multiple levels, including the prevention\nof climate change, the prevention of disease resulting from climate change that does come to pass and finally, the reduction of the impact those diseases have on our\nchildren's continuing health. And that's it. Thank you very much. - Hello, everyone, I'm Anna Chodos. I'm an assistant professor in geriatrics. And it's a real pleasure today to be part of the course on climate change and health impacts. My role today is to talk about the special risks to older adults as part of this joint presentation and panel discussion. I wanna start with a recent article that focused on how clinical providers, like myself, can address climate change\nin clinical practice. And not surprisingly to me, the example was that of an older person during a heat wave. \"Sweat was beading on the forehead \"of the emergency medical technician \"as he wheeled in an elderly man \"with a reported fever,\nwhose apparent confusion \"had led his wife to call 911. \"In the midst of a\nrecord-breaking heatwave, \"the pair was found in\na top floor apartment \"with no air conditioning \"and only one partially open window. \"The man was transferred to a bed, \"where a rectal thermometer registered \"nearly 106 degrees Fahrenheit. \"We diagnosed heatstroke and rushed him \"to our highest urgency area \"to begin cooling him.\" While this article was about the general health\neffects of climate change and how the healthcare system and healthcare providers need to be prepared and trained, for me, as a geriatrician,\nI was not surprised to see that an older adult was someone who suffered from a recent heat wave. And I think all of us have seen examples highlighted pretty\ndramatically in the news of older adults who suffer because of climate-related emergencies. For example, during the recent wildfires in our area here in Northern California, Coffey Park was a big focus as the wildfires tore through it in 2017. And in fact, that was\na retirement community and many of the people there were older. When you look at who died in those fires that year, we see that out of 44 deaths, I was able to find 40\npeople and their stories. And 29 of those 40 people, or 73%, were adults over the age of 60. And something that\nwe're gonna come back to is what makes older people and their support systems vulnerable. So I included Sally Lewis and Teresa Santos' story here, as well as Jane Gardiner\nand Elizabeth Foster. Sally Lewis and Teresa. After a harrowing rescue attempt, Lewis and her caretaker, Teresa Santos, was overtaken by the Atlas Peak fire. And here again, Jane and Elizabeth. Gardiner died in the fire that destroyed her home October 9th and killed her longtime\ncaregiver, Ms. Foster. So even as we think about older adults as special populations who, a special population\nthat's more vulnerable to climate emergencies, we're also thinking about\ntheir support systems, particularly folks like myself who work in geriatrics. I don't know if many of you saw this incredibly viral video that went around of a community of older\nadults in an assisted living when they were overwhelmed by flooding, sudden flooding in\nSeptember of 2017 in Texas. The story was in 10 minutes, the water was waist deep. They had no time to evacuate. They were ultimately evacuated by the National Guard quickly and safely, but I think this picture\nillustrates immediately some of the challenges that older adults can face, particularly when they have other factors, like disability. And now we're entering\nan era of the unknown. I'm not implying that\ncoronavirus and COVID-19 is a climate-related emergency, but I think a lot of us have seen and talked about how older people have been particularly\nvulnerable to this virus, not just because of\nthe nature of the virus or some biological mechanism, but actually because some\nof the social factors and environmental factors that are making them vulnerable. And so that's something else I wanna talk about today. And finally, recently,\nthere's been much news, of course, with the many\nclimate emergencies. Particularly, I think for\nus in Northern California, we've really felt that with the wildfires. But even in Katrina, it was clear that older adults were suffering and affected more than younger adults, particularly in terms of\nmorbidity and mortality. So 60% of deaths related to that hurricane and related flooding were among people 65 and older. So today I'm gonna talk briefly about why an older adult would have\nspecial characteristics or unique characteristics\nthat we wanna think about as we learn more and plan more for climate emergencies, and then specifically how those factors are interacting with the\nemergencies we're anticipating and how it's gonna impact their health. This is the whole reason for my career, the demographic imperative. We are an aging society. We are moving quickly in\nmost parts of the country towards at least 1/5 of our population in a given city or rural area that's 65 and older. And the trajectory, here we are in 2020, so to 2050, over the next 30 years, is a clear increase in those 65 and older and an ongoing and\nfrankly steeper increase in those 85 and older. Total numbers of 85 and\nolder will be lower, but it's actually a steeper increase in that population. And that's has thought\nto have been mostly due to the tremendous gains\nwe've had in life expectancy and the fact that we simply have more people living into\ntheir late 80s and beyond. But it definitely means that as a society, and certainly as clinicians like myself, we need to be thinking about older adults as we plan for the overlying\nclimate emergencies that are gonna be evolving. So let's take a moment so I can explain what I mean by older adult and get into some of\nthose special factors. Why do I say older adult? I think you'll see all over the news, senior, elder, elderly. What is the real term? In geriatrics, we prefer older\nadult because it's relative and speaks to the fact that it's part of a spectrum of age and because many people who are in their 60s and\nolder prefer the term. But I often get asked, when should I be seeing a geriatrician or how do I know I'm older? And I think, in fact,\nwith the COVID emergency, we've seen a lot of people are surprised to find out they're older and they're in the vulnerable age group. They don't feel older. They don't feel vulnerable. They feel energetic and robust and thriving, for example. And I think they associate needing the label older when they don't have those factors. What is true is that the older demographic is a hugely variable\nand heterogeneous group. As a geriatrician, I really\ndon't think about age. I think about the other factors that impact that person's health and well-being and\nfunction in the community. So age is helpful, it's good to know. I certainly don't ignore age, but it's certainly not the only thing I'm thinking about when\nI'm trying to understand a person and how best to work with them. And then to point out that there is some indication that some conditions in life or social risk factors actually accelerate geriatric syndrome. so things that we tend\nto see more commonly with age, like functional disability or more chronic conditions\nor cognitive impairment. And so, for example, when\nwe were doing research in people who have\nexperienced homelessness or are living with HIV/AIDS, which is a chronic inflammatory condition that many people have\nlived with for decades now, we often look at people 50 and older and consider them as older adults within those special populations. And it is true, however,\nthat we will all experience many physiologic changes as we age, and often these physiologic changes, which are completely normal, and for each person often very individual. So some people may have more heart impact or physiologic aging. Other people may have more brain or bone physiologic aging. So different systems may age differently, one person to the next. But what we do know is people also have more medical conditions, so not normal things, diseases, illnesses. And then together, the\nregular physiologic aging that's happening underneath,\nand then conditions, medical conditions that may be impacting that person's health and function, are working together to\ncreate a certain picture of someone's physiologic\nreserve and vulnerability. And so things that we\ncommonly see physiologically that are completely normal\nis reduced kidney function. Losing muscle mass and gaining some fat. Losing what we call vital\ncapacity and VO2 max, but that's basically exercise capacity. Someone's ability to manipulate oxygen exchange. Decreased cardiac output and stiffening of blood\nvessels in the heart and throughout the body. A little bit slower reaction times and decreased recall in\nterms of brain function. And then extremely common is losing some ability to see and hear. Then biologically, we know that there are some things that\nare happening normally, and not normally, that\nreally make older adults vulnerable to climate emergencies that we know are coming. So one of the biggest ones is older adults don't thermoregulate as well. So they don't often get the same cues for thirst, for I'm hot, I should take my sweater off, or I'm cold, I should put a coat on. They don't have the same sweat reaction or hair standing up on end to help with cooling. So that is a big factor, particularly with heat\nemergencies, obviously. The other one is because\nchronic conditions, like lung disease and heart disease, and in fact, many people\nhave more than one, are so common, that is a\nbig factor at play, as well, because that makes them more susceptible to the various things that we see with climate emergencies. Again, this idea of\ndecreased physiologic reserve because of physiologic aging in many organ systems just means you have a\nlittle bit less bounce back if you were to be stressed out, physically stressed,\nbiologically stressed. The sensory impairments\nare really important because it means how you\nreact to an emergency or are able to advocate for yourself. Cognitive changes are an\nextremely important part of this. While it's not normal to have dementia, which means you have\nlost a certain ability, cognitive ability, about 10% of all people over 65, and 30 to 50% of people over 85, will have dementia. And that is at least something we need to consider. And then, as I already mentioned, there's some element of\nslower processing with age. And then a big one is one that, it's something that the medical system does to older people. Older adults are on so\nmany more medications than people younger, and the medications have a big impact on a body's ability to respond to a physiologic stress. We also know that there are\nmany social vulnerabilities in older age groups. Poverty is really undermeasured. So the formal poverty rate is 9%, but actually, when you\nlook at better measures, so there's a new measure, the Supplemental Poverty Measure, that looks at out-of-pocket\nmedical expenses, as well as just income and housing costs, it's at least 15% of the\ngeneral older population. But those rates are\nmuch higher for poverty as people get older. So you get poorer as you get older. For racial minorities and for women, all those groups tend to be even poorer. We also know that older adults are fairly socially isolated and about 1/3 of older adults in most cities live alone. The digital divide is not a well-described\nsocial vulnerability, yet there's increasing research on this. But the digital technology\nis obviously essential to our life now. And for the most part, has not been designed for older people and remains a huge challenge in adding to a measure of safety to older people's lives. Older adults are more likely to live in a congregate housing setting, like an assisted living or a nursing home. And then many up, to 1/3 of people 70 and older, needs some daily or regular assistance\nfor their personal care, and that makes them vulnerable. They need human hands. So I'm sure many other speakers have touched on this, and this is one way I\nlike to think about it. This was produced by the American Public Health Association, that major climate change emergencies have clear impacts on human health. We have the evidence. We now know that this is the case. And rising temperatures is one. Extreme weather is another. Air quality worsening is another. And then the increase in vector-borne diseases is another. And I'm gonna go through each of these. But why is it such a stressor? Just as a big-picture concept, you're susceptible to\nclimate change emergencies physiologically, biologically, because of several factors: the amount of exposure\nyou have to the emergency or the factor like heat. The sensitivity you have innately. So again, someone on a medication that dehydrates them\nmight be more susceptible to a heat emergency. And then how adaptable you are. So again, how much bounce back you have in your physiologic system, how much can you adjust, either practically or\nphysically, biologically. And so we know that older adults have heightened vulnerability\nin all these areas because, again, many are poor and in poor housing or congregate housing that may affect increased exposure. Many are increasingly sensitive because of intrinsic physiologic factors, like reduced kidney function, or are less able to adapt. They don't have the same\nthermoregulatory clues. They have a disability that prevents them from getting to cooler ground. They may have a cognitive disability and not know how to\nadvocate for themselves if they're not feeling well. So specifically with rising temperatures, we know that that leads to more heatstroke and dehydration,\ncardiovascular complications and respiratory illness. And we know that, as\nI've already described, the heat impact itself may be heavier because of the less\nability to thermoregulate or move to a cooler location and take corrective measures, like drink a lotta ice water, get a fan in front of you, again, for all the reasons I described, like cognitive impairment or vision impairment\nor mobility impairment. The issue of medications\nshould be considered. And then air pollution, interestingly, worsens with heat. It keeps more particles in the air. And that's one of the main things linking it to respiratory illness and cardiovascular\nhospitalizations and deaths. I briefly wanna touch on medications because this is obviously something that really is a common factor and because many adults are on five or more medications on a regular basis. And some of the most common ones are some of the most challenging ones for managing someone's heat response. So for example, diuretics, which we commonly call water pills, things that get swelling out of your legs, often used in heart failure. One example is furosemide, that's a very common\none, also called Lasix. Another is what we call ACE inhibitors, longer name, angiotensin-converting\nenzyme inhibitor, or angiotensin II receptor, so those are called ARBs. Those are blood pressure medications. They affect kidney function and, therefore, your ability\nto manage dehydration. Something called anticholinergics. Those are things, often anti-spasm medications for back pain or bladder medications. And then medications that you, don't necessarily advertise themselves as being anticholinergic, but Benadryl, Dramamine. Those can also affect ability to sweat and, therefore, cool. And then finally, there's\nsignificant evidence that psychotropic medications affect your brain's\nability to thermoregulate. So that includes things,\nantidepressants like SSRIs. Those are very common,\nlike Prozac, Zoloft, things like that. So these are just very common medications and something to consider. Then extreme weather, how\ndoes that impact health? I think it's clear, like we saw with the flood picture,\nthe ability to flee or take cover. The significance of a serious injury to an older person may be greater than in a younger person. And then extreme weather\nwe know causes flooding, which causes increase\nin waterborne illnesses, which can be quite severe,\nlike Giardia or cholera, cause a lot of diarrhea, and be deadlier in older people. We also know that air quality, which increases with increased pollution or even increased heat, poor air quality increases\nwith those things, can increase ozone in the air and fine particulate matters and then allergic pollens in the air. And all of those things can really affect people\nwith cardiovascular and respiratory illness, particularly. And then vector-borne diseases. So as things get warmer, we anticipate more\nvectors, like mosquitoes, will be more commonly\ndistributed in places they weren't before. And that will really increase the rates of Lyme disease, malaria, Zika, West Nile. I would say in particular\nfor older adults, West Nile has more\nmortality and morbidity, which means impact on health overall. So those are definitely things that we are concerned about with growing prevalence\nof vector-borne diseases. And finally, the things that I think should be included in, as well, is thoughts about health impacts, but there isn't as much\ndata in older adults, are things like the mental health aspects of worsening climate. And there's, of course, the primary response to this, which is now really an entity that's treated by mental\nhealth professionals, called eco-anxiety, the\nfear of what's to come, the fear of losing our stable climate, but also the trauma from\nall these emergencies and how are we gonna support older adults who are traumatized possibly\nby emergency situations or just the ongoing stress of climate-change-related health events. And then the other thing which I really wanted to point out, because if you care for older people, you care for their caregivers, and you need to support their caregivers. There's umpteen tomes of evidence about how caregivers\ntruly are the foundation of health for people who\nhave functional needs, and to not consider\ncaregivers in the context of growing climate\nchange health emergencies would be unwise. And I think the Sonoma fires gave some example of that, that caregivers are putting their health on the line, too. So what can you do personally? I think at times, this can be a really\noverwhelming health issue, but one thing for sure, we will all experience\nsome of this differently. Local risks are different. And the truth is that it has been shown that heat waves are different\nin different places. So a heat wave in San Francisco or Oregon, where average temperatures are much lower than Arizona, will be different. People are more acclimatized in Arizona to warmer temperatures, despite being maybe the same age with the same chronic conditions. But it's been shown that deaths increase more, in a relative sense. So if you have a relative heat wave, you should still be concerned, even if it doesn't reach\nan absolute number. So that's one thing to consider is just think about your local environment and what are the risks that are most likely to occur. Be aware of your own personal risks. So medications you're on, conditions, functional needs you have, and plan accordingly. And then I think we can start to reach out more and more to our local communities, governments, public health departments that are planning for these things. Look at local resources. For example, my neighborhood has a neighborhood\nemergency response team, and working with them to be aware of the older adults in our neighborhood that might need help before anybody else, should there be an emergency situation. And then things like registering with your local power company to indicate that you may be a higher risk person. If there was a power\nshut off, for example, you require a breathing machine at night for sleep apnea, or you have an oxygen tank that needs a powered, sorry, a powered motor to deliver oxygen. So reaching out as far as we can, but we all know that there's\na larger context here and that part of solving and reducing climate change health emergencies will be a societal and global solution, not just a personal one, but I do think there are things we can do. So the take-homes today for the health impacts of climate change on older adults specifically is that we are an aging society and the impact of climate\nchange on older adults will be an important issue in the future. A particular older person, however, should be considered in\nall of their contexts and may particularly be vulnerable to certain outcomes\nbecause of a combination of social and physical factors. And so we should be thinking about where someone lives,\nwhat resources they have and what conditions and\nmedications they have in trying to come up with a personal plan to help them, should something like a climate change emergency\nreally affect them. So thank you so much, everyone. It's really been a pleasure to be part of this panel presentation\nand conversation, and I'm really looking forward to your questions, and\nI'm always available at anna.chodos@ucsf.edu. Thank you. - I just wanna say that I'm so grateful for the attention that all of you, everyone participating in tonight's event, are paying towards what is, I think, arguably the true existential\ncrisis of our time. I don't see how we can look at the state of the world and not be aware of the impending danger that climate change poses, unlike anything that the world has faced for many, many centuries, if not millennia. And I have mixed feelings about how the COVID-19 crisis is directing us. On one hand, it is such an indication of the importance of a global response to a pandemic that is impacting literally every one of the\nseven-plus billion people on the planet. And so in a way, maybe the pandemic is providing us some insight and guidance into the way we should look at what is also a crisis, but unfolding in a different timescale, and that is climate change. But on the other hand,\nI'm deeply concerned about the negligence that so many people seem to have towards science and facts and understanding of the true reality of the pandemic. So, boy, I hope that we can pull this off. I hope that we don't come to a point, similar to the pandemic,\nwith climate change in which we look at what's happening around the world and say to ourselves, how could we have\npossibly let this happen, given everything that we've known? How it's almost like it's unbelievable, like what we're saying\nabout the pandemic, right? Like, it's unbelievable\nthat this is happening. It's almost like a fantasy. It's almost like a dysphoric science fiction movie. But in that regard, I\nwanna direct all of you towards what I think is\none of the best pieces that's been written about the pandemic, and that's something by Charles Yu in The Atlantic last month. Just look it up, Charles Yu, The Atlantic. And the title of his essay is The Pre-pandemic\nUniverse was the Fiction. The Pre-pandemic Universe was the Fiction. And his thesis is that we shouldn't be thinking of now as a fiction, we should be thinking of the way we were thinking before the pandemic, in which none of us could really believe that something like this would happen, that COVID-19 could wrap\nitself around the globe, that was the fiction. And I think there's a real analogy to the way many people on this planet are thinking about the\nthreat of climate change.

doing something not so easy we've uh had an issue with water running down from up there and washing out the driveway so she decided to take it upon herself and dig this ditch and we're gonna end up lining it with rock and all that so she's working hard getting some good uh core and strength cross training going on right now isn't that right [Music] [Applause] man the deer sure like this trail good grief is tons of deer track all over the place what's wrong still gonna finish that part it's not cutting yet [Music] i've had to stop and pick up quite a few sticks with the little storms that we've had there's been quite a few down small [Music] branches [Music] so [Music] all right well that was a good run i was just 90 minutes at kind of an endurance pace i decided to hit the backyard trail instead of hitting the road and it was just beautiful outside really enjoyed it a little muddy in a couple places but just good fun trail time and so you can take a look at the run up on your screen all the stats and all that stuff uh you know i just kind of i think it was like a 9 45-ish 947 pace something like that so not pushing hard on the trail just enjoying it but i just want to give first and foremost a huge shout out thank you appreciation to mark from trail bird running if you have not checked out his youtube channel i'll link it down below in the description some beautiful trail footage just gorgeous beautifully shot edited great stuff so last week when i did the video where i had the gopro error and i accidentally recorded it 120 frames per second and could not edit it because i was on davinci resolve the free version mark reached out to me via instagram messenger and uh said hey you know what i've got a uh a license i can i can sell you for a good price like a great price so he hooked me up he mailed it to me and to top it off he was like what shirt size where are you and he sent me the shirt i mean this is a super comfortable nice shirt i mean it's got the logo here the back if you guys can see but it's pretty darn cool and i mean it's just a it's a high quality comfortable shirt like oh my gosh this is super comfortable so you've got a website trailbird running uh check it out i'll link it down below go support mark his stuff i just you know helped me out a lot supported the channel supported me so i really appreciate you mark and if i'm ever out in arizona i'm definitely going to shoot you a message and we'll link up and go run some trails so hopefully uh the 120 frame per second i shot earlier today i did a quick little clip to test it works so hopefully it was buttery smooth it should be but i'll know here in a little bit when i start editing but other than that uh declan wanted to do something today so he took the camera went out i don't really know what he did yet i haven't edited it so let's take a look at what declan did today well it's gonna be a hard one but [Music] zoe flipped with this mom what are you doing i'm digging a trench why so the water doesn't go through the driveway like this [Music] i'm gonna set it down [Applause] um all right well that's uh that's life through the eyes of declan so anyway uh just thank you all again for watching supporting i really do appreciate every one of you for liking subscribing commenting all of that it just means a lot uh don't forget we do have ultra trail steve and merchandise down below in the description as well will be a link to the merchandise store where you can go get uh some trucker hats coffee cups uh water bottles you know shirts all sorts of cool

dabbing and everything this is a very good medical strain I've had a lot of deep pain relief from this it's also had a lot of just plain getting good ol high off of this too but cheers guys so really good strain guys just to fit out of the phantom glass art piece super super talented guy go ahead am a phantom glass art on Instagram super super pleased with my rig picked us up at rigs for us guys for a minute now but I'm just a dick to a man it's got the best pool it's a great combo so about this strange it's gonna be a little earthy for those of you people are a little bit more of a fruit

Terry Turner she's a medical doctor and an herbalist and she uses the integrative medicine approach and osteopathic manipulations to treat her patients and she's especially adept at diagnosing and treating Lyme disease fibromyalgia chronic fatigue and illnesses that relate to neurotoxins found in mold she uses a hands-on approach to reduce pain and is truly passionate about helping to create healthy communities dr. Turner teaches a lot and she wants to teach patient patients to understand the mind-body connection and how we can blend the Western medicine approach with other methods of healing her class today her presentation if you will it will cover herbal aids for immunity which is totally appropriate and also to prevent and support symptoms to go through these times of exposure to viral viral to viruses okay so Terry are you there okay we're going to have to unmute Terry let's see if I can do this no I can't Terry can you unmute yourself okay I'm going to ask the tech team in the background okay techies you can hear me can you unmute Terry okay I guess it will take a little while all right they're working on it and we're just gonna wait for Terry to come in life and yeah I mean a general apology for everything what has happened will will happen or may not happen um the internet sometimes is unstable although we have an incredible connection here at the klg studio but still you know nothing is perfect so we're doing the best we can and that's the best we can do and while we're waiting I also want to share it in regards to nettle which is also one of my favorites and the poison oak issue there are truly other remedies that may be a good fit for some people and I say that from personal knowledge because I used to be highly successful to poison oak and it used to take forever for me to heal those lesions there is ways to make it better so just go and inform yourself and there she is hi Terry I take a while it's okay you're there and we can hear you can you hear me yes I can hear you okay Terry it's all yours take it away I'm going to mute myself okay hi um I don't know if you can see me but I'm dr. Terry Turner and I'm an osteopath and an herbalist he's thanking you Terry and a professor and so I want to add a little bit to what you said Claudia because I think a lot of that is true and I actually also am very allergic to poison oak I actually was fishing in a lake when people were burning it around the lake and got it all over my hands and ears because it miss Eliza's in the smoke so it's actually a really difficult one to get rid of from a medical model mostly they'll throw steroids at you from a non-medical model to start with they actually recommend tecnu which is a or something that has some oils in it because it's actually the oils that are what gets you and so tecnu is one of those products that you can actually use to kind of get the poison oak off you but there are everything from immune treatments herbal treatments definitely if your genetics are a histamine responding genetics then you may be more susceptible to it than most people and so turning off your genes that make you go into a histamine response um can be very helpful and we can even use frequencies now um I actually went out and got into poison oak and took a decadron is what which is what we use for tumors of the brain and ended up then using frequency specific microcurrent and it went away for a week I use frequencies the specific microcurrent one more time and an outbreak that usually would last a month to two totally went away without any more steroids so there are lots of lots of different ones that you can actually use so let's see if we can start on the mysteries of immune system from an herbal approach not at Chinese medicine approach but more of a Western medicine approach and I just want to reiterate one of the the professor's actually at UCLA who did immunology his big presentation was really that microbes and viruses are going to become kind of a huge issue for us and learning how to use them for good things as we do in permaculture and a Google pile versus growing herbs that actually can help us manage them so that they don't activate us when we don't want to be activated it's very useful and I think that's part of what herbalism has to offer because we're running out of antibiotics and most the time the antibiotics don't work on viruses at all so to start with I want to talk about transmission you probably have gotten really used to hearing this all over the news and in every email that you get and talking about hand-washing at least 20 seconds usually if you've got something that's got a a alcohol base or a soap base or a thigh mole base those are what really gets bacteria and the viral envelopes covering your nose and mouth the kids are being taught this even in school now so they're supposed to sneeze into their sleeve and make sure that they can actually not sense something around and as you all have realized I'm sure we're all using masks and especially if you're sick even though it's not comfortable it's worth it to consider wearing a mask or something so that you don't give it to your entire family or anyone around you we're kind of at a low covered area right now but I can't promise that's gonna last and so staying at home is part of that also removing it from surfaces so you'll notice even in every situations the grocery store everywhere else they're all cleaning the surfaces frequently trying to get rid of contact transmission and viruses and bacteria have both of those options droplet and contact and then the six feet apart has actually been something that we've known even since the plague they would isolate people who got different infections even in the in the olden days and try to limit the infections as much as they could they even put him in special boats and and out in special areas sadly which often didn't help those people recover but it at least helped the people that possibly might get the infections themselves we have immunity and we have the innate immunity and the adaptive immunity innate immunity is what we're born with although part of that I want to add is also children when they're being breastfed you actually get all of the antibiotic air antimicrobial or immune system in breast milk and so for a period of time in our country they really encourage people not to have breastfed children and now they've actually acknowledged that if you can breast feed your child for at least six months to a year actually their immunity is way better one other thing I want to mention around that though is the interesting part is when a child is born vaginally they get all of the microbes that the mom has in the process of going through the vaginal vault and being delivered and when a child comes from a c-section delivery they don't get all those microbes so we're now finding that dysbiosis and problems with our abdominal flora actually also relates even back to that very moment when we're born on whether we're c-section or whether we were vaginal delivery the two cells you'll hear people talk about are T cells and B cells there's a way that we sequester in our lymphatic system and make antibodies and then the lymph nodes and the spleen help actually filter those out or activate immune systems when we first have an infection you might hurt someone say oh you don't have any i GG IgG is the first antibody we form and the secondary antibody reform is what we call an IgG so IgM and IgG IgM is first IgG is second ID G is what gives you the long-acting immunity and that's part of what we're talking about even with kovat at this time we develop immunity especially that the IgG due to exposures other kids have it we've eliminated a lot of the microbe infections and viral infections and we now have vaccines but if their best friend gets mumps that chances are really high they may get mumps because they are contagious so and then the other is actually having a vaccination or something that gives you a micro infection that we started with polio we actually used a similar to polio vaccine cowpox so that we can actually get resistance to polio itself I'm going to go through this just a little bit to show you where these things start with the adaptive versus the innate the one last comment I have around that is that when we look at the formation of B lymphocytes antibodies defense cells and T lymphocytes how we kill them how we protect ourselves how we deal with the first attack these are things that our body has has done for centuries to change our body cells against specific pathogens so these have been formated from these kind of exposures that's been one of the hard things in that when different groups of people move from one continent to another oftentimes they do carry their immunities but they also carry those pathogens so we notice that sometimes it targets group that haven't been exposed to these we're finding that a little bit even with the Native American population with kovat as well that there are certain groups that tend to not do as well with certain pathogens and excuse who gets it and who gets it really in a such a severe manner that it could be life-threatening things that you can make that you can do yourself to make yourself less susceptible to illness the more you're stressed and this of course is stressing everybody the more you produce cortisol the more you activate your adrenals and this can actually suppress your white blood cells and antibody formation we have noted that a lot of the people that are getting especially Coben but I want to talk about all infections in general if they have vitamin D deficiencies zinc and ficient leas which we think about a third of the population have vitamin A deficiency Zoar vitamin C deficiencies it's sets us up to get more infections so those are some of the things we're encouraging everybody to do through the flu season to do with kovat I'll talk a little bit about dosages as well but zinc actually makes the strep of bacterial infections susceptible if you're low in Z the vitamin A does psychosis and I'll show you a picture that and vitamin C actually helps make you less susceptible to microbes things that might you may not be aware of that could also make you more susceptible as pre-existing medical conditions or your own genetics if you've had your spleen taken out that actually puts you at higher risk for getting infections if you tend to eat a lot of sugar that actually block vitamin absorption if you have dysbiosis or what we call leaky gut syndrome and your microbiome is actually been altered it actually leaves you at having a higher susceptibility for viruses or bacteria as well and it also could actually decrease your secretory IgA so that you actually even swallowing those microbes they affect your tissue of your gut and actually um progress to becoming other infections inside of you specific genetic pathways can do it I'm gonna list one specifically there's a group we called the hemochromatosis group it's a very common in the u.s. it came over from the bubonic plague in Europe especially and it's a genetic issue where you sequestered an iron microbes and viruses like iron so it made those be put in different organs pancreas heart liver and it actually made the people with hemochromatosis survive the bubonic plague they then moved to the US and we actually have a lot of people who have hemochromatosis here in the US but it does put that iron still in your pancreas your liver and your heart so those people usually have diabetes they often have fatty liver disease and they also end up having issues oftentimes with their art and getting congestive heart failure and heart disease way earlier than other people these are the kind of diagnosis you'd want to be evaluated with 23andme or one or of its equivalents or a physician to see if it runs in your family and if a family member goes into the hospital and has that cluster of symptoms they may diagnose your grandfather or your mother and then they'll ask that the whole family actually get diagnosed to make sure that you do or don't have hemochromatosis histamine and inflammation responses some people when they get any common infection they react way more significantly they have mast cells that release histamine just like with poison oak you actually have full body responses you have may have joint aches muscle aches skin blistering things we're beyond what maybe your sister or your neighbor might have even if they are reactive and - the same poison oak and so part of what we're now doing in genetics is really looking at how we can tone those down to control them not with biologics which is what the pharmaceutical companies want us to do but actually so that we can make our allergies a little less revved by using our genetics and supplements to try to suppress that if you have hypertension diabetes mellitus lung issues or cancer high blood pressure if you are certain races you're more susceptible to different infections or if you have a low white blood cell count which is called leukocytosis um stress one of the things that and I borrowed this from my friend dementia Clark is that part of stresses you and how you handle life so learning how to use those kind of things that can actually make your life better and make you enjoy life sometimes they're really simple could be we're going through the comics watching a funny video watching comedians dancing singing exercising getting out in the Sun top execs making art or writing going out into the fresh air just walking around your house even if you're sequestered in your house making sure you get enough sleep call or zoom and connect with all those people you love just because you haven't talked to him for a while and they can't come over to your house and even meditation is actually proven that if you can affect the adrenal axis with of stress and decrease your stress you decrease your catecholamine response you D you improve your immunity it's incredibly I want to talk a little bit about herbs that decrease stress I didn't give the the dosages on these because that's kind of a very specific thing that you should use a herbalist with but if you are going to try these yourself always start very low you can have allergic responses or reactions to herbs that you're doing yourself just like you can have them to foods or medicines and oftentimes your phase 1 and phase 2 liver cytochrome p450 system that you can get on your jeddaks the all of the herbs actually fit in there just with pharmaceuticals as well so if you have certain areas that you have snips that make you more reactive you can react to herbs just like you can as a medicine to regular pharmaceutical medicines as well so violet flowers skullcap cramp bark would Bettany stack ease or horse mint hops valerian laughs lavender st. John's work cabinet motherwort chamomile milky oats notes truck kava passionflower linden flowers these are all very common herbs that are often in stress formulas or can be taken individually if you are a sensitive please please please only try one at a time because if you react to that then you'll know exactly that this is what's causing the reaction all of these also have multiple different other categories that they can be used for so some of them give improvement in constipation so if you tend to have diarrhea that actually may make giving you diarrhea so if you're gonna take an herb look the herb up look and find out what category it's in what other actions it has to make sure that if you're the kind of person that has other side effects of things in your body that are working or not working that this herb is not going to get you in trouble with one of those in activating one that you already have so when you're learning herbs oftentimes I encourage people to actually do trials on themselves get the feel of the plant try one herb at a time see how you do with that herb see how with the spirit of the herb or how the essence of the herb talks to you and how it feels in your body because there's definitely something that your body's gonna really like and there's definitely others that you're not and if possible work with a trained herbalist because they know all of those things so they can do an herbal symptom survey and match the right herbs for you and make sure that you don't get those kind of reactions and side effects vitamin d3 even if you just stay out in the Sun for 15 minutes your vitamin D will actually go up they recommend it at least three times a week you can also use fish liver oil it will give you both vitamin D and vitamin A the dosage usually is 500 milligrams to 5,000 milligrams per day fatty saltwater fish but be aware that if your person who has darker melanin in your skin your chances of being a low in vitamin D are actually much higher there are some concerned that this may be part of what is affecting Hispanics Latin X even our native population in their vitamin DS being low and they don't even know it so they often tend to have to take a vitamin d3 supplement to maintain that what herbs have vitamin D horsetail nettle and parsley zinc you can get zinc yourself from Detroit diet pumpkin seeds some meats have zinc legumes in all the legume family Zink is needed to actually absorb enough vitamin Annie usually zinc dosing is taking 30 milligrams daily if you're doing it artificially vitamin a fish fish liver oils we talked before animal livers green yellow fruits and vegetables this actually is a great vitamin for enhancing immunity for colds influenza infection of the kidneys bladder lungs mucous membranes and it's an antioxidant so you need vitamin A to process with protein in order for it to work properly does it have to be meat it can be vegetable and plant proteins as well be aware though vitamin A is a fat soluble vitamin so you can overdose on vitamin A so you don't want to take more than 20,000 what they call IU's international units daily vitamin C you can find it in citrus rosehips those little balls that come at the end of roses after the roses have gone hibiscus tree tips violet flowers and leaves and usually you want to take one to three grams even on a daily basis and if you could sit you should actually increase that the one thing about vitamin C is if you're taking too much for your body it will give you diarrhea so be aware that you go to bowel tolerance that's and if you're starting to get more sick takes the amount smaller and spread them out during the day so instead of taking in a large dose in the morning take it three to four times a day and smaller amounts and usually your gut will tolerate that as well so that's an individual thing why do they say don't eat sugar the reason they say don't eat sugar is because acidic versus alkaline is part of how our body balances all of its organs and functions now usually our bodies are slightly acidic 7.0 is right in the middle but 7.49 is slightly alkaline that's where we hang out sugar is very acidic and so it actually can lower and immunity and there's a lot of concern that if our sugar levels are really high our yeast and Canada love to have sugar around it does alter phagocytosis here's what photosynthesis looks like so a virus comes along it attaches to the receptor on a cell the cell itself invaginate s' and kind of surrounds the virus and then it makes it into what we call a phagosome with all of that then we end up getting our immune system coming in to try to destroy this virus or make antibodies to this virus it's sequestering it inside of itself we want to talk a little bit about things besides covin and actually right now kovat is predominant but there's a lot of other things that have happened to us for four years and so you can just see what our doctor thinks about it versus how someone who's the not a doctor thinks about it the common cold and flu is most commonly viruses there are over there's some people that estimate it's somewhere around 3,000 different virus viruses but some people say it may be evening up to three million viruses usually you only get one of them once and you don't recurrently get the same virus it usually affects the lower and upper and bronchioles of your lungs I'll show you a picture of what that looks like and there really isn't any treatments for these except exactly what we just discussed all of those things tend to really help when you have a common cold and flu so getting antibiotics don't help sinus infections tend to be more bacterial or allergic bronchitis is the trachea bronchi asthma is the bronchial spasms around the mucus that makes you not be able to absorb oxygen walking pneumonia is usually a viral infection pneumonia is usually a bacterial infection and kovat is a viral infection that gives coughing see difficulty improvement breathing it also increases fibrosis in the lungs and gives you low levels of oxygen it's called hypoxia here's what the lungs look like here's the little bronchus is going down alveoli they look like a little cauliflower or broccoli bubbles and that's where we actually do the exchange the capillaries exchange the oxygen there so before exposure what they're really talking about is avoiding leak we clean your lungs if you're a vapor if you're a smoker if you're a person who cleans so your lungs are exposed to chemicals every day try to avoid the exposures remove all the toxins that would decrease your immune system try to decrease inflammation especially with diet which we just talked about they are recommending they did do a study on regular viruses and NSAIDs did have a higher viral load when you took NSAIDs but for covin they've actually realized it makes it worse things like quercetin luteolin are all anti-inflammatory so you can take those there's a couple of big great papers in terms of protection one of the things they're talking about is the use of ginger and licorice tea there's cilia protectors to try to help with the cilia like structures that in the lungs themselves that it will actually get pneumonias they're now actually talking about the bioflavonoids specifically from peppers buckwheat buck currants and you need to take at least 2 to 3 grams daily increase them and increase the frequency if you actually are happening an infection at that time bromelain which is from pineapple and vitamin c can also enhance these as a combination omega-3 fats raw not seed legumes also make the body be able to make new cells and any unsaturated vegetables oils help that make sure you're doing you can do steams you can do neti pots or crock pots essential oils non I and I saw warm water go and CEO or an organ great for sinus infections treaties mullen vitamins all of these things that we've actually already mentioned seasonal allergies tend to be more of an allergic reaction and that's this herbs for demotions are this list here I've made this so that we'll put it on the website so you guys can look up what the demotions are relaxing expectorants which help coughing for any kind of infection this is the a list of those that also will be on there these are actually herbs that fight anti-infective or virus of bacterias in the lung and that will also be on this liver support helps everything keep moving in the lymphatic system because everything drains through the liver so these are all liver support errors and adaptogens which help the body adapt to stress and the physical accept accept so go to the basics go to nutrition eat your dark green leafy vegetables that your parents were always on you nettles bamboo shoots cabbage beet tops beets themselves carrots yams Oh onions garlic ginger cayenne horseradish this is an article I will add the notation before we mount it on the website that was a kind of an interesting article I found in terms of talking about how Co good specifically works on it they've been doing some research on that and what they specifically mentioned with Co vyd was ginger and licorice Japanese knotweed elder or subbu cos astragalus Russia and and turkey tail they have had some luck with silver hydrosol which is actually aqua silver or a gentle you can usually get that from some of the practitioners or sometimes at some of the health food stores avoid sugars rust more and make sure you wear a mask as much as possible and keep that six feet from everyone else any questions Wow Terry now that is so much information now we're going to make sure we are going to upload all that especially the last through their slides you talked about we're going to make sure we get this all on the website and you hear me yes so the slides didn't work at all you guys didn't see them but hey that's all great we're going to load it up because honestly who can retain all this information you just gave us so this would be an incredible resource to refer to again and again because you covered so much which I I mean there's a lot of points I myself and passionate about you address the the acid and a clean spectrum which is so critical and nobody talks about it you also talked about finding out how we respond to natural medicine that goes for the other medication as well rather than just taking too much we have to wait and see how we react one at a time so I really once we get to feel what works for us then we can go into the whole area of having synergistic treatments but yeah I like it what you said keep it simple keep it simple yes very very good so there are some wonderful comments yes I think we're gonna have to put up this slideshow as soon as possible and you have a very unique knack of combining traditional understanding with modern research and this is really exactly what the times call for that we can apply everything we and all our ancestors have learned so far into what we need to do now for all the new diseases if you will that you know we are encountering and that started at the turn of the century and I know you were critically involved also to finding out more about what then was called SARS and MRSA and now Cove it really is SARS is that true it is a former stars without okay it has a few unique additives to it um it's specifically a corona virus SAR which has these very distinctive receptors that actually give it a ring look which is why they're calling it Corona and usually they go through bats and some other animals but they can mutate and become human interactive yeah obviously that happened and say thank you for mentioning sugar now I talk about sugar a lot and actually there's some people they don't talk to me anymore because I love sugar but but there is something going on with refined sugar that really makes it difficult for the body to deal with other things that come in is that a fair thing to portrayed as such um yes it is the what we're actually noticing is that especially in the artificial sugars different they use different receptors compared to the natural sugars even if you make a vitamin and let's say that's not made from natural food sources normally sugars are in a right configuration and when you make artificial sugars they often are in a right and left configuration because they're artificially made so sugar definitely does interrupt that and actually people can have allergies or reactions to the different types of artificial sugars as well yes they they can quite what what's the same wreak havoc on the system right yes my son was very reactive to sugars and so we one of the things we talked about the and the alkalinity inflammation usually if you're going towards the out the alkalotic spectrum you'll do better so we used to use excess or gold which is sodium it's an alka-seltzer but it's mostly studying bicarbonate citrate and we would put it in some water and visit and he would drink it and all of his reactions would stop because we were off analyzing him so with baking soda technique yes and yeah what it's really doing is making you more alkaline and it can be repeated as you need it yeah that's excellent now we have questions coming in Terry so first of all first I want to mention your website it's Terry Turner do our G and you have a private practice now in Ukiah can you share the address of your practice sure I'm at 620 South Dora it's actually right near the Women's Cancer Resource Center and it's down where the hospice is down in the bottom of the building so it for you kaya so it's a number 102 E and all right excellent and we have another question coming in I don't know how deeply you want to dive in this one but here it is when dealing with an acute situation and introducing a new herb how do you deal with the risk for allergic allergic reaction in other words how do you start with a slow and low dose when you want to attacked an active infection so um if you've done 23andme you can actually look at your C 'wipeys and there are charts that I can give you that actually have the herbs on the receptors for each phase in one detoxification in your liver so they're in the categories just like all the medications are so if you have snips in that line of receptors that might be one that you might be more sensitive to so it's not as simple as tradish medicine wants to make it but the next way is I say always start very low and slow so making it into a tea actually is a way more diffuse way of doing it versus starting yourself with teachers and the dos that are on the label that says you should take a dropper foal if you want to actually try one drop of a tincture that's a smaller dose if you have a reaction to that you actually may want to put one drop in a quart of water so that's a dilutional technique that you might find that you don't need very much of it but you can actually still keep doing herbs that you might be reactive to or find that doing micro dosing micro dosing actually sometimes can be just as effective as using large amount of dosages it's it depends on your sensitivity so usually doing herbs at least every three to four times a day if you have an active infection is the way to go anyway versus trying to give yourself a big dose once a day because herbs aren't time-released so they don't do like pills that oh they're designed to take once a day or a vitamin once a day so doing small amounts of herbs and often times you'll see in some of the different formulas that doing what a dose every hour small amount can be increased kind of through the early parts of the infection I want to mention the American herbal guild website and they actually have a covered resource page which has probably a hundred different herbalists herbal oils without borders you know a lot of the people that have done all the brunner who does herbal I'm all of those have written articles specifically for covered and I've written articles on basic treatment protocols and everybody has their favorites so there's not a an only way to do this we are trying to figure out what are the better herbs for specifically coded because we're in the midst of but on times you can use a mix and match of these herbs for even Biden's some of the local herbs that we have here are really great for infections so even growing some of these herbs in your own backyard as we are learning from Donna Tierra and some of these other things echinacea can be grown all of these things you can actually make yourself and duties or tinctures and learn how to do that so you can actually make it very accessible and sometimes having an herbal first-aid kit so that you can actually have small amounts of different herbs when things start happening looking up oh my a bowl first-aid kit has echinacea and how do I use it okay I'll start with that one because that's what I thought let me see if that if that clears my urinary tract infection or or my mild cold that I'm starting to get the only other one that actually I didn't list on here and I forgot to is there was a really great herb oh good now I'm Kelly's business saying that actually was in from Nevada there was a native herb low mason and it was very very successful in the 1918 flu and it is on the list from some of the big herbalist that one nation may have some good long-term effects I find people that keep getting repetitive infections that even starting with elderberry or elderberry wine and taking it through the flu and cold season helps boost their immunity through that time so taking a little just a little dose of that on an ongoing basis helps bring it up but you cannot actually then if if you're having repetitive infections Adlam ation to it and oftentimes that fatigue at last six eight three months you can actually cut it dry and get everything else we started so it can be very useful that's that's very helpful yes that's a lot of information you gave us and I I so embrace also the understanding of less is sometimes more the micro dosing in regular in of us rather than almost I would say overwhelming the body with this like dozens of natural never natural remedies but how can the body actually process them and really find its way to deal with them while maybe only a third of them are really beneficial at that particular time so yeah that is very helpful and well see if you take too much see at one time you get diarrhea and then you stopped a taxi right so we're taking a small amount to see and they actually decrease reactive oxidative species and all of the inflammatory cytokines that are in your body from infections so you need to actually kind of keep reboost that through the infections that really makes the big difference in you getting through infections faster great thank you so much Jerry we're almost out of time any closing words um be conscious and healthy wash your hands and really take care of you and oh there's one other interesting thing and I'm going to try to actually mount of the video on it lymphatic treatment is really great for colds and flus and the hace pass actually did one that they taught their patients and their families and it made the 33 percent of people who had died with the pneumonia from 1918 actually good at ten percent so I'm gonna actually put that up as a YouTube video so that you can learn how to do it on yourselves through the midst of this coated time very can they be phone then pardon is it on YouTube it's not yet but I'm getting ready to video and so it'll be on and if you want to look up my name on YouTube you can actually see it so much thank you for being here this much to to learn and to study thank you and I'll see you soon alright take care my you", "SYoShZ_Rvlk": "and uh yep there it is hash poop there that's a lot better always sucks to be one-sided oh yeah so we are at 17 grams of bubble hash 17.2 [Music] he threw it in the what what micron is that bag 25 micron sifter bags nylon mesh uh pressing bags 25 microns thick we have these plates um that are being heated oh there we go oh that's already here it's already on its way that's very low temperature okay come on something's happening well that's all the way across it looks like oh yeah the more the temp the slower the that's i got it set at one 65 yeah it's coming out a

it on camera how golden it looks compared to it like it it looks golden yellow the color on there is like yeah it has this honey look and it actually is very like creamy white like it's much lighter than that color that's much more golden yeah that's a history i'm gonna try and take a picture of that right here [Music] let's see oh no it's the brightness if you change the brightness on that one it might change it too [Music] is that this is fine this is fine [Music] yeah it's all going to be on the left and the right in there [Music] the the good thing about this you see how slow the bubbles are they're bubbling off those are that's terpenes and the the stuff that's bubbling [Music] less of the bubbles less of the terpenes being burnt off [Music] yep the cam hates the white paper backdrop yeah it'd probably be it yeah can you turn here on this one no yeah it's just at the mercy of the app but it's cool [Music] [Music] it's just now gonna start [Music] [Music] the way it's slowly rolling down the paper in [Music] and then there's uh two hours 18 minutes for the cannabis tincture that i'm making in the house i'm gonna rub that on her on the bone before you smoke it [Music] oh yeah imagine that that's something on the mouthpiece oh man extra high knowing just like oh that was what was on there and they're like next you know they're like pure fade that's good [Music] [Music] so [Music] hey stupid [Music] [Music] hmm [Music] so [Music] um [Music] [Music] happy valentine's day that's what you get for using the wrong tool right okay i just wish you just on this particular thing here then apart every tool is a hammer [Music] [Music] yeah it's already [Music] solid just recorded it it was crazy [Music] um [Music] that looks white right there negative oh yeah yeah sorry somebody you know someone else talked to yeah i'm like what it looks like to me it does yeah i mean for not quite paper white but the color is crazy yeah um this is not the whole harvest i have like two whole um two and a half mason jars of bud and then this this was larping buds and the clothes trim um and fan leaves that had the yeah it was pretty nice good harvest and [Music] getting a lot out of the material um there was the tincture that i showed people i made too i took the clothes trim um oh sorry the keith blah the keef and close trim from um something else here damn yeah way white looking huh yeah that's crazy [Music] so nice and thick good return right yeah so nice to be able to partake before it cures and dries all the way yep what didn't look like was theirs a lot more still pressing i like seeing the bubbles on the end because every time there's a bubble is a big old push of more stuff coming out huh oh yeah easily [Music] oh [Music] [Music] bubblation yeah i don't have no time limit people oh we press for 30 seconds or a minute i forgot one time it came back a half an hour later it was done everything was done it was perfect nothing was wrong with it because out here in the open you know and i don't really care what happened inside there it was done [Music] 20 tons now park it let it sit for a minute [Music] so [Music] nice pollination [Music] i can see a face in this one there's a mouth open right there's jaw nose is right there eyebrow all day yeah it's a monkey it'd be like that sometimes [Music] burst [Music] [Music] it does quite a bit quite a bit there i say just looking at it yeah twin bubble puppy [Music] and [Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] come hmm [Music] [Music] so [Music] is that the bag right there let's hope not but i do see something kind of funny but it would be facing the wrong direction [Music] i'd say no it's crispy yes cracked that's weird that's some stuff that came off of it yeah [Music] i think we're good to go oh that's cool yeah i could see the bag in see what you there not as clean clean as a jelly bean no had slight ooze on the um seam right there can't even see it though didn't even show up really see here this would be obtained it's like a powder on it [Music] okay it's one it was 66. minus 122. so it was 17.2 now it's 7.2 yeah but then you can take another one 0.66 so it's like yeah more than 10 grams like eleven because this is two bags now and this is tripping me out i'm thinking we made some um ca that's what all this white powder is oh yeah for sure look it's coming off oh dang yeah tca that right there is that white too there it is the nylon bag is intact that's what's on the inside that's crazy yeah i'm gonna boil this in water um the the bag later yeah you can just run it in a coffee machine yeah so um so check it yeah there's i learned i'm taking this herbalism course right and with teas there's two ways that you could uh go about that and when you uh what was it normally with tea you pour pour hot water into whatever you're trying to infuse yeah there's there's a infusion and then there that's infusion oh [ __ ] a type of infusion sorry there's that and then there's decoction where you throw it straight into it it would be easier to grab all of this that's inside of it boiling it in the water it is right there you don't want to take it out yeah it'd be a mess otherwise oh yeah yeah ready for a rip yeah how about did you try touching anything no i haven't touched it yet yeah scared myself i don't know if it's gonna i think i think because it's on this cold ass table here we're good give it a minute put it under the electron microscope yeah i could do that [Music] i don't how did it come up oh yeah clean but it didn't come up in one piece i had to yeah scrape it like okay yeah it'll cool it'll take a moment usually you can't hardly tell the difference in the two what i made the other day good flavor so excited yeah this came out well [Music] the watermelon gelato i grew in the tent yeah so i'm gonna i'm gonna boil this in some water and have some tea tonight or something i'll knock you out yeah it will knock me out that's what i'm aiming for there's some good [ __ ] normally anyway yeah yeah started with 17 came back with 10. got about 11 back eleven yeah cause uh just about minus six point six six because the one bag uh he was going 165 on the plates for the temperature so he had it set to yeah um there was slight bursting not really just because it seeped it's so fine the material in the first place then when it's heated up it starts squishing through the seam there could it bust it yeah oh yeah busted the seam yeah yeah okay guaranteed and get our money back yeah we've got one of the bags he's gotta send his feet there's like a smidgen right there better than that freaking smoke yeah okay all right everything's all cleaned up it's ready to go again there's the bucket that was smooth it was awesome yeah yeah buddy came out nice and and we got the poop hash yeah the long boy one on your right [Music] golden poo is good luck looks like if you were on a deserted island and you had plenty of that you wouldn't be deserted at all you're still fighting nato is it there or not it might be in your mind good luck and golden poo hmm perfect yeah wonderful flavor oh you", "CGV4XOu0YuI": "hi everyone today we are going to see about the face and draw presentation say in this picture this picture shows the face presentation and this shows the bra presentation mile presentation refers to a feet representing part other than the vortex if it is bridge if it is shoulder all those things are coming under thermal presentation fatal my position refers to your position other than the occipital anterior position for example if it is occipital posterior position or if it is lateral position all those things are coming under the malposition face presentation of course when the attitude of the head is one of complete extension that is the occipital of the fetus will be in contact with its fine due to the extension it will go backward and it will come in contact with the spine and the face becomes the presenting but face becomes the presenting part and there will be complete flexion of the limbs with extension of the spine and here the denominator is Mendham that is as usual as usual the adds like other baby the limbs will be flexed towards the body but only the head will be extended and it will be towards Earth so the occipital way towards the spine and in the case of face presentation the denominator is mental next is the incidence of face presentation its frequency is about one in five hundred births and face presentation can be of two types second of his presentation and for primary face presentation primary face presentation means if the presentation is faced during the pregnancy itself during pregnancy itself if face presentation is there means that is known as the primary face presentation and if the face presentation develops during the process of labor that is known as a second today's presentation this face presentation is more common in the case of multiple murders next we can see about the etiology of courses of the face presentation it can be divided into methanol causes and fetal causes the methanol causes includes lateral obliquity of theatres there is in case of multi Paris woman excessive laxity of the abdominal muscles and uterine muscles it will be there so when the uterus is getting contacted actually the force of contraction will be acting through the fetal pole and through the spine it will be directed towards the occiput but here because of the inefficiency of the uterine muscles instead of acting or two over the occiput it will be going over the chin or it will be applying towards a Jill and that leads to the extension of the head and next is contact police in a flat pelvis the head enters in the transverse damage of the rib and the parental eminence may be held up in the obstetrical conjugate and the head become extended and face presentation of course that is in the case of conducted pelvis we know contacted pelvis means if any of the diameter of the pelvis any of the diameters of the pelvis is point 5 centimeter less than the art of normal that pelvis is called of contacted police already we know that in the longitudinal diameter the obstetrical conjugate is the lesser diameter and if all the it is lesser and in contacted pelvis again it will be less when compared with the other diameters so if the head is entering into the obstacle critical conjugate because of the lesser size of the pelvis it may get caught over there and when it is getting captured over there again and again when the uterus is contacting instead of going downward or instead of descending downward it may get be flexed if the head is in the posterior position vertex presenting remains reflex the parental eminence will be caught in sacre-coeur claudemir dimension occiput does not listen and the head become extended and phase resolution results in the same if the head is entering in the Shido position towards the back most probably that entering diameter will be sacker quart low-- diameter sack report lower diameter bits we know that it is from the distance it is the distance from the sacral promontory to the Ilia patron illuminance this damage is also less and if the fatal head is entering into this less diameter they're also the descent will be difficult because the diameter is less so what will happen when the distance is difficult again and again when the pressure is getting applied through the spine there is a chance for extension of the face and that results in the face presentation next one polyhydramnios if the vortex is presenting and the membrane structure spontaneously resulting in gush of fluid and that caused the head to extend as it sinks into the lower uterine segment see in the case of polyhydramnios because of the excessive amount of amniotic fluid more intrauterine pressure will be there and in that case when the membranes are up sharing from that high concentration with much force the fluid will be coming out so with that force when the fluid is coming out due to that force their head may get extended and that leads to the face presentation next one is filter causes the fatal causes include congenital malformations of our consent lab abnormalities of the fetus like anencephaly that is small head then congenital Boyata so in the case of congenital water due to that growth in the anterior portion it will be difficult for the baby to flex the head towards the chest and the next cause is to stuff cord several round of cords around the neck in the case of cord around neck if several core turns are there around the neck that need that leads to the deflection or that will prevent the proper flexion of the head and next one is increased tone of the extensive group of neck muscles if the neck muscles are having more wrinkly stone that may leads to the Extension and the next one is prematurity of the baby and entire in depth in these cases in these two cases the capacity of the muscles will be less flaccid muscles will be there for the baby and that leaves to the extension of the baby that leads to the extended attitude of the baby and next one is multiple pregnancy in the case of multiple pregnancy if one maybe is in the normal position also sometimes the other baby may come to the come to a different position otherwise if two babies are in the normal cephalic presentation also when one baby's occupying the space inside the pelvis the other baby may not be having space to enter so when the uterus is applying pressure when the uterus is come contracting when the pressure is getting applied over there there is no space for it to descent so what will happen when again and again when you're applying pressure it may get extended and next we can see the different positions first one is right Mendo posterior that is if the meant up that is a denominator if it is pointing towards sir right sacroiliac joint right sacroiliac joint that position is known as five Minto posterior if the men thumb is pointing towards a left sacroiliac joint that is known as a left Monteux posterior and if the men thumb is pointing towards the right till your paternal eminence that is right when the lateral position if the Mendham is pointing to versa left Ilia Picton illuminants it is left meander lateral if the mentum is pointing towards sir sorry if the mentum is pointing towards the left in your bikini line it is known as left Mandela tell if the Mendham is pointing towards the right sac right heel your paternal eminence it is right mentor and a there if the Mendham is pointing towards a left heel you're picturing the eminence it is left Mendo interior it is left mentor anterior and this is left vendo force left mend apostasy the he a mentum is pointing towards sir left sacroiliac joint here the mentum is pointing towards left elio personal eminence next one is mechanism of Labor in the mentos eientei their position that is left Mentos anterior position we are going to deal over here here the lie is longitudinal attitude is one of extension of the head and back attitude is extension presentation is phase position is left mento anterior denominator this Mendham presenting part is left Malhar one presenting part is left malar one now let us see the cardinal moments for the positional moments in that first one is engagement the diameter of the engaging and engagement is oblique diameter that is in the case of left mentor and idea it enters into the five Tobruk diameter of the pelvis and in the case of right mentor and leader it enters into the left oblique diameter of the pelvis and the glabella will be the Mendham will be pointing towards her a little bit gentle eminence in the case of LMA it is pointing towards her left Illya pixel eminence RMA it is pointing towards right Illya patron luminance and glabella will be to the opposite sacroiliac joint and the engaging Dimitri's suboccipital breath Matic nine point five centimeter if the head is fully extended if it is fully extended it is supposed to be Tobruk Matic nine point five centimeter and if it is partially extended it is sub mundo vertical eleven point five centimeter if it is partially extended soft mundo vertical eleven point five centimeter and next one is descent listen we know that descent takes place throughout the labor here the descent will be happening with increasing extension and finally the chin will comes on that's just the pelvic floor and the next moment is internal rotation of the head we know that as for the second principle whatever part comes and meets the resistance of the pelvic floor will rotate forward until it comes under the symphysis pubis so here when the chin comes and meets the resistance of the Breivik flow it will rotate one by eighth of the circle and till the mentum is coming behind the symphysis pubis and finally the chin will come under the symphysis pubis or escape under the symphysis pubis next one is flexion this takes place antha since you put but text and off super cheap super rhenium the head is born the diameter distant during the bible outlet is supplement of article eleven point five centimeter submit a vertical eleven point one centimeter will pass next is a restitution this occurs when the chin turns 1 by 8th of the circle opposite to the direction of the internal rotation that is the twisting movement that has occurred during the indian rotation of the head will be corrected by N and twisting moment the next movement is internal rotation of the shoulder now this time the tolda wave comes and meets the resistance of the pelvic floor so the shoulder also will rotate one by eighth of the charge circle in the case of left mentor aunt idea the shoulder enter in the left oblique diameter of the pelvis and it rotate one by eight of the circle and it will come to the anterior posterior diameter of the pelvis and in the case of RMA it will be just gendering in the right oblique diameter of the pelvis and next is exchange of the head this occurs simultaneously at the same time of internal rotation of the shoulder external rotation of the head will occur so the chin moves for the one beneath of the circle to the same side of the restitution to the towards the same side of restitution next is lat reflection the anterior shoulder escapes under the symphysis pubis the posterior shoulder sips the perineum and the body is borne by a moment of lateral flexion body will be borne by a moment of lateral flexion so that's all about the mechanism of phase presentation the complete video of this mechanism I will be uploading in the next week next is diagnosis of face presentation diagnosis can be done by abdominal examination ultrasonography and by the vaginal examination when you are performing the by gentle examination if you are able to palpate mouth mole are born and if it is posing forming a triangle and anus and the scale tuberosity is forming a straight line that is known as backside it's an indication of the face presentation and usually when you are doing the / / within the examination sometimes if it is a face presentation the mouth you may miss taken it as annas and you may think that it is a breech presentation or buttocks presentation but in the case of face presentation if you are just keeping the fingers over that you will feel if it is more you can feel the sucking effect and second thing in the if it is anus surely the hands will get stained because of meconium but if it is more absence of meconium staining will be there and on the abdominal examination in the inspection because of the s-shaped spine there is there is no visible bulging of the flanks and in the case of largely palpation in the mentor anterior position the fetal limbs are felt anteriorly towards the midline and back is on the flying and it is difficult to palpate it will be towards the flank towards the back of the mother's mother's body so it will be difficult to part with the chest is thrown anteriorly against a uterine wall and it's often mistaken us back in the case of mentor posterior position back his felt to the friend hand will be hand will be able and it will be easy for you to palpate it towards the podalic pole it will be easy for you to palpate it because of the extension of the spine in the pelvic the the head seems big and it is not engaged the cephalic prominent says to the sides towards to the side towards which back lies a groove between the head then neck is not so prominent here in the posterior position the groove between the head and neck will be prominent and in the auscultation Ephesus is distinctly audible anteriorly through the chest one of the faders towards the side of the limbs and in the case of posterior position Ephesus is not distinct and it's audible on the flying towards the sides of the limbs next is clinical course or outcomes there is a chance for prolonged labor and it is due to the age fitting presenting part if the presenting part is a very fitted presenting part it will act directly on the cervix and that leads to the proper dilatation of the cervix but here the presenting part is an ill-fitting presenting part so that's the chance for slower dilatation of the cervix and when the cervix is dilating slowly the duration of labor will get blocked and another one when this duration of labor is getting too long finally what will happen when it when the uterus is contracting and relaxing for a long period the you then muscles will go to a stage of inertia so the effective you tend contractions will not occur so that also may leads to the further prolongation of the labor process and formation of elongated bag of membranes I told you that phase is not a very fit representing part so through the sides of a presenting part this amniotic fluid will come and it will get it will get stagnated in front of the presenting part so it will form a bulging of the bag of membranes and pour molding of the facial bones we know that the skull bones will not get us fired fully during the process of labor so the molding of the skull bones are possible during the time of labor so if the presenting diameter is a little more during the molding it will decrease and easily the baby will pass through the but here the facial bones will get old you will get falsified during the process of before the process of labor itself so the molding of the facial bones will not occur so if the molding is not occurring if the presenting diameter is more it will be same it will continue are same so the delay of the rotation will occur so there's a chance for even arrest of the labor also and delayed engagement if the presenting part is a bigger diameter occipital frontal or mental Vertica in that cases engagement may may become late or sometimes engagement may not even occur and lay the internal rotation here also the reason is same due to the largest diameter presenting diameter the rotation may take time and Aris at and at times insuperable obstruction if meant a positive fails to rotate anteriorly this already I had told you if the presenting diameter is more there's a chance for arrest of the labor and there is a chance for malrotation also next is cord prolapse I have already told you that the presenting part is the face is an ill-fitting presenting part so when the uterus is cutting contacted the umbilical cord may escape through the sides of the presenting part through the sides of the face so that may leads to the heart prolapse and next is maternal DOMA if the presenting diameter is a largest diameter for example if it is meant to vertical thirteen point five centimeter when this thirteen point five centimeter is passing through the vagina there is a chance for tear of the soft tissues of the perineum and next one is postpartum hemorrhage already we have seen that there is a chance flow chance for prolonged labor and due to the prolonged labor I had told you that there is a chance for you turn in Ayrshire or the Seas and so v contractions of the uterus and if the uterus is not getting contracted effectively in the postnatal period there is a chance for bleeding or postpartum hemorrhage and prognosis the material prognosis include in the case of Mentos until their maternal risk is not much increased if it is an anterior position the risk is less but if it is an exhibit of posterior position there is a chance for artists of the labor or something that is the face may get impacted and in some cases it can be manipulated - that is if even if it is an and posterior position also by applying by manual pressure under the guidance of art Kazan you can bring it to the interior of the potato anterior position and if you are able to bring it to the occipital anterior position the outcome will be successful and the future prognosis include there is a chance for fetal bruising see if the face is a presenting part when you are doing the vaginal examination sometimes your fingers may damage the soft tissues of the face and even your fingers may damage may produce damage to the eyes little eyes also and there is a chance for cerebral hemorrhage and intrauterine hypoxia when the duration of labor is getting increased there is a chance for you trained hyper hypoxia for the baby and if the presenting diameter is a large diameter when it is passing through the pelvis there is a chance for compression and that leads to the cerebral hemorrhage and chance for increased operated delivery so usually if the head is not rotating or if there is a delay and if fetal hypoxia is occurring usually we will go for the operated delivery and chance for infection there's a chance for bacterial contamination due to the bacterial contamination from the vagina and even when you are doing the provisional examination also your hands may introduce infection directly directly to the baby and the baby may get laryngeal edema during the first 24 to 48 hours after the delivery next let us see the management of labor in the case of face presentation first we should maintain stick s this all they had told you that there is a chance for infection a next vaginal examination when you are doing the vaginal examination you have to be careful because already we have seen that little chance of causing injury to the eyes and there is a chance for introducing infection so because of these reasons you have to be conscious and Blau bowel and bladder care you have to empty the bladder and bowel and that may leads to the he say passage of the baby and I see when the duration of labor is getting poor long the mother is mother may get exhausted so you have to meet the nutritional needs of the mother next is relief of pain already I have told you that here there's a chance for increased duration of labor so throughout that process the mother is supposed to bear that pain so you are to give her adequate analysis and you should monitor the progress of the labor if there is an arrest or if there is any unexpected reaction if quickly hypoxia is there or there is a if there is no progress in labor if the you plane inertia is the science of fetal distress is there in that cases you have to take immediate action next is the rest and ambulation during the process you have to give proper us to the lady at the same day you have to UM plate the mother also and if there is any deviation from the normal if signs of fetal distress or if any maternal unexpected reactions are there immediately you have to inform the doctor and routine observations of the field conditions and maintain or condition also should be them that is your protein protein Lee how to assess the progress of the labor you are supposed to check the vital signs of the mother not supposed to check them we are fetal heart rate you are supposed to check the number of contractions the progress of labor everything and fetal scalp pellet electrode usually we want apply and in case if you are playing you are to be careful and you should not insure the eyes and overall assessment is to be done and whenever you are doing the assessment you have to record it and you should see the pelvis for the adequate see you should assess the size of the pelvis and you should assess the size of the baby and you should assess the Associated complicating factors for example if teen pregnancy is their gestational diabetes is their eclampsia is their preeclampsia is their those conditions also you have to see in uncomplicated cases a wait and watch policy can be taken sometimes in the case of phase presentation when the uterus is contracting sometimes there is a chance for again this a chance of flexion of the head and if it is getting flexed that may leads to a vertex presentation or sometimes a research and so further extension and if it is getting extended further unlikely fully if it is extended the less diameter submental breath matic meander breath Matic may submit dobrik Matic may enter so there is a chance for normal delivery so in that cases you can just wait for a wait and watch policy immediately after the capture of the membrane if the membranes are rupturing during the process of labor immediately after the rupture of membrane you should perform a vaginal examination to explore the possibility of tough cord prolapse and again after if we again within added interval of 2 to 4 hours you can do the provisional examination and in the case of meander posture if the head remains high that is in spite of good to attain conductions also if the head is remaining high that is if the head is not getting engaged you can go for the caesarean section now let us see the indications of the caesarean section the case of face presentation if there is a contact at pelvis is there if the baby is weak if associated complicating factors are they in those cases you can go for caesarean section next is birth of the head when face appears act of Bab Alba extension must be maintained by holding back the since holding back to since you put and permitting the mentum to escape under the symphysis babies before the occipital diameter is our to sweep the perineum in this way the supplemental vertical diameter eleven point five centimeter can be distended instead of the Mentos vertical thirteen point five centimeter into the vagina and an elective episode me also should be performed if it is not performed properly that is during the birth of the head you should hold the essentia put in order to reduce the presenting diameter and if the head does not descend in the second stage a forceps delivery can be preferred and rotational forceps can be used and when rotation is incomplete or position remains when to posterior you can use the rotation forceps in case if the rotation is not occurring caesarean section will be necessary if the head has become impacted and there is any suspicion of disproportion that is during the process of labor if the head is if there is no progress and if you are suspecting the arrest of labor or if you are suspecting the cephalo filmic disproportion in that cases also you can go further so sorry next we can go to the draw presentation if the fetal head is not fully flexed and not fully extended in that case draw presentation will be there and raw means it is a portion between the anterior fontanelle a and the orbital ranges and if that portion is coming in at the brim of the pelvis we are calling it as draw presentation and the incidence of draw presentation is one in thousand buds next let us see how to diagnose the proper sensation the cephalic prominence and the glue between it and the back is less prominent the head feels big and not engaged on vaginal examination you can feel the anterior fontanelle lay on one side of the pelvis and the orbital fringes and possibly the root of the nose at the other side that is both Angela foreign relay and the orbital ridges you will be able to see on either side and the cuff or the confirmation you can go for the scenography or radiography next is mechanism of labor in the case of draw presentation the diameter of engagement is through the oblique diameter and the engaging Dimitri's mento verticals thirteen point five centimeter so there is no mechanism forth for the bra presentation in an average says baby but if the baby is very small and if the pelvis is very spacious and if you 10 contractions are effective would do 10 conductions are there and if there is no other complications you can try for the normal delivery and usually in the normal cases there is no mechanism and even for the posted above presentation also there is no mechanism and cause and prognosis of draw presentation there is a chance for obstructed labor in the case of persistent representation there's a chance for rupture of the uterus and there is a chance for spontaneous sometimes if the head is getting flexed that may leads to the buttocks presentation and if the head is getting extended that may leads to the face presentation in that cases if the head is coming back to the face presentation or if they had this well getting well flexed and if it is going to the vertex presentation you can tie for the normal delivery usually if the same raw presentation is coming normal delivery will not occur there's a chance for obstructed labor and if there is no evidence of fatal compromise labor is allowed to continue for a short while in the case of further extension of the herd converts sometimes if it already had told you some if you are suspecting that if it may get converted into face presentation or feet if there is a chance of getting converted into buttocks presentation you can wait if the head fails to descend and walk draw presentation is persisting in that case you should go for the Caesarea section and you can fight for the manual correction of the face with full dilatation of this if the cervix is fully dilated and there if there is no other complications you can go for the manual correction to the face presentation and if the labor become obstructed and if the baby is died we can go for the craniotomy for expelling the baby out thank you for watching this video thank you", "90ZMF7tTOSE": "[Music] [Music] jedd diamond welcome to radio curious it's in a long time it has been it's good to be back so your book mister mean saving your relationship from the irritable male syndrome I'd like to begin our visit with the description of what the irritable male syndrome is well this really evolved from research that I had done on male menopause which was one of my earlier books what we found was that one of the key symptoms that was repeated over and over again for men that were going through midlife changes was a great deal of irritability anger frustration and I wanted to understand this better so I did an in-depth research project looking at this dynamic of irritability and found that it was a key issue for a man at midlife so the issues I suspect would be biological and sociological indeed we found that there actually four key interrelated issues that were part of the dynamic one was changes in hormone levels secondly fluctuations of brain chemistry thirdly increasing stress levels of the men and fourth the real change in the the sense of identity and sense of role satisfaction that men were having so where do we go with this I suspect from your book and the subtitle saving your relationship the idea is to understand for men and women how do you bring this understanding to the average couple and that would be parallel I would presume in an average gay couple who would have a long three together right well what my concern was I'm a psychotherapist as you now and have been treating people in couples for forty five years now so my main issue is how do you help families how do you help a couple deal with their relationship in a way that's satisfying for both so that the the relationship that often is of long standing doesn't fall apart just when the couple could enjoy it the most so what I wanted to do was develop very specific interventions very specific tools that I've used in therapy to help people and put them at the service of couples that they can use themselves to help their relationships not only survive but to thrive so examples would be well we do things for instance in the therapy sessions that I do of really tuning into what your own needs are often when we're in a long-standing couple our needs get kind of merged with our partner and one of the things that often happens is we get disconnected from what our deep needs are or how to express them to our partners so I give people exercises that help them reflect on their needs to tune in to their needs and then to be able to share them with their partner in a way that really works for them that helps each other to connect let's be specific if we can about what some exercises might be well for instance what would I'll ask people to do is close their eyes that's a way to disconnect from the outer world to tune in to the inner world to begin to breathe to take slow deep breaths that enable you to get really relaxed them to begin to let your your focus go inside and to ask yourself what is it that I really need right now what are what are my desires what's going on with me what's the deep hunger that I have that often isn't being satisfied having gotten in touch with then I have people visualize that to get it as clear as they can and in their mind and their psyche and then to write them down after they've reflected on it to write it in words write it in pictures write it in whatever way they're able to contextualize this and then once they do that to share it with their partner to zoom them the insights into what they're seeing when they look inside is this done in the therapy model or outside of the therapy model and brought back to the session with you well what I'm doing it in a therapy context I will do both sometimes I do this right in the office where people can sit and I can guide them I also give them homework that they can do themselves and so when they're doing this as part of the the self-reflection that I guide them through in the book it's something they can do on their own they can in a sense guide each other and guide themselves as they're working this in their own home I believe what you're saying however carries an assumption that both partners to the relationship want to be there and I would suspect that in many contexts of the people who come to see you one wants to be there more than the other and perhaps the other is doesn't want to be there well what I found is there's only one reason that I found in the years I've been doing therapy of why people would not want to be together and it's usually because pain is developed fears have developed concerns about are my needs really being heard am I being attended to do you care about me and so when these hurts pains disconnections occur eventually you start wondering do I really want to be here am I am I really you know going through pain needlessly so when you help people get back in touch with their needs when they're able to express their pain without blaming and judging their partner often they're able to get back - that sense of we're in this together we want to help each other we want to be able to satisfy each other's needs and the reason that we may want out more than the other partner is because we're in more pain or we're in touch with that pain once we get that articulated then I can help a couple realize they're both on the same side they really want the same thing they just often have gotten disconnected from the knowing that their partner wants to be cared for wants to be loved just as much as they do in your book mister mean you make references to men reacting to not having gotten enough attention from their mother as boys right and you bring this out forty-five to fifty years later into their lifetime in middle-age tell us about that well I think as a psychotherapist that specialized in men's health issues through these many years I found one of the secret needs that men have talked about is how much they need to be cared for nurtured held in the same way that they did when they were children or they wish they had been cared for and nurtured and held his children and these needs never go away we kind of have the the notion that is we grow up we become adult we don't have the same needs that we did when we're children but I find that that desire is just as strong and men repress it we're told we need to be strong we need to be macho we need to be you know men's men we shouldn't be needy that's feminine that's not what men really need and that hunger that men so deeply have but don't express often comes out at midlife often comes out when we hit our 40s and our 50s and if not dealt with it becomes the the seed or the core for that anger that irritability that grouchy old man syndrome that we see so often so you're implying that the need is equal for both men and women but men are you're saying that men repress it women don't well I'm saying something even more striking which is the research shows that in some ways men need that nurturing even more than females that we know from research on brain chemistry that the male brain is actually more sensitive to emotional overload to emotional trauma from the interactions that happen so in some ways the the male psyche of the male you know soul needs nurturing needs care even more than the female but clearly men and women need this in measures that often are not met and both men and women are hungry for the connection that sometimes they didn't have when they were children but then strongly are hungry for for their whole lives well I want to know how you conducted the research that led to that conclusion but before we get there I want to say that in this edition of radio curious were visiting with Jeb Dimond a psychotherapist who lives in Willets California and has been working with men and women for forty five years and we're talking about his book called mr. mean saving your relationship from the irritable male syndrome you're listening to radio curious I'm very vocal Jed tell us about the instrument that you prepared that resulted in the conclusion or gave you evidence to conclude that men are more sensitive to emotional overload that seems seems like it's a contrary statement to what many men our age would say well it is actually the research is at my personal research this was done by a number of neuroscientists that actually measured the the brain functioning what going on in men's brain when they were either recalling traumatic situations or they were actually put in stressful situations in the laboratory and what what I was able to do was to build on this and I developed an instrument that I called the irritable male syndrome questionnaire that started out as the scale I used when I was doing the research for the book but after I did it I posted it online so that other men and women could take the quiz could assess the levels of irritability and anger that they were feeling and in the last five years we now have had 60,000 men take the quiz and probably 20,000 women have taken the questionnaire so we have a huge database now that have enabled us to see really the extent of irritability and anger that goes on in men and how it's reflected in their relationships and more importantly what we can do with whatever level of the earth ability and anger and frustration that men have to heal these wounds and help relationships so they can grow and stay together and thrive through all the rest of the years that people are together I want to know specific parts of the questionnaire but before you tell us give us the website so our viewers and listeners might be able to have access to her yeah it's real simple it's IMS quiz calm the letters i M s for irritable male syndrome quiz calm and what we found is this is a wonderful tool particularly for men we found that wives will talk to their men or their partners will talk to them and the guy will say no not me I'm not doing that not I'm not not angry and they take the quiz and they get a score and all of a sudden I get letters from the guy saying you know my wife's been telling me I've been angry all these years but I took the quiz I got the score I scored really high and now I really recognize that this is a problem and now I'm ready to get some help there's confidentiality in taking the quiz that can be either maintained or revealed by the quiz taker exactly and the some of the questions are well the the four key symptoms there's 50 but they often group into either hypersensitivity where that feeling of walking on eggshells almost anything you do can set the person off frustration let's stay with my personality for a minute anything that the partner does could set the male the man off right okay so it's his hypersensitivity particularly to her well it's it often gets reflected with her often the you know I was just talking to a man this morning as a client and he was saying that things were frustrating at work he was having a really difficult time at work and he was you know just reacting and every little thing bothered him and he keep it in check you know all through the workday but when he came home he found that when his wife said one little thing he blew up on her so although he may be hypersensitive to many different situations including work including other parts of his life often it's at home where it erupts and often in obviously the most intimate situations that are the most precious are where the the hurt and the pain can be the most damaging similar to when a toddler breaks down when they come home after they played happily and day care all day exactly yes so the hypersensitivity is one frustrations and all kinds of symptoms that are related to frustration anger that can be you know blowing up kind of anger or that cold you know my wife used to call it when I was going through this is beady-eyed look and finally the the fourth symptom you know has to do with anxieties and fears and worries and altogether we found that there were this fifty symptom questionnaire that then helped us group to different types of irritability from the grumpy type of that just you know frustration but just little things bother me to the explosive type where things actually blow up and there's you know rage that can turn into violence to the depressed kind of irritability where you're you know you're frustrated you're depressed but it's an angry depression not a crying in a weeping depression so we have this knowledge we have a couple where one or both of answered the 50 or so questions how many questions are there they're 50 okay and they're about 50 symptoms right you analyze that and then that's where you go back to what we talked about a few minutes ago of close your eyes and determine what I really want that's the first down of us that's the first step and where do we go from there well once we see what we want and what we need then we we see what's blocking needs fulfillment what's getting in the way and some of the things we test for in our clinic we look at hormone levels because one of the things that often gets in the way for men is their hormone levels are out of balance and we want to know what those are with the blood draw you can do blood draws you can also do saliva test which looks for the hormones that is in what we call the the free testosterone level so we can do blood you know and/or saliva we're looking at stress levels so we want to know you know how much stress do you have in your life we want to look at diet because we find what you're eating actually has a very important influence on your feelings and particularly irritability and anger we want to look at exercise and how much you're moving how much you're you know actually physically you know letting off steam so there's a number of things that we then look at to see what's getting in the way of the man being able to be the kind of man he wants to be and being able to relate to his partner in a way that's satisfying and then we intervene then we offer different solutions from increasing hormone levels to you know changing diets to getting an exercise program to psychotherapy we have a whole host of tools that we can offer once we know what's really getting in the way of a man getting his needs met and a couple being able to come together in the United States in general in California more specifically and Northern California even more specifically there's an ingress there's an increase in the use of marijuana in the northern part of Mendocino County were you live much of it has grown do you find that the use or non-use of marijuana influences the issues that we're talking about well I think they do not just marijuana I think there's a whole host of substances that people can use if used well and without problem whether it's in our cocktail before dinner or a glass of wine with the meal I mean we we use those things to change our emotions to change the way we feel to relax to unwind after a day but for all of those things you can overdo that you can use marijuana as an escape you can use it as a way to block out from the realities of life you can use it as a way not to talk to your wife or not to talk to your partner so all of these things can be as well or they can be used with problem and clearly as the stress levels in the world increase as environmental stresses go on economic stresses you know continue to increase throughout the world what I'm saying is the level of escape that people are experiencing is going up the level of irritability and anger is going up and often rather than dealing with these things directly we misplace our intention we escape from dealing with them and that then leads to more problems and I want to stop that a lot not only relationships with partners to get better but we want people's relationship with their neighborhoods to improve their communities to improve with their economic world to improve their situation with the political system to improve I think we need to be more engaged on many levels than we are now so on the front end I would anticipate that denial rides high indeed how do you get past that veneer of denial well there are two basic ways that people get through denial uh one is you can wait until the major crisis happens you have the heart attack your wife says she's going to leave you the you ride your car off the road because you haven't had enough sleep so in other words one way to get through denial is to do nothing until the the world impinges on you in a way that you can no longer ignore it the other way which I think is is less stressful is to anticipate the problems that can occur that's why the questionnaire has become so helpful to so many people because in a sense it it forces you to take a look not only in the moment and then now how are you feeling now but it enables people to look and say how is this going in the future if I don't make some changes what's going to happen in the next six months the next year and it enables then the man often and his partner to say you know let's not wait until we hit the wall let's not wait until the heart attack occurs let's not wait until you know our sex life goes out the window let's do something now so the website for the questionnaire is WWI ms no it's not that the website for the question here is WWI MS quiz comm that's right and Jeff Diamond I want to thank you for being with us on radio curious and before we close I have a few questions surely when was the last time you experienced irritable male syndrome well as you know part of the reason I wrote the book was for the clients that I was seeing the people that I wanted to help but also quite frankly because my wife was telling me you know you're getting kind of irritable you know it's a problem for us I mentioned that kind of beady-eyed look that I wasn't even aware of and I think so many men are not aware of the frustration and anger that builds up and how we take it out on our partner with outer rage or just that stare that can be so hurtful and my wife pointed it out to me and I began to I first resists like many men to deny like many men but finally to go you know I think she's she's telling me something that's truthful because she cares for because she cares for me and so I I dealt with that and so it's been probably you know six or seven years in the past that I really tackled this head-on myself and I can tell you our relation Jeff we've been together over 30 years now really turned around when I started dealing with this in a more effective way than either trying to suppress it and close it down or to blow up on her or other people friends colleagues makes a big difference when you take that anger and you're able to express it in constructive ways and can you tell us your age I'm 66 and more questions what would you like to do with the rest of your one precious life that's a good question I can tell you this one precious life is becoming more and more precious as I get older and I hope that with the this rest of my life I can do a couple of things I can continue to have a really deeply loving relationship with my wife I hope I can continue to help and support my children and my grandchildren that are the next generations coming up and then I can continue to share what I know in my writing and my counseling and my talking to people so that we can all live in a world that works better that's more balanced that's more sustainable and more loving really for everybody and a Eureka moment or an aha moment that has come to you and your experience that has stayed with you well what a hot moment I got with my wife was I was feeling so frustrated with her one day and it seems so clear to me that she was doing things that were causing me pain she was irritating it was so clear to me that she was the cause of my problem and I was so frustrated I went out for a run I'm a runner I like to run and I went for a run and I came back and I felt like I'd been transformed it was something had lifted for me and it was an aha moment that said nothing's changed between she and I she doesn't change anything she didn't say anything different what had changed was my perception having broken this frustrating interaction doing something good for myself like running I realized a lot of my problems were in my own head and if I could release those in some way in this case by running I could be a lot happier without being so angry and so sure that I had to get my wife to change in order for me to be happy and finally jet diamond is there a book that you could recommend to our viewers and listeners well there's I read all the time and so there's a lot of books that I love one that I've been reading lately is by a psychologist and a philosopher named Irvin Laszlo and it's book called transformation 2012 there's a lot getting written now as we get closer to 2012 about the changes going on in the world changes going on in society the stresses that are increasing and he puts these things together in in a very very important and transformative way that tells us what can we all do to ensure that when we get to 2012 and past 2012 that humans can learn to relate to each other relate to the earth in a way that's sustainable and in a way that we'll all be here for hopefully centuries and centuries to come and not wipe ourselves out well Jeff diamond thank you very much for being with us on radio curious thank you in this edition of radio curious we've been

"hey there hi there ho there you got Gort you're hurtin hippie with finally another review we are reviewing Mendel breath hi cannabinoid full spectrum extract HC FS e for those of you who don't know HC f SE hi cannabinoid full spectrum extract is the sugary substance is THC a that falls out of the hi Tareen extract so it has some terpenes in it it has the full spectrum of plant it is absolutely beautiful medicine very high in strength very wonderful in flavor and in aroma for you Chris you haven't commented in a while but always for you crisp we're looking at it in front of us right now and it is like an Amber or dark brown sugar like a brown sugar it is a little bit slick it is easy to break up into pieces but it's more play-doh like than it would be sugar like it's absolutely beautiful we're gonna go in full in a bit here I just want to read to you while you're looking at that read ear what Leafly says about Mendel breath because it has quickly become one of my new favorites excuse me Mendel breath is an interesting mix of OG Kush breath which is supposed patriarch of the cookie famine etics and Mendel montage their forces combined make dense frosty buds that reek of sweet vanilla and caramel no matter how good this smells save it for after work this thumper can pivot your entire day's plans with its powerful body high built for chronic pain and discomfort this is an incredible plant I've had it in BHO I haven't had it in flour yet now HCF se now let's go a little bit closer and look at it under the microscope well I'm changing my camera so that later you get my ugly mug I am showing you it at 20 times zoom this is 20 times and that's a very tiny piece I'll show you the end of my dab are under here so you've got an idea for size oops that see so there's my dabber so it's very very small now let's go 200 times you're seeing what you see is sugary crystals and they're absolutely beautiful but at 200 times I have not seen it yet it looks like you're looking at sugar under a microscope large squares almost glass like structures all stuck together like an with like a jelly oil absolutely beautiful amber colors with yellows and some bright whites where the crystal is really frozen stiff absolutely gorgeous now my friends you're coming to me come to me there we are I should leave that up there because I'm zit City I'm having a hard day anyways peace and cheers friends love and harmony been a while well not really I talk to you every day I'm perched ponderings but it's been a while for one of these this is Oh such a beautiful smell of vanilla I don't smell the caramel maybe slightly but boy oh boy do you taste it in this this is one they're more expensive than the average I believe these are 75 dollars a gram or maybe a hundred a gram yeah they're a hundred aground and some people already reported on my last one that they can get it a little bit cheaper but I'd I just wonder the quality this is this is really expensive the process and it's really really well worth it we're taking a DAB right now we've already talked about what it looks like it's very brown sugar ish almost like wet brown sugar but just tiny bit wet it has beautiful crystalline structures it has an incredible smell of caramel and we're about to taste it peace and cheers friends I forgot I forgot my carb cap doesn't matter I got a big one that's where the caramel comes in my friends is that taste a very creamy creamy caramel with a slight taste of vanilla it's like a like a gourmet coffee it's really really a beautiful beautiful taste but even more so for people like me and I know a lot of you are like me with chronic pain with back pain with neck pain stuff that you really need to hit hard to get rid of the pain this doesn't this is my new go-to this is it it's not great for insomnia so I still have bubba kush for my nighttime medicine but throughout the day I'm a I'm always fatigued anyway so I still stick to mostly indica a little bit of tea first thing in the morning and by noon our mont indica and not very much during the day but this has helped me wrestle that anxiety monster that seems to follow a lot of us around this has calmed it this has allowed me to go out on my walks unlike bubba kush which locks me to the coach this is one that has allowed me to continue my day a little bit tired little lethargic but fairly clear and wanting to a good mood it's a mood changer and oh boy with I'm looking out my window and I'm seeing that we just got another foot of snow so we've gotten about a foot and a half in the last day and a half and that was right after a three degree high so talk about a low but this stuff takes that low away keeps the day nicer so I've really enjoyed Mendel breath both in BHO and in the HCF SE and MMJ total healthcare has them both any of you trying to get on there remember if yet run into trouble go to the main website click on the chat we're there six days a week helping you helping us help you anyways helping them help you so and that helps us because we like to help people my friends I hope you like this it's one of my smaller ones my 99th I still don't know what I'm doing for my hundredth but I want it to be a big one peace and cheers friends love and harmony and that was terrible peace", "Cq4G2ciXjZI": "Stanford University welcome to this week's ee3 if you're expecting an Intel talk sorry it's been rescheduled for spring EE 380 is a battle our product is about electronics technology and usage and it tends to be about when it's about usage tends to be on what we can do with electronic systems make things possible or better the assumption is generally that the environment is either trivial or it's a the problem that we get to solve and yay us that doesn't reflect reality the best sensors in the world are completely useless that they can't get to where the data is where they can pick up the relevant data and that's what makes today's talk different the ocean today is largely unknown not because we don't have decent sensors it's because we can't get the sensors to where the data is and that turns out to be a mode of energy problem Roger Hyneman today's speaker and his co-inventors at liquid robotics came up with a clever way to use the ocean to provide loaded force I want to say something clever about considering how long people have been looking at the ocean insert your own joke narrator of course once we have a way to move we're back to 382 familiar 380 ground autonomous robots power limited computing low bandwidth hostile environment yay us this talk also though reminds us of well the of the breadth of technology that is in Silicon Valley electronics may be ubiquitous and essential but it isn't the old but other things are important to what a lot of little or not so little companies around Silicon Valley that do simply amazing things that are Facebook Google Microsoft or computer companies Vadra honey thanks a lot well it's it's great to be here I did look at the colloquium and think what is this is an electronics engineering computer science colloquium it seems a bit of a stretch for me I am neither certainly the mechanical engineer I'm also not an oceanographer but I thought that it might be appropriate to start out with a little bit of a primer on ocean observation what it is why it's challenging and why it's important you may have realized that the planet is covered mostly in water 72 percent of the ocean is of the planet is ocean this is if you play with Google Earth you can spin around and get to a point where you can see almost nothing but it should be self-evident but sometimes it's not that with six and a half billion people approaching seven billion growing at a hundred thousand people per day living on this planet understanding the ecosystem and and and how we interact with it is not just an academic question that it may in fact become an existential question and you cannot do this without looking in depth at the ocean and the ocean is a difficult difficult place to observe quite tangibly we get a lot of food from the ocean the number one source of animal protein for humans is fish it's about a two hundred billion dollar a year industry and about half of that right now is aquaculture fish farming the the Marine capture fisheries that they capture for marine fisheries peaked in around 1996 and it's been level or declining since then that's not for lack of trying but the fish simply are not there in the numbers they used to be that's one example of the importance and some of the change that's happening in the ocean another thing that is well known is greenhouse effect global warming or the carbon cycle about 5.5 petagrams or I think that's the same thing as a Giga ton of carbon is put into the atmosphere apparently through anthropogenic sources each year well about 90 gigatonnes comes out of the ocean 92 goes back in so then that change there is about 2 Giga tons but it's a huge variable in this equation that needs to be understood it's it's we don't have co2 sensors throughout the ocean at this time so there's there's a lot of inference there's a lot of solid data but there's a lot of inference this relates to global warming it also relates to a parallel problem that it that is related to co2 which is ocean acidification so that net to Gigaton lies per year maybe increasing the pH or increasing the acidity of the ocean that makes it more difficult for organisms that build shells to grow coral or shellfish some of those are quite small pteropods with a little nearly microscopic snail creatures that young salmon eat for example these changes are need to be understood better you're probably aware of this this is quite a famous piece right now that's in the news this is from satellite observations of the ocean that document the shrinking of the polar ice cap some other changes that are happening the ocean maybe are less well known and and and this one I think is interesting because it highlights the importance of ocean observations and the difficulty of them this this data comes from a group in England that has been running since 1931 a continuous plankton survey the the apparatus as you can imagine from 1931 is quite simple it's a thing that gets towed behind a ship plankton go in one end and they get caught in a scroll the scroll advances because a propeller drives a gear mechanism so it's all mechanical and what it does is it keeps her record of this of the plankton where that ship transected those scrolls are then brought back to a lab they're laid out and they count what types of plankton were discovered most the data is centered around England because the study was there but it is global the ship transects have been expanded in there they're expanding this network but some of the changes that they documented are fascinating the one of these species of girl plankton that in the 50s to 80s period was mostly in this region you can see how it's been changing over time that that migration right there is this ocean equivalent of the Sahara and climate moving to Italy and the Italian climate moving to Germany we don't see it it's in the ocean we wouldn't even know about it were it not for these guys dragging around their plankton recorders so that's not been funded locally we really you know what other changes are happening biologically in the ocean that are unobserved so oceans are important ocean observations are reported how do we do it well the most traditional way of observing the ocean is through ships and buoys we've been doing this for quite a while and it's quite difficult this is a more recent picture that buoy technology is evolving quite rapidly and improving greatly the ocean on average is 2 and 1/2 miles deep ships go you know about 25 miles an hour you saw you know ok the scale of things how long does it take to go from Palo Alto here to here the 25 miles an hour it's a it's a considerable effort you're not gonna not only in time but the size of the ship fossil fuel use to get there these are its it's an important activity but it's not an easy one I don't think these guys were going 25 miles an hour sometimes they break free they have to be recovered they have to put back so a lot of effort goes into ocean observations and in no way is what are what we doing at liquid robotics the wave light are going to displace this it these are complementary efforts I'm just trying to give a feel for how it's done and what what what it takes to to take measurements about the ocean satellites of course are where we get most of the the information certainly in terms of the quantity of data about the ocean we've launched 19 satellites than the last decade dedicated to ocean observation they take fantastic images and they measure out a large number of variables sea surface temperature this is wind data sea level and this is ocean color the the biology of the ocean is perhaps the most difficult thing to observe we have we measure a lot of physical factors about the ocean but the biological factors of the ocean are more difficult to observe ocean color is one thing that the satellites can actually provide the biologists yeah it's scatterometer II is that is the name of the technology and I couldn't tell you in detail how that works but Google scatterometer II and and and you'll learn yeah this is a beautiful image of from a satellite and and I bring it up just because if you look at the the complex patterns of mixing here there's actually recent work that's been occurring in Monterey Bay that is aimed at understanding these patterns of mixing and really suggesting that this is not chaos this is just complex it is actually predictable if you have the data and you have the modeling it is actually predictable but it shows sort of the challenge you know satellites only looking at the surface what's happening below you need to in situ measurements to see that but an instant you measurement you know it's very different if you're here versus here how do you know where you are in this in this mix so you need a combination of approaches to understand these phenomena you need both in situation even satellite you need to aggregate that data drifters are another approach that are used for measuring data the Argo program is a it's been a huge success in physical oceanography it's an international effort we've deployed three thousand three hundred and nineteen floats as of July of 2009 all over the world these floats and most the time at depth about two thousand meters below the surface and then they come up and they take a profile of salinity and temperature and depth and transmit that data and then they go back down but they are adrift so that means that you can't let them near shore and they tend to move away from upwellings their position they and then also you he ships to to deploy all of them so a lot of effort gone into this and really invaluable data as to the structure of the ocean in three ninety-two weeks who may sit at the bottom for about two weeks and then come up and so that's really driven by a power you know you'd like to have more data but the they're also battery-operated vehicles and they want to last for about two years recently there's been a lot of innovation in autonomous vehicles a different approach that sometimes we get confused with this partially because of the name see lighter is one of the buoyancy propelled gliders that are out there buoyancy it's a it's a very clever idea it's the the sea glider is was developed at the University of Washington APL the original concept I believe came from Scripps there's a number of organizations that are now making buoyancy propelled gliders their basic concept is that they will glide forward as they sink and then expend an energy when they reach the bottom of the profile and this is the only time that they actually expend energy for propulsion by inflating a bladder now they will rise to the surface and they can collide back up so gliding down and gliding back up they can travel quite a distance with the only minimal expenditure of energy inside this this puts them in a you know they're very different category than what we're doing through the wave ladder they're submarine and we're ship they also are reliant on stored energy generally there is a there is a class of point supercollider that actually extracts energy from thermal gradients so there are energy harvesting it's colder down deep reliably and it's warmer up top reliably so you can extract some of that thermal energy by generally for the payloads they're still reliant on on battery power and their mission duration and the amount of data that they can collect the power limitations are very fundamental and there's other ways here a volunteer observer or I'm not sure he volunteered but he got to take some data I think he's measuring a conductivity and temperature it's actually a very very useful way of getting data in areas that are difficult to get to these guys go to amazing places and they tell us about their lives where they go but they're also gathering physical oceanographic data as well so that's that's a kind of a long introduction but now we now we get to wave letter so what is wave letter and how is it different well what it is is it's a persistent mobile platform it's a surface platform and it's 100% energy harvesting so it harvests energy from the Sun and from the waves and therefore its mission duration is not really limited by its battery stores the the basic principle of the of the wave light or the thrust generation principle is explained in this cartoon as the float is lowered by a wave fins on the glider rotate passively they they are pivoted at the leading edge Springs return them into a neutral position the fluid force on the bottom tilts them up so that the glider now dives forward on as the float is lifted by a passing wave water pushes the wings back down again passively it now thrusts forward on the upstroke so if you just sit here holding the sub portion of a wave glider by its umbilical and pull it up and down it'll try and swim forward all we have to do is steer it so the only actuator in the system not shown in this schematic is a rudder that's at the tail of the glider and that rudder we just have to steer infrequently to keep it going in the direction that we want to have it swim who wait that's right well the fin you can do it a variety of ways actually but the the the glider itself is heavy so if you cut the umbilical it would it would dive forward at a very steep angle well about a 45 degree angle so the fins are actually returned to a neutral position by a spring and you're pushing against the spring yeah expected is that a pretty cool feature there's yes and no there's there's a number there's actually quite a bit of nuance into the wing design and the and the architecture of this vehicle and unfortunately I'm a little bit restricted you know or I want to be a little bit cautious in how much I put out just and because this is a bit of our secret sauce if you will but but I want to get the fundamental principles and I think this this explains that pouring in the ocean as well as the build-up of life which is a common problem yeah so so metal corrosion antifouling these are these are the this is my world is they're really challenging problems and I will talk a little bit more about that coming up what's that yep should extract something that off let me come back to that because I'll because so I actually well let me say first off right now the vehicle has a very clean partition of energy all of the thrust comes from the waves all of the the electricity comes from their solar panels in the early days we never thought we could have actually created something quite so simple we thought surely we would have an axillary thruster well no because there's batteries right so so so yes yeah see yeah so you it's not it's not operating without batteries the batteries buffer that periods not just a night but dark storm periods and and so about I'll come back to that in a little bit more detail let me just talk just a bit more about the thrust principle when you watch a wave move across the surface of the ocean the water itself is moving in approximately and you know this is all nominal and in approximately a circular orbit so if you watch a duck or something floating it'll it'll move in a circular orbit and end up right where it started after the wave passes the diameter of those orbits decreases logarithmically with depth such that when you get to a depth of about one half the wavelength there's nearly zero motion so the basic principle here for energy extraction is we put something where there's a maximum motion we put the other part where there's reduced motion and we can extract energy from that the the length of the umbilical well about seven meters is a good compromise depending on where your operating depending on what the sea state is a different optimal length would be would be there you know the longer the more energy you can harvest but it's also more drag the the genesis that the idea actually came from a quite a different observation if you are a kayaker for example and in Hawaii we're from liquid robotics got started in Hawaii the concept anyway if you're a kayaker in Hawaii and you get an offshore breeze it can be a very dangerous situation the wind will be you'll have the full force of the wind in your chest the surface layers most the energy goes into wave generation but the surface of the water does start moving and you get Whitecaps and even get blown out to sea scuba divers have learned not actually are usually taught that you have to be careful because you can do just ten feet down and a gale will pick up at the surface and you won't even realize it it's just it's that much calmer just a little bit below the surface so the concept was let's put the mass of the system where it's calm and have as little as possible at the surface and keep it pata had a station-keeping buoy and that really is you know a two part vehicle believe me you wouldn't go through the trouble of an umbilical and the snap loads and all the abuse that it's gonna go through if it wasn't a really key part of why the wave glider works so well it's a wave powered vehicle what about when there's no waves so we've had a lot of opportunity and a lot of design effort got into optimizing its performance in calm conditions here's a few pictures of it moving along in calm conditions rough conditions the other end of the spectrum you've got a lot of extra energy difficult to take pictures in rough position so I we've been actually in rougher conditions than this but the challenge there is really not one of efficiency it's one of durability the in this picture you see this is another slide that's actually addressing the same point calm conditions here story about Hurricane Flossie so in August of oh seven Hurricane Flossie was approaching Hawaii we had early earlier prototypes and that in that era than we do now and a lot of the work that we've done and durability hadn't been done at that point we had about four of them out in the ocean and a few days before Hurricane Flossie was going to hit the island we thought it was the governor was you know warning that there's gonna be a state of emergency and looks quite serious so we decided to pull the vehicles out we got two of them out and and we were using a friend's boat because she had a bigger boat than we did it was a 35 foot rig a very capable boat in rough sea States but when we were driving back we were going head-on into gusting winds that were you know 50 knots that boat could flip going over a wave we can flip back so the boat captain was very cautious took us in slow and there's no way we were gonna go back to get those other two vehicles we were done well but we can tell the vehicles what to do so we went into port we had them swim to us so at one knot our prototype wave gliders made their way into these 40 not 50 not gusting winds and they made it the two miles and we went out into the calm harbor and picked em up now something about the way they move into the waves there's this there's this bifurcation you know it's it's calmer down below than it is at top that's one thing there's also just an interesting thing about the cyclicality of the motion so if you're going into a wave on the downstroke the sub tends to dive forward then on the upstroke it tends to hook in and pull the float through the crest of the wave the what the float will actually dive and go through the white-capped like a surfer would break through a breaking wave it's pulling with a tremendous force at that moment so it's so at that moment the energy expenditure from the vehicle might be in the thousands of watts if you were to try and do that with a conventional thruster now then it eases down the back slide but it's automatically repeating this this cycle of pulling the float through these Whitecaps over and over again we don't have any control over it it's all passive and and it's what makes the thing work during the time that we were developing wave glider and actually before it there was a parallel program to develop a similar thing that was funded by DARPA they had slightly different objectives and they had different ways of doing it but some of the approaches that were developed in that program were sail sailing vessels and of course you know for all the remarkable things we say about a hundred percent minor energy harvesting and all that well sail boats have been around for a long time they're the same one hundred percent energy harvesting however when the conditions get rough and you're talking about a small vessel the winds pick up so does the sea state a small sailboat is has to tack to hold station so you're going at high surface speeds in rough conditions and it gets untenable pretty quickly so that so a remarkable thing about the wave lighter we've been able to get it to work in these calm conditions it also works in very rough conditions too so a wide range of conditions that be that is able to operate we you can that's something that you want to moderate actually a little bit so it does have a high buoyancy because that's where it gets its you know the upstroke is from the buoyancy but you'd like it to not necessarily stay on top of that that that Whitecap wave so it will actually you know we adjust these things that it will actually break through the tops of those waves and go under now to this crowd there's nothing remarkable about what we're doing here but satellite communications and we use iridium enable us to stay in touch with the vehicle globally the Internet of course is the other end so wherever we are and wherever the wave butter is we can communicate give it commands the user interface is a very early version of the web-based user interface it's actually layered on top of a NOAA map here it's showing two vehicles going around a course so we can create a waypoint these we call them bread crumbs or the position reports of the vehicle in this case I think they work two minutes apart parallel courses like this or useful actually way for us to evaluate the vehicles when we make changes to them this is a little bit a little bit corny I admit but it was a card that holiday card that we sent out last year not skywriting ocean writing I suppose the font size here is a quarter mile this is four different vehicles this one the you had four waypoints and it just repeated that so we layered these bread crumbs on top each other the green one we actually had to set up multiple courses to try to get a bushy wreath here but I guess you know the point of it is you think that wave motion its directional that these things would be getting pushed around that they be surfboards they're not we can we can control them quite precisely the the float is where is the primary space for payloads you can put payloads on the on the sub you can tow things but the primary space where most people want to put their payload is in the float so our float is designed with hollow chambers underneath the solar panels these hollow chambers are our boxes so liquid robotics will provide standard boxes that are waterproof that they have the waterproof connectors already done we have pressure monitoring leak monitoring humidity and temperature and a standard interface so that people can develop payloads to go inside of the box alternatively you can just have the space and pack away the center space is occupied by the core electronics module it has iridium GPS in this bubble also lights and xp for wireless so we can program it yeah computer on a boat without paying for the satellite and also waiting for the it delays we have lithium ion batteries earlier versions actually used LED acid batteries for ballast down on the sub but we elected to go with lithium ion batteries and move it up closer to the actually the source of power this would be the solar panels and where the primary drains are the payloads yes yes this is probably okay that's a good segue d live long like six months later shows an example yeah good segue let me get to that um so this this is a pot of available solar energy this is an re L data this is solar energy kilowatt hours per meter squared per day on a horizontal flat surface considering weather effects let's say you're in Seattle in June you have five point six kilowatt hours per day per meter January you have one so let's take that to January in Seattle there's a conversion of units here I apologize for this is what hours per meter so divided by a thousand so one kilowatt hour here go down this column we have two nominally forty three watt solar panels the panels that were using are twelve percent efficient so there's better technologies available now we wanted to go with the proven cots panel this one's designed for buoys it's waterproof it's very durable and so that's that's that's a starting point but one way of getting more energy here is you know there's solar panels that are probably twice as efficient or more so that gives you an eighty six nameplate 86 watt nameplate rating you it count for a number of things aging obscura salt slime and you get down to let's see we're on this column two watts average continuous power available for everything the core system as it is right now uses about 0.7 watts when it's in full core so we're using satellite using the Iridium quite frequently and we're using the rudder as much as we need to that's the core system that moves you a 1.4 watt available power budget for your payload in Seattle in January this says theoretical it's this is an old slide we actually have quite a bit of data now to validate this and we need to update this slide but this ended up being a pretty accurate estimate of the reality so that means you know it's not a ton of power obviously but there's still a lot that you can do with 1.4 watts average continuous you're storing a 650 watt hour set of seven lithium ion batteries so you can you know run that down during peak periods and then charge it up if you have payloads that'd be much more than that you can also think about doing two vehicles and do a round-robin it's a cycle one through and then do another one yes or does that include the percentage of time the panels are covered during the dialectic wait yeah so there's a it's a fudge factor because it depends a little bit on conditions so this was a and a engineering estimate about a budget and but and that was you know considered if it's going to be underwater certain amount of time fortunately the panel's fouling on the panels has in our testing has not proven to be a big problem the and that has to do with a position replacement and and they're doing but they were doing quite low on that yeah that's right that's not a significant portion of the time generally that's that's really we're just going to do that during the peaks of the waves and and when that's happening that's often very bad weather so it's cloudy anyway and yeah yeah so actually I'll do this in a slightly different order than they got the slides that this is not not not my chart is it's borrowed from mr. Rajiv here but this is an interesting chart to your point earlier about high latitudes and and winter the interesting thing here is that if you look by month Sun and wind are reciprocals now waves and wind correlate very very well so Sun and waves will be nearly a reciprocal in June you got a lot of Sun not much wind and in December you got a lot of women not much Sun also by latitude high latitudes not much Sun a lot of wind low latitudes not much wind a lot of Sun wouldn't it be nice to have a system that uses wind and waves and or or excuse me wind and waves and Sun the amount of wave energy that's available this is for a 45-pound vehicle that's actually about half the size of what we typically make them but if you're in six second waves one meter wave height you've got about 45 watts that's available for extraction some of that's going into thrust but there's there's left over there that we could be converting into electrical energy and so that's the development project that is is in the roadmap to take some of the wave energy and also turn that into electricity because that would really greatly expand the operational ability in high latitudes and wintertime yeah sort of efficiency of the total energy available in so that's not an easy question to answer actually and and we're doing quite a bit of analysis right now to get to an efficiency number so I'd rather not not put a number out there but it's it's it's you're not the first person to ask but it's not an easy one for us to answer actually it's well I think we're more efficient than solar panels actually so I'll say that yeah a little attitudes summertime with the amount of with the emergency temperatures that you get what's the highest temperature that your lithium ion batteries experience ambient so in the ocean that's generally not a problem the the because we're we and we contracted the dry box out of aluminum that's not you know you'd like it to be plastic from a fouling point of view but we decided to deal with the potential galvanic corrosion but use aluminum because of its thermal conductivity so the the dry box is soaked in water so if you're in a tropical climates you know where the waters 90 degrees maybe you'd have some some issue there but that really that doesn't appear to be a factor where that is a factor is yeah right right and so we're we have to be careful is on the deck of the ship and it's storage and I don't have the numbers and then off the top of my head but that is that is definitely a relevant ninety by the way is heading up there Thanks that's into the problem digit percentage loss per years okay yeah well and and honestly when in the present design of the vehicle now the the longevity of all these factors are things that the engineering is ongoing in this new you know it continuous improvement process but the lithium-ion battery will always be a limiter on the on the useful life of the vehicle it's not a black-and-white thing they degrade gradually but but if you want to have a vehicle out for five years lithium-ion batteries may not be the the best technology presently so III guess that's all I have in this presentation on on you know waves and and Sun energy and the energy budget of the system just a quick recap before I talk about some of the development history and the applications so I think I made all of these points I guess the main thing is if you're harvesting energy now even if it's a it's not very fast your mission since the longevity doesn't have a hard limit your distance also doesn't so you can travel a long distance to an area of operation so instead of taking a ship there you can drop it off from a port or from a boat somewhere else and have it travel to the area of operation likewise you have a sensor failure you can have the vehicle come back for repair so this is where to be off the cost benefit really comes into play is that the you're eliminating the need for a ship to transit to a distant area so it really enables operations in wide parts of the ocean that really may not have been economically feasible in the past at this point I would say it's real we've been working I've been working on this since 2005 our existing test fleet has traveled about 42,000 nautical miles the longest mission 6,200 nautical miles and and it's separate mission over ten months we haven't completed the design so that you can actually kick the thing out of the back of an airplane but there's no fundamental reason why that couldn't be done well so the an integration that we're in the process of right now is a is so container ships will be broadcasting their position via the automatic identification system it's a transceiver system that all ships internationally carry United States is actually you know behind the rest of the world in the implementation of a is it's implemented on very small craft worldwide and it's it was the essence of it is for collision avoidance it's a line of sight system so you can't you can't easily get the data via satellite you have to be within the line of sight but they're broadcasting their their position and where they're going the Waverider can receive that and will be able to try and get out of their way and if we hit a container ship the contendership won't notice but uh yeah we will and although it would be it you know it's not a test we've done but it wouldn't be too surprised if the bow wave just didn't push us out of the way lou the ship that of a container ship size so I thought this being Stanford it might be interesting to talk a little about the development history with an audience of undoubtedly entrepreneurs and inventors liquid robotics we have our tests and operations facility in Hawaii we have our headquarters is here in Palo Alto it was born in Hawaii through the work of the Jupiter Research Foundation Jupiter Research Foundation is a very small nonprofit group that got interested in listening to whales in Hawaii you you got so Hawaii actually coming up the whales will be arriving soon it's the the winter months in Hawaii snorkel dive down you'll hear the the song of the whales and it can be quite mesmerizing you have to remember to come back up and take a breath Jupiter foundation was interested in transmitting the whale sound life out over the Internet and so this is one of their early buoys it's got a solar panel it's got a radio VHF radio transmitter transmits up to a repeater on the hill and that goes out on the Internet close to shore you hear waves breaking and you hear this sound that sounds like frying bacon which is actually snapping shrimp so you need to get away from shore it ends up that and now putting a move or buoy away from shore is more complicated than you might think so the Jupiter guys started thinking about is there an easier way of doing this because we have a remote-controlled boat that we would drive out with our hydrophone and then we drive it back but our budget really just didn't add up so what about solar panels on the remote-control boat well then what about when it's dark at night and when it's it's windy the solar panels become a liability so they were thinking of ways of doing a station keeping whale listening hydrophone I got involved I heard they Joe who's the head of Jupiter foundation contacted my father they're old friends and and who's a my father was also a mechanical engineer the group of us started brainstorming and we came up with all of these ideas this is one of the early models that I built a flapping wing device this is a see if that's a little video clip with an early test apparatus that I built in this video there's a sliding rail here with a motor and a crank arm on it this is free to slide and let's see here so the energy input is through this little gear motor driving the crank replicating wave motion the thrust is coming from this guy down below which pulls it along and it's you know as you can see it's remarkably even pace this little prototype with a styrofoam float was operable in a swimming pool and and that was really you know kind of one of the the lightbulb motion moments was when I brought this prototype over to Joe's swimming pool and we we had to swim around and I I brought a bucket so that I could make waves and so I sat on the edge and made waves nobody hit the side of the pool and then I'd run around and directed to swim back and Joe had the idea of if I bent this little flap at the back it might do circles and then I wouldn't have to run across the pool every time so he did that and then I stopped making waves when we were all talking about what we just saw and what we might do with this concept and about 20 minutes later we looked over and just from the wind ripple on waves on the pool it was still swimming around in circles and so it was a you know we knew at that point that we wanted to scale it up and getting its trust from the thing below that exactly exactly so there's nothing pulling it along other than this vehicle Templar exactly we have we have good strong IP on yeah and it's there's a I don't have much in this presentation about our IP strategy but yes feel enough that we that were okay to reveal this we we have a little bit I haven't myself but about different people in the company of here I to lose well garage yeah yeah wave motion and they decided to go with the sale yeah a little sure yeah now we're definitely not the only ones interested in Thomas yes no yeah we're talking to a large number of people yes and and we have you know we're a little bit beyond the the concept Stasia I'm going back in time but we have revenues and and customers and all of that so this is an early prototype it was a biomimetic in inspiration bundled up and ready to launch here from sure one of the concept from sort of the size of the vehicle is we'd like that it be something that a couple people can handle another an early prototype one of the early prototypes this literally was a surfboard with the dry box in Hawaii one of our and one of the reasons why we stayed with operations in Hawaii is that you know year-round you can do tests and and you can do rapid iteration one of our techniques in this case this is a Shore launch so launched off the beach swimmer guided out past the coral reef then swims to a station where at hold station for a little while then we had to go around a square horse another vehicle that was nearby we had go around the same course so that we could race them so one of the techniques for improving the performance of the vehicles is is just that have two vehicles that you think are identical and race them see if they are identical then they change and really get to real world truth on the validity of the design changes we started showing selected customers in 2007 and the capability of the concept this was one of the vehicles that we did a demonstration on demonstration was in December and we decided just to leave it out pretty soon it had some friends this was kind of remarkable because these are these are full-sized three or four inch long gooseneck barnacles and there really wasn't anything else there but they they they latched on and they grew to full size very quickly what happens at a given time it's unpredictable it just depends on what organisms are in the neighborhood and what the conditions are like so the next year or something different might happen on the same very same vehicle we made no attempt to curtail this by the way this was just these this was ordinary paint no effort to to have anti felling that's right yeah it's well I mean of course yeah I you know III don't know how they find their way around the because you know how do they yeah how do they find the Waverider to latch on there I think there's just a lot of the the spore if you will out there but there's actually I don't I don't think I have the picture in here but there's a vicious-looking creature it looks just like a centipede that eats these things and it has to somehow find the thing that the the they're all attached on and then make us home there and when we took this thing out the one thing in Hawaii that is a little scary aren't the centipedes though that'll really get you and so we took off the solar panel and there was this sort of water centipede and it's a it was a fire worm that eats the gooseneck barnacles but the it's it's it is pretty I'm not a biologist but it is very interesting watching the biology around these things good news here solar panels you can see some salt scum that'll get washed off the next time it's wavy at but the fouling really wasn't developing on the panels and that's different organism this sponge came a little bit later and you jump in and there's always you know a different group of fish that were swimming around it sometimes you'd see some of the same ones you'd seen before but it became they do become that's fish aggregation devices and so the fishermen do use them and that's just the way it is the good news is oh so we had set ourselves a target of 120 days and this was when it passed it the good news is even in covered like this who was still operating so I was still able to hold station is definitely slower than it was without all the barnacles but it was still able to operate and the other good news is that there are antifouling treatments that will dramatically slow the growth here in Hawaii in this particular area in this environment is a high growth area so other areas particularly when you get farther away from shore they will be less biologically rich less of a bio fouling problem yeah so you could sail for a while in the temperate waters sure yeah yeah you yeah if we could yeah yeah that's right you know although our one firewoman I think we'd have to fire him because there were a lot of particles still on there and he was not fat enough I think we needed a few more of them that's right so we've we've got a lot of activities going on some of them are our you know customer related and I and I won't go into those too much but I'd like to tell you a little bit about the story of our favorite engineering system right now well we like all our children but red flash has certainly been one of the more successful engineering systems that we have the first big sort of letting them out of our test area mission that we did was the circumnavigation of the Big Island of Hawaii this is 343 nautical miles red flash took about nine days to make that voyage and quite rough seas in this area one thing about this area so this is where our shop is in Kauai hi but one thing that's great about this area for testing what a way powered vehicle I mentioned the fact that year-round we can get out there but also the prevailing conditions from the Northeast means that these side this side of the islands are quite cliffy and jagged and there's often very rough sea States the channel between the Big Island and Maui is legendarily rough is not a good place to take a small craft so we have this very rough water available to us to test in in this little Bay here it's on the lee side and it's often very very cold so you you have a wide range of conditions to test and operate in so the owner of one of these things out yeah there's not a lot of there's a law about autonomous ocean vehicles and so there aren't there aren't many legal precedents and there are responsibilities to be responsible in in this case we were in international waters and so there aren't a lot of you know certainly not local regulations but there are the international rules of the sea so that's but that's a there's a there are there's definitely work being done to get the legal precedent but when we first talked to the Coast Guard about what we are doing in Hawaii we actually we talked to a number of agencies about you know 12 different agencies about what we were doing and you know could would they permit us to do it and the Coast Guard was welcome you know they don't have a classwork it's it's it's not a you know we got instructions at first that would they would like to have a 15 Candela white with the you know you know universal coverage 7 degrade respectfully and we built this light but then it was always somebody else the Coast Guard realized no no that that would mean that you are a vessel and there might be a person on a vessel you're not a vessel there's no person on this so I know maybe you're closer to marine debris well we don't like that either we don't really like that either because marine debris is so there isn't really a class for small autonomous vehicle that's in the collision regulations right now so that is a an open open issue tip over a kayak was it to you well that's part of the that's part of our thinking is just keep it small and and then it's then it's less of an issue if you yet if you get really big then it's more of a collision threat that's right for and that was ultimately where the Coast Guard in Hawaii came was they wanted us to keep it in a certain area so they could put out notice to Mariners they wanted us to to do to her from things and this was all two years ago and we've been following the guidelines and without an incident but it's you know potentially could be you know it's it's it's tough to say it's it's for most vessels running into something like this it would not be innocent and there's certainly things floating around in the ocean of a similar size that that you should be careful about if you're a mariner yeah plastic well so I don't have it in this deck but we did send a couple vehicles from Hawaii to California recently and so from Hawaii California go straight through the Garbage Patch and we didn't get tanked well right we didn't you know this is a vehicle test so we didn't have cameras regretting that they did document the garbage batching that you take off the solar panels and there were bottle caps and little piece of debris there but when they made it to San Diego and we pulled them out it was a it was definitely a beautiful moment I mean we've been working very hard for for a long time to try and make something that is capable of doing something like that I in and swam with it and they looked totally pristine just you know ready to turn around and go back so that was beautiful also they were enveloped with a school of anchovy so I was swimming around with these this is shiny cloud of fish all around and it was a moment of revelry underwater that's right well they started to swim around me and then I realized all right I started to think what eats anchovies and I got out I think you know nothing too bad e-sign Jovi's but I didn't want to that's right well more news coming on that hey I want to announce right now but we are definitely looking at some grander challenges so speed over grand yeah so that's actually an interesting thing is that speed over ground is readily available from GPS but speed through water is a little bit more complicated yeah so we do have water speed sensors on more recent vehicles actually all all on red flash and actually the difference between speed through the water and speed over ground is an interesting piece of oceanographic data right there the inference is about the currents so also you can turn it into a drifter by just doing circles I'm gonna I think that we may hit the bottom over time so I'm gonna skip through this a little bit we we did some testing with red flash in Monterey Bay in April of this year Monterey Bay is perhaps the best instrumented piece of ocean on the planet and that's we have scripts in Southern California we have embarked and the Monterey Bay Area Research Institute that are doing extensive studies in Monterey Bay so we wanted to do some testing there to calibrate our instrumentation we operated near the embody my nan dem two buoys these are state-of-the-art data buoys with state-of-the-art weather stations that we we thought we could trust to to calibrate ours so we operated near the buoys for a little while and then moved on one of the things that maybe is a little counterintuitive about the wave glider versus a buoy is that okay so we don't have a way of stopping the vehicle is always moving forward to station keep the algorithm is you know swim and then swim towards the target and just do that again and do that again and do that again again so it doesn't need to be anything more complicated in that we end up keeping station this is a conservative case 50 meter radius so 50 meter radius that may not seem like that small of an area but on the ocean scales that really is if you look at what data buoy does this is the 1.75 or 1.7 kilometer watch circle for the M 2 buoy now there isn't really a reason for to reduce the scope of that and they're all ways of mooring of buoys so that it is it is more precise in this case it's not important the value of it so this is our 50 meter radius relative to the 1.7 kilometer the value of that will be in cases where we you do there are cases where you want careful positioning and one of them is where you're acoustically communicating something down below you know I forget I think it's about fifteen hundred meters but I forget an actual physical contact rendezvous possibly yeah possibly definitely we after we calibrated the sense where we sent the vehicle down south we plotted of course went down to the border with Mexico and then went in for an inspection one of the you know one of the other questions is you know this is collision vandalism what will people do to this piece of equipment that's out in the ocean we knew where red flash was we picked a part of the ocean nose out in international waters where there wasn't a lot of activity where was going to be out of the way and then we went out and did our inspection turns out that you know the middle of nowhere is a place that a lot of people would like to go and and so we were in the middle of nowhere and so would so was somebody else we saw where our vehicle was we saw a boat we saw a water spray and I thought whales were used to whales and then we saw something that looked like the Bellagio fountains going up I saw a blue thing in the water we saw our red thing in the water red flash we weren't sure what was going on the boat then turned to us and we saw the machine gun on the front of it they were loitering towards us we didn't know what they were they got a little bit closer we saw it was Coast Guard they were doing you know firing practice in a safe out-of-the-way area and was that well so they didn't shoot us I appreciate their restraint in that because it must have been tempting they did not shoot red flash and they said is that your red thing we we coyly said yeah and they said well we tried to move it and they picked it up and they dragged it away and then we went back to the but of course we have told it to safe position so they were they were just sort of ignoring it and I think I don't know I don't know what they do I think they practice missing you know they're not actually trying to hit the target because I would destroy it but they're just I don't know but we picked it up and we moved it away and we relaunched it and it swam back up they didn't know that you know I think they were ready to go back and shoot some more looked like fun that's what they trained the seals yeah we yeah we were I mean we I would say how close I don't know 15 20 miles but yeah yeah we did yeah yeah so yeah so we've more recently we took red flash back in we upgraded we gave it the water speed sensor and we upgraded the firmware with some things that keep in mind this is an engineering vehicle so we're still making design changes on this particular one and we relaunched it the kqed dove a new story on the California report here about about it and then we had it head north this time another ocean observation technique HF radar gives you some very interesting information about surface currents there's a mesoscale Eddy off Mendocino which at this time was very pronounced so we saw that in the HF radar and decided to use it to our advantage and wrote up the that side of it and shot through this area quite quickly the we made it to the - you know the north edge of the United States and we decided that we would keep on going and start getting some information about some higher latitudes we did go all the way up to the Alaska border or this is a offshore but what would be the equivalent of Alaska border offshore and a storm came in a pretty significant storm this is where red flash was during the storm on September 23rd wind gusts were well what do we have here 82 miles an hour gusts steady winds 60 miles an hour 22 foot or seven meter waves keep in mind that's about the length of the umbilical so very significant conditions in that and the great news was it's it was holding station and and doing exactly what we talked to Haven in those conditions the we have had events with red flash along this mission and we have had and had some interesting repairs in this case the weather station was zapped with a atmospheric ESD I guess that's lightning low calorie lightning I think the there has we have made some manufacturers actually made some modifications to the sensor to improve the shielding and grounding so that it would resist a similar event in the future but we swapped out the the weather sensor and relaunched it it had actually just before our recovery it actually picked up some kelp it's not the first time that happens it slows it down these kelp patties are out there and but it generally sheds the kelp within hours or or you know a day or so and then this was a repair that we did up at the north end of its trip in Graham Island these boaters tend to like to leave in the middle of the night so do things in the early morning I'll just just quickly go through some of the things that we're working on right now I spoke about Gateway applications briefly before the electromagnetic energy really doesn't propagate in salt water or any meaningful distance for our ocean observation purposes so while GPS and satellites and and cameras and everything worked great on the surface below the surface you have to think of alternative way of communicating acoustics on the other hand the speed of sound is five times faster under water than it is through air and acoustics become a good way of communicating so the Waverider positioned at the surface is a great link between the acoustic undersea world and the electromagnetic above sea world the tsunami warning system the dart tsunami warning system the deep area deep area reporting and assessment of tsunamis tsunami starting with the teeth is what the acronym stands for the dart system has the the key piece of or maybe the most specialized piece of technology is the bottom pressure recorder this is a very sensitive pressure sensor that will measure the height of the water column within centimeter accuracy it likes to be in deep parts of the ocean so it might be four miles below the surface it's looking for a particular frequency low amplitude wave that is a tsunami now it knows that there's a tsunami is four miles below the surface the water may be 100 miles off the coast how does it tell anybody so the logistical challenge of this system is to get that message out running a cable would be one way the way that this system is designed is that there is a buoy at the surface you could run a cable up that up to that buoy but that actually would be a lot more difficult than running the acoustic modem because the these things are not going to be exactly the same spot you want them anchor to different spots so that when you account for currents the the buoy is relatively close to being above the the bottom pressure recorder the the really you know the ongoing maintenance cost the system and this system has been tremendously successful it was launched very rapidly in response to the Indonesian tsunami and deployed around the world the key thing about tsunami warning system is actually really avoiding false alarms so that you know when there's not a tsunami coming and in the system has been quite successful with that but wave fighters are we're working with SAIC and and the national data buoy center and actually this is a marine environment who is the original route that deployed the dart system on having the Waverider be a backup to the already deployed service two systems so if one goes down you can have a wave glider go out there and do the same function so we did a demonstration or earlier this spring and we're continuing on that that paths that we'll have wave letters as a backup acoustics generally are a you know it's a great acoustic observation platform Marine Mammal researchers whale researchers are you know very excited about the possibilities of wave glider we're working with Scripps with our high frequency acoustic record over there Harper recorder to integrate that on a wave ladder and make acoustic measurements for marine mammals is that could keep up to the way right co2 I mentioned co2 earlier the we're working now with a Pacific Marine Environmental lab again up in Seattle I know as a environmental lab to provide a co2 measurement system using technology that they've developed for ships initially than buoys now being miniaturized even farther to go on a wave letter so this measures the partial pressure of co2 in the air and actually the same sensor measures the partial pressure of co2 in the water by equilibrating air with with the water and then running it through the same sensor it carries calibrated tanks of air to recalibrate that sensor and it has other sensors to to validate that information so it's a way of measuring or inferring the co2 flux how much co2 is going into the ocean or coming out of the ocean at a given spot the fact that it's a mobile platform means that now you can have this you have large numbers and the cost-effectively and you can reposition them potentially in response to observations made from satellites or other systems so to observe a particular phenomenon so we're really excited about the future of that program this is shown some of the other sensors that are relevant to to that measurement I mentioned and I should say I mentioned the you know the biology of the ocean being you know relatively difficult to observe co2 is one physical variable co2 and oxygen or one physical variable that relate very strongly to the biological activity and so that this is it was not a direct biological observation it is a useful one for understanding the biology of the ocean yeah is it when I ask you to make a version that was monitored methane we we've yeah no and I actually actually you know the reason why I'm doing this this talk and we're doing this type of exposure is exactly that that type of question it's you know liquid robotics is an engineering company we're not a we're not a science company we're not really an oceanographic company we're an engineering company working on a new apparatus and so really the it's it's if measuring methane is is of interest we need to find the right group of people and get them together to work on a payload to do that but I think that that would be a very interesting one and not to my knowledge do we have anything actively working in that area seems to be rising in methane clathrate prospecting right that's right so and hydrocarbons certainly as well just that yeah yeah yeah every good significant reports I've nothing concentrations in high latitudes right because the warming of the Lord seek death maturity which really should right yes so we we have there's talk about a you know mass spectrometer type system for for measuring chemical constituents and and other methods of hydrocarbon measurement but at this point I don't believe we have an active project but I will say our our business development crew has enough conversations going on with enough people who are interested in doing various tests that I am not cognizant of all over myself that's hard tonight to keep up this is one future topic profile current profiler integration and that we just did recently this was you know just a quick hack to but I included just to show you know so we've got these payload boxes but you've also just got you know it's a float the float has you know it doesn't have any moving parts it's you can change the shape of it you can do a lot with it in this case we drove around a square box or a little while running the ADCP and this is some of the average to data the main the cyclicality that you see here is actually the vehicle going in different directions on the lengths of the box if you take that out of it by I you know through the GPS then you start to see what the actual structure of the currents are below the surface in this case we ran it again in in a shallower area so that we could actually track the bottom so the ADCP has the ability to measure the movement of the bottom as well as the water in between the itself and the in the bottom and smooth and compensated for the vehicles motion and you start to see some actually very interesting current profiles here at a depth of 30 meters the water is actually moving the opposite direction of what it's doing at minus 10 meters a service current measurement wouldn't have seen that so a DCPS are a really interesting technology for getting three-dimensional structure of currents full of the surface and and the Waverider is going to be a great platform for a DCPS taking a tcp add weather station potentially and other sensors and you've got a integrated meteorological oceanographic sensor platform utility can turn back now seven feet yeah that of 20 goes the other way well we're just doing the rubber to get the other way yeah what is the speed of light so the I'll say that our focus has been on durability after you get to a certain speed where you can navigate around then durability is key having said that and it may not sound like a lot to people who drive cars but one and a half knots is a typical speed for a wave lighter right now and that's actually considerable compared to other types of autonomous vehicles so it's a very useful speed and it gives you a wide range of operation given the the fact that ocean currents are you know generally less than a quarter or not there's obviously areas where they're quite a bit more than that and then you have to think about how you're going to navigate the vehicle and that's a little bit more than we can probably go into now I think I'll just kind of recap battery life right now is the main limiter for autonomous vehicles in the ocean in historically they've really been you know there's a lot of a lot of different work and applications for autonomous underwater vehicles particularly but they're generally relegated to newer ship or near shore operations so getting the energy harvesting gives you a way of getting an autonomous vehicle in remote areas for long distances and the wave riders got continuous communications because it's a surface vehicle and the operational area is most of the planet and so this really represents a fundamentally new capability and fundamentally new sensing applications so we are at a point now where we've matured the platform enough that it's it's time to be interacting with the various oceanographic groups and in scientific community to find what the right most meaningful Niram applications are we've got a strong set of them that I've presented to you here and there's more that I don't have time to but we're really interested in soliciting others who are interested in doing research for this platform so that say thank you for more please visit us at stanford.edu", "QCkWMbOrJNw": "hello everyone and welcome to the prosper series my name is Adriana and I supports ello community and I will be your host today so it's so special to have everyone gathered here in this one virtual space and so to begin I would love for everyone to share in the chat where they are tuning in from so go ahead and share your city or in country and we can start to have a sense of who's in our virtual room awesome so Cheyenne from Philadelphia welcome and yes Vanessa is from San Francisco I'm here in El Cerrito California so right outside of San Francisco Toronto Mexico awesome love the Toronto contingent Geneva

Brazil awesome an Oakland wonderful and even Malta I love the international flavor that we have today awesome so welcome everyone please continue to share in the chat also comments along the way we will be monitoring the chat during during this session welcome Wade from Vancouver so the purpose of the prosper series is to envision id8 and create a new beautiful world together and today we'll be doing that through a workshop and discovering your unique purpose by Vanessa Slavic she'll be leading us through this so thank you so much Vanessa for sharing your gifts with us today and before we dive in to that I want to give a little background of how prosper came to be so prosper was originally designed to be an in-person experience of a weekend retreat and this is us at our first prosper experience in the woods of Mendocino California this past fall so with nature as our backdrop we gathered together as developers designers dreamers and doers around the question what if money were beautiful so we had sessions with thought leaders around the future of blockchain and economics and financial inclusion as well as community led sessions and here we have a design sprint on privacy at night we gathered around the bonfire and made s'mores and even had some campfire songs which was great to share music together and during the day we also had activities of smaller discussion groups hiking and yoga and there were even some farm animals which added some extra fun and connection to nature during our weekend so what I think was most beautiful about this inaugural prosper event is that it gave us all some space to think about what prosperity means to us and the specific things that we want to do our intentions and commitments for making that vision a reality and so at the culmination of our retreat we gathered together in a circle to share that and proclaim it for ourselves and others and so given the great response from this initial retreat and the beauty and the magic that was created and just getting started we decided to do another one that we were planning in June here in Peru of course because of the state of world events with Kovac we decided to bring prosper online and so now we're here gathering at the prosper series and so instead of having a full weekend packed with content we're taking bite-sized chunks that we're going to share regularly through a series and so before I kick it off to Vanessa to start today's program on discovering your unique purpose I want to invite you all to join me in a short meditation to bring us into presence to prepare for our workshop today so if you feel comfortable I invite you to gently close your eyes and begin to take a few deep breaths and feeling where your body is touching the seat below you and it's possible that you have a lot of feelings right now of excitement curiosity and just noticing that and with your intention and focus deepening the breath taking a few deep breaths here noticing what you feel in your body and once you settle into your seat bringing your awareness gently to your heart space in the words of Charles Eisenstein how beautiful can life be we hardly dare imagine it and so I invite you now together as this group virtually even though we're separated through time and space here we're all connected and gathered in this moment so I invite you to imagine just how beautiful life can be in your heart just allowing the images the feelings the sensations to blossom as you continue to breathe allowing this image to come alive just noticing what that looks like for you and your part in it and after your next breath gently opening up the eyes and coming back into the room and so today as a first step towards that beautiful vision we're going to move into a workshop that Vanessa will guide us through and discovering your unique purpose and so please welcome me in welcoming Vanessa up to the stage as I call her forward and if you have any specific images or visions from that meditation you're welcome to include them in the chat so hi Vanessa good morning good afternoon good evening welcome how's everyone doing today you can't respond to me or some perfect I'm gonna share my screen so one prepping for the workshop today if you have some sort of paper or some sort of device to write with there is going to be an activity section of it and ideally it's pages that you can or like index cards or post-it there's something that you can kind of spread out and look up at them holistically and thank sort of just get that ready for a section in a little bit and with that I'm going to share my screen so hopefully everyone's here today to just kind of explore unique purpose and what it means for them and let me make that the big thing hold on can you see is the projection let me actually I drown it yes okay this is this is my presenter window the big part of the screen so it just needs to go into present mode perfect okay that's reasonable let me focused yeah so that's good fantastic yeah okay great well let's do it today we're talking about unique purpose and this is something very near and dear both to my heart which I'll tell you a little bit of story about and then also to Solo in the cellar community so I'm a partner at Z labs have been working on solo for a couple of years and my passion is really like kind of merging of design and diversity and inclusion so how do we create more access for people around the world today we're gonna talk a little bit about my story because I think it helps kind of show what the journey of a purpose could be although there are many and then it's at the container for what we're talking about today we're gonna do a little bit of like right-brain creative exploration which we did a little practice of this a few days ago and the team struggled to kind of channel that energy so I think it'll be a fun activity for all of us but then we'll move into what more people are comfortable with which is more than analytical side of things and then talk about what does this kind of future look like and we can do some Q&A and then Audrianna is going to back up the session and invite people to zoom who feel like sharing and after um okay so first so today is containers so I think most of you are familiar with solo and the mission but it's really about building a financial system that creates the conditions of prosperity for everyone and I wanted to kind of explain a little bit more about what prosperity means and the way that the solid community defines it is along three verticals so first basic needs are fulfilled and things like shelter health food growing along your own unique path so kind of understanding your journey and then having the ability to actually follow that and last but not least actually helping one aid one another this is where like community and connectedness come it comes into play and today we're really focusing on this second piece of growing along your unique path and hopefully this is a resource to help you think about that journey for yourself there are two core values in the solo community which are unique purpose and connectedness and we fundamentally believe that every single person on this universe has a unique purpose and that in order to prosper and be fulfilled they have to be able to kind of follow that path and that journey and so I'm gonna take a look about my journey and my story in relation to prosperity and kind of growing along my unique path and when I was at a polenta sieve jobs gave way it's really resonated with me is that you connect the dots looking backward but not for it and so it might be hard to kind of see where your career is going or kind of what these different pathways are but actually looking back it all makes sense and that's very much the case to me and just something to think about you know we're like quite big fans of Charles's work but this question this quote really doesn't make me itch which is how do you change the world you change the story and so we're all kind of mapping our own stories and our own journeys in this big evolution and how do we change both the bigger narrative but also the narrative within ourselves and so I've been thinking a lot about purpose in the context of the purpose of like Maya kind of like inner purpose but then how do I share that purpose externally and I think it's really interesting to look at that look at that both and like any kind of branding experiment right you want them to actually be equal so the inner to match the outer I kind of inside of your company to match the representation that you put out in the world and so like what is your story and kind of how are you showing up and how did that match kind of your inner inner map and so this is actually a slide that I presented when I was interviewing to work at Z labs working on solo so I thought it'd be fun to bring it back from the archives but it was how I kind of introduced my background and to where kind of I am today and there's like a few key threads so I worked a square for a while I worked at Apple before that got that was where I got really into diversity inclusion work and just like how could text like help scale like a more beautiful world to use the terminology we use and and then also there's this thread of always going back to like design in art so I did it in high school it was my original major in college but then I switched to marketing was still minored in it and then at every pivot in my career I was like maybe I should go back to grad school and like study design and then finally what I left square I did which is where these two lines intersect and that's where it kind of became really clear for me that I was really the design for equity and how do I kind of bring those things together and so part and part of what we did in grad school that kind of leaving was right a point of view statement and so my point of view from grad school is on the left and so this is kind of what I take after is like okay this is like that outer kind of story this is what I this is the type of work I want to be doing and then on the right here is a screenshot from solid org our about page where we have kind of everyone's purpose actually as part of their profile and so hopefully you can see some synergy between like this intention that I put out there and then the kind of role that I embody within the sella community um I told I guess part of the reason I'm doing this workshop is also talking about like career transitions I know like there's a lot of uncertainty about like an unemployment like transitions like people and I think this is a really great opportunity to explore like different pathways that might have been not possible before sometimes like constraint really does breed creativity and so um if somebody lost their job or kind of in transition it's also a great way to kind of look for alternative pathways or alternative careers and so when I was leaving grad school I was working with the UN consulting didn't love like remote work and really wanted to like find a team to work with and so I started doing this like exploration period and and I did something which I'm calling energy mapping which is basically I had this big it's actually on the wall behind me right here but this big canvas on my wall and then in blue is everything that I was like exploring as a career or like something that like I wanted to kind of go deeper on and then I looked at the people the companies and like the projects that I knew in that space and then every week as I was having conversations might continue exploring the like post-its would move and very clearly and I think probably because of my background like a lot of energy went into like finance and blockchain inclusion and you're probably wondering more like where's Stella on this thing but because you didn't know Stella's original name was actually Jem and so this is something that I was exploring at the time which is way internet but so this was kind of how I helped navigate this kind of inner and outer period of like once I had my point of view and kind of what I wanted to do I kind of then explored opportunities that that would kind of manifest that lastly in like my own kind of outer purpose journey I had a checklist so that I could and be unbiased in my search and so as I was kind of exploring opportunities I like compared it against my checklist and so so that ended up satisfying everything and so it ended up being kind of a great project for me to work on that really lied to my purpose and so this was like not long after joining we did a research ship to Kenya and really exploring how this technology could help benefit communities around the world and that's a lot of the work that I'm really passionate about that I get to contribute to Tello scenario that's a little bit about my purpose and expiration so hopefully it maybe inspire Z or it just gives you kind of more context why I'm here today so now we get into the fun kind of creative expiration period and I do want to kind of caveat that if you came here today assuming that you were gonna like wrap up in an hour and understand what your unique purpose is it's probably not gonna happen in an hour but I'm hoping that we can start exploring this and I'm just kind of sharing some tools to get you thinking about what this could be for you and I think it's always evolving so it's just a nice practice to kind of get started and so if you have your papers ready I can't actually see what's going on so hopefully everyone has a paper and some sort of pen I'm gonna draw with you but basically I have a series of prompts and Audrianna is gonna time so it's going to be two minutes for each prompt and just some guidance for this section so I would highly prefer that you draw instead of right so we don't really want to put words to things or articulate what they are we actually want to kind of explore the form of things which gets us more into the right brain side of thinking and so when the prompt comes up don't sit here and like think about it for a minute or two minutes it's actually just what comes out and just start drawing when the prompt comes up if you can write what the prompt is on the top of the page or the top of the kind of sheet that you're working on so that you have reference to it when we kind of do the follow-up activity and then scribbles are definitely welcomed so if you feel if you're like this is how I feel today and it's just a jumble that's totally great I'm sad don't ever think it have fun no judgment you don't have to show anybody yeah I'm gonna invite some folks to this screen and we want to share at the end but that's totally optional except again this is just for you let me see if anyone has any questions before we start how many prompts are there yeah I was gonna see how many you I have like quite a few um let's see when do you think I'm gonna see how time was going so I have let's say 10 10 is better than a pencil if you want to share any other questions before we start okay I am going to jump back in perfect okay so again two minutes for each one don't overthink it this is fun remember we're here for fun so okay perfect ready set go so the first three unexpected parts of quarantine are okay next one a gift that I find myself naturally giving during these uncertain times things that I loved to do as a kid three things that give me energy [Music] three things that take my energy when I think about my career I feel things that I'm proud of in relation to my career my and now power in your personal life [Music] okay just a few more okay tomorrow people close to me say that I am last but not least my perfect day is probably different than according to their [Music] so now invite you it to close this country invite you to take all of your papers and lay them out wherever in front of you wherever you are just to get a sense for what you do and then as you're looking at it I invite you to see if there's any themes or trends that kind of emerged and if anyone's interested in sharing they write in the comments we can invite you on the screen I've just kind of seen as are things that came up for them see anything or have any kind of insights that they want to share I can do one I think for me there's like a lot of themes like I put my perfect day she's my little doodle like going for a bike ride and being in nature reading a book like all this kind of fresh food like being in friends and community and then like going to a restaurant and the things I love to do as a kid where I step I used to play librarian and with my brother and we would like check out books from each other and slide them on this metal thing so we had a trampoline and I love to do that and I love to like ride my bike around the neighborhood and it was like it was like freedom so I think like books and bikes are definitely consistent and like wanting to be outside and I think that like the consistent theme is just like being around people like I'm definitely an extrovert yeah and then like the things that like take energy or things like staring at screens all day which is feeling very relevant right now okay but invite somebody up so we're gonna play a staring contest and me staring at you [Music] Jenna how can I invite someone on I thought I could do it from the chat but yeah I didn't ask a question hmm I think I'm hosting so yeah that's it my Elena cuz I can pick on her that's cool with you okay so you have Justin she's been invited hmm oh yeah I got real Thank You Vanessa for this wonderful workshop so I could share a few of mine you can start with here these are definitely things that take my energy and screams was also one of them all right definitely for those of you there I can't one is like when you just keep going around and around and around and being like punted in many different directions it just can't get to the place you know just keep being led around and around in their own um really sucks my energy and then as a fellow introvert slash October sometimes like big crowds and lots of people in groups so I need to let me be able to balance both I sent over an extrovert one other thing that I can share is maybe people that are close to me with these but what they say this is like my really crude drawing of a brain so I really have an idea of me being like kind of like a Brainiac and also do things I like the classic theater masks but it's also like happy and sad so I'm also like a basket of emotions a lot of time so these two things describe me very well but also I think people have a yeah of me beautiful watch Aaron my drawings are pretty bad so I'm just I'm just gonna keep them down here make the rules I'd say theater merges in mind like a cross across like personal professional childhood is like this this tension between a need to be outside and an active and like to be to be like intellectually stimulated be it like like reading a book and like hanging out with people with good banter yeah those those two energies just feed into absolutely everything what else I like you're only expecting a I needed to use words though - it's a kind of like captioned and you know like describe a little bit most when it was through books because books are very easy to draw in and they also like a very symbolic it's a lot like I drew another book tear when I wasn't even a librarian this was my I think this was the prompt of what I love to do as a kid so I really love to read and then I also looked anymore so this is like my curd where I got it with my little little painting yeah the other clothes yeah thank you both for sharing it looks like we have two more volunteers Angela and Ian it's better seeing people spaces so folks that can just taking a moment to bring them up Vanessa no one came up I know this wheelchair well unexpected in quarantine I said was like the long lines I said I like Percy stores and then also I had classes online now and I'm unexpected to what is it me right I can't hear Angela oh she's speaking okay okay yeah yeah she's going right up okay and then in like all the challenges that that was good 19 and I said a gift that was during these uncertain times it's like getting to spend more time with my family because I was going up to college and now I'm back so like I have more time to spend with my family and [Music] something that gives me energy is just being outside in nature and being friends and did you notice any themes are kind of anything pop out to you I do a lot of people and I think people are really like the purpose of myself i connecting with other people and just sharing your moments and feathers yeah it's beautiful thank you sure and do you wanna go sure so to be honest I also kind of broke the rules just because I am also working during the day so I didn't really draw anything but yeah I'll answer some of these questions um so I'll start with the first one which was how this current quarantine has affected me I think I'm becoming I'm becoming more introverted which has actually been something I've always wanted to do um like I I know growing up I've always been an extrovert I still think I am like I would prefer to work in an office physically with other people but I'm surprisingly not as anxious about this this kind of current lifestyle um as a lot of us before out there I guess um because I currently yeah I think I'm becoming more introverted other than that okay so the next question was what has what is the gift that I'm giving um I think I have more capacity to give and both in terms of time and money during this time because I'm actually juggling two jobs right now I'm a full-time at a part-time doing product design work and and so um I have more of a capacity to give both in terms of money as well as yeah time so like I've donated to a few charities recently and went to a friend of mine doing a crowdfunding campaign for her startup where she's working on a chatbot to to alleviate people's anxieties with respect to homelessness like one more if there's any kind of themes that you feel from all of it yeah yeah sure um things I think overall I I feel like I'm pretty and kind of hard maybe just overall I feel pretty good about my life so far um but I'm pretty the okay I'm kind of anxious about um right right now my life is just that I've had to man this is actually very hard I'm really sorry um bladder questions I can't get up - what do you feel bad about with respect to career I guess okay one thing that I just say I'll just share the whole like what gives me energy on what takes away energy I'll just share that and that's it um so what gives me energy is family friends my current work and and the opportunities that are on the horizon um actually recently got accepted to something it's a Mozilla fixed the web fellowship thing and then and then what picked away energy is just okay this might sound like a big statement but like there's a lot of in this world right um with respect to just a lot of things and and a it that seeing that stuff on the internet takes away energy and and also uh elitist attitudes out there like when I was looking for a new job like about a month or two ago having to deal with people saying stuff like oh you never worked for a big tech company oh then you must not be good or whatever um like having to face these people who think like just because I didn't used to work for these reputable companies they think less of me so yeah elitist attitudes but but over I'm pretty proud of all the multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary experiences I've had both in the world of social impact and and both in terms of local experiences in Canada and and also global experiences yeah thank you for sharing your congrats on the gig or offer or whatever thank you thank you yeah I think thank you both for sharing hopefully that was a good kind of initial exploration of kind of getting into the other side of your brain and kind of what is passionate for you or what kind of resonates with you I do want to spend just a few minutes kind of channeling the word side so let me share my screen again there's a little fun activity we're gonna move into the last brain ray can tell a lot of people are more comfortable so look at this photo what does she need and I'm actually curious I want to check to see in the chat like what do you think ah she would like what do you think she needs you can see the photo so she's reaching up for the top of the bookshelf I'll let you keep on doing it basically some what most people might say is that she needs a ladder or maybe like an extendable arm or a longer she needs to be taller maybe like some taller shoes or something like that um but that's actually like the direct you're basically solving meet the need with that prompt where what maybe she actually needs is a distraction from quarantine or a book to read with her parents and so what is like the actual need versus what's on the surface and so I love this photo because it kind of gets you to think in a different way where like yeah she's reaching for something and I could solve that problem with the thing that I have in my mind or I could kind of go one level deeper and have empathy for her and trying to understand her situation and then try and go a little bit deeper around okay well what does she actually need and then start getting curious and I think this activity just kind of it's that mindset of getting curious that I want to invite all these beautiful papers that you wrote or drew how do you get curious about these themes that you're seeing and then translate that into kind of how you want to show up in the world and so I invite you now to just take a few minutes to look at kind of the things that you drew or the things that you wrote and to start just looking for kind of words or verbs or emotions or philosophies or like things that are kind of emerging between the paper between the pages I mentioned for me like reading which is really about growth for me there's a lot of like community and connection and things like that and so I invite you to still you could do it on one of your existing pages or another page but it's almost like a word Bank but just kind of look at the themes and with this in mind this photo in mind take it like one level deeper so like yes there's lots of trees and so I could write trees but but what is it really about what it's about like connecting with something like deeper than myself or connecting with something bigger and so can you kind of get curious about what's beneath the surface and so I'll just give you a couple minutes to kind of explore a word Bank as you kind of use these creative explorations to now kind of go inward around what might be things that really drive you can maybe one more minute okay so I'll go first again because they'll see if just maybe one or two people want to share but for me the things that came up for a creative expression like connection and community just being like how I personally thrive learning from nature and really like growing on all dimensions there's definitely a theme around like teaching and coaching I use always I want to be a professor um so that's something like giving back through education really drives me and then like going deeper I'm really understanding the system of something and to solve problems all things I feel really resonant for me and kind of my purpose and how I'd show up there may be one or two people that that don't feel like sharing folks can also share in the chat as well and just so you know there's about a 10 second lag between when you type and it shows up so we're just going to be patient drink my coffee something that gives me energy while we're waiting I can share too nobody wants a show that's yeah for me I music was definitely a theme I think for those of you that were at the first prosper I shared the sound healing there and I really loved connecting to vibration and also similarly to Vanessa the movement of nature and kind of natural life force and how it how it animates all life is really beautiful to me so when I kept some comments so I'll minimize here you can say up but I like sing faces movement in connection with nature from Amy Joshua for me life survival freedoms spirituality diversity wealth success love and helping others that's beautiful hmm Sebastian connection and team up up to transform being a value to others friends are a treasure really are a treasure sorry you can't see your friends I got something in place is really hard right now yeah great well thank you for sharing I just have a few like closing slides and then I know I'm Jana has a zoom link if people want to get a little more chatty and then this one-way projection situation so let me just share my slider one more time just to kind of wrap things up so we have another one with the idea of tribes and community with shared values also came up for me I also have spreading knowledge and powering others collective intelligence the idea of the whole being created in the sum of the parts also connection with ourselves and to others as well as nature wow that's sort well articulated I feel like you should have came up that's beautiful I feel like you're in the right place yeah apparently I was gonna have us do more things but we're gonna skip this um the idea is that kind of like the point of view I shared at the beginning that led me to work on fellow what's the kind of articulate this into us a few sentences that kind of point you in a direction but you can do that as homework if you feel like following up on that yeah so this was kind of my point of view that I showed at the beginning which is more career focused but I think has some of the similar threads of like systems and connection and creativity more articulated around my journey I guess in my career so where do we go from here so I just wanted to offer two resources that I've found particularly helpful and I first under in mind that I kind of like this inward journey and like as you probably know it's a practice so I think it's the same as if you wanted to go run a marathon it's not you know something that happens in a day and you have to like train for it and I'm actually talked to Seth you know I was like how do we get like what are the best resources for purpose and exploring and he's like it's a daily reflection that's something I do every night and it kind of evolves over time and I think there's a million tools you can use that all point to the same thing but it's really about knowing yourself and knowing your strengths and knowing what drives you and then translating that into a story for other people to really grasp on and so that was my intent of sharing the point of view is that that's your kind of story that's how you show up but you really have to do the work first internally to understand what what really drives you and that's really the purpose of today I was hoping to show you to kind of align this inner purpose and then explore and how that might show up in your work and kind of how you're spending your your day-to-day so the goal of today and also a long term um two of my favorite resources that some of you might be familiar with so one's called the artist way it's a 12-week book that walks you through a bunch of prompts and then it actually has a practice called morning pages when you wake up and you write 750 words just vomit on a page everything that's on your mind and it gets you out of your kind of thinking brain and kind of the chaos and just kind of get things down on paper but then there's a lot of really great creative prompts basically like part of the thesis of the book is that most people stop drawing when they were kids because at some point someone said like your drawing sucks and so when you say draw a person they draw stick figure because when they were five that was like the last kind of interpretation of a person that they drew and so it kind of gets you back into that space and gets you comfortable with kind of the creative expression which I think can really help this kind of like over-index analytical mind from kind of making some of these decisions for you um so that's one resource I did it over twelve months but it's a very very helpful and the other one it's called design your life at the class out of Stanford basically they apply the design thinking process to yourself so you kind of do all these assessments like one of my favorite it's called the goodtime journal then basically as you're going throughout your day you're noticing like things that give you energy and things that take them and kind of reflecting and you do that for a few weeks so you basically get like a current state of like what are you what do you actually enjoyed in your day today day to day and what what do you actually not and then hopefully that helps give you a compass you can then put it into prototyping plans test things out and it just gives you a whole framework for how to think about how you want to spend your time during the day so it's a really great resource we actually have like a two hour workshop that we did first see labs that we could actually do externally or with the community if you're interested and you know so there's two resources that I've particularly found really helpful if you have any other resources for kind of exploring the inward journey and career pathing etc that you want to share in the chat like feel free to do that now as I'm sure other people would love to hear and with that I wanted to leave with a quote the two most important days in your life are the day you were born and the day you found find out why so I hope you continue this journey of exploring why and why you're here and how you kind of show up day to day and I hope that you feel a little bit inspired to keep exploring that and so with that I hope to see you at the next prosper it's currently set up Fridays at 8:00 a.m. PST same link as you came today and just to like I think most of you already involved the cell oh but we have a chat that's just chat it's all org and then a newsletter that's news it's a lot of work so that will kick it back over to Juliana unless anyone has any questions I think it would make sense to move over to zoom yeah thank you so much Vanessa I have the pleasure working every day and I just love how in my opinion she's so balanced in her right and left brain and so I love the way you're able to take these concepts and combine the creative piece with the kind of taking the juice of the core themes so thank you for that so I encourage everyone as a takeaway for yourself and to share with others in the world to

today for this topic with the work that we do at geneve with women during peri and post menopause a lot of times we hear questions about certain aspects of female health and specifically the anatomy component of it that we may have either never been exposed to um in our education depending on what education we had or it's things we forgot so today we have two very special guests we have dr yashika dooley and amanda sipos i am stacy kazantrak and i am the director of jenev's health coaching i'm a registered dietitian exercise physiologist and i'm very excited to have both amanda and dr dooley with us today um dr dooley can you give our audience your background and your specialty especially as a urogenital gynecologist yes um thanks again for having me today so i am a board-certified obstetrician and gynecologist so i did four years just learning about general women's health and delivering babies and then i did an additional three-year fellowship in urogynecology so i work primarily with perimenopausal and postmenopausal women looking at incontinence and pelvic pain and all the things that happen as a woman as a woman goes through menopause and beyond excellent um thank you so much for joining us your expertise is going to be wonderful today as we dive into this topic uh amanda let um you are another special guest and you're one of our geneve uh behind the scenes um uh employees but do a ton of work and you are also a pre-menopausal woman which i am as well and we've had some great conversations so i would love for you to introduce yourself to our audience and give some of your background in terms of the questions and curiosity you've had about female health since working at geneve sure so i'm amanda cypos i am in charge of product management at geneve on the technology side so i don't make your lube but i make sure that you can sign in and talk to all the people that can help you get through this challenging time in life um yeah so stacy and i we catch up quite often and i ask her questions like hey what happens when you're hoo-ha becomes the desert or like what's the evolution of beginning to end like you're born and you're hoo-ha looks one way and then it becomes a jungle and then then it progresses and things shoot out of it like children and then it progresses again and what does this all mean and how do we embrace it not be scared and excited all at the same time so basic stuff like that and um i'm excited to get some more answers excellent yes we are so as we are thinking about our webinars so many of our webinars do and we always want to highlight um the professionals in this field but i think it's also important to recognize that our audience um has questions and this these are topics that we don't talk about enough and so today we want to bring more conversation and amanda's going to help us do that by helping us through the lens of someone that may not be in health care have health care training specifically but certainly um a female interested in optimizing our health and learning about our bodies all right well let's jump in and get started i know everyone is eager for this um so one thing that i wanted to highlight again going back to the women that we work with at geneva oftentimes there's gaps and there's understandably um women don't necessarily understand what's happening during menopause and that's what we're here to help them with but i find that there's also a lot of questions around what is this in my body what um i don't understand where to put lube like how do i where are all these things so uh amanda can you start off with some you shared some questions already um that come up with that you've had or maybe conversations with your friends but anything in terms of having a greater understanding of um female physiology anatomy and physiology that would be helpful for you yeah so i think initially it would be the evolution you know um we're born as little girls it's a flat surface for the most part and then it evolves and we have a lot of information for the most part you go through puberty and like i said a jungle grows and you're like what's this thing and how do i find it and then you know you have a child or maybe you don't and then it starts changing again but there's no there's no like rulebook for that or how it evolves and what that entails so that's my first question what's next oh i would say um i like how you described it that's really good so yes it starts out kind of flat and there's not much there and then as we go through um you know uh puberty and you have more estrogen everything starts to get thicker and fuller and so now you have the labia the labia minora and the labia majora so you have those folds down there so everything's not as flat anymore um those are particularly helpful because they help to protect the actual um vaginal canal okay and then also you have like the clitoris becomes plumper and fuller and so that's great because now you can have orgasms um and also you have the hair right and so like all over the body you have hair that's kind of growing wild like a forest um and so what then happens different people depending on when they get pregnant hormones are wild and so all of those things kind of change and that's going to be very different for lots of different women um but then as you go through menopause there is decreased estrogen and it's kind of like you're coming full circle where things start to flatten out they're not as big and full anymore a lot of people lose a lot of the hair down there which again is like all over our body as you're going through perimenopause and menopause you're losing hair on your head under your arms your legs also on the vulva um and you lose a lot of the fullness down in the vaginal area so the labia minora and majora start to flatten out some and again like i told you those are very protective of that vaginal canal so it's not uncommon that as that thins out we are at increased risk for getting more infections and particularly in older women they show up with like lots of urinary tract infections or just irritation in general so in a nutshell that's kind of how i would relate what you're saying and it's just the cycles of the estrogen that's happening yeah that's a good good point i like how you also there's a natural timeline around these things this is normal for these fluctuations and estrogen certainly is a a driver with a lot of these okay i have another one already okay go forward as you hit puberty and everything plumps out and you're fertile and happy and want to have fun um how do you know like if you're having an orgasm and how do you figure that out like what's your advice like how do you discover that piece of your body and where do you start comfortably without being ashamed or embarrassed or judged so i think for women who are concerned that maybe they've never had an orgasm or they're not sure the easiest simplest way is to do like actual direct clitoral stimulation um and so the clitoris that is at the top of the um the vulva so really for most women i say it's like right below the hair so and if you feel around the thing that feels really good when you're like kind of touching it or it's really sensitive for a lot of people um and i tell most women just like start very gently and everybody likes that touch to be a little bit different um and for women who have never experienced an orgasm that's a great way to see what an orgasm feels like because you are in total control when you do it yourself and you can just kind of experience what that is like and for some women that's the only way that they're really going to be able to have an orgasm is with a little bit of direct clitoral stimulation in addition to whatever um vaginal penetration is going on and as that changes through time and that area becomes flat again and i feel like we're in a time period where like divorce or breakups or transitions are totally normal um but i feel like a lot i know lots of women that are in their 40s and 50s and they're hitting the street and they're dating again and now they're dealing with a desert downstairs and approaching conversations about like uncomfortable boning or burning and um like where do you bring that up or how how do you talk about that comfortably and i'm kind of wondering if you have any advice uh talk about it with their partner or talk about it just in general i think both because i don't know if it's accepted to talk about it and i think we should have more of an open relationship with our lady friends and then yeah i also i think i'm more interested in like the scientific um process that's happening in your body so that you know how to approach it in an intelligent way with like a little bit more of an upper hand when it comes to that situation because if you know what you're talking about when you get there you're in between the sheets or you're yeah burning or boning or both um yes like i i wouldn't want to be embarrassed and i know my friends don't want to be embarrassed and nothing's worse than like chafing for no good reason so yes so i would say the first part is all about normalization right and i remember a time when we never talked about um erectile dysfunction and then there was a time where erectile dysfunction like commercials were all over tv and people say it all the time now right so it's really just about us making it normal because if we can talk about erectile dysfunction and my children can see commercials on tv like why can't we talk about whatever is going on with women so really it's us saying no this is normal it's okay and if we can talk about the male counterpart to that because if they're having you know all these medications to get them nice and erect they need us to also if they like us because they need us to be ready right um so i think we need to then make it normal and we need to take out the discomfort just like when we're talking to our younger you know girls and saying it's totally normal to go through having a period and your breasts develop like how we choose to talk about it is how people are going to receive it and if you say it's totally normal to talk about breast development and having puberty and going through menopause in the same way we make it normal to talk about anything else that is dealing with that um i think when people are talking about having chafing and vaginal dryness and irritation one of the things that you should realize is men don't need very much if they're not having erectile dysfunction to be ready and to go right into intercourse females are much different we're much more cerebral and our bodies take a little bit longer to warm up and so if you automatically go and you're bumping and grinding and moving and it's all very dry down there it's going to be more irritating i think oftentimes you need to be ready if you know that you're the type that it takes a little bit longer for um like lubrication to naturally occur to have something on hand um and i think oftentimes it's great to incorporate that in foreplay so that nobody is irritated nobody feels like uncomfortable or waiting um but if you actually incorporate even using the lube during foreplay it makes it so much easier so i say you know you can actually use that to again direct clitoral stimulation or putting a little bit of lube on the outside because that's where it starts a lot of people have irritation just with penetration so you want to make sure you're getting the lube or whatever you're using on the outside as well as the inside if you're having problems with lube on the inside whatever like if it's you know penile penetration putting lube directly on the penis so that as you're having penetration you're not going to be irritated with insertion and initial movement until you have more vaginal natural vaginal lubrication so all of those things are very easy to do and if you talk to your partner and let them know how to incorporate it or even if you don't talk about it but you kind of show your partner what works for you most partners like they love you they care they're going to be down for it they're like okay that's easy you know and it makes it easier to do and it makes the transition very simple um i think that's the easiest way to start it but really and you'll know that notice this even with women that have just if they're pregnant or if they've just had a baby that's another time where you need a lot more lube because there's decreased estrogen and so a lot of women will be like i don't understand why i'm so dry well it's because you don't have as much estrogen right there and so um that's another time where you need to increase lube especially maybe if you had a vaginal delivery and you had a tear or something all of those things are going to contribute to any potential pain and so you want to kind of get ahead of all that by having the communication having the lube ready incorporating it into the foreplay and then even if you need a little bit extra during the actual intercourse i think it's great like right all of those times and you just make it very natural i love it too dr dooley thank you so much for bringing up the driving home the point around the need for conversation um and the comparison to erectile dysfunction with men is often um you know there was a pill created pretty quickly for that once that conversation came up so i think we um deserve on the female side to have that same thing and that conversation is so important so thank you for driving home that point um and also these things are and making these uh normalized or natural um you know we have there are products on the market we have uh different lubricants that we've created there's other ones out there there you don't have to feel shame about buying these you don't have to feel shame about using these they're there for a purpose and it really is about how can you optimize this time of your life and this is a part of the light of your life in that point uh dr dooley are there common misconceptions that you hear when it comes to female anatomy specifically or areas where women really um don't have the knowledge or understanding where it could be helpful to just know okay here these are this is the physiology this is the anatomy and this can help you improve your health or your quality of life i always recommend my patients do is just um take a look down there you know i think it's really hard when people come in and they're like something's wrong something's different but i'm not sure what and so they're trying to explain it to me but if i'm looking at their pelvis or their vagina for the first time i also don't know like is it usually a little bit red there is that new for you you know and so it's hard i don't know what your baseline is right so if you tell me it's irritated but i'm looking and i'm like well maybe it looks a little pinker or peacher maybe it's a little blue here but like for a woman they'll be like oh no that's always there that's not what i'm talking about that's so helpful for me because i don't know right and so if you kind of know your baseline and then if the doctor dismisses it it's easy for you to say no no that was never there before that's absolutely new and different for me right if your doctor doesn't know your baseline and you also were like i don't know i never looked down there it's hard then because now i just have to have you come back and be like okay let's see if it changes so i think that's the best way for women to empower themselves is to like just when things are when things are feeling rather rather normal just like stick a little hand mirror down there and kind of look okay this is usually the color this is what it looks like you know and then if something gets irritated or red just like you would do any other time right if something's red you kind of look at it you're like is it bruised what's going on so that you can then be able to say no that's that's usually not like that it's usually not that red it's usually not that full whatever it is um and then no matter what people say you can absolutely advocate for yourself and continue to advocate for yourself because you know that's not right but if you're not sure and they're not sure then you're both kind of like stuck in a quandary i think that helps like to get over the initial hurdle because if somebody tells me nope that's not normal i'm gonna listen to them more because i'm like okay she says it's not normal let's figure it out the other thing i think women need to do um and a lot of people ask me is like you know if they don't take a look or if they feel a bulge or if something is different it's hard for them to understand what's normal and not normal so i oftentimes will show pictures in my office and show women what they look like so that they can know what is normal right because sometimes if you just don't know like you see something you're like is that supposed to be there or not you know and so even if they have something like prolapse i'm like well it's common it's not normal you shouldn't have prolapse but it's not cancer right because lots of us are just like is that gonna kill me should i get surgery for that so just being able to talk to them about what it is really helps to just calm down their nerves and their anxiety even after like a woman has like you know babies or whatever things are different and if you don't know what's different or nobody's ever told you that's totally normal you just had a child or that's totally normal you've had four kids 10 years ago it's nice to hear that and be like okay i don't have to worry about that that's part of the natural aging process no that's such an again that exploration of understanding your own body then empowers you um to to take control of your health and to have that partnership that collaboration with the healthcare provider um that's another thing talking with a lot of women that it is it's not about healthcare providers just telling you what to do we every woman should feel that they're 100 in charge of their own body uh and part of that is that exploration and then you can um capitalize on that relationship with your healthcare provider or elevate it in a way that um that serves serves the woman more yeah yeah um thank you great points we have a lot of take-home points i hope i hope people are taking notes right now amanda two questions did you have some questions vanda i do so i feel like the age-old question or what i heard on the street and talk to my girlfriends was like i'm going to the gynecologist i didn't shave i didn't wax do you think they're expecting a landing strip what's going on what if it smells funny like how do i know if it smells different than last time do you think they remember is it in my chart notes like are they judging me like if someone judging me when i'm there like i don't know because i'm clearly spread eagle and like what's going on and i can't see what's happening i can't see their face now what like uh what's the answer like what do you think when you when you just spread them and you're like oh yeah manicured poorly that's a like like like what is that like so the answer as a physician like literally is it doesn't matter to me i totally as a physician like i see so many like i don't even remember it i would also say that as a woman i wonder i wonder about those things too right so i think as a woman like you're more likely to smell yourself or like especially if it's like the end of the day you've been running around i live in texas it's hot right and so i like in a lot of physicians if you stop them and be like do you want to go to the bathroom first if you want to do whatever i'm like i think it's fine you don't have to do that for me but i think that i want the woman to be as comfortable as possible you don't have to shave you don't have to do a manicure you don't have to do all the things but i feel like a lot of women do right and i as a woman also make sure that i do those things because i think it's just part we all just want to be as comfortable as possible because it's such an intimate exam and it's not like a five minute exam sometimes they're looking and you're just kind of like okay what's going on down there um i try to talk to the patient but i think it's also nice if you feel uncomfortable if something's going on for you to talk to your doctor and make that as normal and as comfortable as possible um so i think you know those are all common questions but i think from a doctor's perspective you're just like okay we don't worry about those things but i have people all the time and like if you want to if it makes you happy fine but don't go out of your way just because you're having a doctor's appointment i feel like another one i've heard is like you're in the stirrups and then that like gas bubble drops and now you like don't know what to do you're like oh my gosh like do i run to the bathroom is this gonna rip like is this gonna be mortifying like are they gonna pass out in front of me like what is this so i think and i've done it before while i've been on the table i just say excuse me just like you would any time right if the gas bubble rips or whatever what do you say excuse me i feel like especially for women as they get older you have less control of those things especially if you have urinary incontinence women are likely to leak they might even leak a little bit as they're coming down the table because that's what causes them to leak or they might pass gas right or even some women have like what we call like vaginal farts where there's gas that gets trapped in the vagina and as they're moving the gas escapes through the vagina most doctors will just be like oh it's fine i totally understand like part of it is i made you do that because i'm putting you in a situation where that's what your body naturally does right um i think it's on it's embarrassing just because nobody wants to pee on themselves or have a fart in somebody else's face but also a lot of times when we're pushing on the vagina or if we're doing a bimanual exam we realize that we are pushing the gas out so part of it is just what we are doing during the exam and so you should not feel uncomfortable or embarrassed because we as physicians and providers realize what we are doing during that exam is causing the natural bodily functions to happen okay i have another one so that's a good point go ahead amanda say you're in your 40s 50s whenever you get to my husband calls it mendo pause um but when you get to menopause um and you start feeling insecure about like you know societal immune society's image and the societal standard of like are my lips where they should be do i consider a vaginal rejuvenation like is this where i go in and instead of a boob lift i'm trimming the roast beef like what it what like what how do you cope with that or know what you have is healthy and maybe not healthy to be altering that because of the vagina being its own system in itself yeah so i feel like unless it's a quality of life issues so unless it's affecting your ability to you know have intercourse have bowel movements urinate we would consider it cosmetic right and i feel like that's really kind of a personal thing it's like somebody saying should i get a facelift or not well if you're 40 or 50 your face is never going to look like it did in your 20s but that doesn't mean that you can't get a facelift right same thing with the brass or if you want an abdominoplasty right like the way that your vagina and vulva look in the 40s and 50s is how it's supposed to look in your 40s and 50s and it's going to be a little more saggy skin it's going to be looser it's going to you know maybe be a little bit more wrinkly and so now you just have to decide if that for you is the threshold for wanting surgery and everybody that's going to be different i think it's totally normal though if you decide that you're that type of person or you want it to be tightened up a little bit great go for it you know but there's for us there's usually as physicians there's very little things that we're like oh you absolutely have to have that trimmed and let's let's just tighten that up and make it look better because the alternate side of that i'm always like i'd rather to be functional than beautiful but like don't touch right and that's that's the problem you can make it real pretty but if the person that you love can't use it they ain't gonna care what it looks like all right and so at the end of the day you want it to be functional right and so whatever gets that to happen and if you're doing a lot of cutting and trying to tighten it up but it's a hands-off situation nobody's happy kind of it comes back to the beauty on the inside right it's like wanting to focus on that and again bringing conversation to these things of knowing what's normal if if women perceive like this is abnormal something's wrong with me i need to fix it versus this is part of the process and it it's a little bit different than it was 20 years ago and so are some other things but what can what can you do to still feel optimal during this time yeah uh well we've talked a lot about different different aspects of the female anatomy the vagina we've mentioned the clitoris the vulva um labia all different terms here and the transitions of these during life are as life goes into peri and post menopause um and we've talked about some of these normal changes are there any that we've missed in terms of how some of the anatomy may change or the symptoms that women experience during uh peri and post menopause um i think the biggest symptoms are going to be like the vaginal dryness which most women kind of know about coming along with the vaginal dryness can be irritation right and so that can be just because of decreased estrogen um i think the other thing that um you can always think about is this is a time where you can have more just like yeast infections and urinary tract infections and sometimes women don't realize that that might be going on so i usually tell women if you've never been checked out if you haven't been checked out in a while just it makes sense just to have it checked out and just make sure that there's not something that maybe you just need to either get like you know an antibiotic for something um and not just assume it's just because i'm perimenopausal or postmenopausal because oftentimes women write things off they write off their body and they kind of poo poo their symptoms when it's really something they should at least get a baseline check and once the doctor's like yeah that's fine then okay you can kind of continue on and decide what you want um i think that the other thing is that this is a time where uh natural skin changes can occur so there are things like um lichen sclerosis happens more in postmenopausal women and that is just where you have just the skin is more dry and it can happen all over the body but it you notice it more in the vagina so that's just another thing that you may have vaginal dryness and irritation and it really does mimic just the normal postmenopausal woman but unless you be unless you're seen you know you're gonna write it off and think it's one thing but it might be something that could actually be treated so again that's why i tell women like at least stop by your doctor or your provider just to get kind of a baseline reading to make sure there's nothing else going on that might be able to be treated that you're saying oh it's just because i'm in menopause oh and that's another good point um where women we do sometimes put things off like oh no that's fine i'll get through this i'll just push through this um and this is another uh opportunity where it's learning what is a normal response for your body but then also areas where you don't have to suffer in silence and just and try to be the the hero of this situation um uh man any more questions come up for you yeah so when you're raging again at like 45 or 50 or whenever that time shows up first of all how long does that time last like what is there an average like i know there really is there's like a cycle average of like 20 days but that's not really real and then like what's the average menopause um so i think this is one of the biggest misconceptions most people think that you know menopause only happens like mid 50s and perimenopause is like a couple of years before and after that and that is completely wrong so people can have perimenopausal symptoms and postmenopausal symptoms for 10 or 15 years so it's not that all of a sudden you're going to stop hot flashing and irritation and night sweats and all that is going to end like a couple of years after you go through menopause and i think the fact that people think it's gonna end it really is probably what bothers them the most because they might be like 65 70 and still having those symptoms and they're like i don't understand why it's still happening and i'm like well that's just your body it's just what's going on um so i think there's a wide range of that and i've seen women in their 70s that are still hot flashing like they just started but if you know that like this is just my body and i'm just a hot flasher then it's easier to accept and you're just like okay i may never stop i might die hot flashing and then you know you're not expecting something that may never happen it's easier for you just to accept it and move on so the other part is like when you're feeling that rage again but you're an adult you're not going through puberty yeah gone through that cycle already um i mean me and my partner have this conversation like hey i'm taking a walk like i'm taking a walk like don't touch me it's like a hot switch like you're asking for something else if you push it um what do you recommend people do i mean some people scream some people you know i know that fitness helps release some of the tension and that anger and energy but when it happens so fast and there's so many triggers around you and then like like like i'm getting anxiety talking about it so uh what is the best way to create a healthy boundary distance from the stimuli around you i mean some of you some of them you can control some of them you can't um and just like enabling like the step back and then like breathing through it and waiting till it passes so i think one is once you know your triggers kind of setting yourself up for success so one thing that a lot of perimenopausal impose when menopausal women do is you know dress in layers right so you can kind of feel like okay once i get hot let me be able to take off some layers so i can kind of control that some women they have lots of these like cool packs and even for sleeping they have those cool like cool pillows and cool blankets so it'll kind of help to um help you have better sleep um i would also say you know a lot of women carry around fans or they have like you know fans in their office i think any of those things because when a hot flash comes or when that rage comes like it usually hits you out of the blue so i think once you know it's there being able to like stop and kind of even count backwards and give yourself a moment i say most people would really say that the hot flash is going to pass and maybe like you know 8 to 12 minutes it seems like the longest time of your life but like if you just give yourself a moment you know it's going to pass i think it's kind of like women that are in labor right like it hits you out of the blue but if you have already kind of prepared you know that contraction is going to end like you're just waiting like it's going to end i just need five more minutes like i think we prepare a lot for pregnancy and childbirth and labor but we never really prepare in the same way for menopause and i think if we prepared in that same way we'd be so much more empowered to deal with the symptoms people feel caught off guard by the symptoms because nobody tells them what to do nobody says okay it's gonna come it's gonna last five to ten minutes it's gonna be over and then you can do x y and z but if you knew like okay it's gonna come and i can do these things and you have things kind of in order like you'd feel so much more empowered but i even tell women if you're having a hot flash if somebody tells you i need a second i'm having a hot flash you give them a step back like right the same way if a woman tells you i'm having a contraction like that room shuts down everybody's like i think i'm the one that's having a hot flash just tell people i just need a second i'm having a hot flash i'm gonna step out i'll be right back because i think we all understand that's that's a moment like you just you can't even think straight right and so there's no reason in having a conversation but i think we need to normalize it we need to have that conversation but women also need to be vocal and often times that's the thing that they try to hide right a woman has a hot flash her face turns red she's sweating bullets and she's like sitting there like i hope nobody sees me i hope nobody can tell you know as opposed to just saying you know what guys i'm having a hot flash let me take off some clothes or i'm going to step outside i need a moment like that would really help the symptoms so much more because when you're trying to hide it it actually makes it worse because now your anxiety's like coming up and you're hoping nobody sees you everybody sees you but nobody wants to say anything right like it's obvious when they're having one so i think if you would just put it out there then everybody in the room would know and then you just kind of take care of it and then you come back and life goes on like nobody's gonna die yeah perfect i have one more question the sweat i've heard that your like body sweat changes and like one of my girlfriends is like oh my god i've had this rank boob sweat and i don't know what to do i don't like do i start applying deodorant under my like boobs like it smells terrible i smell it when a hot flash comes on it's leaking down my bra now i'm saturated and like i feel like all your scents change which is like you know ph wipes which we have at geneva and i have girlfriends that carry them in their purse everywhere and i don't know what that smells like yet and i think you should be aware of what you smell like in case you have an infection or something's off but like how do you handle that like how do you handle rank boob sweat like all these things that start happening so i think they do have like different powders and like deodorants and things um that you can use and so i think you can try them some women find them helpful some women don't really notice a difference i think for most women what they notice is that odor which you can't really get rid of the odor right it's just and so some women they they'll bring like an extra set of clothes or they'll bring like an extra shirt or an extra bra because usually it's it's after the hot flash and after the sweating now you're just wet it's almost like you had a workout but now you got to work the rest of the day and you're uncomfortable and you feel like everybody can see you but if you could just go to the bathroom change your bra or change your like you know your shirt or whatever and you felt more comfortable like then you could kind of go on with your day so i feel like there are things that you just have to feel comfortable doing and just being like it's okay right um again it's us normalizing it and being like i had a hot flash and i just had to take that stuff off like yes i have on a different shirt now it's not what i came in to work with but if you talk i had a hot flash and i was wet it's kind of like if you go work out at the gym right like you would just change your clothes like i'm uncomfortable and once you're comfortable then you go on with your day but if you normalize it then people are just going to go on i always tell women most people are thinking about themselves and most people are not going gonna notice what you wore like if you tell them like you know most people look and they're like oh okay you change like i had no idea what you wore like but we are always thinking other people are looking just at us but most of the time we are only thinking about ourselves which is and everybody's only thinking about themselves so just do what you need to do make it normal it's going to be fine the more we have these conversations and talk about it the better it's going to be all right such a good point and i'm going to use that as an opportunity to remind people to that if they have questions um now would be the time to put them in the q a box or the comment box on zoom or under the facebook live feed on facebook as we come into we have about 10 minutes or so left here um that will be wrapping up this is all amazing information i am finding it very informative as well and certainly supports um our mission at geneva in terms of really changing how women experience menopause and it does start with a conversation we're not going to change the menopause process and i think science is very far off from doing that as well so i think it's really more important to embrace that conversation and bring more um normalization to that what do you see uh dr dooley as anything else outside of the conversation or perhaps how do we help women have the courage to talk about these things i have a lot of clients that even amongst their friends don't want to talk about menopause except they they all know they're in menopause but it's scary it's uncomfortable um how do we support women in having these conversations so we can make this change i think one having these um webinars just like this right where you see how comfortable we are talking about it and it empowers you to have a conversation i would say most women when they have gone home or they talk to their good girlfriend like everybody's like oh my god you two i've been having the same thing like like nobody ever was like nah that's not me you know especially if you're starting with your your close circle of friends right that's a great place to start because they know you they love you you trust them and it's a great place to start having those uncomfortable conversations um and the more that you have them the more that you're gonna find kindred spirits you're gonna find your like tribe and they're all gonna have the same thing we're all having those same issues we just don't talk about it and the more that we talk about it the better it is and it just makes it easier like like i tell people even in my house my kids my kids are probably right outside the door they hear like i talk about orgasms all the time i talk about vaginas and penis and all that and that is how we talk in our house so it's very easy and it's not uncomfortable but we started that conversation and we continue it and we we normalize it so my kids probably will never feel uncomfortable saying stuff like that because they've grown up that way we have to now educate ourselves and educate those around us to be like it's fine just like erectile dysfunction on the tv right that was never going to be normal until somebody decided some man probably decided this is what we should talk about and show on prime time television and so now we do we have to do it for ourselves though nobody's going to do it for women if we don't do it it's never going to happen thank you for that reminder here and um we did get uh one comment that says a huge thanks to amanda for going through amanda pause and making it so approachable and funny and to dr dooley for just making it real so thank you both for that this person also had a question um she said that she had a hysterectomy nearly four years ago aside from lube is there anything else to do for vaginal dryness she also has psoriasis so all of her skin is dry but she's interested in options for vaginal dryness given that situation so i guess the one thing i would say is you could always try a little bit of um vaginal estrogen for most women that's going to be the thing that you need so lube is good for just in the moment right just while you're having like intercourse or whatever but to give you that continual um lubrication inside the vagina like at baseline most women are going to need a little bit of estrogen especially as they get older and it's easy to do and usually you only need it like once or twice a week um so i would just say just ask your you know gynecologist or a family practice whoever is doing that for you and it's something that we prescribe it all the time super easy and you'll feel so much better and you can put that on the inside of the vagina and on the outside and it really does help with all the tissues excellent um another question came in about weight gain what can we do for weight gain what's your perspective on the weight changes during peri and post-menopause dr julie um so the biggest issue is that we our hormones are different um we our metabolism has changed and even if you're eating exactly like you did you know four five ten years ago women have increased fat on their body which is normal as you age and you have decreased muscle mass and all of those contribute to the weight changes so it's easier for you to put on weight it's harder for you to take off weight and because of the distribution or the change between the muscle and the fat it makes it harder for you to metabolize i mean so the things that i would say is you're going to have to watch what you eat a little bit more because what you could eat a year ago and not gain weight is not going to be the same this year and it's absolutely not going to be the same two or three years from now if you can do any kind of weight-bearing exercises that's going to help you put on more muscle mass that protects you from osteoporosis which is great but it's also going to help you to rev up your metabolism and you're going to be able to ease more easily burn calories when you're not actually working out that's definitely some lifestyle switches and things to to look at changing that may have to adjust even if you have been active or focused on your nutrition other points in your life and i'll definitely put a plug for our health coaching team um with that because that's definitely a resource in areas where we can help women find the plan that's going to work best for you and really we look at an approach that's sustainable it's not a quick fix and it's not something that's going to help you lose 20 pounds in two weeks we're looking for something that's a long-term change that can fit with your lifestyle recognizing that your lifestyle might be different right now yeah and knowing that it's going to continue to change i tell women what you do today you're going to have to continue to alter and change five years from now yeah that dynamic process that that dynamic life that we all live that's right but if you embrace that if you start with that knowing that i'm gonna continue to have to evolve and change then it's all good you're not expecting one answer it's like okay i'm just gonna tweak it a little bit more it's like kids right you just continue to tweak what you do and you just know the child i had a year ago is different than the child i'm gonna have five years from now but that's okay you just continue to tweak it amanda did you have a question of that or comment yeah i mean i'm i'm still pre-menopausal but all the time in my house i'm like well my pants not the same that they used to or like oh i don't fit in this brand now i fit in this brand or i look at a picture when i was 25 and i'm like whoa like remember when and so recently you know i've done more reading and i've done more stuff to educate myself on the fact that we're all going to get old it's inevitable and um my husband always says like hey it's a privilege like you worked really hard to get here and not everybody gets that opportunity so guess what if you have hot flashes or cold flashes or your hoo-ha is dry like we can we can we can work through those things but not everyone's here today and i don't think that we give ourselves enough credit for getting to that point um and not that i'm excited to join the menopause group um personally like in a health-wise but um i like excited to be there too and and have the opportunity to check that box because not everyone has that opportunity and it is part of life and i think that's that's kind of part of the story um and i'm not there yet but that's totally how i feel at this point and i would say there's a lot of women that go through perimenopause and postmenopause and they feel so much more empowered in their body right they feel like i know this body so well now i didn't know this body that well 10 or 15 years ago and it's really how you frame what you think because now a lot of women come in and be like it's so great now i don't have to worry about getting pregnant like in your 20s we're all like oh my god i don't want to get pregnant and now they're like we don't have to worry about any of that stuff we're not worried about pregnant we're just having fun like right it's great to have fun and enjoy themselves so i think it's just all an evolutionary process and they're like you know we don't have all these kids in our house now it's just me and my partner or me and my spouse and it's really just reframing how you think about that time in your life and looking at all the things that are amazing about that time in your life that you wouldn't have if you weren't that age and really embracing that and being like this is so good i never had this before whatever it is and looking at it from that perspective like you said and a lot of people don't make it that far right so just the fact that you're still there is great and i always think too um i will say that there are women that the thing that age gives you is experience and there's women that i look up to because there's no way there's no amount of education or reading or certifications that you can get that can take the place of true life experience and so much of what um women have when they're in period post menopause they have life experience that's unique that you can't get without without going through that aging process absolutely yeah sorry we'll go ahead go ahead uh so i also learned recently i i always thought i wasn't allowed to ask for help for anything like you need a job don't ask for help need this don't ask for help um health-wise don't ask for help and the more and more that i evolved the more and more i was like oh wait they might have been through it oh wait they might be able to talk to someone or talk to me or break it down and like once i finally realized i could just ask for help and women have their own like group that no one discusses on the surface but we're really like the glue that holds everything together and once i started asking for help and it dawned on me that i could it was like the floodgates and the ease of going through every day just became like a quick message away or just like a helpful hint and uh it's been a night and day experience just knowing that you should just ask for help and it's okay like it's a healthy thing yeah that was such a good point in so many areas reaching out to other women reaching out to healthcare providers reaching out to health coaching whatever finding that support network really does help women feel their best during this time you don't have to be alone no one has to be alone right now um one other question that um we can finish up with this came in via email uh prior to the webinar um and this woman asked she mentioned uh she wanted to talk about debilitating periods fibroids and going through menopause um and how can periods cause shoulder pain so what's the connection between uh having a period and uh pain in their body uh as she's going through um the menopause change or in perimenopause she says her body hurts a lot she feels like it's similar to what fibromyalgia may be is there anything they can do and it's hard to get things done without taking a lot of ibuprofen any thoughts on that dr dooley yeah so i would say um if you have fibroids just having fibroids on the uterus depending on where those fibroids are and what they are hitting against what other organs that in and of itself can cause pain you know i'd say it's almost like being pregnant right the uterus is getting bigger and it's pushing on all your other organs and it's just uncomfortable because it's not supposed to be that way the same way with fibroids um and so when you are having menstrual cycles um sometimes you can have what we call retrograde menstruation so a little bit of that blood can get inside of the abdomen and that can also be very irritating to the abdominal organs so that can cause pain um but you could just have something like fibromyalgia and so not uncommon that women will get that later in life perimenopause and postmenopausal time period so again those are things that you want to make sure that you're checking in with your health care provider and seeing because it's easy for them to do in the office to find out if you are i'm having fibromyalgia um so that those things can be treated um in general most women should not be having more painful menstrual cycles as they're going through the menopause like your bleeding should be getting lighter the pain should be getting lighter even fibroids should be like decreasing every now and then that's not the case but i'd say probably for 80 of the women those symptoms should be decreasing and if they're not that's a great time and a reason to be checking in with your healthcare provider and just making sure there's not something else that's being missed thank you for that another reason again shouldn't be suffering in pain and um in silence alone reach out for help and get um support there and and answers or diagnosis where needed well um as we finish up here um i'd be curious if either of you have any final remarks any closing comments for our audience amanda i'll start with you to see if you have anything that's that you've taken away or you want our audience to make sure that they take away ask for help that's the first thing i learned it a little too late i feel like um and then i just feel like maintain having the conversation it was super great to meet dr dooley i haven't done that yet so that was very informative and um i think that's about it i'm sure i'll have pl plenty more conversations to share that i have with my girlfriends where we're all confused and we don't know what's going on so maybe we'll do a part two dr dooley any um final remarks resources um or recommendations for our audience um i would say the biggest thing is you are your own best advocate and so you need to feel comfortable advocating for yourself even when you're just not sure but i think you know i tell women all the time you know your body better than anybody else so absolutely feel empowered to talk about it and know that nothing will ever be normalized if we continue to like whisper in the shadows about whatever is going on it's up to us it's up to us as women to make it normal it's up to us to have those conversations because the more we have it the more people around us are going to be like well of course we talk about minipose of course this is what happens um but really it is up to us nobody's going to do it for us um but it's so easy to do once you start having those conversations it just it just becomes like of course that's what we talk about excellent great reminder to wrap up with um and then i'll also remind um our listeners as well that in addition to the health fix health coaching option we also have telemedicine so working with ob gyns that are specialized in menopause through telehealth you can schedule that and look at our options for that on our website so if you're looking to work with a provider to get some of these questions answered a lot of women will schedule appointments just to ask questions um there won't there won't be a physical exam on the over the telehealth um but our uh provider certainly can still prescribe prescriptions if it's appropriate they can answer questions and certainly give recommendations in terms of treatment for managing menopause symptoms on the medical side and then our coaches are all also trained in menopause and can help with the nutrition the stress management sleep exercise all things that there's a lot of different strategies and but often women need to figure out what's going to work best for them so we can certainly do that and help you to find the strategies to build your toolkit so you can approach this time of life with a little more zest a little more ease and know that it's normal but there's resources here to support you thank you both so much for your time uh this is a pleasure talking with both of you i learned a lot um and had a lot of fun so thank you dr dooley and amanda um and maybe we will have a part two coming here um in the future thanks for having me thank you you", "5M4hW37Y53c": "welcome back you know painting is something that many struggle with he turned to everything from those infomercial products to surgery to make it stop or worse yet they learn to just live with it while our next guest says you do not have to live with that pain anymore no here to explain is Tom Mannix with Aspen medical products good morning tom we're having us appreciate great to have you thank you well thank you very much for this back brace let's get started and talk about Aspen medical properties appreciate being here Aspen medical products came into existence in 1993 so this is actually our 25th year that we're going into pretty exciting does thank you yes very pretty exciting year for us but what we do is we specialize on spine bracing just the spine and we've been doing that for 25 years spine bracing has changed from Mendocino over these 25 years a lot of people are probably familiar with these big white you know things that kind of bind you up like that yeah well they turned into low profile very lightweight braces that people can wear throughout the rehabilitation and it's all about providing proper support which JJ actually has that brace on right now or a variation of that brace right and and what happens with the support on these things is that a lot of people that have back pain their their muscles what happens is in fact it happened to me this morning when I woke up because I'm an old fat paramedic and everyone said why on my back brace my back just kind of seizes up on me what happens is the muscles in your spine just seize up yeah and they go beyond a pain threshold and that's what you feel like grabbing their base so what we need to do with these braces and what we've pioneered with the Aspen braces is we need to give the person a certain amount of compression and really a localized compression you see braces on T to the TV that are advertised by a celebrity sports stars and things like that that are elastic bands those give you some sort of compression but you really need an inelastic band yeah and so you need to get that compression or what happens it starts to relax and and that's when you feel the relief now that's what this brace is about so the first brace is the horizon you can see there's an entire line of these braces but what it's meant to do is when you take the bracelet put it on : happens got a patented independent independent compression system in the back that when you hold it it really does feel nice the support yep and then I adjust it like that and then if you need to you can take the strings and you can dial in the the support wherever you need to that's because I've used a bracket back braces before or we're typically like you see if you want it to be tighter you have to really pull hard on the entire device to the point where you know you got muffin-topping on the top and the bottom this it gets right down to the point with these that's fantastic right away and often I I put an ice pack in the back and that really I was mentioning to you my mom on the farm her back goes out about twice a year from doing physical labor but she won't stop right like so many people so you're this is this is a good solution right when you start to feel that seizing up well I think that's the key and what these braces are meant to do is get people through the activities of daily living well they they don't cure things but what they do is they take that pain away and they help you go about your day the other brace that the only two braces that we bought are really interesting braces this one is near and dear to my heart this is called the peak scoliosis brace okay and scoliosis is a condition where people will start to lean to one side and this is specifically for adults who have lived this their whole life and that's what's kind of tragic about it because they've been through the wringer they're not surgical candidates they've had braces they have had therapy they've gone through everything and they finally basically have just given up and said well I'm going to live my whole life with pain yeah so we made this brace and what happens is when you have scoliosis and you start to lean it's everything else gets stretched on this side so you get pain with that basically what we do is we put this brace on prop up the other side and it lifts the muscles kind of relax and take that pain away we've seen people that's another thing that happens with the adult scoliosis is they get bent over like this and sometimes people can't breathe so by standing them up it allows their diaphragm to and their lungs to expand so that's that's the second brace that we have and the final one this I could see probably every millennial about 20 30 years from I'm wearing one of these exactly exactly so this is called the Vista therapy collar and and we are raising a generation of people to do this right you can't block 5 feet and not see people like this yeah you go out in the studio and people at their computers and everybody's bent over like this and basically what's happening it's a text neck phenomenon so it's the same thing right people do this they stretch all this out they get tremendous headaches even sometimes to the point you do it long enough you can affect the curvature of your spine oh no and because your muscles get trained you're essentially creating your own hunchback situation yes and so what this does it has a bladder that's in the back and it has it captures the up and what it does it'll take you and it will return you to the neutral position so that gravity is not causing all these problems again fantastic try don't go backwards on the evolutionary scale we try to do that you know it turns out it turns out your mother was right you know when you slouch in your chair yeah and you continue to slouch and you slouch and then they tell you to sit up straight it hurts to sit up straight yeah even though that's a position you should be in so that's the same thing that's going on with the vista therapy collar interesting yeah I tell you we're gonna all have to start using our devices like that yeah don't take this this isn't something Reed is typically going to the story I'm gonna go get myself a you know a vista collar Rob brace this is something that you would get from your doctor right yes sir these are these are medical products and so we want everybody to go to their doctor and what happens is the doctor will determine the extent or the type of your injury or what you need and then pick a brace that's right for you but the key things again is that you have to go to the doctor they pick the right brace you have to wear it and that's where Aspen medical comes in comfortable braces you can wear them and they actually do the proper support for you it's fantastic really the these have kind of a sporty like a flexible sporty quality to them but it really is amazing how you know in our in our generation how far braces how amazing oh my goodness yes it's great having appreciate the time thank you very much

For those of you who don't know us very well\nyet, we're a center that is involved with a lot of study of coastal and marine environments\nand the organisms that live in those environments. We study things like eelgrass beds. We do restoration of eelgrass beds. We study the effects of ocean acidification\non marine organisms. We study the water quality of San Francisco\nBay. We study invasive species in the bay. We work on a lot of these projects together\nwith our partners here on site, the National Estuarine Research Reserve and the Smithsonian\nInstitution's Environmental Research Center. Their main branch is in Chesapeake Bay, but\nthey have an out coast here. So for those of you who don't know very much\nabout us, that kind of gives you in a capsule what we do here. We--Tonight it is my really big pleasure to\nwelcome you to our first presentation in what is a new occasional series that we're calling\nthe art of science and it is--we're really excited about engaging the public in some\nnew ways to share our love of the ocean and the science of the sea. Before we begin, I do want to thank some of\nour sponsors, including Frey Vineyards, and you've been enjoying their wine tonight. They're from Mendocino County and they boast--and\nMendocino County in general has the highest percentage, largest percentage of acreage\nof certified organic wine vineyards in the United States, so that's a nice feature. And it turns out that Frey Vineyards who's\ndeeply committed to organic agricultural practices has the distinction of being America's first\norganic winery, so yeah. [Background Applause] Long tradition of caring\nfor the land. I also want to thank the caterers who brought\nfood and donated it for this event, A Forkful of Earth, ETC Catering, Boudin sourdough and\nTony [inaudible]. So thank them for their contributions for\nfood. I also want to thank Isabel Dreaver, who's\na neighbor who made a big contribution to help support this evening's program. So those are our sponsors tonight, so thank\nthem. [ Applause ] Tonight, we are really fortunate to have two\nexceptional artists here, a pair of photographer authors who clearly share our love of marine\nlife in ways that, you know, I can't even begin to describe how intimately connected\nwere are through art and science of these marine organisms, Josie Iselin and Susan Middleton. Josie is an alum actually of San Francisco\nState of our master's of fine arts program. She also has an undergraduate degree in visual\nand environmental studies from Harvard. She has authored and designed seven books\nat least. Her books focus on forms in nature, the kinds\nof things you might find walking along the beach, so she has a lot of books that I think\nyou will enjoy. She's exhibited her photographs all throughout\nCalifornia and Maine, in galleries and museums and she works from her studios, Loving Blind\nProductions here in San Francisco. Susan was the chair of the Department of Photography\nat the California Academy of Sciences for a bit more than a decade until about 1995\nand she's now a research associate there. She's the author of several highly acclaimed\nbooks, produced associated films including one that won an Emmy Award, National Geographic\nfilm entitled \"America's Endangered Species, Don't Say Goodbye.\" Her photographs have been exhibited and published\nthroughout the world and they're in a permanent collections of the National Gallery of Art\nand the National Academy of Sciences. She is also the recipient of an Endangered\nSpecies Coalition Champion Award for education and outreach and a Bay & Paul Foundation Biodiversity\nLeadership Award, and Susan is also a resident of San Francisco. So we're really excited to have both of them\nhere. They've joined their creative forces tonight\nto create a presentation called \"The Slimy and the Spineless\", portraits of unsung ocean\nheroes. It's based on the recently published books,\n\"An Ocean Garden: The Secret Life of Seaweeds\", and that's one by Josie and \"Spineless: Portraits\nof Marine Invertebrates, the Backbone of Life\", little irony on that title. And after the show, Josie and Susan will be\nsigning their books and the Book Depot from Mill Valley has books available for purchase\nif you're interested in buying them. So one of the reviews of one of Josie's books\nhad a quote that I found particularly relevant for tonight. It was the reviewer said, the secret to finding\nunsuspected beauty artists and naturalists will tell you is knowing how to slow down\nand really look. So tonight is one opportunity for us to share\nthe joy of doing just that and hearing about the process of doing that. So please join me in giving a very warm welcome\nto Josie Iselin and Susan Middleton. [ Applause ] And this is Susan Middleton, she's going to\nbe starting us off tonight. Welcome! >> Thank you. I'll start off and followed by Josie. It's an absolute privilege, and honor, and\npleasure to be here. This is my first time visiting the Romberg\nCenter and I live in San Francisco and have for 40 years and had no idea that this treasure\nwas here. So it's marvelous to be here, thank you for\ninviting us. It's the first time Josie and I presented\ntogether, though we've known for some time that our work begged to be shown together. So you're going to see the first time that\nthat's happened, but I'm pretty sure it won't be the last. I want to personally welcome some people who\nare sitting in the back there along the windows, from Richardson Bay Audobon Society Conservation\nLeadership Program students that I had an opportunity to meet briefly. Before this presentation started, I just want\nto offer you a personal welcome and hopefully there'll be an opportunity for you to interact\nwith some of us after the program. Vladimir Nabakov said, \"There can be no science\nwithout fancy and no art without facts.\" I think both Josie and I are so immerse in\nthat place where art and science meet and in fact, merge. And that's why we're here together. So I'll let you be the judge of that as you\nlook at the images that we're going to present, some of the stories that we'll tell you and\nour processes. The most recent project that I've been involved\nin has been photographing marine invertebrates for the newest book called \"Spineless\". This is the cover of the book and of course,\nthat's the cover, the cover boy and we think it's a boy. We don't know for sure. It's a juvenile pacific giant octopus, a member\nof the largest octopus species on the planet. It was a juvenile. I photographed it at Friday Harbor Marine\nLab and spent three wonderful days with an octopod expert observing it and photographing\nit and it was after, you know, 40 years of doing this the most beautiful animal I've\never photographed. I'm going to show you very rapid fire here\nwhere I started. This is obviously not an invertebrate. But in 1988, I took this photograph with David\nLiittschwager of a San Joaquin kit fox, a critically endangered species and this led\nto an entire career making photographic portraits of what began as endangered, federally listed\nendangered flora and fauna. This is the light-footed clapper rail, a marsh\nbird, very, very rare. And this is the black-footed ferret became\nquite famous as an endangered species. And much less famous but no less endangered,\nin fact more endangered was the Wyoming toad, who was part of the captive breeding facility\nin Southeastern Wyoming. This animal had about $5000 from the federal\ngovernment for a rehabilitation and restoration program for this animal and the previous one\nhad 2 to $300,000. This was 30 years ago and I began to want\nto understand more about how ways humans choose to protect what we protect and why. This was kind of an obvious thing, you know. This is animal is incredibly charismatic,\nit's a mammal, it's a little closer to us perhaps but this toad became quite an amazing\nphotograph and was even featured in Playboy magazine with a little mistletoe over its\nhead for their Christmas issue. This is a grizzly bear, talk about charismatic\nmegafauna. So this is were I started, you know, 30--over\n30 years ago, making portraits like this in collaboration with David Liittschwager. This is one of the most powerful ones. This is a purebred Florida panther, which\nis a huge part of this in the National Academy of Sciences. How did I get from this? Well, to this, at least started photographing\nmarine species, getting underwater. This photograph was taken at the Aquarium\nof the Americas in New Orleans and we kind of took over the tank for a period of a couple\nof days and inserted a black background and a white background to create this visual isolation. It was not done on the computer, but at least\nit began to experience me, if you will with photographing animals that live in the water,\nwhich is hard to do. So this a huge leap. This is, you know, 30 years forward and I\nshowed you that because the arrival at this place had everything to do starting at that\nplace. Over the years, I've gotten closer and closer\nto photographing the lesser known understudied species that are no less important to how\nlife works or how ecosystems function. And of course my most recent passion over\nthe last six years have been these marine invertebrates, the backbone of life. I didn't come up with that. Actually I wanted to say the backbone of life\nin the sea, but Sylvia Earl, my long time friend and colleague said, it has to be backbone\nof life because we are all utterly dependent on this realm of life. And over 98% of the described species, the\nknown species in the ocean are marine invertebrates and out of what, 34 generally agreed upon\nbroad categories of multicellular life, which are called phyla by scientists, 33 of those\n34 are comprised of marine vertebrates and the 34, where we fit in, as chordates also\ncontains invertebrates, so we're vastly outnumbered. So I thought it's time to champion the underdog. This is a beautiful stalked jelly that actually\nanchors itself on to this eelgrass, which is festooned with beautiful red algae. This is--A lot of times people assume that\nthe creatures that I'm photographing are relatively shallow water species and though most of them\nare, some of them came from deep water places because I was on a NOAA Research Expedition\naround French Frigate Shoals and we were able to actually bait lobster traps, set them down,\nand this animal called the white phantom crab, came from about, I think 350 feet down, maybe\na little bit more. One of my favorite kinds of marine invertebrates\nare flatworms. This is a four-lined flat worm. They're extremely delicate and what I've learned\nis that in the history of life, the deep history of life, these animals were the very--we're\nsomething very akin to them, we're the first animals that had bilateral symmetry and central\nnervous system. It was an incredible evolutionary breakthrough\nafter sponges. And I kind of think of humans, all of us as\nsitting or writing on the shoulders of these incredible evolutionary inventions that we\ninherited. This is a beautiful giant fleshy scale worm\nthat I photographed at Friday Harbor Marine Lab on San Juan Island where I've done a lot\nof the fieldwork. I did the fieldwork in three different locations. This is a Taylor's sea hare that tends to\ncamouflage itself on eelgrass and this is one of the reasons why I visually isolate\nmy subjects so that you can better see the detail and character of each individual animal. And again, it's not done in the computer. I tried that. I mean, you know, if it could be done successfully\nthat way, it would be a lot easier. I actually have to create little photo studios. The edges look cutout if you cut them out,\nat least to me I can always tell. So this is an animal that's--actually this\nis a lion's mane jellyfish, a juvenile, that is swimming around in a tank that I've sort\nof refashioned into a kind of photo studio, and I'll show you a little bit more about\nthat as we go on. This is a frosted nudibranch, very, very beautiful,\ndelicate, delicate creature. And this incredible animal turned out to be\na new species to science. It was captured from about 8 to 900 feet down\non the French Frigate Shoals Expedition and scientists felt like it might be something\nnew, just because an expedition that was focusing on this realm of life had never been mounted\nbefore, so the chances of discovering something new were pretty high. In fact after those three weeks on that ship,\nscientists predicted that maybe 10% of the animals that were collected would very likely\nbe new species to science. Turned out, this was one of them. This has been named, common name is Kanaloa\nsquat lobster, and I photographed it live and then it needed to be collected, that is\npreserved in alcohol so the scientists could do the detective work to sort out, whether\nit was indeed a new species. And after several years, it has been indeed\ndescribed as a new species and based on only this one specimen. So it now exists in alcohol. It's the holotype. Those of you who are scientists know what\nthat means. It's the specimen that really typifies or\nis assigned to be the characteristic animal representing that particular species. This is another animal that came from the\ndeep, the red, white and blue shrimp. And this is the Flabellina nudibranch from\nthe northwest. And one of my favorite images is the black-eyed\nsquid, also from Friday Harbor Marine Lab in the southwest as is this, which is called\na sea angel, its common name. But the person that I have apprenticed myself\nto the most, my mentor and muse is a scientist named Dr. Gustav Paulay and he's one of the\nworld's leading marine invertebrate biologist and I'll show you a picture of him in a second. But he calls this animal the devil angel. And--Because of the horns, but you know, about\n70 to 80% of the time when you see the animal, those little protrusions are retracted. So you don't see them, you only see the wings. But he told me to wait, and I did and there\nthey were. This is one of the ways that the fieldwork\nwas accomplished. This is the NOAA vessel, Hi'ialakai and it\ntravels every year from Honolulu out to the northwestern Hawaiian islands and then often\ndown south through the Line Islands doing coral reef ecosystem surveys. And I've been on that ship many times as part\nof their sort of education and outreach team. And I set up in their wet lab that I'm sharing\nwith at least 10 other marine biologists, most of whom are divers, I have like--we barked\noff our space. I have about, you know, 2 feet. We all have about 2 feet. And that's where I set up my sort of photarium\nand photo studio if you will, which you can see here. And here, I'm photographing a tiger cowrie,\ndifferent color of hair but it is me, just a couple years ago. And this is the resulting photographs. So what I'm really trying to do is to create\nalmost like an eye-to-eye encounter even if the animal doesn't have eyes that we really\nperceive as eyes. But like if we were another tiger cowrie,\nhow it might seem. And many people collect these shells, they're\nso beautiful, sought after. But not very many people have seen the actual\nanimal. And this beautiful gray fleshy mantel, completely\ncovers the shell when the animals is comfortable and so you can see a lot of that here. This is a really neat animal called the suborbicular\nKelly clam and it was brought up living in a beer bottle. It likes to hide in places where it's protected\nand beer bottles are perfect, and extend its siphon. So it became too big, it grew up in that beer\nbottle, became too big to escape. It was fine because all it had to do is extend\nits siphon out, collect food, it was actually ideal. We had to break the beer bottle though to\nget it out. One of my favorite kinds of animals, photographed\nmany, many, many of these. And this is a brittle star which is not actually\nbrittle. That central disc is very soft and very succulent\nobviously because they hide all the time. If you snorkel or dive, you can only see these\nwhen you sort of pick up a piece of coral rubble because they hide underneath things. As soon as they're exposed, fish come from\nall directions to prey on them. This is a freely anemone from the Line Islands\naround the Central Pacific. And I was on another NOAA Expedition there\nwhere I was able to photograph in one of the most pristine coral reef ecosystems left on\nearth. This is the orange-rimmed flatworm and the\nleopard flatworm. These beautiful, beautiful animals. And this is a red-eyed medusa from San Juan\nIsland. And this is a very interesting animal. It's been recently discovered. It's a rainbow comb jelly, and it's been recently\ndiscovered to contain--I think this is just sort of a new scientific acknowledgment that\nthis animal very likely contains the most primitive nerve cells known. So a lot of research is being done on them\nnow. And these are called sea gooseberries. This animal looking more like a vegetable\nis called broadbase tunicate. And it is relatively closely related to us\nas chordates. I found that really hard to believe. But as it turns out, these 34 phyla that multicellular\nlife were divided into are determined by body plan. So body plan, you think well, what do we look\nlike when we're adults. That makes a difference but what makes just\nas much of a difference is what animals look like in their early developmental stages. So even in their larval stages. So very early on, we as humans and this animal\nhave some things in common, like a notochord and gill slits. And those are defining characteristics of\nthe chordates. And that's kind of where I'm headed for potential\nnext project if I can figure out how to do it visually. This is a nice collage of nudibranchs. I think nudibranchs are the most beloved of\nall the marine invertebrates by the most people because they're so beautiful and varied. This stubby squid. Now, sometimes people will say, \"How do you\nget these animals to do this?\" I can't get these animals to do anything. The real key is just waiting, patience and\nbeing ready. And I had no idea that this animal is going\nto be able to do something like this in the tank, sort of prop itself up like that. And when I saw it, I was like, oh my God. But then I wasn't sure how long it was going\nto last, you know. So you go--you wait and you know--but if it\ncan do it once, it will do it again and it did. Some of these animals have marvelous name. This is called the Tahitian glass sausage\nand I'm sure that their scientific names are even more incredible, but I'm not going into\nall that Latin right now. This is a sea cucumber, as is this. This is the black-spotted sea cucumber. And this is the most ornate of all. This is the stiff-footed sea cucumber. Now somebody asked me earlier, you know, to\nwhat extent do scientists play into the work that you produce? Heavily, a lot. I apprentice myself to scientists and I have\nfor 40 years. So I worked with California Academy of Sciences\nfor many years and after I left there because I had just to go out in the world and do fieldwork,\nI attach myself to the best field biologists I could find. And so in this case, Dr. Gustav Paulay, he\npointed this animal out. It was in the lab at Friday Harbor Marine\nLab, and it looked kind of like a white shag rug because all of these tentacles were withdrawn. And he told me, he says, you know, this is\nnot easy to find these and he said, if you're patient enough, you may see the tentacles,\nbut be patient because they're fantastic. And it took like three days for them to come\nout to this extent. And I don't know if it was curiosity or hunger\nor what it was. But eventually, they emerged. This was a big surprise for me. I'm sure many of you have seen egg cowries,\nthey're white cowrie shells with the highest gloss you can imagine. They're so beautiful. And people collect these too. I have one on my dashboard. Fortunately, they're not endangered as far\nas we know. What I didn't realize is that the animal who\nlives inside this beautiful shell is like the night sky. This is a black mantel covering, you know,\nengulfing the white cowrie shell and it becomes complete, absolutely astonishingly beautiful. And all of the marine invertebrate biologists\nthat I spoke to about why would a black animal live inside this white shell, no one had an\nanswer. A few has suggestions of where you might want\nto start that inquiry. This is probably not going to surprise anybody. Most of us have seen gooseneck barnacles. But I love being able to look at them from\na different point of view. A little bit down and seeing them emerge like\nthat. This is a pretty cool crab that want you to\nthink that it's actually a sea pen. And so it attaches this other marine invertebrate\nanimal onto itself. You can see those little--you know, little\narms that are dedicated for that purpose. And it's always there. So, if you're coming in from above, you might\nnot realize that it's a crab is what I think is going on. This is the same species of crab with a fire\nsponge. This is a very obvious adaptive advantage\nbecause if any of you have ever touched a fire sponge, which I have, it's a terrible\nexperience. These little spicules get lodged in your skin\nand it feels like your skin is burning. So, this animal has come up with a really\ngood way to defend itself. At Friday Harbor Marine Lab had the good fortune\nto photograph a Puget sound king crab and in fact, my friend, Deidre Kernan [assumed\nspelling] is in the audience tonight. She help me make this picture because we needed\nto--I usually work alone, but I really needed somebody to be able to drop the crab into\nthe tank as it floated down to take the picture, and this was the resulting picture. Even more amazing to me was the closeup. Sometimes people will say, \"Are you enhancing\nthe color?\" You know, \"No.\" The big challenge with marine invertebrates\nis to render the color as vivid as it actually is because it's not possible. The [inaudible] too wide to sandwich it in\nto the digital possibilities. So I do the best I can, but enhancement, no. Probably reduction if anything or compression. This is the dock at Friday Harbor Marine Lab\non San Juan Island where I've done a lot of the field work, and this is my mentor and\nmuse, Dr. Gustav Paulay collecting marine invertebrates off of a rubber tire bumper\non the dock. Lots of subjects, lots of beautiful marine\ninvertebrates came right from this place. And this is their research vessel, the centennial\nthat goes out. This was a bunch of students that I kind of\nattach myself to who are studying marine inverts. And we were doing what they call a dredge\nand fortunately, that's not a coral reef habitat because you would never use a dredge in a\ncoral reef habitat. But this mechanism sinks down to the bottom\nand then is dragged along the bottom and picks up whatever it can pick up. And in this case, it was a treasure trove\nof marvelous things from the bottom. Josie, you can see, it's mostly algae. And these are students going through and sorting\nout because you never know what's going to come up. These are some of the animals that were being,\nyou know, set aside for their portrait sessions. And we try to keep ones apart that might prey\non each other. I had to have scientific advice on that. And this inside the lab situation where the\nstudents and the scientists work, and those are called sea tables and there's fresh seawater\nbeing pumped in from Friday Harbor just a few hundred yards outside. So it's a good place to keep animals happy\nfor observation research and in my case for photography. So, here I'm photographing a wide-hand hermit\ncrab, beautiful animal. And that's the resulting photograph. These are worm tubes. I really have never been a big fan of worms,\nbut I was converted when I worked on San Juan Island because the marine worms are fantastical\nother realm of life altogether. These are tubes that these particular worms\nbuild out of sand and not any sand grain will do. They are very fussy about which grains they\nselect. They're like little artisans. And this is the phoronid, so whole separate\nphyla. This is the worm itself emerging. And this is the tube of the ice cream cone\nworm, you can see it, it's like artisan ring going on there. Here's Gustav again out at low tide, sand\nflats with the students saying that he needed an arm extension and it was pouring down rain. He knew what he was after. He said I want to get a diopatra worm for\nyou all to see. And for Susan to photograph. Lo and behold, he did. And it's a worm that also builds tube like\nparchment, which I also have in my dashboard. Because he extracted the worm from the parchment\nso that we could all see it. Take it back to the lab, observe it and so\nthat I could photograph it. Look at this animal. Ornate tube worm, well named. And probably I think more amazing than anything\nthat Pixar could invent. Or maybe Pixar gets some inspiration from\nsome of these animals, but this knocked me out. And you would never see this animal because\nmost of the time it's in a tube and most of the time it's very deep, and most of the time\nit's not low tide. So, what a revelation. This is a feather duster worm, some of you\nhave probably seen these, another tube-building worm, festooned with algae. And this was the learning experience for me. This is called Venus' girdle. And when I was on one of the NOAA vessels,\nfirst meeting, some of these marine invertebrate biologists, Gustav Paulay came up to me with\namazing jar full of water and he looked--I just met him, and he handed to me, he said,\nif you can photograph this, you can photograph anything. And I looked at it and I said, \"I don't see\nanything in there.' And he just smiled and walked away, and I\nthought hmm. So, I went outside on the deck because the\nsun was setting, I thought maybe some sharp light, or maybe there's something in there. And I could see these things like swimming\naround, but they were transparent. And it was very difficult to photograph them,\nbut I did. These two animals are famous for their vision. These are mantis shrimp and they have the\nmost sophisticated color vision of any animal known. Humans have what are called three rods and\ncons color receptors, mantis shrimps have 16. They can see 360 degrees without having to\nmove. It's incredible what they're capable of. And this particular species has the added\nadvantage of having a tail end that looks a lot like something a predator would not\nwant to mess with. So they are very, very interesting animals,\nand quite sophisticated and I spent a lot of time trying to imagine what they see, but\nof course, we don't really know. But than urchin tail is pretty cool. These are ribbon worms. They can stretch out to almost impossible\nlengths, beautiful, amazing animals. And these crabs, these decorator crabs, photographed\nso many of these because each one has a different style. They don't all collect the same things. I'm sure it has something to do with what's\navailable. But the students were doing a lot of research\non this, and some of them really did lean toward red or lean toward green algae or in\nthis case, these red knee pads. This was a short story I want to share with\nyou because it was a big learning experience for me. I was out with the students and researchers\ndoing some fieldwork on San Juan Island. We were looking around for things to bring\nback to the lab and suddenly I heard this yelp of excitement and everybody gathered\ntogether and I knew they had found something and I went up close and this is Gustav's hand\nand he said, \"This is the world's largest flatworms, this is the giant flatworm.\" And I looked at it, and I thought, so you\ncan see how big it is. I thought OK. And he said, \"They're rare, I've never seen\none before. I know about them I've never seen one. I've been looking them for years.\" Do you want to photograph it? If you decide to photograph it, you must promise\nme that you will bring it back tomorrow morning this exact spot under this rock because they're\nnot that many of them around. I looked at it and I thought, \"I'm not going\nto be able to do anything with this.\" It looks like a brown blob. It's not beautiful and with these gorgeous\ndesigns like the other flatworms that I photographed in the past. And of course, with photography as all of\nyou know, you can't tell how big anything is. That's one of the magical things about it. That's why I'm not telling you how big most\nthese things are. Though in the book, it's in the back but it's\nnot the first thing you get to know. But I thought you know in a photograph, this\nis not going to look like a giant flatworm. And even in his hand I mean, you know, giants\nrelative. But I thought I need to try. So I took it back and something happened in\nthe tank that no one expected. The scientists, all the students gathered\naround because this worm, obviously unprovoked because I can't get it to do anything, I mean\nit was in freshwater at the right temperature, started becoming this contortionist. This beautiful range of shapes and forms that\nit could turn its body into was absolutely astonishing. And it's actually one of my favorite series\nof pictures in the book, and I did take it back the very next morning with reverence. Yeah, that was my favorite one of all. A few pictures of hermit crabs, have done\na lot of work with hermit grabs, I love them dearly. This is wide-hand hermit in a sponge, living\nsponge. So sometime hermits are not in shells. They'll inhabit a living sponge and that's\na good mutual relationship benefiting both. Lots of pictures of hermits in the book. These same species, different homes, makes\nsense, right? All the same species, different homes, a lot\nof it has to do with availability of shells to be had. And, you know, here we have the same species. The guy at the bottom obviously was not able\nto find a really nice house but he is making do with that rather, you know, eroded shell. And this I call the nudist. This is a hermit crab without its shell, so\nyou see on the upper left what a hermit crab looks without a shell. It looks like without a shell and they're\nvery vulnerable. They don't like that at all. I mean, they're embarrassed, but it's worse\nthan that because they are very vulnerable to predation and they have little hooks if\nyou can see that attach to the inside of the shell and of course, this animals was coveting\nthe shell and jumped right in shortly after this picture was taken. This is the same species of crab with its\nshell with three different species of anemones, a marine worm, tube worm there and a barnacle\non the top and the scientists were way more excited about that barnacle than they were\nabout the hermit crab because it was potentially a new species, at least rare. I'm now going to shift us toward Josie's wonderful\nwork in the world of algae and I love algae too. And of course, out in the real world, algae\nand marine invertebrates are not separate. They live together. And not only do they live together, they have\nwonderful mutually symbiotic relationships. So here you see another decorator grab that\nis festooned with both green and red algae. And I love this little crab. He's mimicking or at least camouflaging on\nHalimeda algae, which is a very important algae out in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. It's estimated that half of that beautiful\nwhite sand on the atolls comes from algae, not just [inaudible]. So really they're coral and algae atolls,\nboth from algae and from marine invertebrates. And of course, this is not an invertebrate. This is lipspot Morey eel. But festooning itself really emerge and surrounding\nitself with this beautiful [inaudible] algae, so with that, Josie. [ Applause ] >> Wow. I think we all have to take a little breath. That was just, just remarkable. I'm a little bit shorter. So thank you so much and I feel like we are\ntwo photographers that have come to this parallel space that's really, really a special place\nand I'm absolutely also delighted to be here at the Romberg Tiburon Center where all of\nthis celebrated so much. I'm a book maker and I'm a visual artist first\nand foremost, and my most recent project is on marine algae or seaweed. And I think maybe starting with the really\nbig difference between Susan, the work that we've just seen and my work is that, my work\nis very much about the everyday. It is not about things hidden away, you know,\ndeep under the mud. It's about what you and I can find most often\nwhen we are at the beach and how the beach is really this place that's a portal to our\nocean world. And I really had to learn the science as an\nartist. I've come to the science from the visual. My books are all very visually driven books. So the visual comes first. It's the image making that then drives the\nquestioning, the questions that arise that are like, \"Oh my gosh, why is that the way\nit is?\" So, I too--Susan and I thought it would be\nnice to both kind of show where we came from and how did I get to seaweed. And I wanted to start with a couple of the\nvery first spreads. I'm a book designer right from the start and\nI'm showing you a couple of spreads that are from the very first book proposal that I sent\nto my publishers. And this was where I just became intoxicated\nas a visual artist with marine algae. You have some Egregia or the feather boa kelp\nhere and this [inaudible] here that is on a piece of surfgrass. And it's this combination of these crazy shapes\nand forms of the feather boa and the contrast of shapes, the great combination of colors\nthat for me was just intoxicating and I couldn't stay away. This was again one of the very early spreads. It's the Mazzaella, just its fabulous watercolory\nquality to it. And then just a scrap that I picked up on\nLimantour Beach one New Year's Day when I was out there. And again, these are some of the page spreads\nthat went into the first proposal and I send it off to Abrams & Chronicle Books and they\nsend it off to their sales department and the sales department promptly came back and\nsaid, \"A book on seaweed? You got to be kidding me. We can't sell a book on seaweed.\" But I couldn't stay away so that was the beginning. But it all really started back with a book\ncalled \"Beach Stones\". This was my first book and it was a very simple\naccounting of a collection of stones and in between the single portraits of stones where\nthese pages where the stones really started to design themselves and they became a little\nmore elaborate. I worked with a wonderful geology writer,\nMargaret Carruthers who wrote that book. And then I moved very quickly on to a book\ncalled \"Leaves and Pods\" and this was just looking at leaves from trees that I found\naround the various neighborhoods of San Francisco. And San Francisco has all these fabulous microclimate\nso you have quite a variety of trees. I got to go into the Arboretum there and also\nto the Brooklyn Botanical Gardens and work with their horticulturist. But it was with this book that I really started\nto expand how I use the page and this process of visual storytelling and develop the idea\nof looking very objectively and closely at an object like this pin oak cliff, and then\ngoing in even closer and what are the questions that come from looking so closely. And in this case, there's this fabulous concave\nshape and Mary Ellen Hannibal was who I was working with writing--she was writing the\ntext for that book and she writes eloquently about why leaves are shaped the way they are. I am not a graphic designer, but I have become\na book designer through this process and so I didn't know any of the rules and so I was\nable to kind of break the rules like crossing the gutter and using the full bleed and it\nhas worked to my advantage. I then moved very quickly on to a book on\nseashells and this book, again it was about shells that you or I could find at the beach. The core of the book was my grandmother's\ncollection of seashells from her many, many years on the beach in South Carolina. I also got to go into the collections at the\nAcademy of Sciences, into their shell and fossils collection. And again, here we have an ammonite and this\nis following an image of the nautilus shell and it's continuing the story of the nautilus. But by looking at it and then looking even\nmore closely, these fabulously flamboyant sutures are clearly what the story is there\nand I worked with Sandy Carlson on that book. But on all three of these books, I worked\nwith a single editor, Nancy Cohen and she and I really made a consistency of tone across\nthe books. It's very simple science and relatively simple\nimagery, but there's a consistency to them and she gave me the confidence to say, you\nknow, I can write the books myself going forward, and that's what I've done. I really--After working with these single\nobjects, I really wanted to make kind of more involved imagery and I also had really come\nto find the beach as this place of discovery. It really is a portal into this ocean world. And this is an image that led to the next\nproject. It is clearly some driftwood and a feather\nand there's a little bit of sea glass there. And then there are these pods and these pods\nare just things I was just compelled to pick up off the beach and now I know they are of\ncourse the pods from the Macrocystis, the pneumatocysts from the Macrocystis. But at that time, I was just reacting to them\nvisually. They have this fabulous orangey color and\norganic shape. But this--oh my God, there's a ladybug on\nthe keyboard here. It's a good sign. There is. We all have good luck. That gave rise to this book, \"Beach: A Book\nof Treasure\" and this is really an accounting of kind of everything we find at the beach. And I knew--starts with sand and where the\nsand come from, the genome of the sand dollar but it also has some kind of cultural history\nin there and we get through to the end and the idea is that trash can be treasure at\nthe end and what we can learn not only about the science of what we're looking at, but\nwhat we can learn from it. But as I was making this book, I knew that\nI wanted to include sea glass. Sea glass is just one of those gems that you\nfind on the beach and it's magical. It's a magical moment. And I'm going to show you some slides of the\nstudio. But my traditional scans which you'll know\nwhat I'm talking about in a minute, really wasn't rendering sea glass. Sea glass was coming out more like stones\nand it wasn't quite working for me. So I started experimenting with the transparency\nadopter of my scanner and that is the part of the scanner that is designed to scan slides\nor negatives and it actually pushes light through the slides or negatives or objects. About that same time. I was taking the Rocky Shores Naturalist Programs\ntraining to be a docent at the Duxbury Reef in Bolinas. And I started to spend time on Duxbury Reef\nand on one of those first trips up there, I just picked up this very nondescript piece\nof seaweed or algae and held it up to the sky and this is just--was a brilliant moment\nfor me. It was--I was really so struck by this fabulousness\nof form and this intensity of color and I hope that when you all go to the beach, you\nwill just do that. Just take a piece of seaweed and hold it up\nto the sky and you're really--it's a surprising moment. I knew right then and there I needed to get\nsome of that algae back into my studio and on to the scanner and that's what this image\nis. This is really a signature image of this beach\nbook, it's made it to the back cover. But these are all specimens from Duxbury. And from hereon in, I'm labeling what we're\nseeing. And for the seaweed book, \"An Ocean Garden\",\nit was very important for each item, each specimen that we're looking at to have its\nname there. Naming was very much a way into the science\nfor me. It is a way in. But I was very conscious of my own ways that\nI learn. Naming is very hard for me. There is a reason that I was in the visual\narts department at Harvard and don't be fooled, environmental studies had absolutely nothing\nto do with science. It referred to kind of architecture and design. So the environmental studies didn't really\nexist in the early '80s, at least at Harvard at that time. So this is the Fucus distichus [inaudible]\nand two kind types of the Cryptopleura and it gives you--this is one of the earliest\nimages made. This again was on early on, these are two\ntypes from Nereocystis or little baby bull kelp and I was so pleased to be able to capture\nthis dynamic quality to the seaweed. I felt like even though I was in my studio,\nI was able to communicate just a little bit of what it might be like to experience a seaweed\nwhen the tide is high and when we are not able to see it. So this is my studio. It's very small. It's under my house in Noe Valley, in the\ncity and it's about 10 feet wide and 15 feet long and there's a table and it's this table\nin which all these things collect and I've kind of pared down my slides here for this\ntalk. But usually, I have another slide that has\nlots more things on it. I have a great collection of seaweed squiggles\nand that collection extends from this table out into my garage. But it's here that the relationship start\nto happen and once I've found the relationship that I think might work, I then translate\nthat, those objects over to my scanner, which sit just opposite that table. Right here in this image, I'm setting up to\ndo what I call a traditional scan and that's where the light is reflecting off the object. I leave the top up and the background defaults\nto black so that's how all of this opaque things like the stones and these squiggles\ntypes are produced. Let me go back here. So from when I'm making a transparent scan,\nI take--the white cover there comes off and there's another light element in that top\npart of the scanner with another piece of glass and I carefully lower the top. You can see I have some helper stones here\nthat help me out. They keep the top from smashing my specimen\nand that scan has captured the light element from the top adapter is pushing right through\nthe object or the specimen and that's how the transparent scans are captured. These are some typical specimens as they sit\naround on my work table there. What you'll see is they're not like the traditional\npressing where the marine algae is floated onto a piece of herbarium paper. I've kind of developed this technique where--and\nmany others have done it as well, where I can press the seaweed to be a discrete object\nand that way, I can place it on to my scanner and make an image such as this circle of reds. So these are just from those scraps lying\naround my table and these are all in the red group of seaweed, and there's this wonderful\nrange of nuance of color. These are some more of those Macrocystis pods\nthat absolutely just, you know, happen to collect on that table and then they result\nin what I call the traditional scan into an image such as this one. So this is my whole workstation. I work--My work comes into Photoshop. I do use my computer. I don't use a camera at all. I have not used a really decent camera for\nmany, many years. And here--so the images come into Photoshop\nbut then I very quickly work in--I start placing images into InDesign and I design the books\nas I go along. I really design the books almost like a piece\nof sculpture and it's those--that designing process will then guide me in terms of what\nthe next images are that I'm making. So it's very much a visual storytelling and\nthe sequencing of the books is very, very important and ongoing process. So this is the images that results from those\nseaweed squiggles. And then this is the next squiggles. This is a fabulous pressing of Microcladia\nthat is from the university herbarium at UC Berkeley and it became the end papers for\nthe book. And as a book designer, I get to do the whole\nbook from soup to nuts and I always am thinking, what are the end papers going to be and I\nhave this whole little file full of possibilities and this is what made it in there. So here we are at the book. My mentor for this project was Kathy Ann Miller\nat the university herbarium at UC Berkeley. She was really my guiding light. The various marine labs up and down the California\ncoast have consolidated their collections of marine algae at the university herbarium\nwhich sits together with the Jepson Herbarium at Cal, in the basement of the Life Science\nBuilding there. Kathy Ann is the curator there. She is the guru of marine algae. I've been able to do a number of workshops\nwith her and she really guided me through the science of seaweed with an incredible\ngenerosity of spirit. So she's very much my mentor. I thought I might read just the introduction\nto the book because it gives you a sense of how much of a personal story it is for me\nin terms of coming to the science of seaweed. \"I fell in love with seaweed at the kitchen\ncounter. I had returned with a sack full from the windswept\nbeach at Princeton by the sea, and as I dropped each specimen into a tub of salt water, its\nform and color and translucent sensuality awakened. Pale pinks mingled with bright greens and\nyellow oranges. Rounded fronds, bumpy textures, and slender\ntendrils unraveled. I focused on one green algal mass. As I teased out the delicate blades, they\nstick to my fingers or to each other, but I persevered. The delicate connections between the razor-thin\nblades were surprisingly strong, and as I unfolded them, one by one, I could see their\ntiny serrated edges. I felt like I was discovering a secret that\nfew have seen, the secret of Desmarestia herbacea, or acid kelp. In 1955, Rachel Carson published \"The Edge\nof the Sea\", a lyrical and intimate prose portrait of the intertidal world, that universe\nof life that resides just below and between the tides. In describing the complexities of existence\nwherein the basic fabric of life, the ocean itself, is wrenched away and comes flooding\nback twice a day, her intense love and care for the seashore is palpable in every word. Carson saw the integral nature of all organisms\nliving at the seashore. Her ecological view, rare at that time, when\nmost scientists were nose down in the study of specific species, is as contemporary today\nas when she wrote it, and she celebrates seaweed as one of the great ecosystem engineers of\nour planet. It fixes carbon, generating the base of the\nfood chain, and creates habitat. It is fundamental not only to life in the\nsea but to all life on earth. So again, Rachel Carson was a really important\nmodel to me and I encourage anyone who hasn't read her \"Edge of the Sea\", it's as good and\nlyrical as ever. This is a historical pressing of the acid\nkelp. Acid kelp does have sulfuric acid in its cellwalls,\nso it's a strategy against being eaten. If you are out collecting algae, you don't\nwant to put your acid kelp in with your other specimens because it will bleach it and they\nwill all be yucky when you get home. So now, I just want to go through some of\nthe specimens from the book. This is Cryptopleura ruprechtiana. The ruffle is characteristic of the Cryptopleura. This is from the Duxbury Reef. And again you can see this detail on the lower\nright is actually from the same file as the whole specimen and that's how much detail\nI can get with my scanner. When I was actually working on the file, I\nwas deep, deep into the ruffles and encountered little copepods and almost microorganisms\nthat make their life in that tiny but important environment. The Egregia menziesii is the feather boa kelp. This is absolutely my favorite. It has these wonderful whimsical pods or bladders\nthat keep it afloat. This I had to bring in to my studio wet. You can see that it's a wet specimen. As it dries, it becomes much less fantastic,\nso I had to put this goopy thing onto the scanner. Cumathamnion, OK, so the names have changed. I do put the former name. The names are very up to date. Kathy Ann was my guide in these things and\nshe is very up to date. Color is such a formidable characteristic\nof the marine algae and it was--William Henry Harvey was the first to use color as the basis\nfor identifying seaweeds. While his specimens had infinite variations\nor color, their spores clearly visible under the--his primitive microscope, were definitive\ncircles of super color, vibrantly green, vividly pink, or intensely olive brown. In 1839 Harvey segregated algae into the three\ntaxonomic groups of green, brown, and red that we still use today to classify seaweed. So the greens have the chlorophyll A and B\nand they are where our terrestrial plants come from, that's were the chlorophyll comes\nfrom. They migrated up on to land. The browns have an accessory brown pigment\nthat combines with the green chlorophyll and makes this wonderful array of olive browns,\ngreens, almost oranges. And then the red, the reds have a blue and\na red accessory pigment and there's just the chlorophyll A in there. And the blue and red pigments combine to make\nthis incredible array of colors. Of course, one of the questions I ask was\nlike, why these pigments? Well in fact, the red spectra in the--that\nwe experience on land does not penetrate the ocean and it's the green and blue wavelengths\nthat penetrate the oceans. So the blue and red pigments are picking up\nthe wavelengths that they receive. It's kind of a resourcefulness, it's really\nwonderful. The seaweed architecture, I use the colander\nkelp as a way to talk about how seaweed is structured. It has a holdfast which holds it to the rocky\nbottom. It has a stipe and it has a blade. This is a very simple structure, of course,\nyou have all sorts of different branching structures. The colander kelp has this magnificently wholly\nblade. It degenerates, it kind of sloughs off at\nthe same time that it regenerate itself at what's called the meristem. And the meristem is where the stipe hits the\nblade there. The colander kelp is kind of a favorite of\nmine because it actually exists on both the east coast and the west coast and I very much\nhave a foot on the east coast. I spend my summers as much of them as I can\nin Maine and I'm very, very rooted to the coastal world of coastal Maine. And it's one of the few species that actually\nevolved. It migrated down from the Arctic down both\ncoasts, so you will find it on both the Atlantic and the Pacific. Ulva or sea lettuce, this is perhaps the signature\nspecies of the greens. It is only two cells thick and every cell\nis like every other cell. So this is very different than our vascular\nplants in which cell differentiation is so fundamental. So every cell photosynthesizes and every cell\nhas access to all of the nutrients of the oceans. Here we have the Fucus distichus, our bladder-wrack\nout here and then the classic rockweed. If anyone is familiar with coastal Maine,\nthey know that this is the rockweed that just smothers most of the beaches there. What was outstanding to me is that most people\ndon't know its name. So Ascophyllum nodosum. These are both examples of dichotomous growth,\nso one splits to two, which often results in three. And you have this wonderful almost Dr. Zeus-like\nquality that is created and that of course I have a lot of fun with. Botryocladia or sea grapes, this is a pressing\nof Kathy Ann's. It's from the Channel Islands. Sea grapes actually hydrate themselves, keep\nthemselves hydrated when the tide is out by being full of water. When you do find them, they do really look\nlike grapes and this is a pressing so I can actually scan from a pressing on herbarium\npaper and the light is reflecting through the specimen and bouncing off the--I have\nmy little pal here, my little ladybug. Through, and I'm able to drop the herbarium\npaper out and we have the resulting image. Coralline algae, coralline is so fundamental\nto our intertidal ecosystems. It is in all the world's ocean and yet it's\ntaken this completely different strategy than all the other algae with all their exuberant\ngrowth. It actually calcifies in its cellwalls to\nprotect itself from being eaten. Calcifying is a very laborious process so\nthe coralline algae might take five years to grow five centimeters. I find that coralline algae is really common\nto find on the beach, but many people don't notice it and once they've seen an image like\nthis, they'll go out to the beach and go, oh of course here it is. This is how you'll find it when it's bleached\nout up in the wrack line. This is showing both an articulated coralline\nand the encrusted coralline. This is an encrusting coralline that encrusts\nspecifically on limpets. But when you're in the intertidal and there's\ngreat swats of kind of pinky what might look like lichen or stuff on the rocks, that is\nthe encrusting coralline. So the Macrocystis, the giant kelp, this is\nthe dominant kelp of our great kelp forest from the Monterey Peninsula down south. What I'm showing here is the Apical scimitar,\nthat point of growth that's at the very tip of this massive organism. This one was in fact 20-feet long and I got\nthis top portion back to my studio and on to the scanner. And here we have some of the classic Macrocystis. Most of the algae tend to be flat. They maximize surface area to volume to be\nthe most efficient photosynthesizers that they can be. The Macrocystis also developed this texture\non its blade, this rugose texture that actually creates a microturbulence at the level of\nthe cell so that even more nutrients can come at the very microlevel. I'm able to--I was able to dry a Macrocystis\nblade and then go in and scanned just that texture and I'm able to take this into a whole\ndifferent visual realm, which is of course extremely exciting. Nori, these are my Nori dancers. These are just little scraps of Porphyria,\nwhich has now been relabeled Pyropia. I actually use these as an excuse to get in\ntouch with a dance professor from Middlebury College, and she and I coordinated on a performance\nand presentation together. And she in fact has taken my book in the information\nfrom it and done some I'm sure fabulous dance performance all based on marine algae. But that kind of--the fact that the seaweed\nis really this wonderful nexus where art and science can come together is of course for\nme a great, great joy. Nereocystis, this is the bull kelp. Now, I could not have made this book over\nthe last two years. There has been no wrack washed up. I walked Fort Funston twice a day every week--every\ntwice a week, every week. And many, many of the specimens are just wrack\nwashed up on the beach. And there has been none. We have not had the storms with this horrible\ndrought that we're in. So this was on one of those days when there\nwas massive amounts of Nereo, the bull kelp washed up. And the tiny babies are just at the oceans\nedge, and that's what this is. This is a very immature baby bull kelp. The bladder is probably as big as my thumbnail. There's a little visual story of this lifecycle\nand this is a mature bull kelp. So the Nereo is an annual, the entire organism\ncomes off each year and washes up and starts afresh. The Macrocystis is a perennial and the holdfast\npersists. But this is the bull kelp here. This is a very big goopy specimen that was\nactually in my studio and there's a continuation to it. And here it is at the end of its life as you\nwould find it, you know, at the high tide line bleached by the sun. Gloiosiphonia, this fabulously Victorian specimen. This is a historical specimen from the herbarium. It probably was made in the 1880s by some\nvery dedicated collector, probably a woman. There were all these women in Monterey who\ncollected at the turn of the century and would send their specimens up to Albert Setchell\nat UC Berkeley, the head of botany department there. And this is to remind me that I feel--I'm\nvery much working in a Victorian tradition of imaging directly from the specimen. And in contrast to that very feathery Gloiosiphonia,\nyou have this Pachymeniopsis which is tough and stretchy, but no less spectacular in this\nradiant color. Polyneuria is many veined, but these veins\ndon't transport anything as where one to think. They offer a little bit of structure, not\na lot. The bladder chain wrack, you've all seen this,\nyou know, out at Stinson Beach. This is really everywhere but as a designer,\nI can go in closely and just take such delight in the variety of forms. Pepper dulce, pepper dulce, Osmunda very common\nin the midtide zone. I will often stick a piece of this into my\nmouth as I'm out in the intertidal. It has lovely little bite to it. And again, it's very flat. Halosaccion or sea sacs, these, again they're\nhydrating from within. If you're out at Bolinas at the Duxbury Reef\nin the spring time, these pop up as a whole meadow of fingers. The water actually--unlike other algae, the\nwater in the sea sac actually keep it upright. It's absolutely delightful. And I'll end here, and I'll read how I finish. I had the great good fortune of going to the\nUniversity of Southern California into their special collections and being able to see\nfirsthand this enormous elephant folio of hand colored lithographs done by Alexander\nPostels. And he and Rupprecht described a lot of the\nmarine algae of the Pacific Coast for the first time. My buddy is here. The hand-colored lithograph that introduces\nthe Postels and Ruprecht portfolio \"Illustrationes Algarum\" shows a pair of Russian navy sailors\non the rocky shore of what was likely present-day Alaska, circa 1830. One has his arms laden with bulky kelp, while\nthe other, holding tight to a sapling to keep from slipping, pulls a long Laminaria up from\nthe water world onto the dry land to which the soldiers are clearly limited. This terrestrial world, wild and newly explored,\npainstakingly rendered with tree trunks and moss, is, however, relegated to the top third\nof the lithograph. The majority of the image, clearly delineated\nby the surface of the water, depicts the realm of the seaweeds beneath the tide. Colored in greens, golds, and reds are masses\nof Nereocystis, Macrocystis, Alaria, and Mazzaella, bent with the current, their holdfasts connected\nto a rocky bottom. Clearly the soldiers cannot see this world\nright below them. Neither can we. It takes a steadfast sense of exploration,\na willingness to put on boots and wade out into slippery terrain, or to pick up what\nmight initially seem repellent when walking the beach, to learn about this secret life\nof seaweed. If we love the beach and all it is trying\nto teach us about our connection to the oceans, it is worth the effort. So we can finish there, and we have plenty\nof time for questions I hope. [ Applause ] >> Thank you both so, so much. We are going to transition to--We have a couple\nof our graduates students who are going to sit and panel up here with Susan and Josie\nand ask them a few questions and then we're going to open it up to the audience for questions\nand discussions. So, that's what we've got coming up. If someone could turn the lights up just a\nlittle bit and I think we can bring out some chairs. We can bring it back down. >> Oh yes, OK. >> I just want to get the chairs. So, Melissa and Heather, you want to come\nand introduce-- [ Inaudible Discussion ] >> OK. I'd like to introduce two of our graduate\nstudents from our master's program here at Romberg Tiburon Center. We've got Melissa Payton here who studies\nsubmerged aquatic vegetation in San Francisco Estuary. And we have Heather Richard who studies microplastics\nand biofilms on them and they're and what there--how they potentially interact with\nthe metals and all kinds of things in San Francisco Bay. So those are our two graduate students and\nthey're going to start us off by asking our speakers a coupe of questions and then we'll--so\nyou can start getting your brains working and thinking about what you might want to\nask. And then we'll take questions from the audience. OK, who wants to start? Heather? OK. >> Thanks. Josie, in your book, I really appreciated\nand love the comment that you--you make a comment about the colander kelp saying that\nit's your favorite, but that it has this ability to grow and die simultaneously. And it's a better metaphor for life than a\nlittle pink blossom, and it inspired me to think, that would make a great tattoo. So my question--my question for both of you\nis if you would get a tattoo of one of your subjects, what it would be? And why? >> Wow, well, I know right off the bat actually. I just have such a soft spot for the feather\nboa kelp, the Egregia. It is just--It's so wacky, and yet it's so\nsuccessful. It also has this--as a designer, I've become\nrather obsessed with the pods, the pneumatocysts that have these very whimsical blades that\ncome off of them. So I have a collection of about 35 that I've\nassembled into poster actually. So, I'd have to--it'd be a hard choice between\nwhether it was the little bladder or whether it was the lovely long blade of the feather\nboa but feather boa was from my tattoo. >> That's an easy choice for me too, the octopus. And you see it right here. I don't know if this would be the template\nfor the tattoo but it would definitely be an octopus. And the reason is because I guess partly because\nthey're the smartest of all the marine invertebrates. And when you look at them and they look back\nat you, you know that someone's home there. And I have that good fortune of diving and\nsnorkeling and encountering them in the wild and watching them look back at me. But I've been even more privileged to be able\nto look at them for long periods of time in a visually isolated aquarium like the cover,\npacific giant octopus on the book. I worked with that animal for three days and\nit was just--it seemed inexhaustible in its repertoire of gestures. As soon as I had thought I had seen everything,\nit would assume another form and just astonishing. So I'm very much at awe of those animals and\nthe tattoo would definitely be an octopus. >> All right, thank you. So you're both artists but then interest in\nscience, but I was wondering if you get different reactions to your work from artists compared\nto scientists? >> Yes. Yeah, I think so. I mean, that's an interesting question, and\ncertainly one that is not often asked I don't think, about whether or not reactions to the\nwork are different with artists and scientists. I don't always get to know, you know. But I've been doing this for a long time,\nand I attach myself to scientific experts, so I'm working really closely with scientists. I've always felt like my work was not fully\nembraced by the art world. And I've--you know, you never know quite why\nbut part of it I think is because it's not ambiguous enough. It's too direct and it's too literal for a\nlot of art world pundits. Though I'm great, great fan of fine art and\nhave been since I was a little kid. I was as passionate about fine art as I was\nabout nature as a kid, both of those things were very, very strong for me. The most supportive community from my work\nover the last 35 years have been conservsation biologists because they know what works. They get it. And so, those people have been my most ardent\nsupporters right up to Edward O. Wilson, who I think would just about do anything to keep\nthe work going because he understands that it works. >> Yeah, it's a very interesting question\nand I think one of the tings that's so great about showing the work in conjunction with\nthe science is that the science adds a conceptual level to the art work that if you don't have\nthat and often if you're in an art context, that's missing. That's the missing piece. So, I think both Susan and I are very similar\nthis way in that we have kind of an ambivalence towards, you know, we are artists and very--I\nhave an MFA from state and you're supposed to be, you know, showing in galleries. But I feel much more comfortable walking this\nvery thin line between scientific illustration and art making. It's a very interesting place to be and that's--and\nbringing the science into its wonderful to be in that situation where there is that conceptual\nside to it is added on. >> I really appreciate the way that kind of\nbuilding on that question. I really appreciate the way that you folks\nseem to be mediator between scientists and the public. I wanted to know if you saw yourself in that\nrole and if you had any advice for scientists to be better able to reach the public with\nthe message of their science and conservation, what advice would you give? >> My advice would be to write, write, write,\nwrite and write differently. I mean, no--write--I mean to write many different\nways. You know, I think it's really--my goal was\nto write a book that I could understand as a nonscientist and to use not--as use no jargon. And I think there's all sorts of ways to practice\nwriting whether it's a journal writing or writing some--about something you care very\ndeeply about without realizing that some of the words that scientists understand so fundamentally\naren't that well understood by the general public. And so, I find myself not having the training\nin science. I don't rely on that vocabulary. And I'm able to kind of find this way in through\nmy personal experience. And so I do feel like I am a bit of a mediator\nthere because I'm that public. Yeah, I agree with Josie. I mean I definitely feel like I kind of give\nmy subject matter, these animals that I showed you tonight, these marine invertebrates, I\ntry to give them a voice to communicate to the general public in a way that I think is\nmore difficult for scientists and I guess my advice for scientists would be team up\nwith artists. >> Yeah. >> Which they do, but maybe more so to along\nthe lines of what Josie was saying, to not be afraid to be passionate. And to not be afraid to feel and to not be\nafraid to express that, to not be afraid to love what you study. >> I just want to add to that in that I very\nmuch feel like scientists very much love what they study, but--OK. But many people are passionate and how can\nyou translate, how can you be a translator for that passion? And that's where collaboration is really so\nwonderful. >> Well, on that note, from more of a scientific\nperspective, I was wondering if you thought about when you're making these images, how\nto balance a sort of realistic view and an artistic view and you know, if you thought\nabout if there's anything that you lose from removing these plants and animals from their\nnatural environment. >> At this point, after doing it for so many\ndecades, it's a completely intuitive process. I mean, my subjects actually tell me what\nto do. I sort of have to get out of the way and be\nprepared and there are something lost when you visually isolate an animal or a plant,\ntake it away from its environment, it's habitat and what you lose is that sense of context. What you gain is incredible detail and more\ninformation in terms of form and texture that you can probably ever see in its natural environment. I've worked with so many scientists over the\nyears who have just been astonished at what they were able to see in the visual isolation\nof subjects that they might have been studying for decades and even with that giant flatworm\nthat became the contortionist in my little aquarium, all of us including the scientists\nwho'd been, you know, marine invertebrate veteran scientists, we were all pretty sure\nthat we are witnessing something that probably no human had ever even seen before because\nyou could never see it in the natural environment. So there's some loss and some gain. It's a fresh approach. It's like making a portrait, like you make\na portrait of a person, you know, trying to capture the individuality, character if you\nwill, of an individual organism, not the species but an individual because that's what I'm\ntrying to bring. >> Yeah, and I will just build on that. I mean I very much--Susan and I have come\nto this kind of technique of portraiture along these different paths. Using the scanner, I've been very, very conscious\nof the fact that I'm taking these organisms out of context and what is it that I'm gaining\nand I feel like I'm very aware of how bombarded we are daily with imagery, I mean, especially\nnow. There are just so many images out there and\nthey have so much visual information and we have horizon lines and textures and by stripping\nthat away and taking scale out of the picture, it kind of allows these organisms to really\nspeak for themselves and it was something that struck me when I first started using\nthe scanner back, you know, 20, 25 years ago and I still feel like it is a really versatile\ntool for letting these objects, these natural objects and species and specimens speak for\nthemselves, so. >> All right, we're going to open it up for\nquestions now from the audience and I'm actually going to ask maybe Heather to scoot around\nand hold the microphone for people who would like to ask questions. OK. >> Great. >> This one is for Susan, and then I have\none for both of you. So in terms of your process, do you use flash,\nyou know, how do you eliminate the color. It seems like you use black or white to get\nthe contrast, but I'm just curious how you do it photographically. [ Inaudible Discussion ] [ Laughter. ] >> The question was about how--about my process,\nsort of how it's done, how that visual isolation is achieved. So all the photographs I showed you tonight\nwere taken in either a modified aquarium or a glass tray that has little plexiglass sides\nthat I made, that I fabricated. And sometimes I'm shooting down and sometimes\nI'm shooting straight in. I'm shooting through water. All of the animals are very much alive. I try to keep them as happy as possible with\nfresh seawater. The way the white background is achieved is\nthere's a milk plex, like a translucent piece of plexiglass that is either underneath or\nbehind the aquarium 6 to 10 inches behind or underneath so that it doesn't flare and\ncut the contrast on the subject matter. And then I'm pumping light from behind and\nyeah, use stroke, brown color strokes, really excellent strokes which I finally invested\nin, which was a good thing because I was using--you know, once it weren't as good previously. And so I'm--so that's how the background is\nachieved for the white background, which are more complicated technically than the black\nbackground pictures. The black background pictures, I just take\na piece of something rigid, cardboard or maybe a piece of plex that's covered with black\nvelvet. I'm fussy about the black velvet. All black velvet is not the same and put it\nin front. So that's how that's achieved. And I filter the water, I'm obsessive about\nthat for clarity, but still you get those collector crabs in there and they are just\na mess. So you know, so I will take Photoshop and\nclear out stuff that's floating in the water, but that's about as far as I go with the Photoshop. I'm handholding the main light. The camera is in one hand or on a tripod and\nI'm literally handholding a key light. Yeah, that's the light that's lighting the\nsubject because I'm always moving around. I can never put in on any kind stand because\nall I want to do is move it because I'm moving it all around, you know, and I don't know\nat that moment which place is going to be the best place, and then I'll use silver cards\nand white cards to bounce the light back and so it actually creates--it's almost like two\nlights if you wanted fill light to fill in the shadows. I have a lot of little, you know, things that\nI use, but I work alone. Yeah, it was-- >> [Inaudible] to be an octopus. >> I do, but I wish I had eight arms, that\nwould be better. Did you have a question for both of us? [ Inaudible Remark ] >> Well, I'm--actually along those lines,\nI am working with a fabricator in South San Francisco to make a series of shower curtains\nand they're really beautiful and really fun. It is a whole another world to get into fabrication\nand actually make it work and make it happen, but it's--I'm having a lot of fun right now\nbecause we have all the elements of, you know, the water and the transparency, and the imagery,\nand I'm a designer and it's really fun. >> I'll just add really quickly, it was an\nimage I didn't show because both Josie and I cut our presentations back for you all so\nthat we can be sandwiched together. But there is a photograph in the book of a\nmussel shell that has a lot of other organisms on the mussel shells. It's really beautiful. I collected it myself in a tide pool. And when I started working with my editor\nat Abrams, Andrea Danese, she looked at that and she said, \"Oh, I want an evening gown\nthat looks like that.\" And so, you know, so maybe it can manifest. >> Yeah. [ Inaudible Remarks ] >> Hi there. This is a question for both of you. I've just started tinkering with underwater\nphotography and I really started off as a student in marine biology. But I was wondering if you have any advice\nfor people kind of getting into the field of underwater photography in marine biology. And also kind of what was your experience\nas something that advance you the most as a photographer and an artist. Was it, you know, a new environment that you're\nin, technology that you're able to use. What was it you think that helped you the\nmost as an artist and photographer? [ Inaudible Remark ] >> The discovery of the scanner as a tool\nwas kind of haphazard but it was when my kids were really young and I had--I was doing lots\nof laundry and I had this lint trapped in the back o my drier and I was collecting all\nthese beautiful circles. It was a circular lint trapped and I was collecting\nthese stacks of very beautiful differently colored circles of lint, and I had just bought\na scanner with my colleague from graduate school and she had it over in her apartment\nbecause my apartment was way to chaotic. But something just prompted to take these\ncircles of lint over to her apartment and put them on the scanner. And I was immediately taken with the ability\nto capture these nuance of color. The color is very straightforward in scanning\nfrom object to scan. And the level of detail that I could achieve. And it really was this kind of breakthrough\nmoment as an artist. I had always wondered, you know, how could\nJasper Johns create, you know, a thousand American flags, what was going on. But it became my tool and it became this way\nto focus my energies and to not only focus but then to broaden out again. And I'm still completely taken with the flexibility\nwith which, you know, it allows me to photograph and design. So finding that tool was crucial, was crucial\nfor me. >> I think that's a good question that you\nasked. I think--I worked for Richard Avedon in New\nYork City in the mid-'80s, one of the world's great portraitist and I had admired him for\na long time before I actually had the opportunity to work with him. And that was a real galvanizing experience. And I came back from that year, back to the\nCalifornia Academy of Sciences, where I had my studio, and had a position there. And I became obsessed with the notion of making\na portrait of a plant or an animal. And I wasn't really sure if it was possible\nto make a portrait of a plant or an animal that could evoke the same kind of emotional\nresponse that a fine portrait of a person could. And I do think it's possible. I've been doing it ever since. But that was a real kind of shift for me to--and\nof course, you know, removing the background and the visual isolation. I certainly was influenced by the time that\nI worked with him. And the earlier question you asked about what\nadvice would we give. You know, our work I think, I can speak for\nboth Josie and myself, especially when she was talking about those--the lint. Because I saw those pictures just last week\nin her house. And I love them. Artwork is about seeing. It's all about seeing. And you can see amazing things in--everywhere,\neverywhere. This place, this Romberg Center, boy, I got\nout of the car and I was like, oh, I need to come back here with a camera. I'm sure I'm not the first person that had\nthat idea. So, it's about looking at things perhaps in\nnew and fresh ways. And underwater, I think it's a wonderful way\nto experience underwater whether you're a snorkeler or a diver. Those are I don't think my most important\nphotographs. But whenever I go snorkeling or diving, I've\ngot a camera with me. And it's how I experience what I'm seeing\nbecause I'm wanting to see what it looks like. I just want to see what it looks like. I think most important thing is to just do\nit. Do it and continue to see and you'll be surprised\nand you'll discover things. And it will tell you what to do next, just\ndo it. Yeah. [ Pause ] >> I'm not sure this is an answerable question. It's sort of an anthological question, but\nI mean as someone who believes in science, I think that form comes from function. And yet, you look at these--some of these\npictures and you have to just say why? It's like diving and seeing tropical fish\nand you know, they're [inaudible] in colors and they don't really need to be that colorful,\ndo they, and yet--you know, I don't believe that God decided, OK, this one's going to\nhave this color. So--But these portraits that you take by isolating\nthese organisms to me at least raised that question. I wonder if you guys--if it raises that--those\nquestions for you as well. >> Absolutely, I mean these--the science in\nmy books comes from those questions. Absolutely, why is this bright purple? Why does this have this odd, you know, [inaudible]\nto it? Why does this one bleach and that one doesn't\nbleach. I mean, it's all--the questions come from\nwhat you're looking at? What is smacking you in the eye. And so that's my way into the science. >> I always think about that. Why do mantis shrimp have that incredible\nvisual acuity? Why is that? What can they see? There's--you know somewhere, there are answers\nto that question. Why does the animal who lives inside that\nwhite egg cowrie, why does it look like the night sky? Why is that? So, you know, a lot of times I will talk to\nthe scientists I'm working with and ask them questions that come up, you know, just my\ncuriosity. Sometimes they'll have clues, sometimes they'll\nsay, you know, really we don't know. But if I were going to go down that line of\ninquiry, this is what I might. I might wonder what it feeds on. I might wonder if it's nocturnal, I might\nwonder different things. So, you know, I've been able to get a little\nbit of an insight into how a scientist would approach that, the whys. But there's so much that's unknown and this\nis very exciting because there are reasons for everything and some of the stories are\nmarvelous. The things, that are known about, you know,\nadaptive--because I do believe form follows function, of course it does. And to the extent that scientists can reveal\nthat is just wonderful. This the great detective work of science,\nI mean, science is so exciting, you know, I think. >> Well, this is definitely not a scientific\nquestion. I mean, I should pass this on. You talked--Susan, you talked about making\nyour subjects as comfortable as possible, the octopus for instance. You were--The way the water comes in and the\ntemperature and its needs there, what happens to them after you're finished with your work? Do they go-- >> Thank you. The question was what happens to the animals,\nshe was talking about how I try and make them comfortable which I do. But then again, how do I really know, you\nknow. I have to take my cues from the people who\nknow them best, which are the scientists that I--and the field biologist especially that\nI attach myself to, and observing them. And then she want to know what happens after. Most of the time, my protocol is and the protocol\nof the expeditions that I'm on and the people that I work with is the animals are returned\nto their natural habitats. Particularly with that octopus, I mean, there\nare some very, very high value species that--I mean, every--it's the protocol at Friday Harbor\nMarine Lab. I mean, it's--you know, it's like a law. You can't--So, and it's also the right thing\nto do. However, that said and I actually got to personally\ntake that octopus back and really sit off the dock, it was a great, great honor. The very first expedition I went on was part\nof the Census of Marine Life and that was at French Frigate Shoals, which beyond the\nisland of Kauai, maybe about 300 miles. And that was one of the--probably the only\nknown expedition, it was a three-week expedition on a research vessel that was staffed with\nthe world's top marine invertebrate biologists. An expedition focusing on that realm of life\nthat never been mounted to that area ever. So it was--you know, there was a presumption,\nwhich was correct that probably, you know, a lot of new species would be found because\nof that. The only way that scientists can determine\nif an animal is a new species is by actually collecting that specimen and preserving it\nin alcohol. So on that expedition, it took us a very long\ntime to get the permits to actually collect because--so those photographs, that was the\nonly time in, you know, almost 40 years of doing this that the animals were routinely\neuthanatized after their portraits were taken. And that was kind of hard for me because I\nknew it was their swan song. But, you know, in the case of that beautiful\nKanaloa squat lobster, it's the only known specimen. It's preserved in alcohol somewhere. It's a beautiful animal. They're more down there, they're just really\ndeep and these kind of expeditions are very hard to fund. So hopefully, you know, there'll be more that\nwill be discovered and released back as the years go on. Typically, they go back to their natural habitat. >> And mine go into my compost bin. [ Laughter ] >> Well, they were washed up. So please join me in thanking Josie and Susan. Terrific presentation. Thank you!", "hGzrpPmwiug": "great so we'll get started thank you so much so I'm Nikolas bar I'm an American Family Therapist I've been working at them how many plates for over a year now and I've had the great opportunity to really develop and put into practice a lot of the stuff that I've been developing learning training in till the last few years so it's been a really special to kind of have an incubator to to really advance my specialization in Harley place and thank you both mark and Lori has been really great okay my background just quickly go to Nairobi University as opposed to University of over they have a cymatics graduate program there and an undergraduate specialization to California Institute of internal studies up in San Francisco there's another graduate program at JFK in Oakland that also has a cymatics program both of them have great continuing ed programs their workshops that kind of thing also to the EMDR here at Burlingame and some work of the late bill Boeing so you know because we've been sitting all day as we've been trying to do since very very little in classrooms we're all very good at it but I think that comes with the cost of perhaps feeling and connect being a connected being connected to anything but know the lower neck perhaps so one give us a chance now to actually practice a little bit to start us off for the day last part of the day so this is probably my favorite little experiential I do marry me somatic groups and my mindfulness groups just to bring the level of safety and containment grounding in the room which then allows the patients to access mindfulness or the skills were practicing or the more challenging subjects we're addressing more wholeheartedly with more resources yeah so I think this is a not only just for us in a room together to any practice some semantics but also if you want to keep that reserve around the background okay I can do this animation was true yeah part of that especially with strong one is I like to be very Invitational right just respect boundaries so you do not have to do this you're welcome to sit out but I only ask that you are not disruptive you can do whatever else you want just don't subscribe to others Adam so you're welcome to let your and find yourself this posture or a seat where you feel settled in I call it stable and correct both of those qualities both of stability like a mountain but also that strong peak where you feel tall alert and waiting especially late the afternoon and you can if you feel comfortable in your eyes come to Chloe's or you can lower your gaze and already we can simply just notice the quality of our thoughts you don't have to change them just noticing you know are they focusing on future the past think about the traffic on the way home excitement this pecan pie and whatever it is you don't have to change them again we're just noticing whatever the thoughts are do it right and if you're doing this with our patients who might spend a little longer here to keep moving along just noticing now bringing our attention to the places in the body where we are in contact with the chair so this is the surfaces of the body where in which we're in contact and we can feel our body touching the chair there may be particular sensations here warm the particularly / cleanest flowing as stuck a heaviness lightness we're just noticing whatever particular sensations are there we may even notice what it feels like to allow the chair and hold us dropping and yielding our weight into the chair and inviting the chair to lead us up to spring us up [Music] just noticing the particular sensations there in a contact and we're moving now our attention down to the surfaces of our feet the bottom surface of the feet where were in contact with the ground again nothing fancy here just whatever sensations we notice or cool tight loose flowing stuck the heels the arches of all the toes [Music] and we're going to direct our attention to the second left toe second left toe just notice whatever sensations you feel they're really focusing that attention in on the second left toe if you need to wiggle it you're welcome to just to kinda add some sensation now from the very tight focus of the second left oh I would like you to open your attention now just attune to the fuse awareness of the entire body notice anywhere that stands out any particularly strong sensations could be tension in the back the neck to be burbling in there in the belly anywhere you notice it now direct your breath there so this is the first time we're linking our breath up now and invite yourself to three directly into that particular place if you want you could imagine sprouting like a mouth for a global right over that particular place in the body's here reading directly into it if you want you to pick another sensation gonna play some body and again send your breath there nothing else to do just sending our breath to that place of my body good we did let go of the body awareness and instead just direct ourselves to extend to the duration of our exhale so we're trying to prolong how long it takes us to evacuate the air from our body one way to do this is to constrain the exhale back puckering of the lip system our breathing out through a straw called a straw breathing just just nice and slow letting it out prices good now we might bring up a recent memory of positive memory or it could be something distant but a strong memory where we felt particularly safe particularly loved particularly value maybe we thought powerful might make the picture a little bit more for yourself really noticing about the surroundings were like many get directing your attention back and noticing how that's shifted enniaa sensations in the body maybe there's a new quality and breath if your posture shifted or there's less tension or more tension and then coming back to that memory again of the image that represents the memory of that positive experience we had and just inviting some nice full breaths as we think about that we're going to enhance this if you want get invitation-only you can place your right palm very gently on top of your heart now to find your heart you can take your left clavicle or collarbone and come down up three ribs sometimes a little higher than you think it is just really softly placing that hand there noticing what it feels like for the hands to touch by leaving the body to touch the hand so we had simultaneous sensations going on with the body touching the hand and hand touching the body and then both the other palm placing that over your navel very gently over the navel did an invitation if you want you can we just want to apply the sense of softness as though we were holding out a young sleeping puppy just a real gentle softness noticing the sensations again the work for the hands touching the body in the body touching hands in the final little bit here is Burma trends into a self hug where we take the left hand and dig it as far as we can into that armpit and with the right hand we put it on the arm so it becomes a bit of self-talk and just letting the shoulders release as much as you can as you breathe nice and fully okay that's it so we just did a brief little tour of different little different skills there let's see whether we do we started with to do whatever they want we didn't have to change them and just let the thoughts do their they wanted really nice way to establish mindfulness very quickly right it is a non-judgmental perspective and from there we've been noticed where we're in contact with the chairs so immediately we're bringing our attention to our peripheral nervous system yeah hoping to ground and settle us into the present moment yeah then coming down to the bottom of the feet even more peripheral and really quite neutral it's a nice safe place to always bring our attention if we're feeling flow your associate are out of the room or starting to get anxious can bring those sensations a focus of the sensations of the feet to the foreground then from that we focus and even tighter onto the toe and that actually takes a bit of effort to really refine the attention I think that's a really nice way again to practice more soul and finely tuned attention in the present moment yeah without having to it's straight from the hero now or our connection with ourselves yeah that we've opened up to a diffused sense we noticed whatever was on a foreground of our experience wherever he goes that usually it's my neck in my back from me make my tummy and send our breath there sometimes it shifts our experience sometimes it doesn't can be soothing sometimes people with headaches fun is really helpful just to bring their their breath and send it to them yeah so it just a quick survey we did a positive memory we reached going to be prolonged the breath I noticed what focusing on a positive memory did to our body yet to track how our body organizes association with that memory in it and we placed our hands on our body and maybe had a physiological response to having those hands placed on a particular places yeah yeah any questions or thoughts about that as you get started these things that felt particularly relaxing or kind of like didn't work so well for you yeah there my heart good say you've never felt your own heartbeat but here we are you get to actually sit there and connect to it right it's amazing every moment of our life that hurts them something and we can actually kind of have a direct line of communication to it yeah so this becomes really useful information for not only us as as practitioners when we're sitting with traumatized folks but also for our clients to learn how to track their own physiological responses yeah and let them know that something's coming and maybe they need to divert with some coping skills yeah so there's lots we can mine from that and maybe we might think of some of these tools later on talking about techniques I need to kind of scoot yeah okay just what we're doing why we just give back because we're gonna do it so what is so Mattox so max generally is I'd say when we break it down it's the felt sense of being a body it's not becoming aware of the body as though we're just brain that needs to like oversee the wild phenomenon of the work of our course you know but instead it's about becoming aware through the body yeah and the each system of the body has its own kind and quality of awareness its own kind of consciousness yeah that it's trying to dethrone the central nervous system as the only kind of consciousness that we have and instead study the other forms of calm that are distributed throughout the body that system the vast system of intelligence we have in the body yeah and it's quite it's quite diverse as a field yeah I think originally most digitus knowledge would work under the paradigm that we mind and body or one others unit using these two things and slowly through a rust-free tradition there's business ISM has been created between mind and body because it was quite different that could have you know something to do with religion and the West and looking at the feminine and the body and the earth is full and sinful etc etc could have things to do chicken right right that reductionism and mechanisms materialism but later in the late 18-hundreds and in the early nineteen hundreds but philosophers were studying the body and what it meant so her soul and merleau-ponty we're trying to figure out what what are these phenomena that we experience in the body and how can we understand them not in a way that could through a microscope but really through our own felt experience right our lived experience it was only later that that was then adopted into the healing art form so it was first kind of the philosophers who were tinkering away at which sometimes seems to be the way there's a bunch of names and people if you're interested I put them on your slide just because each of them has their own unique kind of take on and this is not by any means comprehensive every time I put a name down I had to like knock 20 others you know there's so many people in this field it's really fast and boy anybody that really stands out so a big Richard Cohen she's still alive and still teaching to use awesome I really recommend looking after her website volume is entering the valley there's Cohen she's cheap looks at each particular system of body and investigated it for years of what the felt quality and the intelligence of each system the heart the lungs the veins of them all that really intricate work very meticulous yeah and so finally we're catching up right I think tout physics is finally catching up with the quantum mechanics quantum theory but I think the whole field in general is fun the understanding that we can't really keep these categorically so separate anymore yeah cool ok so one of the things we were doing there with the practice when we started was tapping into our felt sense this is a I would say a core feature across most of the somatic therapies out there is that particular quality of the experience of our body now I like this drawing here because it really highlights why it's important for treating trauma because when we're traumatized we stop being able to really sense much of the of our wholeness in the body but instead we're really on the threat alert we're looking we're orienting for threat outside yeah and what my little toe feels like it's quite irrelevant you know for that so simply by cracked same peripheral peripheral awareness we can be teaching our clients and resolved to tap back into that sense of wholeness and unity of being connected to our body yeah and that can be really terrifying for obvious reasons right don't go straight for the heart center or the throat you know don't just don't do that first you know start with the bottom of the feet the very nice is your true place to establish some kind of felt sense awareness right or the contact of the body on chair yeah so just languaging because we don't typically have much vocabulary the language to describe these these particular sensations in the body I wanted to give you any list of different vocab words of describers for these particular sensations they may have heard me saying things like heavier like or hot or cold or thick or thin they're flowing their stock curved constricted or moves all of these are really useful to have in our nomenclature really readily if we're going to start to studying sensations yeah and we're going to ask our patients to study sensations so we have to be able to model them support them intact in their process of studying there any thought sense yeah I think it's really cool the fact that he was studying sensations broke it down elementally so each element had a different quality of sensations yeah in fire air earth water but the fire in temperature was the temperature of the sensation air being is moving or is it stuck the water is it not sure but he had a whole system so there's many ways we can conceptualize all these different qualities and sensations I think the biggest one is that many patients won't realize they're having sensations if it's that kind of uniform so mundane hum of sensations though they're not feeling anything well actually it might just be very boring and mundane you might not be feeling much just this little tiny vibration and that's that's it that's that's never there's never a lack of some kind of vibration in the body because all the cells and molecules are constantly worrying around okay so even the most subtle sensation is precious and something to study and be careful and notice we don't just want to notice the giant sensations that have a sign on them that saying hello I'm here you know beware or whatever cold so that's why this is here really okay we're gonna talk a little bit about how our nervous system works with arousal before we go any further any thoughts about sensations and the stuff we've done so far you're following yes cool okay so maybe I'll say tell story so I lived on a comm unit and or in for a summer doing a permaculture jig the design certificate in my you know college years and as you do you know and my friend and I were smoking a little grass out in the forests as you do a common in Oregon and we kind of got lost I was forced to argue there's a lot of trees and they become quite you know confusing at times so we have we happen to pop this green field this pastures mode look really nice and inviting like oh my god finally someplace safe there's a gingerbread house over there is no interrupts there's a giant black animal running for us and the next thing I knew is I was like about a mile away you know I was somehow a mile away and in recollecting what had happened my friend and I had just bolted and running through trees you know like there's a tree there but it didn't really matter you could just kind of run through it you know and or a bush or whatever it is you just go through it and then eventually like we got to her senses about a mile away and said you know what that was a dog but that part of the brain wasn't there yet there was not a lot that's that's what we're talking about with this nervous system arousal we really need to be able to trust this I mean I'm happy around from the dog you know it was a scary dog didn't be there already okay so classically we break down there is system into two different branches and if you want to have a healthy balance between these two on the left side we have the parasympathetic and this is where we're hoping to be most of the time this is the rest and digest nervous system and it's just kind of you know some blue you know I consider all the different organs and how they're affected in the parasympathetic this is useful and probably pretty intuitive the fact that when we're in our rest and digest safe nervous system blood is flowing to the intestines we can you know digest easily get our nutrients from our food blood can flow slowly so the heart beats slow lungs aren't breathing fast etc Center right the pupils don't have to be dilated because they're not searching for threat and we can have sexual arousal in these places right but once we go over to the sympathetic nervous system the fight-or-flight nervous system suddenly arousal doesn't make any sense neurologically right or aura adaptively we want to run from that big black mammal that's running towards us and then again our digestion isn't really important right there you might literally evacuate our bowels share our pants to avoid wasting any blood it could be better used running or fighting from a threat yeah so again it's really good to normalize these systems with our patients that like this is just how our body reacts to threats like you're not weird right this is smart this is evolutionarily adaptive and the question is does it get stuck right everything's stuck in that system that's when it becomes maladaptive yeah cool trying to get quickly through this we have the triune brain three different levels of the brain and the very kind of center of the brain we have a youngest oldest part of the brain the reptilian part of the brain the same years 500 500 million years old crazy and it's response to threat is to freeze to imitate death to immobilize yeah super old-school like what a loser does or a possum does or were to tear does in the headlines yeah now the limbic system is a middle part of the brain again pretty old but not as well as the reptilian this is where we're going to be more active we're going to mobilize towards the threat either running or fighting yeah and then the most recent adaptation is this brilliant neocortex that we have sitting on top of the other two and there we don't actually need to fight we don't need to run we don't need freeze and if if we can use our social skills our social engagement system to navigate this will save ourselves a ton of energy we'll just talk it out right we're going to talk it out and try to figure out the threat in a more creative fashion yeah cool but it's really hard to be in this neocortex if the fight or flight system is activated this is perhaps my favorite model right here and I could spend I don't know forever talking to you about it and getting curious about it but this comes from dr. Steven Porges he's in Cleveland he's awesome and he has given us these three different segments and broken at Dallas not just these two wings the sympathetic and the parasympathetic but he's looking at the very particular nerve that is regulating this arousal and it's the vagal nerve the vagus nerve and on the bottom we have what I would say self and an ifs sense we have that safety the curiosity the call all of the qualities that we can work out by using all of our neurological creativity and apparatus that's sitting on top of our brain right but once our arousal or physiological arousal gives something we're starting to activate that fight or flight system now we're either going to flip into fight or flight and all of the associated qualities of those two have we're going to lose a lot of the creativity and openness and groundedness the ability to talk it out once we flip up them to this state yeah there's all the particulars here of what they're doing and really interesting we'll come back to that now at some threshold here that dotted line have a have a laser plant it's just not at the dotted line it's the threshold between being capable of responding and incapable powerless over powerlessness or powerless so at some point our nervous system judges that there's no point in fighting or running we're just gonna have to dissociate pretty darn hard here yeah numb ourselves out and try to minimize the actual harm or damage done to our consciousness yeah so we can see this with many animals when say the leopard gives the Gazelle right and just the firm grip around the neck eventually they just go into this free state and it increases their ability to stay numb right so we suddenly get all the pain the endorphins rushing in to help us just deal with it we might have kind of out-of-body experience depersonalization and derealization experience we might even fully faint just to not be present at all yeah they're really tricky here is that all of these motor impulses that are happening here to fight or to run away they're not going anywhere when we freeze they get stuck in the system yeah this is a bit of this like the burdens if you will of these parts of these protectors that when we successfully run away from a big black mammal in the forests of Oregon one faded summary we actually used all of that cortisol all of the activating fight-or-flight arousal and hormones to their completion those are gonna mile away and so the muscles have had a chance to really process and work through all that stuff right same thing if I got in some kind of find a fight with the diamond we were be able to process all that stuff but if we quickly had a surge of that adrenaline and cortisol a lot of good stuff but we immediately felt powerless and responding to it all that impulse to action has been frozen stuck yeah and we're just thrown up into this dissociation now we can see that this might happen chronically to kids growing up right where they are around these giants who they depend on for everything and they were powerless with so they might flip into this freeze and faint state a lot yeah there's a lot here any thoughts about it questions and visual freight that lets say oh absolutely told ya and seeing everybody almost everybody shaking their head hurt maybe you're personally remembering her from your clients at 7 thank God we do I should say like hallelujah we have this response and we need to again normalize it validated this is a way of maybe out lying with a with a protector a manager or firefighter to validate it it was smart it was an adaptive response then I thank God we can freeze and things what if you really had to be around that whole time and you were being taken advantage of or when you're being humiliated you know did you really want to be present fully for that little you know no no of course not right there you're an impossible situation so this is really an adaptive strategy for our nervous system to be able to manage what is otherwise totally intolerable yeah cool so other things that happen here is that we're bonding and belonging down here this is where the self is happening where we're able to have the healthy attachment system going on where we can connect with oxytocin and vasopressin the bonding and belonging hormones coming from the heart now for the avoidance the avoidant attachment style my guess is they're pretty much usually in in these two right and when they start to fall they start freaking out so they thought again but thought and it frees you to make sure that they don't have to face all that the hands up stored up stuff that's been waiting for them from past traumas yeah the disruptive attachment relationship yeah so what we're trying to do is actually hold our nervous system as a scaffold for our patients we want to become masters of regulating our own and you make I mean if you're in practice as a therapist or position you're already doing this you know what it feels like to get activated emotionally your arousal to get activated in the room and looked out you have all types of an implicit or explicit ways in regulating your nervous system to stay present and grounded with your patient not very quality as we do that with our patient we are unwittingly actually lending our nervous system to theirs we're helping them feel safe around it and bringing down their arousal or saviors or hey to talk about this yeah okay another way of conceptualizing this is the Babel window of Tolerance this is a more popular concept so it's weird because from the previous one that blue section the frieze has now been dropped to the bottom so that's just the only kind of weird part about putting these next to each other is the frieze and st. is now squarely on the log route but the same XY axis for you arousal schedule on the left and then time the idea here is if we have only a certain amount of arousal to really handle both keeping the social engagement system going while being able to stay open and creative and have the self bleed yeah so I broke it down here the bottom will be in the Friesen thing and they'll talk will be up in a fighter flight however traumatized patients this becomes skinnier the window will shrink yeah because the episode of trauma was so terrible that they no longer can handle that around yeah I like these little illustrations of the cute little penguin and I found these just really online little easy you can search them does it you can don't miss you can't see the link but if you're just a google image these things it's really great for handouts for your clients right these are meant for psycho-educational handouts because clients need to know I think it's very helpful for them to know how their nervous systems affected by trauma yeah of course there's paradise to be happen and what we're trying to do with our clients is help them stay within the window yeah but also how to open the window back up that's my next light here proud of this game so the metaphor I use in patients is like we're in the bathtub and the water starts getting hot and we can dissociate when we get numb out not realizing it gets getting hotter or we can turn on the cold right so we need to learn how to regulate our nervous system arousal by tracking its signs and signals that is starting to heat up we're starting to have higher arousal and then putting into place skills techniques you were just talking about something hopefully it bring down that arouse just activating that social engagement system or noticing our sensations in the periphery or prolonging the duration of our exhale any of these particular techniques to regulate the nervous system back down into the optimal arousal zone yeah now that the other implication of the window of tolerance is that once we've learned really good regulatory skills that we can turn up and down the nature of our our nervous system you want to be able to stick around longer for hotter water and cold water without dissociate yeah to expand what we can deal with what we can handle that these are different phases of of the treatment the first really much more about stabilization how to get them to not just use alcohol or their behaviors their maladaptive you know to minimize the burden on those spirity that are managers or protectors to to give them new skills to be more more adaptive now how to regulate yeah who any thoughts about the bathtub Straight Talk run away destroy your memory you got it so it's seeing how a child is able to fight with their parents without the parent hurting the child but like being able to receive it and then respond effectively or to have the child people run away and they adult not take it personally but say okay they neither space I'm going to make sure they're safe but they can take their space if that's happening that we're out there were allowing them to have that fight-or-flight responses their own boundaries with that so you don't have to rely on the more primary you know primitive defences exactly and I guess here we don't need to sit the bath tub with them maybe it's as though it's like I guess let's that story with them Jackie Chan and over the West sounds like our Cowboys they're sitting in the two bathtubs next to each other it's really funny they're their ghosts just well there is no shanghai yeah that's excellent so so the city of the bathtubs next to each other it's so cute in a bother and and so we are like but we are like that with our patients we have our own further longer we have to be regulating our own arousal with our patients noticing our countertransference if you will and then not only implicit like trying to regulate ourselves and tolerate the effect we're experiencing but then we're actually lending them just my being in the room with them of lending our voice contacting contact statements maybe even encouraging practices of explicit coping skills we are lending our nervous systems event so they can learn to regulate better this is really what ancients were being what parents are doing with infants as I've been really primitive free parenting we're we're organized otherwise the fracture parts of our experience the effect of our experience or somatic arousal or experience otherwise was so intolerable to a parent the Mary couldn't handle it organized either we need to be you know master parents in the way we can handle them organize all of that I mean disorganized stuff yeah this is my my a particular term I don't take credit for the Goldilocks zone of proximal discovery yeah it's a good balance of like like anyway so growth happens we're uncomfortable about when we are too uncomfortable so we have to repeat that off ad nauseam with our patients that like you know look this is gonna be uncomfortable you're gonna you're gonna have to try new things and take risks you know feel things you don't want to feel other thing things you haven't want to think and notice sensations that you have trying to try to deny right good so we have to learn to track the nonverbal signals that we're getting formations to make sure that we're not throwing them into the deep end or we're keeping them in that blue green area yeah cool quick overview of the basket Association model came up in the 80s guy named but it wrong it's very sophisticated and I found it kind of hard to crack when I actually rather the primary but the basics are that we can break down our experience into these four different categories in the acronym of basque so first of all behaviors for the effect sensations of knowledge now when we're dissociating we cut off those pieces we psychically you know fracture them off of ourselves they exiled them so behaviour that looks like we just we just don't go there anymore right what do you I can have sex because it's do you have today or you know I don't hug you know or whatever it is we're just actively blading cutting away that from our experience to avoid having to experience yeah same thing that affects like lesson idea or just yeah not to sadness if I heard that one before that's a given I recently had one I live on the top 20% of emotions that's a graph I'm superlame very explicitly I'm go see our metrics on that one and sensations like we might have old swaths of our physiology where we were unable to notice and feeling these sensations where that chronic freeze and numbness has just completely cut off from places in our body of our affect in our body yeah and then finally knowledge just and usually we don't remember I don't know but the pressure of pushing all of that aside all that dissociative pressure can create anxiety and obviously depression and all of it but then also the it feels like to every action there is a equal and opposite action so we have to have the intrusions that pop them back into our awareness triggered by some kind associative element so again we have reenactments that happen when we're avoiding it this can just happen like our body takes over or just watching ourselves behave in a certain way effect where we're flooding you know we were completely in the shame spiral it's up is feeling we don't like it we don't like it but here it is I was not breathing regularly it's like a really disorganized aspect state this is from Pat bogdan's work she's a student she came from the Comey school that she founded sensorimotor psychotherapy psychotherapy this is her text it's awesome I kind of recommend it more highly it is comprehensive it's called trauma and the body aptly and if I could just make this a presentation I would because it's just it's excellent I've done my best to do her justice she does she has an institute that does trainings as well so definitely recommend checking her out or if you're interested in your own therapy to start getting investigatory on her own somatic experience it's a great gripping to look up somatic experiencing or a sensory motor therapists so she recognizes that this is not a stage based kind of model of phase we're gonna have to circle back around on earlier stages as we move into the deep dark parts of our treatment yeah so she proposes three different stages and treatment the first is stabilization this is a bit like seeking safety to the same kind of model seeking safety developing resources for stabilization so it works Felicity and relaxation skills grounding skills we are Co regulating with an establishing safety in the relationship right and rapport trying to knock out some of more acute stressors in their life so they're not going to be doing a trauma treatment and suddenly they're addicted or their whatever comes up right but actually instead using the current stressors in life as the tests studies the case studies to stabilize with to practice all of those grounding and containment skills by addressing all the current stressors yeah which we kind of double second to do they do this yeah until we feel like we're ready it's safe enough that we can start processing processing is a bit like desensitization where we're able to actually start facing towards the previously associated material whether or not it's the effect sensations the met explicit knowledge or concepts of images were we have to have that kind of bring it all attitude at this point where it's like okay we've got our kit we've got our tools are ready to start facing the stuff I think this it was trying to get ready get ready Akuma doozy of a come here he's trying to align this with ifs and in the stages of treatment and I'm kind of happened a bit of a tricky time but certainly stabilization is becoming friends with and and restoring the sense of self right and like magnifying their qualities of curiosity of compassion of clarity calm right so that when we start processing I think that's when we start aligning with the managers although we might be doing that stabilization - yeah right it doesn't really matter you're not gonna spend all presentation on that that's where I'm going okay and then the finally integration of the final days it's that it's now something that's a part of our past right it's not something that is long it's no longer haunting us as actively it still can pop up we can still have flashbacks but it's not as disturbing anymore it's just an associative memory that still has some charge and I know that I'm not there and it's not appropriate for the situation I can manage that I have the skills to manage that and still stay engaged with my life I don't have to avoid situations anymore it's a really great promising practice right okay so we're gonna kind of go step-by-step through that those three three tiers of how we're treating yeah okay so the first one is just some explicit resources we've already done some together at the beginning and the next techniques for the therapist to practice when you're in the room with a patient to enhance it this is called shuffling and that which suddenly we're going to learn how to do some body reading and and then practice contact statements that include and what we noticed when we are reading the body noticing in their body and then finally just kind of a quick little introduction to ventilation and titration from up here with Ian's works really somatic experiencing yeah cool um there's a little kid with a little dingy thingy and he's running on earth he's being state because it's got a flowy right we want to be safe - we want to have our floaties and we don't want to learn how to swim when the boat sinks I stay padlock on foundations it's like cool so you learn these skills don't wait until like big alarm bells run if you got some fire girls we gotta like practice this so that when the time comes they're ready for us their worst they're waiting in the wings to come out and support us yeah so kind of like we're updating their litter managers we're trying to support the self to be able to learn how to manage when the Exile gets active managers and the firefighters to give an alternative so we did some of these we just quickly won some orientation it's it's really quick we can just look around the room and by looking around the room and twisting our neck just a physiological act of me turning my neck around and actually activating my spatial awareness I'm looking at the space that I'm in the colors the shapes the where I am located compared to where you're located what would the bird look like if it was looking through the ceiling where would they all be right all that kind of ensures that we're safe yeah it sends a signal to the body you know I looked there's nothing there's no threat right you can literally just look under the you know you're sure they OCD folks would love this once I give you a warning on that I keep looking yeah yeah but it's good because physiologically we can get frozen and that freeze faint zone and stop looking for friends private just first rigid locked in okay okay but instead we're gonna we're gonna relax and actually use our neck to look around these they're actually imprinted come on like check it out you know that that it's like that kind of cliched thing that happens in horror films or like the you know is it's like and they get frozen something's behind them but they can't look you know they can't look whatever it is it's just Terron is it yeah it's that run you know I just get out of there they can't because they're stuck in this freeze so I recommend that we help with our dissociative patients are really highly dissociative create cue cards for different places where they feel activated dissociated that give them a menu of different things to notice in each place so if we're in the doctor's office knives be activated the doctor's office because at one time is family and instead you know so if you look at the paintings on the wall and the doctor's office describe them to yourself what's happening in those count how many chairs there are how many magazines are there what are the colors and the magazines right get really specific about the details and that can help a patient really repeat themselves in the present moment and orient themselves to safety I'm fine I can look around I'm safe yeah signaling into the mind that there's no threat I am a little topper sauce we practice the prolonged duration on the exhale so this particular breathing exercise Scouts there's like every type of breathing exercises Under the Sun exists right the benefit doing prolonged exhale or we're really focusing on trying to extend the duration of the out-breath is that every time we breathe out our parasympathetic nervous system is activated every single time you breathe out every single time you're breathing I'm going to do a sympathetic nervous system so if I can put more focus and more duration just on exhaling I'm doing myself a world of good and bringing myself back into the breasts and digests social engagement or system yeah optimally we want to be in a good balance of both and we can breathe in and out normally of equal duration you know it means so that we can have a balanced it's healthy to have a balance but most of our traumatized patients are not going to have a balance their sympathetic is runaway supercharged so we need to give them these techniques to really stand the duration of the exhale yeah I like the strawberry a missile animated a cartoon and when trouble focused CBT which is used a lot in medical files therapy they explicitly teach the therapist to lay down a therapy office with a cop on their belly and to show that their their client how the belly expands and contracts when you breathe right and that's it's fun kids love it oh my god that therapist is on the ground I've done that with patients adult patients and they like it too so it's just a weird convention get out I'm gonna lay down another couple of my wire come it could be anything okay so just shoveling this is a nuts and bolts like somatic psychotherapy 101 technique be cool if we had a little longer me to practice it here together they'll be done so we're going to just talk about it how we shovel our attention back and forth between our own physiological experience what we notice our sensations to be the aspect and emotions where we're feeling the charge in our body and then don't even pay attention another client at that time just don't even talk to them you can let your eyes rest on them because that would be kind of rude but you're really directing all of your attention to noticing your own physiology your own arouses and sensations in the body and then you notice it good shuttle back to theirs what do you notice in their body how are they breathing what are they are they moving are they stiff are they relaxed loose one of the patterns of their of their body when they're talking right all of that had a good week notice that we shuttle back to our own just noticing our own sensations our breath it's so simple meanwhile were all quite verbal so it's not like we're missing their content of what they're talking about right it's still going to comment we're gonna hear it but we're just directing our attention to notice the sensations in our body and their body and everybody in their back it's a really good way to not become overwhelmed with our countertransference right because we're going to notice it really early if we do that you notice the early early hands students of the particular in a grandmama transferences yeah but it's also going to help us relate with them we might notice that there's some mirror and going on or some empathic attunement where we might catch something in our home body of their experience before they notice it themselves okay so my heart might start sinking and John might start classroom right my pelvic floor might start much anything we don't see anything else in that what has changed but then you might be curious and wondering what's happening me do what you notice in your body right now as you say that and they go oh yeah tightening there oh interesting let's get curious about that boom right I was there so I could send to a lot more like esoteric realm this is not somatic spas one I still find this to be extraordinary people a lot of us are intuitive and it could be intuitive but there are some people out there who have mapped out the particulars of what every little by signal and sign means and what it could have correlations to how we organize our lives in our experience it's really hard to read oh sorry but you can check out Vogue della and body manic therapies came out of write and Kettleman and all the structural work right I mean this is really cool so just even looking at the basal or all the muscles on the bottom of a Kaffir and they're associated with just our balance and group interaction I just think it's that specific my first supervisor was a Batala therapist and she told of elbows this these all those here all about boundaries and making space and groovin Gary for me anyway and everyone's been do a crowded concert before elbows are like a real big deal right at any crowded concert where you really have to make space for yourself how are they organizing their elbows are they do they just drop by their side today are they active anytime all that we can notice so good even here it says that there's the like if we have our floor is always up there may be a belief associated with that I'm always in danger by the quality of fear and in that we start getting clued into how much material we were missing when we weren't paying attention to the body it's a ton you know vessel member cook says it's the holes of score right and really by orienting ourselves directly to how they're organizing physiologically we're looking at how they're covered and the 80% of themselves as organizing experience and the other 20% is the verbal that we're able to talk about it and CBT right so when we do notice something say hey we are talking about that I noticed that you stopped breathing after it's nothing new we took contact statements all the time with our patients about their thoughts and their feelings all the time oh it's sad how to feel sad yer or like how humiliating defeating that must have been for you huh they're just simple contact statements that show that were there or listening and to bring attention to something their experience so all we're doing here is just trying to add somatic contact statements into our already developed a contact statement practice so it seems like you're not is tensing when you say that as you say those words your hands curling outward into a fist huh I wonder what that's about yeah to bring our quality of curiosity into that and then that's gonna Clewiston severe transference onto us so we might notice that our patient is always on the front of their couch sitting on the edge of the couch and they're maybe on the weight is on the balls of their feet and you know they're kind of tilted away from us curious I wonder you know what that's about about how they're relating with us are you really feeling safety with us they truly are they really feeling safety if they're about to run out the room you know or another patient who just ladies on the couch and sloppily disregard for your pillows everywhere you know shoes on you know favorite blankie what does that either how they're treating us in the room right of course these are all these nonverbal signs we're used subtracting but then vice versa we also want to track her own how are we called into response what posture are we in chronically where this patients probably gonna be different than the other patients and that might give us something I wonder if a lot of people are like this with that they elicit this from a lot of people in their life yeah or I wonder if there's a part of the neck style that feels like I do in this posture yeah so we can get a lot of information by just doing that shuttling exercise back and forth back and as we use contact statements for developing the clients sophistication in tracking their body experience so that eventually they're just like the self is slowly running the show the clients slowly running the show understanding how they're organizing experience outside the room have noticed you know when I was with my friends and they said this thing I just I just drew the troops I didn't have anything to say you know it minded me of how my dad used to criticize me ah good there you go you're tracking it right and sometimes it's just as simple as noticing the shift in posture and alright I used to do that bro now that's that's very familiar cool just shut down yeah another fun technique comes directly off that oftens work but I think homie does this to somatic experiencing does this neural affective relational model does this a lot of the somatic people thank gosh Gestalt does thing like this is nothing new we wanted to experiments yeah try on new behaviors also just try on same things new skills and see what happens in the room but we're going to do mindfulness like we did at the beginning of our practice so it wouldn't so one eye to the patient the one who sits on the front of the couch I asked her first let's establish mindfulness we did a little bit of mindfulness practice notice our sensations or emotions or thoughts breath and just settle on the breath okay I'm noticing just this neutral space you're in right now I just want you to say the word no okay try again and then BOOM but I throat broke I have my voice cracked but a heart sank I didn't feel strong they're cool so what would happen if you were to just try it throw your your chest out a little bit more what happened if you you brought your chest forward stood up a little straighter okay now try to get what happened if you stand out no yeah there goes where they buy but you know you got some force and boom chaos demonstrandum right it's like done they can maybe get it when I'm not what I'm certain my boundaries I'm not really assertive and you can teach them the words of language all you want but if there's still cowering underneath it they're not going where she really needed this is a particular plan Laurie and I work together but that helps I think this current treatment of us what happened is that she said we were working with I need help please help I need help yeah that one just brought her that she was just boom I've never say that I'm so autonomous I'm so independent I'm afraid of asking for help boom boom boom boom or but we can get it simply by establishing mindfulness and finding these core organizing themes and trying to not wasn't like to say notice how you organize in the body let's get curious about that cool and then I listed some other processing models we're familiar with I brought up st booms AMD or and the basics here MGRS that is doing what I think Pat Ogden's doing here but accelerating it through the proper power of this bilateral stimulation yeah it's just activating the neocortex to organize the material faster or which has normally Morgan Utley would be happening during rheems paramus Lee and getting that stuck material in the middle of rain that is in the freeze and the faint and the fighter flight and allowing the neocortex to organize it just by stimulated back and forth back and forth back and forth between the lobes right yeah any thoughts or questions keep digging okay so I'm going to talk about Peter Glavine and the ways I hope would make him proud um I'm gonna speak up so Peter Levine says the nervous system is like a slinky right and at times it's quiet and sometimes it's loud and it should be able to bounce up and down and up and down normally I thought about it's like mark when he was visited like a puppy gotta get you some kind of dick bag Lauren stuff Penda you might be fighting you know whoop right hopefully it's organized like that whisper fighting to my feet running we might be whispering to a friend or writing in our diary right and what happens with the fries are faint is all of this energy gets caught slammed into the slinky and it's like we got this vise around it that keeps it tight in there yeah our job is not to allow it to just just just just volcano about to see you I think he'd be proud I don't know for that but instead to just eat it out little by little little by little little by little by little by little until they have their nervous system back to have their life yeah hello so that's the idea of of titration like we're in chemistry class again dropping the solution not trying to over saturate the solution just drop by drop by drop we're tracking their physiological since the signals of their body we're noticing our counter transferential signals from our body and to know that okay this is it we don't want to push them any further it's time to instead pendulum to swing our attention over to a calm and safe place or resource right all the different schools have different particular ways of doing their call and safe place but it's really important to be able to establish something where we can actively dissociate together we're gonna distract but it's going to be a healthy adaptive way of distracting all right let's talk about that time you play with the horses or let's talk about that meditation retreat you did on the mountaintop let's talk about the snow low fight you had with your whatever like - or let's come to the base of our feet and notice the sensations on the bottom of our feet good what are you kind of sensations do you feel there yeah I'm gonna wrap up um there's a few more slides here about identification and integrative capacity I think the one thing I need to say why don't we look at integration here that third phase thanks for your patience and for sitting all day is that we can recognize when the exile is activated and take care of it yeah we can recognize when we're activated and manage it and still stay present in our life knowing that that's something different that's in the past still still activating a little stressful but we got it we can handle it so this is a nice example right out of the Ogdensburg so the client who experiences panic symptoms not scream the client who experiences panic symptoms when men get on an elevator with her must learn to discriminate for internal experience the racing heart and constricted breathing the feelings of fear for her current external reality that these men are her own colleagues like liked and well known to her and there are other people in the elevator she's able she has the skills to protest she's got an active fight-or-flight response as she said needed to keep her safe right and find out another example so this one's really nice given the negative feedback in a supportive manner by a co-worker she extinct instinctively coward without realizing it it was an artifact from her childhood abuse even when it was a supported feedback she was getting triggered into this cowering stance so she reported interpreting this incident as an angry attack although she didn't tell it intellectually that this was not the case so I think this is my biggest take-home here I'll finish her negative capacity was undermined as her cringing body posture rendered her unable to interpret or respond appropriately to the present moment no matter how much she told herself she was not danger to overcome this distorted and inaccurate mixing of past and present she had to learn how to boardings away from the trauma rate with related stimulus and toward her sensory motor experience so instead of cringing she learned how to stand tall right the alternative response it was unable to be fulfilled when she was being abused right so I tell my patients a lot like you know your body is sending you these signals and your minds gonna do this best to rationalize them to make sense of it right and if it's stuck in there the traumas still stuck in there I'm still cowering my mind's gonna be like oh there's something to cower about I'm gonna look for somebody power back I'll give you a thousand reasons why you're being abused right now right to make sense of that signals coming from below so we need to address the signals who below to have an alternative response otherwise we're gonna be stuck with these panic attacks that don't make any sense I'm an anything I'm gonna keep breaking down in tears why do I keep like we're organizing that experience is physiologically we need to learn how to respond differently to it yeah so many questions inspirational quotes yeah stabilization and the last one was integration pumps that processing yeah so you know containing the current storm just regulatory mess that we have going on the the use of all the old coping mechanisms and firefighters and managers and learning other ways to cope in a more adaptive manner so that we can then turn towards the stress actually bear even more intensity as we then go into the next phase of processing of facing following stuff right and then finally we should be able to have a new friendly inviting welcoming self filled relationship with that previously exile material and then move into the third phase of integration where we then turn back towards our life and figure out how we can live again and engage in things that we've kept away yeah yeah oh thank the patient aware of your ethics before they start with you yeah again to that location yeah sound so you're like don't start a recession or something this order that's right yeah I still wanted to be a client directed to my well I think like in how Comey is the use of Systems Theory principle called word Anissa tea and the idea is that if all the different parts of an organism are in communication with all the other parts then it'll naturally heal right just there's this natural quality of life to heal when all the parts are harmony yeah so our work is just to simply attend to that and bring the splintered parts back into the fold and the clients are gonna bring their data yeah or they won't didn't want to call them on it but gently and thank you so much I hope you take care of yourselves in your bodies tonight's treatment [Applause] you", "YiN_hpgTbmc": "what is up youtube it's your boy it's your scottish government for 204 coming at you with a quick video man uh before we get into when this video is 21 plus 18 plus it's a cannabis video you know i'm a medical marijuana patient of new jersey so but yeah we're gonna get into this you know fast and easy it's gonna be a pretty quick video we're gonna i'm gonna show you guys what i bought take a dab and then in the video after that give my little review on the wax and stuff and then in the video i'm gonna then go to sleep because i'm [ __ ] tired low-key and by the way i've been dabbing this for a while super terpy fire but anyway it's called durb and terpes uh e85 jet fuel x uh jeffy x biscotti one ounce jar ounce of concentrates but yeah it's definitely crc but i don't mind it it's really some fire bro to be honest with you the taste fire the effects of fire it lasts a long time so i did the spoon test because you know i like this first off i looked this brand up on reddit or you know whatever the urban terpes i looked it up it's obviously a black market brand and you know a lot of people were just [ __ ] talking about it but people who had it before said it was fire so i was like whatever bro i'm gonna just [ __ ] buy it do the spoon test if that shit's fake i'm gonna get my [ __ ] money back you know i'm saying so basically the spoon test is where you drop some concentrate on the spoon you heat up the spoon from under it a little bit until it turns to a puddle then you put your finger in there the wax and you take your finger out and you let it cool down for like two three seconds and then you try to like peel it off and if you could just peel it all off or your finger like candle wax then that's just fake but if you can or it's pine resin probably but if you can't it just smushes around then it's real wax and i did that and it [ __ ] smushed around like a [ __ ] i could not get that [ __ ] off so that was a good sign but yeah i've been smoking it honestly i've been getting high as [ __ ] so you know this [ __ ] is fire like i'm not nobody it's just like any other wax i bought it's fire yeah this is my first day smoking d9 like dabbing d9 in a while because you know i bought this ounce and i was like [ __ ] i'm about to buy this ounce and [ __ ] i bought the ounce i took like you know a couple dabs of it i've been dabbing here and there but yeah that's just definitely fire i plan on making some edibles with it tomorrow so you guys will probably have a video coming with me making edibles uh i'm trying to get this but the consistency is good it's kind of like the wax wax i've actually reviewed on this channel that like white looking crc obviously wax it was fire obviously some of the best wax i've had on my channel and uh it's kind of like it gives you like that it's like more like sugar wax than live resin i'd say hey let's see if we can get a close-up real quick on this try to get this one scoop a close-up let's get a focus man you know i'm it's most like 90 short crc which i'm fine with that honestly i'm not really worried about it being crc a lot of people don't like crc i'm not really worried about that as long as it's [ __ ] real wax you know that's all i really cared about yeah definitely [ __ ] the smell is [ __ ] insane all that [ __ ] though bro i'll give you a little look at the jar if there's anything in it by the way it's from this piece of paper because i i had to scale it out so i put it all on this [ __ ] piece of paper and that parchment paper i used to press a nug so it has so much [ __ ] plant matter on it and i got all the plant market matter on the [ __ ] [ __ ] so i was like damn ain't that unfortunate we're gonna dab that right there that's a [ __ ] glob take a little tiny bit out of there but yeah it's some fire though i ain't gonna lie to you bro it's definitely some fire i'm waiting to [ __ ] to uh make these edibles you know so let me show you guys what that means by the way 30 quick little uh you know still a little bit of wax on the side too dirty as banger i know kill me look at that is i don't know why it does that that's from the reclaim that i smoked out of this one time left to stay in forever you know so def oh my god almost [ __ ] broke it definitely gotta get a new banger soon bro but wow look at that that looks [ __ ] phenomenal i'm not even gonna lie to you got a zipper this let me know what you guys are thinking man did i did i just buy meth like this is not meth by the way youtube don't delete me man that was a joke but yeah like what like what the [ __ ] did i just no it's wax it's good it's fire definitely honestly off of smoking and [ __ ] like the times i smoked it you know today i'd say i would recommend people buying it by the way look at this [ __ ] carb cat bro broke just a couple minutes ago completely like just broke hopefully there's no [ __ ] whatever this is made of hopefully none of that i'm guessing glass or whatever it's not glass i don't know what this is hopefully none of this pieces gets into this that's what i'm really hoping because i'm not trying to smoke whatever the [ __ ] this is made out of all right anyway we're gonna hit this [ __ ] up we got the blazer we got the [ __ ] gt blazer lit up you guess a little look of it you can even see seems like and it tastes good though like that's the thing about it like even if it is crc which is like 99 sure it is it takes fire by the way crc if you guys don't know crc is just it's color remediation column column whatever it's called and it basically it's just something that people use on their wax to change some [ __ ] not like you know some [ __ ] that doesn't look too fire to some fire looking [ __ ] basically it's what people use to change the color but it can be dangerous if they don't like filter it right or something but like for the most part it's not dangerous a lot of dispensaries sell crc and pa you can [ __ ] look it up damn that [ __ ] takes fire though i know some of you [ __ ] out there smoke crc every day man definitely some fire taste i can't wait to get my other [ __ ] bro my d8 i can't wait to get that i got this [ __ ] really for edibles i'm gonna be making a [ __ ] ton of edibles with this at least two to three batches i'm hoping i'm gonna do one batch first see how it is do another match um dude i'm [ __ ] smacked man shhh my eyes up i thought it was like it was street still like even though now it's like reclaimed can i reheat reheated so many times still not a bad taste to it [ __ ] baked i've been texting and [ __ ] through this video that's the last dab before bed d9 man so [ __ ] bait tomorrow i should have a [ __ ] uh product

to the customer 420 till i'm a fan of them but bro i saw a video of this [ __ ] throwing out crc wax i was saying it was garbage whole time if you go back to his old videos bro literally 80 percent of the city smoking is [ __ ] crc like bro what i couldn't believe it when i saw that video i went back to his old videos and literally literally everything he was smoking was [ __ ] crc you can look at it look at his old videos just look at the quality of the wax i mean some of it was straight up shatter and [ __ ] son actually you know straight up pressed rosin shatter and [ __ ] like that that wasn't all seriously but the live resident [ __ ] that he showed [ __ ] like that bro he had crc look you gotta look at it man i mean not every single video let's see i see but i said a couple little [ __ ] but that's what everybody bro uh and i'm not this is no dis to everybody i mean i'm smoking crc right now but there's a lot of [ __ ] i see smoking crc strange show or strange central i mean

needs but his name is reclaim [ __ ] that [ __ ] i seen a lot of [ __ ] smoke crc bro but you know it's it's in the wax community man it's there ain't getting rid of it [ __ ] like to make the product look a little bit better than it looks which is whatever as long as they filter that [ __ ] right what do they think boys", "WMvL2-tBEUU": "[Music]", "Hh9EVakX8AY": "machan was the first guy out here in the 60s and 70s to be serious about making fine wines in this part of Sonoma County he was originally a dancer which is pretty amazing he was very quiet was a very skilled dancer dance at the American Ballet Theatre on Broadway at the Lido in Paris and in France he fell in love with wine and he obviously his quote on the page which reads I knew I couldn't be an old dancer but I could be an old winemaker so that's what he did he came to Sonoma County originally in about 1959 and started making wine in Tiburon and eventually by Jacques Hill property Alexandrov at Valley properties so he was a real risk taker and a real pioneer and one of the great innovators and so we take our inspiration at the winery from his example that he said in 1989 the winery was purchased by the Klein family Tom Klein his family who are fourth fourth-generation going into fifth generation farmer farmers out of Stockton California they bought the winery in 1989 as I said it's it's a famous the winery where we're sitting we're just I are sitting the tasting room was opened in 1971 they've got the winery in 1970 there wasn't much up here in those days in terms of wineries very few so again it was a big deal to be here tom-toms they're farmers they come from a background of sustainability taking care of the earth were very much sustainable winery were focused on all of that the way we handle all of our everything around here the water the land farming all that stuff's very conscious about how we farm and that's not a nice place to work in that case it's a beautiful place and innovation we go to the next screen I talked about staying with the innovative thoughts that Rodney strong had and who he was Justin here has been responsible for an awful lot of the stuff and I'm sure we'll talk about some of it but we were certainly pioneers and in what's becoming a very popular technology of of square tank fermentation we have a winery with 50 square stainless steel tanks that Justin helped design 57 if you count the baby ones 51 big ones and 6 baby ones baby ones are adorable by the way if you ever come to the winery we'll go to the square tanker that's fun so that's one of the things things we've innovated in also Justin's always the newest equipment that makes lines better so we have oh the latest in optical sorting technology rotary barrel fermenters which is pretty cool to see yeah and Justin here also designed one of those fermentation eggs but it's half oak and half stainless steel it's that's pretty cool things you see I haven't tasted the wine huh how'd it come out pretty good shot in there it should bring some you know all right I'll get to what is this secret it's a sin okay she cut it one guy you gotta know one guy and then of course we recently well we developed over the course of 20 years really one of the last if not the last straight vineyard site in Sonoma County which is we call cruelly ranch which is above link Sonoma in a spectacular region completely undeveloped that we put in 200 acres up there and it's I'm sure the site when we talk about Ron at the last one we'll talk about that site a little bit but that innovation is what we lean on just as Rodney did so we continue that tradition and of course our first wine is from Davis Bynum the Rosie Davis was another pioneer in the Russian River in the sense he had the first tasting room in the Russian River he made the first single vineyard Pinot Noir in Russia river so we acquired the Davis Bynum brand in 2007 we made it here at the winery wonderful wines focused on Pinot Noir and Chardonnay and a little Sauvignon Blanc and of course Pinot Noir rosette so another legacy that we were happy to carry on is that up Davis's he was a he was a terrific guy so that's just a brief little background on the winery we should just get to the lines right once listen to me so we'll start with the rose egg this is our 2019 as you can see Rosa of Pinot Noir well I'll turn that over to Justin it's it's a hundred percent Pinot Noir single vineyard pitbull correct so this is a first main major vintage of this wine for Davis Brian it is a single vineyard wine coming from the James branch which is the backbone property that sort of an interesting property was a originally developed back in 1968 and by both and away Rodney strong and Davis - they each bought two parcels right next door to each other and then subsequently Tom Klein purchased a third parcel right next door to those back in the 80s and then when we decided to unify and relaunch Davis - a single vineyard focused brand for Pinot Noir and for Gundy and varietals we reunified those three pieces into one vineyard called the James ranch which we named after Tom clients mother Jane so this vineyard is in the middle of the Russian River Valley right smack dab and what is now called the Santa Rosa plain and this piece of ground used to be underwater used to be part of the Laguna de Santa Rosa and so the soils reflect that they're very shallow clay-based soils and right below the topsoil maybe 18 to 36 inches down depending on where you are on the ranch those soils you are you encounter a hard pan let's call it thermically and there's pretty much concrete you can't even really break through that with a ripping shank it's so hard so it really naturally inhibits the growth of the vines allows us to grow with beautiful density and complexity of flavor due to the naturally low yields naturally controlled vigor of the vine because even though these soils hold a lot of water they're so shallow in depth that we get small routing routing zones and routing areas and that leads to these really balanced beautiful lines so this single vineyard site where we get this theorem are from does a great job with with that philosophy this is very small production 300 cases it's just a little bit about that well your inner cases so it's not a lot of it and I'd not intended to be a lot of it's just trying to make a really interesting gorgeous Rose a I love the I thought the flavor of it it has it has first off great acidity got a little bit of a little bit of an tingle on your tongue from a little co2 which I love makes it pop I just pops in you're not moving you know kind of love like any watermelon job everybody I'm not yeah yeah and really lovely Rose a and Rose ice that was easy to make us people think well because everybody makes it but a lot of people make lousy roses so there's really a couple ways to make rose a there's a the standard method which most people do which is called a semi a basement Rose a and that means that they're taking a byproduct of another fermentation they're doing a drain operably docks thenyeah is French for bleed to concentrate the flavors in that original tank and so they're instead of throwing that byproduct of juice away because it's very valuable you can make Rose a editor so it's a fine way to make rose a there's plenty of good ones out there made in that philosophy but the problem with that is when you make your rose a with that method you have chosen to pick your grapes for an entirely different purpose and so you're automatically compromising on some of the quality benefits that people really like from Rose a because of that your vicinity will be lower your fruit flavors will be more heavy more like dark chocolate dark cherry or red red cherry and not the same fresh floral light flavors that you get with the watermelon straw arian and Laurel characters like you that what we do is something called an intentional rose' and that means we're taking grapes for this wine we have selected two blocks on this property of clone 1 1 3 and clone 7 7 7 and these crates are grown just for Jose so we're taking very expensive grapes $5,000 a ton grapes and we are choosing to make Rose a with them we're not saying well we have these are expensive we don't want to waste all this juice let's make a by-product wine that we can sell quickly by doing that we can pick them less right which is what we do about 20 21 bricks that leads to lower alcohols about 12% fresher more natural acidity or delicate fruit flavors and we're floral components and just that more fresh embodiment we use them sorry just one more one more you get a winemaker talking and we talk sure that so we use a philosophy that I got from the people at doe may not as the kind of our our style and so that they are you doing it strictly as an intentional lying they're using different varietals than we use but most of their protocols and philosophies are something that we would aptitude here at runs strong in in to expect the may knots one of the great grows a producers from Provence and France I mean they're one of them they're one of the they're one of the maybe one of the most famous roses around except for Brangelina I suppose domain height goes back a long way before that great rose is such a versatile wine with a lot of different foods it works with a lot of things I'm a big fan of having it on a picnic with a bunch of charcuterie it's it just works it works great so don't be people tend to just drinks Rose a for the heck of it but it's actually really good at the table so I love to bring it with which dinner I often what my wife lets have Rose a tonight she loves rosette but she likes less I'm married what do the acid use is really lovely what would you guys pair or well you know I think it goes with a lot of nice dishes I it's hard in some ways as long as you have the acid works with a lot of that happen I'm stumbling because there's so many things I do really like it with I can choose a charcuterie plate I like it with with the right kind of chicken dish it's pretty darn good too a lot of Earth's seasons on the chicken it just looks great you can do it also wasters yeah you could do it with any kind of salad that might be something that people are trying to eat a little healthier when you're stuck in your house all the time watermelon salad yeah just using vinegar or acid based dressing there's just you know one of the heavier dressing yeah this beautiful one I like that Rosa and I'm picky about was it well let's go on you want to try the upshot let's go up jack does anybody has any questions feel free just in wait your hands are anything you like up shot well up shots are white one that Justin came up with I always wanted to know I was thinking about this today cuz I don't think I've ever asked you that when you sit down to decide will do this blend this is the second where did you start starting to vineyard everyone we make doesn't matter what we do I've always started a vineyard and so this wine as well as the upshot red and even the Rowan which we'll get to last all of these wines came to me while walking vineyards and the vineyard speaks me in a way where I think they worked the works all together so this wine started because I was up in Mendocino County walking very very old in fact the oldest commercial Ernie Irvan years in the United States at the hush video and I was walking with the winemaker and I had this concept in mind just to try to create what's in front of you and that's that was the aha moment of walking that vineyard while tasting the hush perverts in the vineyard with the winemakers and then parlay it into the largest component in this line which is the Grenache Blanc which comes from a very cool site in a so-called windmill farms and I was down there with a friend of mine her name is Audra she's uh kind of knows everything about the ins and outs of Paso and she brought me to the site and I was immediately taken aback by the 20 beautiful windmills that scattered through this property and it's one giant kind of big rectangle of property and going up this slight incline with all these windmills and it's awesome and then she told me the little tidbit that oh by the way this was owned by Alex Trebek and I said done I'll take I'll take it not the vineyard but some of the fruit and and so between the Olga verts and awesome Grenache Blanc and there's some again another really cool whole small vineyard that typically gets decimated by pigs in Monterey that has cool DNA on it you know we we contracted by 25 tons of DNA every year and the most I've received is eight if the pigs pigs typically get on my fruit why they call them things yeah so bottom line is we I got started by looking at all of these amazing sites and thinking about how they would blend together thinking about it from a vineyard perspective and everything that I do from a winemaking perspective starts in the vineyards I I say that as 90% grapes 10% winemaker and so good winemaker can find those exceptional sites and so that's what we've done with I feel like Don Quixote walking through that probably yeah I walked through the vineyards and I tell them to get the hell out of them I'm wearing my winemaker uniform which is typically a vest and a black shirt well I don't have like the sombrero and so I like the idea and that you know look Alex Trebek owns over here is pretty cool right and then just for the other than you to mess with you I decided to put red wine or red grape into the white wine so when you read this label which is a very cool label it's a whole map of a timeline of the whole process we went through you will see because it tells you the entire blend Pinot Noir on there and that's not a mistake I actually take any more grapes I make white wine out of them because I just squeeze them really quick in the press to get the juice out with no skin contact and that comes out looking white and so it really adds freshness and complexity to the way yeah when I taste it I don't know how many of you were tasting it but I get a lot of like almost key lime and then kind of peach I made a labor cut and you get that little bit of governs flavor in there a little low a little wide sheet but it's a pretty interesting wine to taste it's a lot going on in it it's hard to nail it which is what a complex wine does is right but why only smells like one thing that's not really a complex line it can be delicious but you wouldn't throw complexity yet this I like this one I drank this the other night it opened by the way I drank a bottle been opened it was on its third day been open for the third day was open it's in my refrigerator and I my wife had made again it was a chicken dish actually and I so much she had this Thai chili lime covering on the chicken I said the upshot would work and it was sensational it was really good and it had been open for a couple days it was it had lost much it was really so now I'm really without you because I've been chomping at the bit all day long to talk about my food pairing for this wine oh sorry and now holy is it really yeah my daughter so I have three kids and my nine year old is really into cooking these days so we have her getting this box monthly box called radish I'm not sure if you've seen it but if you haven't it's fine and get it here sell for your grandkids or your kids and the dish that she cooked out of that box yesterday was like a tide chicken lettuce wrap oh yeah with some carrots and some bell pepper and chopped nuts and it was like a nine year old cook this food but no but I paired it with I've shot white and it was like the perfect pairing what so fairly there's your uh it seems to work with that taient yeah a little spice in it really work yeah well I mean it was my wife was skeptical and I you know what I'm gonna do if it doesn't work you open something else you know you can't cook another dinner so just open a different bottle right so so that's the upshot of all these white grapes so the name up shot means the positive outcome of a series of events and so this is the upshot of my passion for blending and once at least blending white grapes hello for the red grapes and we'll get to the red upshot which is similar a little bit yeah anybody got anything for us okay I know we got it all covered here we're telling you too much let's because we always tend to go from lighter to heavier we're gonna we're gonna go to Pinot next and then get to the upshot red this is our Davis Bynum 2017 Russian River Pinot Noir uh this I already know I like this one so and this honors Davis who again was one of the one of the real pioneers in Sonoma County was feeling orange not many people make it been aware before Davis was up here can't think of anybody now most people that were growing Pinot Noir back then didn't even know that it was you know that's right that's true so that you know so Ryan mentioned that Davis bynum was the first to make a single vineyard funeral our back in 1973 and when he bought those grapes that single vineyard wine happened to be from the Rocio Lee property Joe Rocio Lee at the time didn't know that he was going Pinot Noir he was selling those grapes as mixed Reds to italian-swiss Coney which was the biggest winery in the area at the time for $30 a ton today those grapes sell for $15,000 a time and when Davis walked the vineyard because of his time in Europe he knew exactly what he was what he saw he knew that it was butyl are and he immediately made a deal with Joe on the spot handshake deal to buy the grapes for $300 a time versus $30 and Joe was like okay done and that first first batch of grace became the Rocio Lea when you're 7 1973 Dave explain 73 Rocio Helen vineyard Davis's vineyards or his property was which were planted after miraculous basically right over the hill they're they're right next door to each other and they were friends and neighbors for a long time Davis always got Rocio if Ruth even when Rocio Lee's got famous and everybody wanted Rocio a fruit Davis always got whatever he wanted from the roof yoli's they're always grateful to Justin we have a question from Mike Hill asking how long should you let wouldn't open up how the Peter why yeah um you know I always like to let a wine sit for if you can grinning not very many people can about a half an hour you have the time in the fortitude to do that you almost always enjoy your glass of wine better than opening it at Corrigan immediately but you really don't need to but if you can it won't hurt for me out when I when I no want to make it for dinner on my watch like your dinner I get the wine when I pull a cork and I pour it in a glass by the time we're done cooking it just was a half an hour 45 minutes you know you taste it at first but then it's just way better after 30 45 minutes and they'll continue to improve that's why you always tend to say the last glass was the best well yeah you're not drunk just turns out the one who just keeps getting back or maybe you're drunk but this is a mix so this comes from James vineyard and then death in a dead ranges so so Russian River Valley became quite big and intrusive from an ABA perspective and so several years ago a bunch of winemakers got together and led this initiative called the neighborhoods program because we found that there was different areas that I wouldn't say that we're making better wines and the other areas but they were making different lines and so what we did be a series of tastings and then post tasting started doing some actual scientific research was to find out how they were different and through that process we came up with something called neighborhoods we we are not going to go through the process of dividing up Russian River Valley into a bunch of small EPA's but what we are what we have done is sort of started talking about the different areas of Russian River with that term neighborhoods and so we've divided it into five areas the Santa Rosa plain which is where the James vineyard is which is one of the warmer areas it's also where some of the oldest vineyards are there is the middle reach which is right where the Rocio leave in your days today that's on an area surrounded by an area called West Side Road so if you recognize wineries like Williams Salem and Rocio Lee and to me and there's a bunch down there we kind of call it millionaire markets where the most expensive land is there's then the Green Valley so that's where Iron Horse vineyards is that's where linn-mar State is that's where Paul hobbs is that kind of area and that's the coldest section of cinema of Russian River Valley then we have the newest area which is called the Sebastopol hills and that's out where litter is a very southern part yeah hey it's a rather kind of the newest kids in town and those are younger vineyards planted on the like pretty far close to the coast where there's very windy exposures and typically dropped up on top of the hill because if they were stuck in the valley they wouldn't have any any of us I'm sorry do you hear any of us yes I can hear you now oh good because um I think I think we have questions and and you don't need to do all the talking well Joe absolutely I'm after that okay someone said a while ago that Pino should be just a little chilled is that correct well first off you never want to drink a wine that's warmer than 70 degrees because 70 degrees is where alcohol becomes more involved so the wants to warm you smell that so I like it you know I I aim it 65 degrees if I can be nuts I'm not taking the Tatra see I the people I see on this screen are all on mute none of them can interact with you and talk to you and yet I think that's the fun of the of the wine rep presentation instead of you doing all the talking yeah we made a note in the in the notes that you're more than welcome to unmute yourself and ask questions it's just to prevent the there's 72 people supposed to prevent the background noise but you're more than welcome to raise your hand or type it in and we will arm on you it's just like the background I never got any recognition so I decided to unmute sorry about that no absolutely more than welcome to your about the land and the hills and the grapes and blah blah blah but I think a number of us may have questions you can also members your spacebar and that will do off mute temporarily so try asking your spacebar there you go yeah believe me we'd rather answer questions makes our job a lot simpler hey I've got a question for you yep what makes the Russian River Valley such a premier place to grow up in alarm the simplest answer is the climbing we get pretty cool mornings which allows the grapes to kind of rest and and that moisture helps the pinot noir not desiccate and too much heat peter moeller raisin very quickly and then the other thing is the soils are mostly made of something called goldrich and that is a sandstone soil that's very well-drained and pairs really well with strength you are so when you pair the soils with the climate and the exposure to the fog it makes it an exceptional place to grow you know turning the fog comes in every evening in the growing season so Pinot Noir is an early ripening red so if you brought away Cabernet out now it's in their valley which often doesn't get any overcast they would write them too quickly and desiccate so that over that blanket of fog every pretty much every every morning it's the big deal that's a said climate but it is about when they when the grapes ripen if you with Cabernet down where people are crows the Cabernet is just never going to get right because if you pick it last the days get short it's covered in fog won't happen you put Pinot Noir where it's really sunny out in Alexander Valley there's I don't know there might be an acre or two of you know our Valley maybe not any because it gets right way too fast and you just can't make good wine and the soils away but that's a good question let's taste the line a little bit yeah so this is coming to different neighborhoods the santa rosa playing the james vineyard is about 50% in the green valley which is the coldest area which is where most of the dutton ring edges are is the balance of the wine and it's all aged in French oak for about 12 to 14 months to give it the hints of vanilla hi we have a question actually how is climate change and the forest fires affecting your growth well the fires weren't any problem because of when they occurred we had and most people had picked most of their fruit before the fires happened so once you have the fruit in the winery and you're not covered in a lot of smoke you're not going to have any kind of smoke date so fire is no fun all of us got evacuated and didn't have any white quality very little effect in general climate change well we're trying to work on that now I mean we we haven't seen any real effect yet if you look at our vineyards over say a 10 or 12 year period we haven't seen consistent warming we haven't seen a consistent cooling we we've had you know cool vintages and one vintages wet vintages and dry vintages just like we've seen in any ten or fifteen year period before that so we can't pinpoint any current an immediate effect due to climate change on what we do what we have found is that areas that we didn't think were suited to growing grapes before namely the stuff way out on the coast which we always thought was too cold now we think that conveying actually can grow pretty world-class wines and that's more of a shift in philosophy than then effective climate change we've realized that highly acidic low yielding vineyards are okay and we don't need to have super deep soils that yield a ton of grapes which was the old mindset of you know the last generation of grape growers and winemakers and now we feel that a small vineyard yielding two tons per acre producing fruit that might be a little bit more acidic than then passed was acceptable actually is where we want to be destined we have a question in regards to with blends at what point do you blend the wines the work in the middle of that as we speak so many try to get somewhere between six to nine months of barrel age on a wine before we start blending a part of that has to do with all wine goes through a secondary fermentation called malolactic fermentation that's uses a bacteria to do that versus yeast and so that can take a while because the bacteria are much more sensitive than yeast are and so depending on the alcohol level of the wine or the acidity of the wine or the temperature outside that process can take a long time so by about six to nine months that's complete we have the wine finished if you will it's so2 it's safe and barrel and then we can start pulling all the components and assembling our blend at that point we do that we pump them all out and make our blend and then we do a second round of aging as a one cohesive blend until it's ready for bottling yeah that's a good question people tend to think you know you go to a blending seminar and they've got these finished wines and you blend them that's not how they make blends that's that's a fun thing to do but doing it right after someone malolactic guess what Justin doesn't it's uh it's it's not as easy to do which is why not every wine is great it's it's uh having tried a few times they're pretty young rough around the edges wines yeah there's two kind of different types of winemaking there's the winemakers that want to make everything some sort of a blend and then there's winemakers that want to make wine that wines that are pure and what you have in front of you are two kinds are both of those so the bynum wines are pure wines and well yes we're making a blend it's all piano are and it's mostly from the same sites either the Dutton properties or the James ranch we're not kind of pulling stuff from all over the place and then when you chase the upshot wines and the growing line last those are true blends that we are thinking about different varietals and how they interact and different sourcing locations at least to the form of buckshot and how that will come out at the end of the day and Justin what was the inspiration for adding Riesling so so that's a great question related to the upshot bread which is the next line that we'll get to and really the the inspiration was trying to make the wine more fun I wanted the wine to be less serious and I wanted some floral character and a little bit additional acidity to make it more food friendly and so the Riesling hits all those boxes yeah the finish with the Pinot though I think my rule of thumb personally for a lot of California Pinot if I just have to state a rule of how long they aged I think that about six years from the vintage they're really hitting their sweet spot they'll keep that sweet spot for another four five six years and then slowly change so I love to drink them you know I've been drinking my own personal stuff from a really good vintage the 14 pillars and they're just tasting gangbusters now they were good then they were good when they came out but this will reward just with a hide one for three or four years you you certainly won't regret it technical question about fining Wow there you go yeah a tough crowd exactly yeah any particular question about it what is fining okay so fighting is why has proteins in it and so there's three different ways we find minders there's the use of either egg whites or isinglass which is a made of fish bladder or what we're using more these days is something called vegetal which is made of vegetables so we're trying to go more towards the animal free vegan type wines all of those components are doing the same thing which is their binding to a certain type of protein in the wine and then settling out what that does is it makes that it just rounds off all the edges so the wine doesn't taste angular the other two types of finding have to do with making sure the wine is stable so if you take a white wine and you put it in your refrigerator it doesn't precipitate out all these little white crystals which you might think is mold or glass or something it's actually something called tartrates and/or if you take your bottle of white wine and you put it in the trunk of your car which hopefully you don't do but if you did and then it was a hot day that wine could potentially turn hazy or even throw something called flock and that's just the protein congealing so think about frying an egg if you crack that egg in that frying pan all that egg white protein turns white that's what can happen in your leg line if it's not it does not bite first ability and so so when we make a commercial wine we're want to provide we want to provide you something that's stable that you can do whatever you want to do with without compromise within reason and so we go through the heat stability to get rid of haziness and potential block we go through cold stability to get rid of tartrates and we go through protein finding to soften and and make that lines edges or more approachable a good question and the different people I often see on wines unfindable turd filtering is and filtering purpose I know but all you do it so I finally in filtering are very different lives right so filtering is just putting the line through a filter so if there's anything in its the wine is a living breathing thing we make it with yeast and we make it with bacteria and things float in the air and potentially can fall into it which could change the wine once it's in the bottle so filtering is just taking that out it's not sterile filtering we don't we're not squeezing every little every little possible compound out but we're doing just a rough filtration that's just tight enough really to fill out yeast that's kind of what we care about most and then it also polishes it to make it look pretty yeah looking pretty counts so gorgeous stuff pinot noir you know a very versatile like obviously you have salmon pinot noir for me but I haven't Sam and I'm probably drinking Pinot Noir and that piano are happens to be unfiltered this is a filter yes so all the bottom lines run filtered so you can see the difference between the upshot wines which are filtered versus the bynum which is unfiltered it was unfiltered you know for sure there's no residual sugar because if there were then you would have problems in the bottle because I'm those those of all there's always a little yeast in there and it might eat that sugar now you've got a bubbly wine when you open it so heat they say unfiltered you know there's zeros in trouble and with a lot of food that's important you don't want a lot of sugar along with a lot of residual sugar it's like putting the teaspoon of sugar and your steak or so let's contrast speaking of the speaking of Riesling so the upshot red is red blend this is I have an enjoyment wine so kind of have two red lines next open next to each other with the rowing in the upshot and the upshot I put into a category that I would call us everyday enjoyment wine and it's not meant to you know be too complex it's really just meant to be approachable and fun and then the wrong one is an ego lining so that's the one that you're pulling out to celebrate a special occasion or impress somebody you know and it's sort of an egotistical type wine so I'm shocked the blend mode wines in then planted in the 1970s really awesome Merlot coming from Knights Valley Malbec and Petit Verdot which comes from our [ __ ] ranch way up at 2,000 feet in elevation and then a little bit of Riesling which comes from Sonoma Valley just to kind of cut through all the tannin and kind of make the wine more fun I have another question yes I just the glass that the wine is served in make a difference so if you were to ask me I say absolutely I am a fan of the right type of wine glass for the white right wine and I'm also a fan of nice wine glasses that are not really thick and bulky I like you know my favorite wine glass is the Rideau venom I think it's Bar None the best wine glass available and you know if you have a big bowl like these glasses that's allowing extra oxygen into the wine so when you're swirling it that oxygen is polymerizing those tannins and making that wine they softer and more approachable it's also allowing those fruity flavors to collect in the bowl so when you're smelling it it's more more enjoyable when you have a little wine glass or you have a glass that you just can't do that and you can't get the right amount of oxygen it's going to affect those flavors and I know wine glasses can be expensive but to me there were well worth the investment especially if you're drinking wines like you have on a table or any Justin we have a question on what are your thoughts on wood wine glasses I've never used one before I would say again it goes back to that same concept if it's the shape of the glass is is really what's important and if it's a neutral wood glass meaning is not going to impart flavor from the glass onto the wine then you know if it makes you happy I say go for it and at the end of the day wines about enjoyment so you know I could be ho d20 about my fancy green omen and wine glasses but at the end of the day I'm drinking glass drinking wine out of a water glass before that's what I had and that's what I wanted to do and it didn't change the fact that I was enjoying my wine so uh do it from an enjoyment perspective you know I'm a geek I'm a Mikey so for me my wine glasses are fun for me and that makes the wine more enjoyable they don't mean that much to you then you know maybe a family heirloom isn't more important or might my wife's father is Italian was a time guy he's got these wine glasses that are short and stubby they have this gold leash around the top yeah and he thinks that you're the best thing ever you know to each their own right yeah I agree with Justin I I tend to drink almost everything out of the same glass because it's a glass I really like I like my feels I like the way like I like everything about it and so I'm happy with it do I need to have an Oregon peel or glass and Sangiovese glass am I gonna have a Chardonnay glass no I don't need that does it change it probably doesn't make it better so regal as a whole whole wine chase newsy popper glasses right so for me there's there's if you want to best the there's three glasses that you should buy if you're looking at from the Rio vinum portfolio and this sort of applies to all the retail lines whether regardless of which one year you like there's the Rideau Bordeaux glass which is the backbone there's the real Savia on class and then there's the Rideau burgundy glass and if you have those three you know you can do your Syrah and your all your Bordeaux wines and all your Rhone wines and most of yours your Argentinean Malbec and that out of your yareta Bordeaux you have your book Burgundian glass for your Chardonnay and your your lar and then you have your Savion Blanc glassware Zinfandel or some young Blanc and shoonoon Blanc and interest champagne which really should be drink out of a white wine glass and not a flute oh oh three then you really kind of going to hit all your marks kind of perfectly yeah flutes are fun but a regular wine glass is better for the champagne there it is so yes fun enjoyable wine and soft it's got good fruit it's got structured you know when I was asked by a marketing team to come up with a little marketing spiel for this wine so I'm gonna give it to you because we're trying to make you buy wine right so you got the Zen is the backbone that places this wine coma County that's the place you got the Malbec which is the soul of the wine that's the flesh and and keeps you gives it a soul you got merlot which is a sensuality and the softness that's the heart of the wine you have the Petit Verdot that's the confidence and the backbone and the shoulders and you have the Riesling which is the fun and that's what keeps you coming back for more if you take those descriptors and you put them in a glass that's your upshot I don't want to know about those wooden glasses does somebody actually have if I can find him in for the link by the way that the president of Rodney strong vineyards is from Chicago and he recommends the upshot red with Portillo's Italian beef sandwiches ah there you go all double talk to me but I hear it's a great place not hungry hungry with this line wine makes you hungry doesn't it you start tasting you just get hungry automatically you know I don't mean that but that food pairing kind of tells you what upshot is about so you know an Italian beef sandwich try to sandwich or just straight to by itself barbecue my wife likes to drink this wine with she's a very very healthy person so she kind of has one diet which is broccoli and grilled chicken sort it and that's what she drinks with her broccoli and grilled chicken yeah so it kind of will check all the boxes again and that's why that Riesling well it's a minor component is important because it brings that acidity in which helps it pair well with a lot of different fruits and it's the owners wife's favorite wine so it he's got a job basic isn't this did he screws this up he's out about that no he won't believe that wineville yeah yeah that's just yes for sure you can make him that every year yeah yeah to me it comes across it's just a nice line the sin comes across to me right away but it's just you know it's round where it's supposed to be round it's it's this kind of a luxury so delicious and again I'm a guy that I'm a geek too like Justin over here as you can tell we've been doing doing this forever I you know I love to try this wine on the second and third day they're really interesting and delicious and really good I always have about at least three or four bottles open from other nights that I taste for fun and a lot of wines tank but well-made wines are always better the second day almost always so if it's fun to not you know to try the second day don't don't just poopoo because it was open a couple days I always taste they're usually pretty good let's let's do the Rowan well here we go this is the most gorgeous stuff so the last one and the most expensive wine is broy so this is not Rodney strong or Davis Bynum this is a new brand that we launched and with the 2014 vintage from Rowan wine company so this is my big spiel of the whole night so forgive me if I get a Rowan is a single vineyard based brand from the Cooley ranch I was hired by Tom Klein in 2010 for this wine or this brand so I came on board after the winery had started researching this property which is the and the Cooley ranches 200 acres blended at high elevations in the middle of 20,000 acre property we did extensive research with the best soil scientists in the world to find the locations of where the plant amongst the 20,000 we then did years of temperature research but tooth and nail with the government to get our water rights and our permits to get a planted which took ten years just to get the permit and then I got to come on board and plant the video and then I built a custom winery for it to make the wine so we spent twenty two million dollars in 17 years to get the wine in the bottle and now we're on our third vintage so that's been almost 20 years a 20 year process to get to where we are today and Rowan is a blend of Cabernet and his backbone with high elevation Malbec for the flesh and the juice and then a very cool component which we did a 3.7 acre block of Syrah that I inter planted with Dean yang so the white grape and the red grape are all planted in the same block just like you'd find in a lot of areas in the northern Rhone we take all that together and aiko ferment that into a singular lot which is about 20% of the wine and that gives it a lot of mystery and a lot of nuance that a lot of people really love the soils that we found plus the climate at this property lead to soft sensual but intense and unctuous wines and rowan means an unexpected windfall so we spent twenty million dollars we spent 20 years doing this and all of that work still yielded a result that we were surprised at so if Rowan means an unexpected windfall and that is what sits in your glass Justin we have a question in regards to the best way to keep a wine overnight is it just the cork is there a stopper you would recommend I would just do the cork you know if you if you have access to a quarter bin because you know you're not going to drink the whole bottle at once in one sitting you know that's probably the best way to do it for those of you who don't know to korban in for event is it's this little apparatus that has a needle that folks right through the cork so you never actually open the bottle of wine and then it uses a gas which is typically argon there's like these little cartridges that go inside it that push the wine out into your glass that way you can pull them korban out and your wine is fully sealed and you have argon in the headspace which is an glass or yours pretty much having an unopened bottle and so well I think that might be a little overkill to do at home that's probably the best way otherwise just the cork works for me and always you know store your resin the refrigerator overnight helps to help slow the oxidation so even red wines if you didn't if it's out half a bottle left put in a fridge it'll keep it a little bit better and then just take it out an hour before you're gonna drink it or get the temperature you want well it's slowing it's slowing obviously wine has two enemies oxygen and temperature you can easily control the temperature the oxygen is I very rarely use anything like a pump to take the air out or a spray I kind of I kind of like to see the evolution of the one and I like to tamper with it I like to see what it's going to do on its own because I've told you a little bit about sage ability tells you about how well-made it is because if you make 50 bucks for bottle wine and it falls apart the second day you were robbed you don't want that way in your cellar yes concerning that on altitude I apply ultra long-haul Jets from Atlanta to South Africa and the company I applied for whoever mentioned sees the why visible there's a problem with the wine at that altitude and the other part of the question is we're on the 45th floor Chicago does that affect the wine taste it off you but altitude does because it shifts the pressure of the ATM which is zooming on the wine and the best way to describe that the best analogy I can think of is bottle shop right so if you once you when you put the cork in the wine when you're making it or bottling it your foresee a shift and pressure inside that model and with having it happening is as you're you're messing messing with the makers so ice made of water and alcohol and acid and phenolic sand there's 50,000 or more compounds that has been traced to in your glass of wine some are very very small some are much larger obviously the water is the biggest and when you force that that pressure you can push all those things apart in a pretty major way and it takes a while for them to come back together so when you fly on a jet and you're flying up at altitude that cabin was pressurized and you're artificially and changing the met make makeup of that wine temporarily it's the same reason that if you go to a really fine line tasting you're never going to find somebody that's going to open a bottle of wine that was just to that tasting with a day before you're always going to have that good taste not all tastings are good they're gonna ship that line thanks to months before that tasting happens because that shipping process takes a while to recover from for that wine to show like that wine maker or marketing person wants it that's a good tip in these days when we're getting a lot of one shipped to us because we can't go out and buy to the store when I get a wine ship to me I don't even open the shipping case for probably ten days anyway so I open it I'm gonna probably drink more the ones I leave it I just let it sit somewhere and reassemble it so it's a jumbled the mom banging around and changes those temperatures at least one of the reasons that as a winery we try to ship our lines to the state that they will be sold in for you to buy in the store up to 60 days before they're actually going to hit the show and that's so that we have plenty of time for that wine to recover from the shipping process before you have the chance to buy it and so you open it even before you get home and so we do have we do have a question in regards to as the screw cap now I'm thinking Kaitlyn and Brad are probably saying that they want the screw cap just to put the screw cap back on but then I did have somebody also indicate don't use the core oven on the screw top screw cap wine still are impacted by the same things that I but not to the same degree because we actually don't pull a vacuum when we screwed out the lines so we only are flowing the vacuum of the cork finishing the wine so it's a little bit of a different bottling process so the discombobulation factor is greatly reduced when you have a screw cap wine though you're not having the same exchange of gases from the inside me out outside so the see I'm sorry the so2 in the bottle will be more prevalent initially so again it's still a good idea if you have a screw cap to open it up and pour it and wait a half-hour before you hear your line and not not a requirement by any means at all but it will allow that line to breathe and open up when you're finished living just screw the cap back on and you're totally set if you don't use a carbon I forget yeah not a good idea and you'll probably break you're proud of it make sure you're done with the core of it yeah that cost like 300 bucks so you don't want to screw it this wine is gonna taste them great I'd love to hear some opinions on the wines anybody cares I think this is really rich I'll go ahead and unmute everyone so if they want to add in anything if you have any no you can remove yourself if you don't want to that way it just give everybody a chance to [Music] let's ask so the Rowan on our we unit yeah I think we're muted no no you're not muted you're okay okay why we can't rate you well so big rich you know a step above s it's meant to be the upshot really gorgeous mouthfeel you get a lot of that gorgeous oak character to it that I like a little bit of chocolate us it's not overwhelming but that I really sweetens it up on your palate so it's really and you always share winemakers talk about balance but and this one has beautiful balance but Justin will tell you that balance is really about the venue balance starts in the vineyard and then the winemakers just don't screw it up if you don't have balanced vineyards being they you get the right yield from them you have them in the right place they're not over cropping they're not under cropping then you bring that fruit into the winery and it's already in a nice spot and then you just don't go overboard and do something silly but if you don't you don't do all the work in the vineyard you don't ever get a balanced one all right you cannot you have some really good feedback here they love the Rose day and the Pinot Upshaw and Rowan it looks like we have a question about a rapport wine stopper you all any recommendations on a report I've never used one Christian anything about them I've seen them I think there are one use thing but as the person who asked that question have you used them how do you mean I don't even know what it is all right so they're brand new they're really really new to the market I only use them once it's something to try we've had a couple of restaurants try them but they're brand new site I don't really know how well they work [Applause] they're hard to find evidently so I was just before I tried to find them I was asking but I've never used it look it's like a 1u stopper like you said I just want you take the cork out you put it in yeah it's what is it supposed to do I forgot it's too preserve the wine for a couple days once it's been open particularly bread I again I've never used one well it sounds kind of gimmicky to me I don't know how it would work okay that doesn't mean I would that would go back to Ron's point which is if it's a couple of days that you're trying to store the wine for it's going to be fine without anything actually probably given there I think they're relatively pricey I don't see what you gave like a piece I you'd have to do an experiment right you'd have to have two bottles on the same wine and open them both and drink half of each and then use one and then the other and see if it actually did it okay I'd be skeptical if that did much good to tell you the truth Thanks no no it's it great if you're a single you keep thinking everybody is married no I don't know what there's a comment on here from Lionel that his sense of smell is a lot stronger than his sense of taste and he actually gets some maple syrup in the upshot I'm red and he loves the wonderful complexity of Rowan so thank you they know yeah Justin will you talk about why Rowan is this the production is so small talk about them like you know the areas that we can source from yes Oh Rose once again a single vineyard so you know Cooley ranch is what it is and it can't be we can't play any more grapes because well I guess that's not true there are 19 thousand eight hundred acres to open it but we did about two thousand soil pits thousand in the areas that we really thought we wanted a plant and what we found was these two hundred acres met the level of quality for the soils that that we were looking for the biggest limitation Rowen itself is that serabian yet component which is 3.7 acres and we're currently using all of that in the wine to achieve approximately that 20% of the total volume and so unless we were to plant more straw VNA we can't really grow it or we would have to change the style I played with it being 10% of the want IANA or human 12 or 16 percent and when I reduce it beyond where it is now I start to lose that characteristic that I loved so much of the line and not willing to do that to sell a couple extra cases if you have a couple of areas of vineyard that's planted that I could graft if we chose to do that but that's not a high priority right now that's currently growing Cabernet that we're utilizing in Reserve Cabernet and so it's got a good home and that's really what limits this particular bottling and then within the Rhone wine coming portfolio there's three other wines that are available direct from the winery that are much higher end and smaller production we have a Cooley single vineyard Cabernet that's 100% Cab that's about 300 cases we have a wine that is to show you the pinnacle about elevation so it's called 2040 because it's sourced from the peak of the property and that's also about 300 cases and then there's a wine called 600 L which is a passion project of mine it's about 55 cases and I do all that work myself and that is about all I can handle by myself with all the other things that I have to do so that isn't going to grow either because I'm just not know he's just damn busy when we have a couple of his specially made this is very expensive table right here that I have one in just as when these are barrels from that 600 that were custom-made for Justin yeah each one of these is about two thousand dollars when he bought the girls so this is very expensive furniture out here but it's an amazing project the 600 ELLs really a nice one and I wish we all could taste but I've only had like once so like we don't get to taste it that much just in there one of the requests what might be a wine you recommend that we've not tasted today similar to the Pinot Noir and Sandy did recommend our Russian River Rodney strong Russian River anything else that you could recommend you know I would say that if you can get it we have a another single vineyard peru are from the blooming vineyard down in the Petaluma gap it's one of our casing reminds that when you if you can try the Davis Bynum and the Rodney strong Russian River versus the Rodney strong Petaluma gap and then you can even pair some of our single clone Pinot Noir from Davis buy them into that makes all of those wines will show you FINA war in an entirely different form with a different style on different you know complexity level so those are all fun the other one that I would look at is our old vines in I think it's a smaller production it's not available very many places but from a bank yearbook perspective if you're willing to experiment with a really awesome zing it's about fifty percent from Russian River Valley personnel from Alexander Valley and it's a it's one of my favorite wines we make yeah the Russian River of Pinot Noir which is pretty widely available that the 2016 2016 was a just a great vintage in Sonoma County and Napa beautiful finish and that wide sandy you know it's I don't know why retails for around the Chicago these days but it's beautiful wine for the money it's it's as good a few more it's yeah it's not the cost twice as much it's it's it's that good I I wouldn't hesitate to recommend anybody that's beautiful me one really a nice vintage so yeah I mean and yeah I I mean I you can probably find it for under 20 bucks around Chicago and that's a total steal you can't everywhere yes yeah so try that and that will make you very happy when you try that so Susan golden was asking about which then you'd mentioned the old vine Zinfandel hopefully the answers Susan's question unless she wants to unmute and and elaborate on that hi Susan by the way is very nice tip that you're on Carmen sure says hi brian is asking about the barrels are there certain type of oak or specific wood that we use in barrel construction to produce specific wines so if you want to elaborate on that and then I have one more question in regards to the row in about the serabian Coe Foreman Coe fermented with the BM yay so if you could elaborate on that as well so I'm gonna take the Syrah question first is the oak question though takes me a little longer oh yeah so what we're doing with the straw being a co ferment is we're taking a red grape varietal that is has some deficiencies to it sera had as a variety as very thin-skinned similar to Pinot Noir and so therefore there is not a lot of color and not a lot of tannin in in the wine if it's pure syrup so that sometimes leads to wines that can be a little gray in - and look at them and can fade very quickly by Coe fermenting being a with that and and the key it really is inter planning it into the same vineyard because as their ripening the ripening at different paces and so we're getting desiccation or getting more skin compounds in the VNA at the same time as because that's going to get over right and while we get the Syrah to the rightness level that we want so what we've done by adding both of those into the same fermenter is we're practicing something called Co pigmentation that means we're loading up the Syrah with all of the phenolic that are in the media so the color that's in the Syrah bind to those extra extra tannin from the white grape and become a dark beautiful colored wine that's stable and fruit and stable and texture and the byproduct of that is the white grape yields some really cool interesting floral like Jasmine blossom qualities as well as some interesting fruit components like grapefruit equality's and when you pair that in with the and growing it adds this really cool nuance to the overall wine and that's one of the reasons that I try to use less of it but I lost that that cool nuance in the process so hopefully that answered your question the reason we do it is pigmentation in order to get a stable more beautiful and more complete wine the question about oak is we use oak mainly from French oak I do buy well not not really anymore but I used to buy some American oak as well but American oak and French are four different species of wood American oak is a tree's white oak is called Quercus Alba and French oak which is you see in most a lot of furniture and veneer but also a lot of barrels it's called Quercus petraea and so the different types of oak trees grow differently and therefore impart flavor entirely different so what I want is barrels that really impart a lot of vanilla and mocha qualities a little bit of spicy components as well as have a lot of volcanic in the barrel in the wood itself because that oak cannon will eventually fine and again going back to that finding that oak cannon will bind to the tannin and the grape and fall out softening up the finish line American oak has much less tannin and it has a lot of what's called whiskey lactone compounds so you get more sweet oak qualities as well as potentially some coconutty notes or maybe some dill notes in addition to that sweetness if they haven't seized in the wood and toasted it properly which is one of the downsides to American oak so I like to use mainly French oh I do source my friendship from seven different forests throughout France and I usually I was supposed to go in June but I usually go to France and actually buy the wood in the futures contracts as locks not as finished barrels we're one of the only wineries that does that and so we pretty buy our wood three years before it's actually made into barrels for us at least most of our our barrels that way then we use different seasoning techniques time location I have seasoning yards throughout France as well as a seasoning yard in Italy and then we have 96 different toast profiles that were utilizing which is time and temperature on fire that course spawned to all of the different types of wines that we make from low impact barrels to very heavily toasted smoky barrels which we might use in Syrah like like for rowing and everything in between and we're always doing research and development trial in our experiments with our Cooper's to push that envelope a little bit further in order to keep dialing in the oak qualities for each client individually using the right oak is a big deal as a guys tasted a lot of once but more than it's frequently then I would taste a wine and wonderful fruit but completely the wrong hope and and it they're just so disjointed and even can be a little unpleasant because they just don't ever come together there it's like the wood is fighting the fruit it's such just he's you know he's a barrel guy I've learned more about barrels from him in a two years I ever knew before yeah all the wives tale is old world wines do not add sulfites but New World wines do so that's not true oh oh yeah where's in Burgundy tasting at one of the top five wineries in Burgundy the current winemakers the son of the of the original wine you know it's a family-owned business and the son who I know pretty well through her field couldn't be there when we were tasting so I was talking to his dad and he tells me a story about one of the wise that we were having which was a so I was there in 2015 and so this was a 2002 Chardonnay that tasted brand new I mean it was gorgeous this is a thousand dollar bottle of Chardonnay and I said I said how do you do this do you guys add just a lot of so2 to make sure that this stays fresh she says well we had three handfuls I said well what do you mean you had three handfuls he says well I had a handful on the grapes I had a handful when the it's finished for many and then I had a handful before its bottle and I said well whose handful it to do is well whoever's working that day I said one of your hands different size and the other guy stands he says three handfuls is three handfuls so really what that means they add what they always have died most of the fermentations in in France at least the better wineries in France both burgundy Bordeaux and the Rhone and lawar are all native their native primary fermentation their native secondary fermentation malolactic and so what that does is they have strains of bacteria and so this is what we've learned because of that exact question this is research that's come out of UC Davis is that the compounds of people were afraid of that they thought were sulfur that we're causing the headaches and causing the sneezing and causing shortness of breath and you know getting you flush is something in wine culture hammy or a biogenic an E and what happens it is that is a form of histamine and your body's having reaction to that which is giving you all of those side effects and all of those reactions for some reason most of the strains of bacteria and this is due to ions of them getting these slants and then spreading them in their natural flora through their wineries or a mean free bacteria and so what has happened is most of the bacteria manufacturers which are based in France or Germany have found that out and are now making their bacteria which didn't used to be the case any free so you will not have those same reactions when you drink our wines all of our wines are happy free and you won't have those same reaction drink other lines that are hammy free unless you get drunk and you get a headache from that that is nothing to do with Sofer or a mean that's just hangovers hang on but I can assure you that they are adding sulfur and they're using something far more dangerous than we use which is sulfuric acid to do that which is illegal in the United States you're not allowed to use that we're using something called potassium metabisulfite which is a as a just a powder that we dilute water and edit that way and most of the time by the time you drink a wine that's aged any more than two of the three years that sulfur has already been consumed anyway because it's an antioxidant so it won't even be in your line regardless it probably started because in the United States we've had to start labeling lines that they contain sulfides so if you're traveling and you're in Italy and look at the file it doesn't say anywhere in Italian or any other language other contains sulfites I mean if they ship it over here they have to put that label on those are old laws that go really back to Mothers Against Drunk Driving Center but people would go to Europe oh this one don't have sulfites they come back there they have sulfides but everybody in the winemaking it's difficult to make my house sulfites because you're taking a big risk right you guys out to dinners you're not your friend any get a huge bottle variation somebody uses no sulfites unless they're a really good wine maker you can open three of the same bottles and they could be wildly different because they don't have some funds to keep all of that from happening so there's that movement there's no orange wine movement it's called for you know people are using no sulfites in wine but the byproduct of that is their wines are turning orange or brown very unstable prematurely because there's no antioxidants to protect protect the wine anybody else got questions yeah I got a question yep we're talking about how the Syrah grape has a thin skin and I'm assuming that this is a variety from France because how do you explain Australia there surahs' are always such a deep dark red and they have a very hot climate on their how would that grape survive down there with the thin skin yeah so they're growing something they're growing it in a little bit of a different way and then they're also adding hand into the wine so you can buy Cannon as a powder additive there's a lot of different manufacturers you can buy it and call it off the red you can you know there's a bunch of different versions and so most mega purple is that mega purple no I know mega Omega purple is like sugar like a concentrate tannin is there there either pulling it from oak there pulling it from nuts or there pulling it from grapes that they've done some process to I don't I don't know the exact way they isolate that but they're available and so they're doing a similar technique that we're doing with this philosophy which is provided by the V&A but it's sort of a natural approach and they're just adding I know the most popular one with the friends that I have down there's one called VR Supra and so they're adding that on into the into the fermenter so they can get that binding effect they're the same type of fashion which creates New York color right you know so there's there's plenty of color compound in Syrah that's something called anthocyanin the problem is with color is it needs to bind to something and that something is called a polymeric pigment if you really want to get technical so there's a it's called a small pigment and then they have to sign in binds to that and makes a bigger more stable molecule which is called a lot of power and without they're in massive amounts the anthocyanin have anything to grab to to form that stable compound so whether you're loading it up with tannin or small culinary pigment from sera are from being a or you're adding it through a different sort you're still getting the same results thank you so Justin and Ron first we had several people say thank you for all that you're sharing and then I have a request that they can see where you're located so I know last time you picked up the laptop and turned it around to the vineyard they'd also like to see the table the 600 L barrels if you yeah so so we're standing in front at the winery right now sorry Paris so this is our terrace you can come out and enjoy and then right in front of us is one of our chalk Hill vineyards that makes our Chaco Chardonnay that's called the River East property I mean you see my pretty truck sorry I didn't know I was going to be doing this and so that's what we were looking at the whole time we were talking to you guys is this beautiful no clouds in the sky day a little bit breezy it's about 75 degrees as we speak and then as far as the barrels go just you can sort of see them so there these are 600 L barrels I actually have them brand 600 L on the head for me six of these barrels are made in the in the world every year they're all numbered I'm not sure if you can see the numbering right here but this is barrel five of six they're made by the owner of the cooperage himself for me he signed them with JCB John chose B card and there's the barrel oh sorry and I use them one time and then they're there their furniture and because our colors are black and gold they make them look pretty for me that doesn't change the quality but this one is six years seasoned wood so it gets really dry and brittle so it's really hard to make these it's a proprietary toast that John Charles and I have come up with over working together for ten years and just experimenting with time and temperature and making wine and finding the sweet spot of what we're looking for and so those are two of the six 600 L barrows and these were from the 2016 vintage that's what was in those before there you go they're getting a lot of while you're setting back up we're getting a lot of good feedback just saying thank you so much it looks like their next destination for the Youth League Country Club they want to come out to wine country and looks like a gentleman bill Richards his wife likes very sweet wine like Moscato and is there anything that you can recommend that is sweeter outside of rodney strong there is my favorite producer is one called de carro not expensive I think it's 12 bucks 10 bucks I know it's available nationwide wife's a big fan of that Dusty's beautiful stuff and that you'll love it so Moscato d'Asti yeah sawasdee is the place where it's low alcohol there you know plenty of sugar little bit a little bit bubbly little fizzy line yeah they're really good and you know she'd love it other than that I really I don't have I mean actually that's not true she could try some of the trim Bock Riesling and Gerber twins from Alsace those are our seven eight percent sugar so they're a little sweeter but they're pretty acidic so they're pretty balanced and here does a great job making wine I think the converts might appeal to her more than the Riesling that'd be the other one I can think of is somehow station of station wines now you have Dec nice ecru phrase things like that this but we don't really make sweet wines we have a port that we we sell at the tasting room but other than that we don't do any sweet wines like that so the one last question that we have is thoughts on how well a screw top versus a cork reseals a bottle reseals or seals reseals is what the question is but I'm sure we can go with either so I would say that a screw a screw top is as good as your storage practice is similar to a cork so if you have a screw top bottle and it's in great shape but you're you know you somehow damage this top part then you've now broken the seal because there's a that's what is cranked down to make that seal so once that is is broken you're gonna allow a lot of oxygen in and you're gonna compromise the wine if you reseal it and you close it down tight from that perspective you're you're pretty sealed but you've just allowed a lot of oxygen into your bottle which is still there when you work with a cork especially depending on type of cork you work with you know we use something called a Dion cork put that up close this is a patented technology owned by the DMA family that guarantees no cork taint in their corks and so we've switched to these because we want to make sure that our customers are getting wines that are not going to be compromised from us and we want to do everything we can to do that and you'll see this type of cork used in more and more wines because they're awesome when you buy corks like these they're made in a process where they grind up the natural cork and then they bathe it in this bath of liquid carbon dioxide to suck out all of the bad components they then take those that pieces of cork and they reform it with two compounds one is a as a beeswax based a binding agent and the other is something called a micro sphere which is kind of like a butte it's like kind of like a balloon in it when they heat it up to bind it all together those balloons inflate the three spheres inflate and create the elasticity on the cork so this here happens to be what's called a DM 10 which is guaranteed to hold its seal for at least 10 years you can buy Dion's you know with less spheres that are rated at 5 years and more more spheres all the way up to 30 years so if you buy one of our very expensive wines like our single vineyard Cabernets or the other row and wines those are diem 30s and so those seals are going to be epic they're going to be really good but they're gonna be really hard to put back in the bottle because they're so tight so I would say that if you get it back in the bottle you're gonna probably use the nine stain side and you force that in that seal is going to be really really good and you're not gonna have almost any oxygen exposure at all especially if you can force it in a little bit they answer the question maybe a little bit and looks like well thank you everybody thanks for thanks for joining us come see us anytime you're out here hopefully it'll be soon thank you thank you it was a great time our pleasure thank you thanks very much thank you thank you thank you", "kyVD7jVhqKo": "i would say we need a democracy movement because we need a democracy speech I like to say that the most dangerous threat to democracy in the united states of america is the mistaken belief that we actually practice work because democracy is not a noun it's a verb deimos means the people crotch amines rule so the word democracy from the attic Greek means the people rule we had the trappings of democracy you get to go and pull a lever every two to four years Oh only four candidates that have been pre-approved and pre-selected by the ruling elite but when it comes to actually participating in a meaningful way in how our society is organized you know how much pay you might get whether or not you get health care whether this country goes to war or not whether we should address the climate crisis you know those kinds of questions we the people never have an opportunity to participate imagine okay imagine if you will the debate around healthcare had there not been elected officials with a commitment to pharmaceutical companies and insurance companies if the priority wasn't making sure there were profits for people that make drugs and sell drugs and you know people who provide medical care as insurers if they weren't the priority and we were the priority don't you think that would have been different that's an immediate difference in your life right now there are folks who are worried about Medicaid Medicare would that be an issue at all if the priority was it let's make sure there's enough profits for the corporations I don't think so the prison system along with the education system and the health care system are three things amongst many others that I believe should never have a profit motive attach the corrections corporation of america has been going around the states in 2012 and 2013 and asking states that are cash-strapped in their budget a will take over your prisons one of the stipulations is that if we take over your prisons for you will pay you for them and we'll give you money but you got to keep them at ninety percent capacity and that basically attaches a profit motive to criminalizing american citizens the democratic self-government experiment and it was started in the united states over 200 years ago has gotten completely corrupted we are not being listened to we the real people are not being listened to when people say we can buy elections which we've seen happening and when we see people say we don't want to let people vote those are all little signs that pretty pretty big signs that our democracies in trouble the move to a men's amendment that we're promoting will basically break the iron grip that wealthy individuals and corporations have a rare democracy and allow the people to rule as they're supposed today we have an unamerican attack on that dream of equality it can't be free if you don't have a home it's time for an intervention y'all money is not political speech I wake up on any given morning in salt lake city and the second I go outside I'm breathing depending on what day it is the dirtiest air in the country or maybe even the world and then I go to eat some food and the prices of that food are determined by giant corporations the place where I get the food is often the giant corporate grocery store and it's often bad for me or downright poisonous and I don't have a lot of options to eat different kinds of food and then I go to travel to one of my organizing meetings and since corporations control the kinds of transportation we're provided i have to often take a car on a giant freeway instead of taking public transit or walking and then i get to the meeting and a lot of the decisions we made we make are often done inside the box of what corporations have gotten us to think as possible and on the way back from there i passed giant billboards telling me how inadequate i am and what i need to buy so my entire day is basically controlled in this tight little area that corporations have decided it's okay for human beings to live and survive when considering the still unfolding history of these United States the words of journalist molly ivins ring true it is possible to read the history of this country as one long struggle to extend the liberties established in our Constitution to everyone in America in other words who according to our laws and culture gets to be considered a person the law creates legal personhood and movements create law and change culture so i'll have the courts passed laws to shape our culture that history goes way back before citizens united 1819 Dartmouth College versus Woodward Supreme Court case turned a corporate charter from a government granted charter to a contract this ruling gave corporations standing within the Constitution 1886 Santa Clara County versus Southern Pacific Railroad though the Court did not rule on corporate personhood the decision was subsequently cited as a precedent to hold that a private corporation is entitled to the same Fourteenth Amendment rights of due process and equal protection as human beings this makes it impossible for us to make laws that treat local businesses any differently than giant multinational corporations even if their business practices are deemed to be harmful to workers the environment and communities or if they have a history of violating the law pale vs. henkel 1906 the court granted corporations the Fourth Amendment search and seizure protection dodge vs ford motor company 1919 the Michigan Supreme Court says the business corporation is organized and carried on primarily for the profit of the stockholders stockholder primacy is established the purpose of the corporation according to the court is no longer to serve the public good as it had been it is now to maximize profit for shareholders above all else Pennsylvania coal company versus mahon 1922 corporations get the fifth amendment takings clause meaning if you pass a regulation that impacts a corporation's ability to make a profit that is deemed a taking and they can sue for the right to future profits lost this creates a chilling effect and local and state governments become much more hesitant passed laws in the public interest for fear that corporations can claim loss of potential profits that cities and states will be on the hook to pay buckley versus vallejo 1976 the Supreme Court rules that spending money to influence elections is protected under the First Amendment in effect saying that money is speech citizens united vs the Federal Election Commission 2010 today the Supreme Court of Chief Justice John Roberts declared that because of the alchemy of its 19th century predecessors in deciding that corporations had all the rights of people any restrictions on how these corporate beings spend their money on political advertising are unconstitutional the court's ruling threatens to undermine the integrity of elected institutions across the nation it's a rejection of the common sense of the American people move to amend is the only organization right now that is very clear on what needs to be done with respect to the constitutional amendment specifically we declare or we want declared that corporations are not people and we also want to declare that money is not speech in every other organizations they are mostly concentrated on citizens united money is not speech to that we always have to ask a question how much better was or politics pre Citizens United not much better and the reason it wasn't better is that second portion was missing corporate personhood it is clear that this country is suffering from a crisis that is deeper than the economic crisis or the ecological crisis we are suffering from a crisis of democracy and I say that because there are super majorities on issue after issue whether you're talking about health care foreign policy economic questions education or political reform that clearly support substantive reforms yet those reforms have not come into effect every single one of our fundamental human needs are being violated on a daily basis and until we get democracy back in this country through overturning citizens united and overturning corporate constitutional rights we're not going to have a democracy that can function for the three hundred million plus human beings in our United States I've been watching it for some 30 years now but I never really felt like I needed to do anything about it until citizens united we should be in the Capitol throwing all the lobbyists out meeting with our Congress people and telling them what we would like them to do to make this a better country if we the people don't do something about corporate constitutional rights that not only our government the United States the mirror is going to go down in flames but we are going to take the entire planet with us we have to be less vertical and more horizontal and horizontal there is focusing on a democracy movement that will help all of us achieve the individual solutions we want every other issue that I care about whether it be the climate whether it be workers rights whether it be education for you know our children whatever it is it tends to get be very hard to get things done without these kinds of reforms because you know the people who write the checks you know the ones who are prowling around in the State Capitol with their you know fat cheque books in their nice suits they're the ones that get the legislators ears there's going to be considerable opposition and there's going to be opposition within the corporate media and strong opposition which is going to make the job a little harder but never underestimate the power of the people when they understand the message never underestimate that I think that this is something that can be done quite quickly I think it's something that could be done rather efficiently it's just going to require a large enough parade it's going to require a large enough people to understand the core concepts and that's the real work that we have to do right now is is hit that that critical tipping point which is probably around twenty or thirty percent of the of the voting populace actually understanding the issue in a big part of the issue when creating a multiracial multi-ethnic democracy movement is an understanding of how race and racism were constructed in the United States through law and how those laws informed our culture in much the same way those corporate rights have been constructed through the law to ensure rule of the wealthy minority over the majority and how our culture reinforces and legitimizes that lack of democracy right from the very beginning article 4 of the US Constitution defined people as property you see the authors of the Constitution were very interested in protecting their property including slaves no person held to service or labor in one state under the laws thereof escaping into another shall in consequence of any law or regulation there in be discharged from such service or labor but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor maybe do the Indian Removal Act of 1830 indigenous communities are forced from their homelands over 10 years 100,000 native children and adults

be provoked by anger at injustice on our unfairness and I'm angry about the fact that we've got twenty to twenty-five percent of the children in the richest country in the world who go to bed hungry are undernourished every night I'm angry about the fact that we have transnational corporations that are destroying the planet that we depend upon for life itself and I'm angry about the fact that the world that's being created with the rape and plunder of Mother Earth is a racist sexist and class oppressive Society you bet I'm angry I'm angry because it doesn't have to be this way we had a class war right now of course we are and you know Warren Buffett I think said at the clearest he said we're in the class woman we've been in the class war for years and my class is winning and who is his

champion of the First Amendment that this country has ever known once said that the Bill of Rights is a badge which says to government you shall go no further what is the impact of corporations wearing that badge because after 106 years in America through the best of times and the darkest of hours she knows how America can change yes we can America we have come so far we have seen so much but there's so much more to do so tonight let us ask ourselves if our children should live to see the next century if my daughter's should be so lucky to live as long as an Nixon Cooper what change will they see what progress what we have made the second thing that I think happens that will look back on and understand this as a critical moment is that we elected a president through a lot of grassroots effort the young people in this country really really made a historic difference electing the black president with a huge amount of hope and I think that their expectations were not met the system itself was a failure that's why it's really critical that we do more and we not just wait for the elected officials to take care of this for us this is what every single social movement that has come before us has done when they recognize that the system is really flawed and it's not working and the people in power are not going to self-correct but it's time for the people to step in and there's actually a process in our Constitution to do this this isn't new it doesn't happen very often but whenever there is a system that is so out of balance we've seen people's movements come together and respond by inserting human rights or correcting the issue to make clear that the priority needs to be on the people there is another history of the United States and this is where you come in this is the history of people coming together and rising up to change laws and change the culture 1791 Bill of Rights the first ten amendments to the Constitution were adopted to protect we the people from the excesses of government at the time We the People protections only extended to white male property owners 1865 Thirteenth Amendment slavery abolished civil rights act of 1866 extended the rights of emancipated african-americans Congress passed this by overriding an attempted veto by President Andrew Johnson 1868 14th amendment black males get equal protection under the law 1870 Fifteenth Amendment black males get the right to vote social change in 1886 included a major campaign for the eight-hour workday Knights of Labor 1 million strong populace drew up the Cleburne demands Eugene Debs builds the Brotherhood of locomotive firemen in 1913 17th amendment the US Senate will now be elected by the people instead of appointed by state governments 1920 the 19th amendment after 75 years of struggle women get the right to vote 1954 Brown versus the Board of Education move schools could no longer be segregated based on race separate is not equal the Civil Rights Acts in the 1960s protected voting rights prohibited discrimination by federal and state governments and prohibited discrimination in housing sales and rentals 1971 26th amendment voting age has changed from 21 to 18 if an 18 year old could be drafted to fight and die in war certainly they could vote 1973 Roe vs. Wade Supreme Court rules that anti-abortion laws violate a woman's right to privacy abortion was legalized if we look back in 50 years we will realize just how completely and systematically we were being ruled of course we had to end slavery of course women had to get the right to vote of course you could organize unions and they're not a criminal conspiracy of course Jim Crow segregation law has to end of course 18 year olds have to get the right to vote if they're dying for their country but this is the thing Dennis every one of those movements seemed impossible when they began and it was only when ordinary people began they get together and have conversations about how the society is organized and about what their desires are what's at stake is the country that I love that We the People a country that this was this was the great American experiment that could the people rule rather than being ruled by the wealthy or the aristocrats and we chose to have the people rule to check or limit the power of government to limit the power of the wealthy to hold down the masses if you're not seeing the kind of change want I'd say ask yourself why you're not getting that and chances are very good it has to do with the fact that our democracy is not working for the people so whatever your number one issue is you should make this your number two because without this kind of change it's going to be very hard to win the other reforms that we all want an issue that I think people used to think was too complicated for regular people to understand and when it's in front of them they're voting you know not just fifty percent plus one not even just fifty-five percent not even just 60 / said you know but seventy sometimes even over eighty percent in support of calling for amendment I think that's one thing that definitely proves that there's no question where people stand on this the reality is that this is a vital struggle it moved to men doesn't succeed then we will continue to live in a society in which corporations call the shots both inner courts and the halls of Congress and the executive branch and increasingly a state and local level and we've already seen the consequences of that so I actually think that right now it's so it's really a world-historical kind of a moment but I even think that beyond the amendment it's so much broader than that we're really not just talking about a you know an amendment that gets for the corporation's we're talking about in a completely new way of understanding what democracy is why it's important and how our economic systems globally will need to be reconstructed we've got to build a movement step-by-step intentionally and deliberately to create the world that we want and that means it needs to be social it needs to be political needs to be economic and ultimately we need a legal system that codifies under law a peaceful just democratic and sustainable world and when you talk about it that way no when I talk about it that way I can have that conversation at an Occupy encampment I can have that conversation at a tea party rally I can have that conversation at a pool hall or a bowling alley and ordinary Americans agree with me not on everything but on the fact that something not right and it doesn't have to be this way that's where the agreement is and that's the sweet spot of real solidarity how many gifts can a congressman take and somehow remain a good man how many times must good parents cry because their little ones must sleep in a van how many crimes can corporations give before their bribes are forever banned the answer my friend is moved to a man the answer is moved to amend how many birds will fall from here because they can no longer breathe how many burdens can we the people take while Congress continues to to see how many billionaires will write all our lumps while we the people still believe answer my friend is moved to the answer is to a man how many wars must a young people find like in Iraq and in Afghanistan how many mothers and children must die from a drones and land how many senators would send of their own sons they truly believed in their stead answer my friend is moved to amend the answer move to a man the answer my friend is moved to a man the answer is", "COAs-zFqXc0": "her friends is mr. cha i smoking the nope just got wishing I always finished Gibby roasty birds kitty meowing ahem no one I'm I am making a

everywhere when you do shoot a big doggy a lot of fun we also talk about filmmaking he's the man behind or one of the guys behind Terra Australis and these guys make phenomenal spearfishing films so there's some really good tips and info in there about that but I tell you what Andres has got he's just got skills for dayz let's go can chat spearfishing and you can hear the passion and as you know in his voice and what he says about the ocean so it's it's a it's a wicked interview before we get there look check out at spear junkies on Instagram these guys have got a cool crew going it's Chris Coates mjk Chris Dylan and Brit Harvey these guys are going to film a 12-part video TV series with a target 12 species in all different parts of the world it's pretty magic I've got the schedule in front of me and we're going to be covering it a fair bit on the new spear podcast but jump on and follow their journey at spear junkies on Instagram check check them out so shout out to Chris and Chris and the boys I wish you all the best with the trip that's just about to start whether the looks of it or maybe it's already started all right then next one audible.com 99 tips to get better at spearfishing is available there as an audiobook if you go to audibletrial.com/preneurcast I'm from this book logan poo file from the west side of florida so thanks thanks Logan awesome review buddy and I'll link that up in the show notes so if you had to andrzej duda cooler on noobs perot you'll get linked up to audible free and you can get our book free and directly split the news through our

it's just phenomenal and the books will probably the book will hopefully be available in a spearfishing store near you sometime in the second half of the year but for the guys that got on the Kickstarter campaign and got hold of some of the unique rewards like a free spirit like awesome awesome thanks for your support and then we offered up the spirit log just to say thank you for getting on but now we're in the dying day so if you want to check that out go to Kickstarter calm pumping spearfishing and our book project will come right out you can hopefully get on it alright let's get into this interview with Andre choice [Applause] guys the Adreno Easter sale is kicking along nicely there's a couple of weeks left to go so get online and check them out at spearfishing comm that a

double savings ah yes master treating yourself kicking horse Sophia's them hooves fear I go to check out and save an extra $20 on purchases over 200 how could I forget that anyway check it out it's amazing today guys thanks for listening to today's news bureau podcast you're joining turbo and I with Andre aka what's his nickname turbo sea monkey I believe and I'd love to know what what that's a little bit say monkey I think it was from I was supposed to grab a textured Dan in Coast Harbor and he's he was starting this like cartoon like comics thing out and I was just cuz I'm I because I'm always hanging off tracing that so I do act like I do act like a monkey hey say about everywhere I go hunting something of a monkey so he just started up the sea monkey even did the sick comic I wish it came out but it was I was a hell cartoon character and I was interesting monkey yeah and I was pretty cool that's cool Travis Travis korkin one of your good buddies he told me to ask you about that as well so I'm glad we got straight into that thanks very good look tell us a little bit about yourself where are you living now but you know and what do you do for a job and and it just tell us a little bit about yourself yeah for sure I'm living on the west coast now I've been over here for eight years I've just moved up to Exmouth which is like one of the most beautiful places I've ever explored it so it's just got the most amazing ocean in rich full life and at this time of the years when it all starts to happen you get all big congregations of baitfish you get schools of the whale sharks where all the that's where the most of tourism comes from and everyone going out from with bio sharks you get start getting all the humpback whales migrating up north and they push along the coast you get killer whales coming through it's just off the hook that's full of sharks it's amazing this love it that's crazy and and you work full-time and Terra Australis tell us a little bit about that yeah Terra Australis is a production company that myself and another two friends Johnny and Ryan have come up with and we've created over the last probably like five or six years and mostly came from a hobby just doing a lot of filming filming beautiful content in the ocean mostly revolves around sharks and shipwrecks and we'll just sort of put together a little documentaries or little movies and share it on social media but uh it's always caused a little bit of a hype i've always got amazing content where the media is kind of jumped on it because a lot of its around sharks - so everyone's like well you guys are crazy and i think yeah you know but you know we just sort of sort of show it how it is and tell them that it's it's different know what you reckon and and yeah share it with the world really cool we're gonna we're gonna dig a bit more into this when we get to veterans vault and you can help us share some some tips and techniques hopefully to help everyone start making better spearfishing films and just sharing sort of the the wonder of it all I guess but um look take us back right right to the beginning e spearfishing how did you get start started where did you grow up in Australia I'm so grew up in Port Macquarie small coastal town on the East Coast in New South Wales and it's all ya sick little beachy towns who require literacy join it's got amazing beaches and coastline heaps the National Park and Isis is pretty much live in the ocean surfing anyway and then I started snorkeling and started spearfishing up the river like chasing the feed for Denard's are some black fish and some some flooded and whatnot with some mates and then we started venturing out to sea and yes this is a West started from there really cool cool how old were you when you when you first sort of took a spear gun with you had a hand spear right the little hands fear for the first time that was probably when I was I don't know maybe 16:15 was that I was that one of the classic red fiberglass ones was it the the old Ali Powell I had a couple of sick ones the first one was an early one little light one which wasn't that great and then I think my brother had a fiberglass one I got that I was sick and then and then I said I think another brother had a telescopic one that I found under the hair us and that was even better was that heavier yep so I had had a bit of poncho you move moving the guns pretty quick after that like what sort of what sort of guns did you sort of get into can only be that tight I do that I end up getting a gun not that long after oh maybe maybe like Oh six months or something I think I had like a little little seed hornet thing like I made it gone yeah I think it oh yeah right Frank ahead and the long relations just a little middle-click I had to Kate bendings and make it hold your lawn and had if a bay cord and yeah it was pretty good it's pretty sick but then I had to upgrade pretty Quakers one day like finish school and as this massive storm came through and it classed off after the storm went for the dive and this is when I first ran into like bigger fish like than almost shooting green and black fishing that didn't think much over and then I end up running to this massive school of Jew fish and then they're all school he's grown up to 10 12 kilos yeah and I ended up getting I had to prank a head with that one made a gun and I like bounced off one and I was like this is nuts and then I end up getting - I was pretty startled vote me my mate would just list losing the there's no mines and then that's when I was like alright I'm gonna need to be gone these things are crazy I started seeing him up to 30 kilos and wouldn't even attempt to pull the trigger so I had that upgrade and that's when I removed the pole where the gun and put a broomstick in it and going along the shaft and made a bigger rubber and then I started using this broomstick gun that was out the same trigger and stuff I ever had so much it was so hard to pull the trigger sometimes so they loaded it up so much power I was like it had to really crank it but I landed like 30 kela Jewish for that thing a it just goes to show you so you didn't snap that broomstick no I will end it up give it to a good mate of mine Quinn okay now he lives up in Kansas now but they ended up starting spearing and things like always that broomstick con was like hey thank you my anything like I think he's a few weeks later my broomstick a side just goes to show that with all the carbon fiber and the technology hey like it's when you boil it down they're pretty simple device by the old sphere gun okay and you had that classic we're gonna need a bigger gun moment when you saw the big Jew fish that's pretty cool I remember the first time I heard about you it was from Travis and he was at the front of a rocky headland I believe and and this young this young ragamuffin showed up and said all you mind if I borrow your gear and go for a look and I think that was you it was yeah I remember watching him work snooping around it was like a sick - hole down there and I was a or when that's had a look and I can hear the water I was like heads going oh I'm not much down here I'm like oh I know where they are and then there was a secret perfect condition I was with my ex-girlfriend I had my jeans on and everything else I reckon I can bury gone and they're like all right and then all right it took me Sherlock jumped in with my jeans and by the gun and goals and some pins and I was but within five or ten minutes I just knew this whole way I came back with like maybe if you think you are doing [Laughter] that's a noise they like come over Bobby we went over and cooked out this massive favor with the fish and all I remember doing it but travelers like this guys is like a caveman and I was he said I was like deep in my hands in the butter and just like rubbing it over the fish or something the other half it's also that's also look it does it sounds like you had a pretty relaxed start to Spearfish you did you have any any struggles like obstacles getting started I mean you're like you're naturally in the water all the time but what did you find difficult oh that's probably like weather and the conditions and the visibility it was really dirty a lot informal quarries are always restricted so sometimes like too many beers with like you know swelled breaking of your head and like you had to really watch it and stealth in and start learning all these spots like finding the areas and learning the seasons it's all learning the whole makeup of how fish live and work I suppose and yeah it was about it just learning learning all the seasons and learning how fish works we just we just created a spearfishing lock so guys can kind of write down all the conditions that they encounter so they can kind of replicate you know success the do did you keep a log or anything like that how did you how did you keep track of all the spots did you just remember them all I've got a good memory but when it comes to like crayfish holes or like a do fish hole or anything like that I can remember like the back of my hand that is correct weird like a like I do remember someone's name and it's two minutes ago but then I could like and remember that stuff that easy I don't never had to really write it down I could look up see idli and so you see this we'll see that bit of rock and I knew that if I went that way like that's where that cave is or and then seasons were kind of like you just learned that over time as well when it's a good time to hunt that fish or the other fish you know you're pelagic so the mole away or the conditions and just everything like that sort of just log it into into your own head I suppose you do it that much yeah so did you did you did you like dude like triangulate like with a couple of things on the shore like get a hill in the front and a tree in so you can kind of you know remember where you were or how did you do it some of them some spots I did I had to do like transit lines with a tree and a house behind it or something like that that was further I sure and like you couldn't see the bottom sometimes but most of it was just man in that rock and you just kind of can I can look up and say that that head man and that's not far away and I kind of know that I'm in line with it okay okay cool cool cool that's a handy trick to mint so did you have a mentor I mean how did you learn all the oh you all your tricks how did you how did you sort of get get through all the struggles I probably like this with the lads that I could hire me or sort of learn together and then when we started spearing like with bigger guards and show some mile away I think some of the boys had some old school speciation videos with rogue Torelli and I think the packs wounds and like Greg Pickering and all those lads were in there and that's when you're like oh this guy's about shooting wahoo and getting big Spanish mat for a start and kind of looked at that like well that's pretty pretty cool and then it was a few guys in town too that we kind of like got into it pretty quick together but it's like someone weather and told to graph and Travis and I and we kind of all bounce off each other I walked away okay cool cool cool all right next part of the show is a memorable fish story I think you might have a few you've been you've been in the water for a long time tell us some tales I've had some sick times I've traveled around the world traveling I used to travel a lot depending on the seasons it's sort of like you know you go in you're going up spearfishing you get you know each year that you get stuff for the smaller fish get your bigger fish and you see these videos and then you all want to chase that type of species and so we started like going to Fiji and three Indonesia and stuff and you know Mexico and stuff like looking for this these fish but there's a few sequins like always you know like everyone want the shoot shoot a dog to chew her and I spent a while chasing a few of them they're that powerful and that crazy right business they saw it was pretty hard to land I think I don't know we had you know always having what snap staff or you know we had to go through that with a fine-toothed comb kind of thing but why not one of the first the first dog is and landed yet was ended up bein like just over 75 kilos and then that was yeah that was probably most memorable we have had a dive and ended up in a school or probably like 50 or something and this one this huge one just came through it was this so just sort of had to be patient and wait for it to come underneath me and then they put a really good shot in there and then it took off with my gear and go my flights under and caught up with someone else's fight so quite maybe like five lights on there I think and then oh it was mayhem they for a while and then I fought it for a beer and dragged me out into deeper water which was good and gonna sort of like bellied up a bit and it started to float because this bladder was full there and the whole school of doggies followed it almost to the surface a is 36 pretty crazy and watch and then ya got that got that fish sort of suppose it's like a trophy fish us boys and yeah it was pretty pretty good press and I was like in the area with those villages and that so I've got to share of everyone like movies little kids are like on the Dacian that's given like this biggest two kilo chunks of like maintain a running off like a holding at hugging it is and it is pretty cool so like um what some guy my priorities andre always about food you'll get this from me a lot well what is what what is dr. tuna tastes like I've never shot one and I've never eaten one umm it's really nice to che me so it's probably it's just shaving wise it's similar to long Spanish mackerel maybe you know the soft but it's pretty really no ask you should love it sashimi and ceviche is really good they can see her as well as this like a pretty not as tender and soft as a yellowfin tuna but I suppose it's like pretty similar this Spanish mackerel a it's it's a it's an order sir it's not as dark in colour is it no it's not no it's it's similar color to Spanish mackerel yeah maybe notice why maybe in-between oh yeah I was quite a surprised when you cut the first one I open to the colour of the flesh and you sort of expect that really dark tuna flesh but it's it's not it sort of yeah like you said somewhere between is actually yeah I'm very surprised yeah kind of light turns translucent even a little oh yeah this range hmm so to hunt that fish successfully what did it weigh by the way do you know this just over 76 kilos and then the hunter was just say a lot again we had to use landmarks and isn't a drift and yet to dive over the right spot and this area and and you're gonna do you breathe it up and try and get relaxed and Satori sitting at about 25 meters when you I think I was about just 27 meters when I show that you know so he kind of like drifting and as he was going on no it's not easy yeah yeah we use what did you use like breakaway rig on there just a straight hard line and and what several flights well yeah what did you set up the floor it was a breakaway system it was like I think ain't no sharp of the slip tip like one of those Alexander slip tips a little more and would have been a more you use mooring a lot and then it was like stainless wire to to like this Dynamo might even bring one of those RAF ones it's a NEMA to like a hard float maybe like 20 weight a hard float to another hard float little like a bungee in the middle of that I think and then there's a while ago and then maybe another short bungee to atmosphere float and then it just just ended up getting as it took off like the Knights had the flashy they're caught in a flash shows that went with it and then another mates gun got caught on and that all went with this way so I got it all off as I was fighting that just flipping it over the floats and sort of clean at all yeah and then um and then I was all right after that so you say you before I sort of picked up when you said like the learning curve for the equipment for these big fish is kind of one of the toughest things what it what were some of the the things you have learned this out that sounds fairly complicated what it's a can be a like we've had some slick tips snap and stuff and then so you know make sure you get what it was a cast one so you want to get machined slip tips they want to be a reasonable length so they can have a fair bit of you know metal on the other side of the fish so it can hold really well the water surface area you want my eye on that thing to be you know Mickey Mouse so check for any glass or corrosion on your wire because they have a ball on the end and sometimes they can break it they're not new then we sitting around on your crimps on everything this your threaded tip or threaded on strong then then you go to stainless wire on the end ears shaft and this make sure you feel you've got a good shaft that's got a good thin attachment because that can better them coming off and just let's just go through it all and then make double double crimp everything just having everything really rated heavily and shackle things off splice things off and some guys treat this setup like it's a little bit secret but I almost think it's like you're doing a discredit to the fish because if guys aren't using aren't using a rock-solid set up now potentially shooting a fish that will get away and it'll die somewhere and so it's kind of almost a waste I think like dialing your gear right and like makes sense from a hunting perspective but also like you're looking after the fishery kind of thing as well oh happy to someone to know any of that you know like it's it's not that we're gonna tell me where to go and they still have to drive those conditions it's never that easy but to give away like take like the technique or even just not leaving that but to give away the setup is like everyone should share that because yeah you don't want to just go out and wound fish and lose gear and just because you can't you just don't want to tell them had how to set it off what that's a bit silly I think yes the first time I heard anyone say that the first time heard that you should be using it it was a machined am ashamed asked sorry I cast machined no no no mrs. Carter's cast tip so it must be made in the mold and I've seen them snap for us and then there's just you normal machined ones that have made on lives and like you know handcrafted kind of obvious oh sure which is it's better you know yeah okay and they've got to be you want a good length tip on there that goes through toggles and that's all the holding power they're essentially the length of the slip tips I use a long longest all I guess the ones that standard ones for that the more ease in their legs and is a pretty long anyway that don't they must be like it must be at least a hundred mill or something like I do but I think you can't get extra long ones but this the standard ones that they've boys to look pretty good already you know and unlikely I'm just gonna ask you like with shot placement you're looking to go through the head like what's I mean what's your what's your thoughts on on shot placement and how good are these sleep tips at holding shot placement is pretty crucial for sure especially only big fish like that normally nice not much of the time that year side on with any kind of like on a 45 above them and ice cream on to you or to the side of you or something like that it probably can get a lot of sidon shots as well but you did pretty much through the top of the head at the back of your head kind of things through the big thick part of the meat its side on you know behind the pectoral fin and on a 45 out towards a head like that's a six shot and then you can save your shaft a bit too but it's on a never backward angle is it fights to fish you're not going to bend the shaft and and then yeah if you get if you do get it anywhere there and you slip tip opens on the other side of the gill plate or anywhere on the head you know again you pretty much guaranteed you're gonna get my something else breaks but if you do go gut shot and stuff or like a higher above the above the backbone shot mid body can still tear our day like you could tear the fish and half is that right there's no they're fairly soft are they yeah pretty much for just just a power that is that powerful like um I just yeah asteroid you I'll just destroy themselves say that's just yeah alright cool that's that's a mint memorable fish story that we caught have extended out because I like it was really interesting to learn about the equipment because spearing magazine have joined the noob sparrow podcast to bring this episode to you today now spear magazine are there actually the other best spearfishing magazine in the world I'm saying that turbo said it now you know and if you head over to Spirit magazine you can check out the team they've got Jeremy Campbell John Paul Castro Skye Bailey Christopher Landers you have a look there's some fantastic people they've got on stuff and that's why they produced the world's best spearfishing magazine the photography that's just poppin the stories are awesome turbo has been rejected several times and that's how you know it's top quality so head over to spearing magazine.com you can buy it you can buy it at your local retailer in the US we you can even get the digital subscription online spearing magazine.com we're up to hunting techniques so yeah what's what's sort of a species you like to hunt and then you know what technique do you use to sort of effectively hunt them regularly more successfully I should say at the moment so changes of change over time I suppose I'm sort of slowed down on the spearing a lot and doing a lot an order filming and things have changed with the spearing a lot really like I lived on a boat for a fair while there's out at say for eight months and just sort of just end up changing a lot just sort of shooting a fish whenever I need it every three days maybe so now I'm kind of like I'm pretty selective with what I want to get and what I feel like eating really but and I like to sort of get a species that's pretty prolific or a fast grower or it's not a breeder that's not too big so I kind of you know really fast it down a lot but I enjoy shooting Spanish mackerel was there but they're amazing sashimi they're really good smoked and they're really good by seed and cooked as well they go a long way get a lot of meat off the off the fish and yeah they're pretty prolific at time so that's oh and I can put up a pretty good for it too actually but um that's very one ear the Spanish mackerel and there's a few life and you know that that's that's great had how do you hunt them and where do you find them though so there are there are pelagic fish so like your warm tropical waters they'll get down the coast in summer times with the currents on the east and west coast your soda life I know Mon like some like reef edges of the holding bait where there's a bit of tired a bit of current but some drop-offs areas those saw the lights are hunting for fish along those sort of stretches okay hunting wise like really good with dailies and flashes are really good for Spanish mackerel pretty much all pelagic fish and then we need to same come in he kind of just is he trying to like eat the free dive to the bottom of his show or not and just sit there and then pretty it can be pretty queasy like come right up to you always circle you yeah that's a good way to wait wait for them to come to you or if this sort of deeper water and you won't make it to the bottom really in time or whatever you can sort of take a dive and just either swim parallel with it and they can sometimes come just turn and just come right in front of you I've done other times that have follow them from behind and they've like they'll sort of turn to the right to look at you so you go to the left side and they're blindside and they'll turn the other way and you just do that sometimes a couple of times and they'll they'll eventually turn sideways as well yeah sometimes you can tap begun with them a little bit if they just sitting still or there sometimes I'll just dive mid water and just sit still I know yeah no come up just playing slow and steady no fast movements and pretty much not yeah not swimming straight out and face on or something like that yeah do you find they behave if you're on the bottom do you find they behave a little differently to mid water like in terms of coming into you yeah a little bit let's do like similar but it's definitely a lot better sitting on the sea floor emotion was seen still no circle you sometimes I sometimes would be too tricky bit tricky shoe and they get on that close and then right above your head so you go right sometimes shooting from underneath but that was very well there are great fish to when you know that around you send your mate down to lay on the bottom and they won't come in on him but when he comes back to the surface in come the macro and then you just go down in slot one is that a technique you use as well I try and do a turbo whenever I can I've actually landed a very big one for end up going thirty said kilo and that was I thought actually thought it was a shock a when it first came in could there but so slender haven't had a healthy non it just in grows on its late are those like what the shark seeking an in depth in their this monster my system Spanish mackerel race no no yeah yeah what's that fish might was that it was at in Wi is in W a yeah it was in a pretty Sharky area to it was that big I think the Sharks are scared of it as I had a shot and took off took my flight under photos and lose everything wasn't really prepared for it and then I chased it all and then as I was coming up through the flight the Sharks are bolting the other way I was like water so it's unreal so yeah but seen the sharks are scared of it I you know you showed a big macro when the shacks afraid of it yeah so let's stop let's dial in a little bit more on your mindset like at the start of the hunting technique you sort of talked about how your your mindsets really shifted a lot and now you you you know you're very targeted I mean had to walk us through that process and something it sort of turbo and I've noticed with guys as they you know progress through the sport things sort of change oh and tell us about your experience yeah it's really nice so you you go to some of those amazing places you know in the world sometimes I see these fish and I don't know you just sort of seen the beauty of them in like even it's not like look watched if you just sit there watch your fish for a while you sort of start you know you've been criminalized by them and the way they act and it's heaps of times in our world fish will just be sitting there fun I mean I can't even pull the trigger because it is this look Connery are the most amazing colors and they shimmer and the way they move and just start building more respect for just the ocean itself really and you know I don't have to still survive I was so sure of that cellar and the fridge if I don't need to get it really Gator fish but I'm not gonna die but if I was gonna die shore I'm getting but if I don't really need to then I won't worry about I'll just enjoy it as it is uh-uh die if there was only salad in the fridge see days in there or not you know I've heard it off with some sun-dried tomatoes and some although the you saying like now you've sort of a bit more respect for the ocean lady G did you go through the you did you become bit of a trophy hunter like when you started was that were you chasing that adrenaline buzz is that what is that what really brought paint your interest just the the adventure side of things traveling the world to these remote areas is really appealing and then yeah we love spearing and to to land like a big fish like a big edible fish it was really yeah it wasn't no it was a good goal I suppose I know has talked about talkative tearing of this and I and you know it wasn't never gonna go to waste which was the main priority I suppose and it was a pretty crazy adrenaline for sure just to get me in the water of those things but I'm more than happy now to just like yeah watch and be the same a mate pumped on getting wine or just to just watch them swim behind they are not what's he worried I say Ron cool sounds like a cool place to be in to be honest yes I'll get there to once I'll show 276 Qi doggy I lived on a boat for a long time and I've been this you know living in a lot of remote areas around the world and Western Australia and just notice I don't really need to like get those amounts of fish used to or to just turn any - oh and be fine with one fish every three days or just even if I don't get it it doesn't really matter you're not shooting local 50 kilo doggy every three days you know it's raki light rather let's take you and shadow someone that you know and then lost your blossom walleye alright cool next part of the show is toughest situation Andre say you know how old are you oldie farm 35 35 see been in the water for for 20 years spearing really what's what's one of the toughest situations you've had and and what did you kind of learn from it um a couple was foes but it's more like just scariest is sort of like I've had a I've rescued but for mates now from blackouts so that was kind of an applause one and a good mate to it been a few mates had everything taken down but yeah I suppose that can shake you up a bit and be pretty pretty gnarly pretty tough if that's that's what you're thinking yeah okay well walk us through you know one of these blackouts um they're all really different too which is kind of fun crazy like the first one that mate was just complacent chasing fish really do shoulder and spits bowl of the surface black they are on the surface shaking and I had him already so he was all right it's just shake for a little while and you came to which was good and then another mate he showed a fish to kind of deep at sits on his boundary and there's a shark they're trying to eat the fish a distress call dragged it up and hit the fish mid-body stoner but my parachute and some struggle to get up he fitted on the surface as well and there's it's pretty big guys as Harvey get his head over works he was like going over and then now that mate was just it's in a cave and just trying to get his crayfish and he blacked on the surface which was they're all pretty pretty like if you're there like you find and if it's on the surface so good Travis one was probably the worse which was like the scariest for me because it was the same that it was different than all the others and he was its revered taped over a so I seek to watch she's Institute in the bottom like in 35 meters pretty easy which is insane and we're using these life spray flashes I've seen the whole dive unfold and I was like I could just see it all happening and then use a throw that flasher and we'll start to land it sinking slowly and it will get to like 15 a this and your your start you died and you dive to it and putting your white belt and then you get in the bottom anyway he went past it which is already like okay know what is it's alright and then I watched him on the bottom was like that clear and in KJ and I was watching him sitting there and I was like also take time he's doing really well and then I just say to him stop looking for that flasher they didn't grab and it was right above his head but you got your goggles on you can looking around in front of you kind of thing you see it was like right above his head so I seen a bit of time wasted a lie not long maybe like you know five seconds eight seconds but that's still a little bit and then he grabbed it does to mean a personalized all right no worries we always watch each other pretty pretty closely on that he's sort of stuff oh sure all the time really and then he's coming up and our flashes set at about probably 50 meters and then this Spanish madman came through you know so I don't even Tim - she's known him anyway cause he's gone off and I was also really what very much breathing okay and I said the same take a shot and I just seen him fumble with the guard pot and then I was like already heading down I just knew this is bad and then he was out cold and about yeah 112 meters so I was probably at about 8 meters at that stage anyway as he as he was like a crucifix I was just frozen not even nothing and then grabbed him brought him up and this reduced mask off and like just yelling at him talking to him shaking even like wasn't any shake it wasn't any convulsing like the diaphragm wasn't even activating all the other blackouts they hot bodies trying to brave like their their diaphragms shaking and convulsing and whatever and this body's trying to braid but this shrouds body was already at that depth so it's locked up this everything's closed up diaphragm stopped if yeah epic quality its throat whatever closes up like it's it's a safety guard to see you don't drown really but here he was like he was fully locked and that was I hate scary for me because I wasn't sure like you know what's it's kind of do I suppose but I just ended that because yelling at him and then I said thumping him in the chest and then I was like I'm gonna start CPR and then right it felt like a forever but probably with him that long but anyway he then he started shaking and then I was all rights where we going through the processes of the body trying to braid and then he took a big breath and then right looked at me I think he said so I'm sorry they advised and post words he said no so sorry fine it's correct this bad so anyway was this like y'all starting to be there for him but that was yeah pretty scary well well well well you've seen it yeah yeah a few I always like always keep close eye on my mate so even if we're diving in there's a few of us dive and I won't even dive watch this watch because no no you just never know why and like bigger biggest difference between you having you back to him and still being next to him or you have looking at him like if you're I had my back to any of them and I was still five meters from a diet and I'll sink and they're gone like it's just you feeling that girl looking at him and he just grabbed my novice a daisy the rest you end up doing afraid of course and the biggest thing best thing I learned out of it was a book a rescue like cleaning up behind the head bring them to the surface the correct way having their head out of the water right way taking the mask of their face it's happening on the face talking to him it's a brave to prove because that's money lasting sense as it goes out is hearing so you can normally sometimes still here and then you got your senses on your face you need to win to blow on it sort of tells the body that it is out of the water and they can accept to breathe and then if that's some work after that then you step side starting mouth to mouth and yeah sorry I'll bet I've got a video on that too way so I've made a video to well show you a rescuing a basic rescue so I'll give you that link co-co-co um so after the kind of the after it all happens like what's the story Andre you guys just call it a day like you you're done for the day pretty much so that divers done for the day hundred percent his yeah you just want to keep a close eye on but if anything I think you should just call it a complete day because he can if you get put on your lungs and you start getting flu-like symptoms you can go down here really quick and recently can they can still drown apparently like my mate was coughing for a few hours afterwards and I was really worried burn was down this village in the middle of nowhere and I'm yeah like soon as you get there water in your lungs he can it must be like a pneumonia effect you can we can produce flame in there have a reaction the salt water can mess you up so just like well first foot first of all for me what well done for being there for your mates you did a you did a magic job four times so that's pretty cool man that's that's pretty cool did you guys report any of that like you know Dan divers alert Network have got a free diving report notification like for did you walk through that process know most spiros aren't aware that there's a place to report stuff and I think the information could really help everyone so I mean that's why I bring it but I mean I only really just learned about it a while ago I was reading through the annual diving reports that they publish and it was reading about you know statistics about deaths and all the rest of it and not not real nice-like light reading but I was trying to write an article and it's just I just noticed it myself it's something I wanted to start talking about a bit more yeah it's good to acknowledge a like him to learn and to like it's so silly I feel like silly or so on that I was from the blackout it's it's it's so easy to avoid instead as e to avoid it really like I said blackouts always usually going to be closest server signal on the server so any almost Joe Blow can rescue or by grabbing them well you don't have to be a thirty made of diver even a 20 meter diver to to help prevent a blackout because it's shallow water blackout square although that's where it all starts to happen when you come into the surface that's when it that's when it happens so most of time yeah but it's not really any excuses oh yeah that's right wondering you spoke there you said you might was coughing for the days after you've seen four of these now you've been around for blokes they've riders rain the next day like apart from that coughing or was there headaches chest pain or is it just smooth sailing from them and you you sort of get back into it no I reckon if they're not right as rain as I straight away like definitely kill it call it a day and go and rest up and fully monitor your night definitely especially if you're anywhere just make sure they're right because you can have video if he gets like symptoms it can be really dangerous that's when they can go really down here also yeah no I don't I just you're the keeper this doesn't doesn't finish from there eh so keep an eye on if it's if they've um flute really bad through it symptoms yes track the hospital for sure oh cool hey you mentioned so about like practicing a rescue when you do free diving course I kind of experience the same thing I was like I've done life-saving and all this sort of stuff like in the water I spent a lot of time in the water but actually doing a rescue drill was just like I couldn't believe how difficult it was and how badly I did it the first few times you do drill it with your mates like or like I mean you've been doing it for a long time now is it just kind of second nature I mean what's the story I don't even really push it too hard when I'm with mates I don't know that well I just sort of cruise but yeah we we all kind of know when we were chasing the deep of doing the deeper dives and chasing big fish we all kind of knew it all or pretty well back to army world trusted each other was with allies really yeah but it's good - I think I should brush up on it again for sure with and later died with now just said just to make sure you know like it's pretty basic it is basic but it's you still need to be showing the steps and firstly in a panicky situation you can owe me some good yeah winded um one of our mates in Brisbane Wayne judge he's got a like a regular pull freediving like crew and they train in a swimming pool every week and they they drill it all the time and met me in turbo actually we met each other there and well it was a great it was a great place to meet you we meet we made our whole dive crew in that place but the rescue drills for me were like that were freaking phenomenal I was really like when you do a free diving course it only lasts two or three days so I mean you do learn it but you don't really keep practicing it after that so I think I think that was really awesome I already liked that yeah I liked it out wine also flogs a bit - he gets you doing real hard surface laps flat out and then and then pushes you into like a which is really good too because you're naked you've got a garnet little dive you've got to give up the surface and you've got to keep in their eyes it's fantastic training and I reckon I've seen I've seen a couple of summers now and they've actually very confronting the first time you see them so I yeah I just I reckon I like what the fourth time yeah you're a bit of a bit of an expert guys if you're new to spearfishing I highly recommend it listening to our episode free diving for spearfishing with Pete Ryder Peter is an entrepreneur and a excellent free dive instructor and he has come up with two great courses the 10-meter free dive and the five-minute free diver I've used if I've been afraid over to increase my bottom time I've found incredibly useful my trip to the coral sea and I cannot recommend it highly enough he's other course at 10 meter free diver is a great resource for those just starting out that literally want to get to 10 meters and this course will help you learn proper breathing technique and some of the safety aspects associated with free diving use the codename Sparrow to save 20% on all of Pete's courses he's put together the steel just for listeners of the show that's at how to free.com years ago noob Spiro [Music] all right next part of the show is Veterans vault where we take well we ask our guests to take us deep into an area of their you know their their unique experience and expertise and and you have got a lot of experience like from commercial diving and and and and cinematography early and putting together these amazing films that sort of showcase our beautiful oceans so we've teed up to chat with you a little bit about how you do that and and I mean where did where did your passion for making films come from that's very decided like from all the adventures we used to do like traveling the world and going to you know beautiful places and I just want to kind of capture it for myself I reckon I was just so I would love to you know capture this and documented myself to look back on it one day and then I started yet learning how to edit and I was like oh look at I can share it like I'll just make these videos and share it put some music on it and then yeah just sort of started there and then my experiences started to grow more and more travel the more I want to say and I just started going to the most amazing magical places on the planet really and yeah I'd love to capture it on camera and capture the beauty of it and then again just to start documenting it and and sharing it with the world and now we've got a production company called Terra Australis and it's good yeah some good following and people really enjoy it and we like to see it and we've got some amazing content on there and you know a lot of other people have contacted this alright saying thanks so much and that's really got me inspired or it's maybe it's helped me appreciate the ocean and that's like a biggest goal everyone I recently saw on your vids it was in a sheltered kind of I don't know it was a bay but it was like a little bit of sheltered water and it was just playing around with a seal yeah that's some observe beam I've been in perth and mental working over the summer and they've got a place called rottnest island just off just off the city there so it's just beautiful it's amazing like really lucky to have some of that right there and there some incredible spots out there on the islands and there's a there's a seal colony as well they're sea lions and they're they're probably the most interacting marine animal out there like I think that's where they started to get to know me I was having my swim with them every weekend and they were coming over and like they'll be sleeping on the beach and you'd go up and you have a little swim around and they'll look up at ya yeah that I'll be that inquisitive if you just swim around jump around like every fun they get they just come out and they just wanna have fun as well so they're not super swimming around you though kissing you here and there and yeah they're amazing so if you like the land at bottom you can lay next to me blah blah blah blah all that they can tell they really enjoy hanging out which is really cool yeah awesome alright like whenever you learn something I find you know you make a whole lot of mistakes and it's it's normally a great way to show other people how to learn as well what are some of the mistakes you've made making films like did you did you do the classic you know using copy you know infringing on artists you know music by putting you know famous tracks on your videos yeah the biggest thing is I just been ready because the oceans out unpredictable right oh there's so many times of like jumped in like cards not in the camera and says no SD card or whatever I had a flat back okay at a flat battery or double check your seals don't have any tiny tiny bit of hair or anything on you see your fuzzy camera are just pretty much all that I just been ready and for any type of action cuz I guarantee when you're not ready that's what that's when it come true I'm asking what what do you use to shoot with predominantly last few years I've been mainly using a 5d Mark 3 in a Aquatica housing it was just an amazing camera it takes the most beautiful photos it's a really good video as well you know you 1080 HD HD stuff but I've just upgraded to a jh5 Panasonic just more revolved around the filming side of things because it does 4k 64 which is which is really good for a small camera and it still has a 5-bit rope it can still store a lot of the imagery and colors at a really deep depth which is pretty techie for a small camera like that so it's I've just been aiming to get a camera that can almost be a base level for but production stuff like baby sinks or being I've been talking to big they say like you know I've got a job coming up in the middle of April with them for like 21 days so I'm pretty really excited excited about that and pretty pretty honored but I just want to make sure I have the you know the gear and the quality of camera to capture that sort of content that you may run into and can can share and if you're lucky enough you can share it on the planet and then everyone definitely saves it yeah yeah this is that a DSLR or is that a mirrorless it's a mirrorless - Jay Hedgehog okay it's a bet it's in between the size of a of a mirror and a DI so it's a it's a medium sized camera I just got a note North cam housing with it - but it's a neat package that's an expensive bit of kit what did that set you back with the housing I just dropped about a grant with the camera the lens the housing everything extra batteries some of their study cards so a grant it cost me that's based base level for that peak production stuff some some people were in love with the Sony stuff they apparently perform really well in low light turbo it's got a it's what does it tell me oh I can't remember Sony a five-day you got that a 6000 you haven't got the expensive when it's the a marked no is it yeah oh no I don't like it anyway I feel much more comfortable with a Canon 7d I can tell you that much this thing's all does the same thing and it's I don't know I just find that I just felt I just found the the Canon thing I knew how to use it it was easy to operate and then Shrek recommended I'll get this camera I was best thing in the world I got it I can't stay in the  Canada revising cameras and they are set up really user-friendly which is good the a mirrorless cameras I don't know from what I'm looking at this one then they pack a lot into a small thing and there's now there's more technology there's more buttons there's more settings so it's take a lot to get your head around a yeah this thing came with a manual it was like it was just freaking huge and while I was I was just pretty much just you know happy with the old servos a slow turbos flared out reading the back of a packet of wetbacks let alone an instruction manual yeah that was a that was a nightmare to having already snowing on tips to get better at spearfishing the other day and I fell asleep the camera my hair down so just gonna go down as I go yep thank you so that that camera they are they a bit like the Sonia's well Andre they're like really good in in low-light as well or like not as feeling not as good in low-light like the sony none of the Sony's would film 4k at 60 frames it wasn't any other camera that feeling really 4k at 60 frames part from the Canon 1dx which is a monster which is Seekers camera but it's twice the price as well but I look at it like not only just for K 60 frames you're looking at like your bitrate and yeah how much how much megabytes it downloads a second as well because like you can the GoPros do it as well but they don't get they don't capture the color grade that the other cameras can and then you've got a heap of different post edit stuff that you can do with the with the imagery as well after that so okay alright well let's talk about posting it what software are you using for you editing your video I use Adobe Premiere Pro I've been using that few years I just do everything pretty basic really just have the nice content they're trying to put something spectacular to start this to capture the audience don't have your segments running too long puzzle a bit of a story together and then have some beautiful music that consider and match it and and go and that's sort of the basics of it I like you don't really need hepatech e stuff for editing it's all just cutting and pasting it together you don't really need to flash it up too much otherwise it gets a bit distracting I think but you can get doing it a bit take it when if I start the catalog color great if I want a color grade stuff okay one one thing I learnt like from chetan with our media guy pet and a few other people I read a book on photography was about thinking in shots is that something that you are really conscious of like in terms of the length of the of a shot or composition like how do you how do you think about it depends like some some days we can have a shot list where we'll go out and be like this is what we need this is what we want to create this is a story that we're chasing so we'll go out and be like go to that spot take this is with imagery shots who need bang bang bang go to this spot that they may bang me this aerial shot to feel this and this and then we'll have a list which is kind of good but most of the time I'm just winging it really and just going out and I say something that catches my eye or I'll capture it and a few different angles maybe and then and then I'll work on a story later on I'll just have a hippie imagery where I can yeah make sure and try and make something out of it from there you gotta become it seems like you gotta be a little bit more sort of opportunistic with doing stuff in the water because you get no control over what's coming your idea pretty much a either put yourself in the right spot and and at the right time the two happens all right and do you collaborate with the editing or do you just is it pretty much like I mean you've got a couple of guys in your film crew you guys giving each other feedback how much of collaboration is involved in putting together a film ya know there's massive collaboration for sure we've got the three of us and Terra Australis and Ryan's amazing he's like really techie wicked editing he's um he's got really good ideas and could really great putting stories together Johnnie's wicked at storytelling tui so he's you know he's got something really out of the box ideas and he can really puzzle things together it's really good team I'm kind of lucky I suppose I'm always out in the field on they are catching most of the content which is what I love to do the best and that's so we all where we do match together with a good team johnny is really good with his social media side of things so it takes a lot I realize yes it's a crazy job actually if you want to be just getting lots of interest you gotta keep pretty busy on it and we all got our own jobs as well at the same time so this is kind of being a hobby but it's starting to form into a bit more turned into the business now we've done we've done our first taco with Discovery Channel not long ago probably like six months ago we've still got other interests from different ventures as well we've got our own projects going on at the same time okay glad I have you guys got like any films for sale on like Vimeo on demand or something serious something similar now we don't a at the moment we're just everything some free online walking through our website got links to everything that we've been involved in with the Discovery Channel the media side of things we are we are working on story now that will probably be coming out maybe as a movie a so or another documentary which may be a purchase thing online but no everything's everything's free to air at the moment or free online we've um we've followed David Oshawa along you know you know since we got on to his crowdfunding campaign ages ago is called inhale the azureus in one breath have you seen that film yeah he ran it on IndieGoGo and turbo and I got on and we were stoked like to sort of get onto a project like that was a long time ago recently he's released a documentary called agua negra and that's in Cape Verde and he's just sort of got a similar mindset to you about making it so it's just interesting I thought you might love to look it up I am caveman most the time I don't really know much much anything but I'll definitely yeah I'll grab the link and check it out for sure cool all right so we were talking a little bit about some some some failures at the start and you were talking about equipment failures in particular do you have like a process now for preparing for the day's shooting I can do you have a checklist I mean what's your kind of your prep for the day shoot look what this just look at a gear really just make sure you know if you're shooting lines getting mixes cut something you want to do that didn't right before that the morning you really like it got any wear and tear on your shooting line that's that's a bad one you can always lose fish that way or he thought there's no engaging properly or your rubbers have got a bit of sun damage and cracks just just rip like this keep on it replace it store your equipment write as a son sometimes you have a good have a spare pair of goggles always good you straps can break the air makes don't forget you wetsuit completely cold sometimes but another one not the big ones just where you're diving and what depths really and just having of the proper way for diving that depth so if you're diving she'll live chatting crayfish 510 meters whatever you probably actually need a bit away it's a extra way but if you start doing deeper stuff chasing pelagic so deep efficient twenty nine twenty maybe fifteen twenty meters just make sure you take a weight off just don't go be heavy a because that's where you get unstuck and you've noticed the biggest difference to ice okay to like use a little bit of actually energy to get down that first ten meters or whatever and then you've then your neutrally buoyant and you'll sink to the bottom but you'll notice and that's a difference if you if you're heavy from the start and you sit on the bottom of 20 meters or 50 meters for a while chasing the fish and you could turn the swim up and your overweighted it already sucks oh yeah things different yeah what about for your photography gear like for a for a shoot for like what is your preparation look like like for a day filming night before I'll prep my gear I'll clear all the cards or save everything off it make sure I've got enough memory space I'll charge all my batteries spare batteries whatever is needed if I've got a light that goes on the camera I have that fully charged Oh check out over the housing make sure the water sensors go to pressure let's go to charge battery make sure the seals are arrived make sure the dome is clean clean it with perfect cleaning equipment so for like um aspiring filmmakers you know guys that are maybe on a GoPro now and they maybe want to get a little bit more serious about making films if you got some sort of advice for them and in terms of how to think just to keep doing what you're doing and whatever you loves things you know like most people who love seeing it too so that's a good way to capture the con you want to share and just to be steady just keep a steady eye you got a GoPro champ grab one of those those units you can put it in like the handles cuz you can you've got a big bigger subject in your hands you can get the smoothest footage and just to move smooth and slow take your time let things come to you and just be just have you make sure your stuffs charged the night before because I guarantee everyone's done it with something cause happening and they go grab your GoPro a camera and it's flat yeah yeah we had a we had a really great bit of advice from tacker from underwater Ally he's he does a thumbs up before the end of every video before it turns this video off yeah or a thumbs down or like a shake your hand dude do something similar really a that's a good idea though for sure then you can go straight to the end of the clip tell you whether or not it's um worthy or not but psychology and what another tip is that go through your stuff every night if you really if you get the only filming a lot just get home put it on your hard drive and look through it delete what it's not worthy and then kkbox good sometimes I'll put like a one at the end of don't don't change the whole name of look so put it all out of whack but leave the files are numbered but at the end of it put like a 1 or something if it's a good one and then you'll remember or actually the best way to do it is to write what was in it like I have a whale so I'm over my head okay guys just like to welcome and announce our later sponsor hex aquatic now X aquatic what is it well basically it's a Faraday shield in a wetsuit and what does that mean well it means it reduces your electronic signals underwater helping you to remain undetected now lots of our past guests are wearing this technology of Sebastian Cramer Matt Madison Travis cork and Jagger crossing ham Chris coats David Ocho they're all wearing this suit why are they wearing it they're wearing it to get closer to fish it's the it's the latest in stealth technology for Speros check them out at hex aquatic com [Music] all right cool let's move on but what's let's that's one of the funniest things you've seen it's beautiful sheet Andre one of the funnest bunnies I'm pretty bad at they say like I'm always sitting there mate so like I've always like I'll go in that cave I say check out that crayfish newbie what we're going like massive what we're gonna shoot me or something and I'll go grab her by the tail as he puts his head in there somewhere but one seek one that was really funny it was it smashed me as well but I've been done by one before is it Nam ray they're electric stingrays and i'ma go first somewhere dust with one of them and obviously in the same like an illegal show okay but pretty much with crazy issues so first one I got to drop by one all this I have my own this cave and I was trying to get his crayfish in this electric boat which drove arm straight in my chest I thought I was having a hard time folding up I was like freaking out I was like I'm having a heart attack like my whole chest was kind of hurt and a massive shock I strong within an electric fence yeah and I was I took my bones I had to take some deep breaths and she knew I was gonna die I know and I was realized I was they are and then I went back down and it's like what was that and I went in and I seen this weed right thing and I was like what those crew guys and then anyway I don't know what I went to started researching there's an hombre and they're sick fish actually and then 16 gray they got there like a funny stingray shape but I have an extra bobby tail thing on the end of them and they always hide the load of sand and then like shock their prey and needham anyway so they dust about one already in anyway months and a year later I know how long later without diving with Travie and Salmon Ladder another good night and but I've been chasing crazy and he's crazy anyway ugh my home this whole by I guess max again I was like ah I ripped my arm out a bit but I was like all right and I didn't want to like show the boys own it was like it straight away I was like I'm gonna get one of these boys a and I'm on it thanks like they were laughing it was like I just kind of cut wedge the biggest crayfish in a new song I'm gonna get anyway down and I was just losers and Trevor you cam knows in two ways I'm worried it and what is in there and also watch this anyway we're in there very bolted because line of the surface screaming you know what is we couldn't laughing he was panicking a haze but he's gonna die a god that kids what could even talk sizes here so panicking just I wanted to know what it was I what it is about the same as I did when I first got here though isn't I you are now joining the the classic list of dope spirit pranksters have had some crackers on the show that was that's a really good one I like that just so good oh good man look what's in your dive bag you're over there and w8x mouth now what's what are you kind of wearing head-to-toe I've been running the heck's wetsuits for ages now well this gave me a suit to test out like two years ago I think okay and you know I've seen this new suit and this technology you know those what is this it's gonna weird but you know give it a go because always playing with sharks and testing things out and anyway the first summer work was off his Island off up this way and I jumped in was I was pretty pretty sick so it really comfy and really warm and I jumped in and yeah I was not I was like patting Turtles and had I was running my hands down sharks and I was like no this is coincidence but ever since I've always had some amazing experiences a with all different types of sharks like big tiger sharks Buncombe like pushing their nose on the camera and I always get fish coming up nice and cause I've had like it whales just everything excu the whales and don't know I would I would come pretty calm as well animate was like I'm always really not pretty country and critique it free I like heart rate anyway but yeah these suits are sick but that's all I wear now I was looked after us too and they're though they're epic so they really could make and the technology and it's really interesting so something's for people to check out it's a happy coincidence Andre because hex have just jumped on and they've started supporting the no spirit podcast so yeah we've had a good chat with Warren recently and he's a mad dude we're really we really enjoy following the hex journey it's great to see some new tech around the show are nice the good guy as well so it's nice to know about where your product came from and how you no doubt he runs the whole he runs at all that he still does Lots himself he communicates with everybody you know you really looked after so that's really cool but that's just that's a wetsuit so we're now so that they they'll ask me they do really well for me also say are you using one of the custom ones like with the yamamoto 45 are you using the what hex are they using I'm not sure what what thickness is it I'm go to five minutes radio oh spoiled I just mix it up because I don't get cold aza and we have not much meat in my bones oh you got kindred spirit here turbo turbo gets cold very easy too oh yeah for sure yeah not made the vines but um because I've done a few projects down south with great whites and that sort of like a soup raising down there so he's hooked me up with five mill done stuff in there to nylons and souls we are on in Australia and it's being be chilly a cool alright what about what about guns and fins and masks and stuff sure I've got the octo mass those guys have given us a few of those and it's kind of like one of the only massive beard and that and in moustache so slightly one of the only mass that kind of seal with my mower but um so always been just comfortable with it like it's it's a pretty big oil on but it's got a GoPro attached movement seals my face really well so I roll with that just go to normal snorkel this a like a fool through one we ever without the valve and I don't like that I just run this knuckle under my mask strap with just holds really tight so when you doesn't flap around which is cool and then just say a hex through the gloves and the socks and then a white Bell it's just one of the rubber ones or whatever so you can kind of get it tight around you so when you do diving down wetsuit cupressus doesn't slip around on you yeah do you run a string like underneath like it like a G banger to to stop it from moving at all no some guys like clip they they they clip like I know they they don't move much the rubber way beyond spot clip like on the front and then it goes between your legs up for your bum chicken coops on the back ear belt and that way it doesn't move at all sounds very European like I've seen I've got a couple of mates are doing Chris Coates does it as well I've seen a few dude stuff but not everyone does it so I just saw just interested so yeah but I don't seems to sit pretty snug a so if I had more movement I reckon I look at something like that sure I run I run a slim knife and then on my hip as well on my weight belt so it's just it's like a it's like a fabric kind of pouch with the knife that slides and it's a flat knife that slides inside it so it's pretty streamlined you're never really gonna forget your knife is always anyway part 2 which is good has your Hicks it got the external pocket yeah I think it does a I know the other ones do let's go another one today but um yeah they all do I they're pretty good for a torch but I don't know about no I put a knife and they've got the right size and it's good a turbo plays cricket so he's always gonna put a sandpaper in her sir oh never a little bit of sandpaper flatten around with my fans and dynamo spins I've just got um so special the code special cleans our carbon blade we had the years I dan dan and from very technical Sabah use of the Carson use what a key right those fins are off the hook I they really got an eye that pretty right bass really strong they're good flex there aren't a soft you were looking at a soft stiffness I've got yeah yeah what foot pockets I've got the stingrays marrow stingrays imma imma stingrays I must say grace yeah I had them before I switched to the Mary's but I think that both kind of much of a muchness but yeah I liked him yeah and that's about it really yeah all my guns like yeah I've been just using on the con side cuz I haven't even been spending that much like my mates are on the steering is they can't really shoot efficient like even come in and then because the last time I lost kinda had I was spewing chasing Bacchus and I was lying on the bottom was about probably seven eighty meters and then like this Mackey maybe eighteen twenty kilo I came in I showed it and good short kind of stoner and I was at all sweet so I just went to like pull the gun towards me and like I want the shooting line the woods fish and then it did a bolt and it was wrapped around the robot and it because I was swimming like I was like moving up towards a shooting line didn't I would really grip on the gun so like ripped out of my hands and then it just quivered off into like the thick oily I was like my Volvo so I won so just disappeared and then I haven't really fought a gun since their nose I've always you something there's always someone that's got a gun I'll just take the camera kill okay but I've got I've just come up to Xing I've gotta hate their hand build guns that I made when I was younger so I'm white spruce them up with in dust off the broom the sand off hey Coleman oh that sounds like a good bunch of kit we heard about your camera as well what about when you're traveling do you use what do you use a like a sports tuber anything um traveling tricky eyes actually quit - not so I got a Pelican case we're trying to fit a lot of valuables in it but my housing staff and the camera equipment where's my free diving gear just like a wetsuit stuff I have like a dry bag I can fit most of the stuff that can potentially be wet like to try and jam it into that and they will go into a backpack on my back but and then over the years EA we've had like you know gum bags and then you can put your wetsuit in there on your guns and stuff and my fins in there and everything like that like yeah you can there's gum bags gonna be pretty good for traveling - but man you Cookman gets heavy like he starts traveling I've been nice to time when traveling around if I'm doing that sort of stuff I've got at least 40 to 50 kilos worth of equipment because I like surfing or like spearfishing and about filming so like it's so much to you hey Ian are cool did you have any more equipment questions to buy um no really I was kind of with all the blue water yeah more so that was blasting around here's a good check yeah last part of the show are you ready to go Andre it's a fast pace around a question all night let me ask one of these days a fantastic this is Spiro Q&A just just shoot from the hip buddy could you describe what the spearfishing experience means to you in one sentence peaceful and nice and rewarding at the end of the day yeah pretty good pretty good I'm always sure to get a good philosophical answer from this - I hate it but I that's all right I liked it - go yeah mate okay if you had to start all over again what would you do differently so macho it's been an amazing journey Anthony Stokes who is the best person to go spearfishing with him why Travis has been my favorite because we could trust each other with our lives and we just always seem to have a pretty amazing time oh this is awkward H Oh Simon what is the best spearfishing if you could only choose one place to go spearfishing where would you go who has been the most influential person or people in your spearfishing that's always a right belly and uh courage and pickering and all those boys I was pretty cool to watch over there movies I used to do in the old school times Haggard was a haggard was an article VHS just getting getting a flogging very good music and shaky but he'll be mangles you know what's the single best piece of advice you've ever been given for spearfishing it's just too to each other really and why not one downs my favorite word well let's do let's do one last one and then we'll call it a day if you could go back in time to when you're starting and give yourself some advice what would you say just to take your time and be relaxed and maybe aren't in fish maybe or something like that I want to be get out get out of this spot this anymore all right man we've had a cracker Chet this is fast becoming one of my favorite interviews of all time I'd love to send people to come and check out your social media and all the rest of it where can people come and find Andre um so we've got yeah Instagram and Facebook and a web site Terra Australis you just google it website Terra Australis TV I've got my own Instagram stuff - Andre Rieu a cool creative where it's alone kind of

tra lis that's the one night all right choice choice comment we've had a fantastic chat I've learned a ton and I think we could have another interview easily yeah and I also made particularly loved your dog - its tuna breakdown and there was a few tips there that we haven't heard before that definitely probably fish save is that it probably will make guys choose differently when they're buying gear which is seems to be a huge thing with equipment failure with that sort of stuff so definitely learnt something made it was excellent and all actually I kind of us seem to sympathize with you there a little bit in how you're transitioning from you know wanting to shoot huge fishing at that rash to sort of filming and and taking a just a feed home I think there's sort of yeah so something I can definitely relate to yeah awesome I know it is it's a good transition and and then he just makes you appreciate everything else that's happened in the ocean instead of just focused on getting fish and some guys gonna be bummed I didn't get a fish but meantime they've had dolphins and sharks and amazing bait balls and you know clam fishermen around belong but they've been going wounded by the can fish and let's not forget electric rays that just make you pee your pants oh I can't wait for the place we run into one of their Oh good-o drank well we will catch you again at some stage in the

day and everything it's kind of towards the end of my day got off a little bit later today so yeah make of this video for later in the day I don't I just said that sounds weird as [ __ ] I'm already high as you can tell but today we're going to be talking about punch breath I'll be go ahead show you guys this cuz it's awesome yeah there we go wow this is probably like the first time get like a really really good angle but it's just really really pretty but this or that was Pudge breath punch breath is a cross between purple punch some of you might be pretty familiar with that straight at mindle breath so it's pretty powerful purple punch I know by itself honestly isn't all that powerful to be to be it's a little bit less than what I consider is like what I need you know as far as my THC to CBD ratio but with the punch breath I feel like the Bindo breath adds a really really nice like kick to it so you can get that full that full medicated feeling because I know with with purple punch whenever I get a purple punch it's really for that taste you know it tastes like you can get some purple punch so it's really really gassy but at the end of the day it's not going to be gassy or there like a glue or something like that you know so it's like wow for what those trades I really go for the the terpenes but I feel like this this trade is a really really good balance if you're looking for something that tastes really good but you don't want to sacrifice taste for strength or anything like that because I found that is a lot of case with a lot of the cases with these strains that are really really tasty looking and stuff like that like besides anything like glue or OG based most of the strings that are like flavor based or on the weaker end for somebody that is buying a GE like glue smoker like I am those are the strains that really agree with my physiological makeup but it's somebody else you know somebody else might have purple punch or something like that and they think that like wow that's like the best thing that ever happened you know that that's I just agrees the most with their physiological makeup you know but if you're like me though then yeah you're you're gonna like punch breath because it actually adds that kick to it from the middle breath but without further ado let's go ahead and uh rip this [ __ ] oh oh wow hopefully guys I've got your bogs your Bloods your papers your edibles however you adjust your medicine go ahead and take a dice fat rip with me smoking on a blunt you know I just rolled up backward for me and my lady for a little bit later oh yeah if there's not gonna blood or a joint or something like that just take a fat drag now Bishop responded sessions [Music] premiere video smells just like the spirit of their butt breath effects [ __ ] are very subtle it's AIT's a creeper in every sense of the word a ball like I am it to be like a minute which will start to feel really relaxed did you like to trade the mindo breath really who sits in that body with the purple punch really gives it a flavor very kind of like a like a accent uh you know if that makes any type of says did what I was very probably died but just like a different type of feeling to the you know the perfect punch is a little bit of the other body but I feel like you get both to the head from the punch why do you get most of the body for the midday but just be oh wait that was a straight appreciation for the day please hit that like and subscribe button for more content I will be doing look voltage drive IDEO so you guys got one of those coming

certainly could and for those of you that happened to catch my recent live stream or add my buddy over here just in case you're wondering and I delete that footage because of course that's super high and very scared but any anyway if anybody was even thinking that was like a move or whatever just like please no okay so please know I literally asked him a dozen times to number one like we consider the size of dad we can always get super high and then number two it was okay cool but if we're you know if you want to go like this hard we think about doing it on film cool cool and cool and I did that little thing where sometimes when I have somebody on stream with me I'll get them super super high and I never tell them I'm gonna do this because it's funny I'm sorry Billy I grab the phone and I go like hey guys let's do a quick check and see how high Parker is or see how high Austin is [ __ ] you know what I mean and I go like walk and I point and I dropped the camera like right on him and he was like and that like [ __ ] this whole world and I'm not anyway have y'all been doing I've been I've been keeping hey there's my homey 17th century century digital boy it's up childhood I've been keeping up pretty good what's the content stuff recently I got the I dropped a video this morning I believe yeah some some hash and hash awesome look at some some fine full milk and I made a nice big beautiful flag flag that I can use to roll up a nice killer hash joint with which that of course is a video that I'm going to shoot later this week and more than likely pre-recorded pre-recorded and then uploaded make sure everything's kosher I am not sure what video yeah oh that's right I like I took the IG TV video I made and I cut it up with you guys product to dad and then of course I have another video all ready to go I did that post very similar to this video but it was on Instagram on Thanksgiving Day and I'll just tell you now new video that will be over the next video tomorrow morning it I guess 9 o'clock I'm sorry eight o'clock California time excuse me 11 on the East Coast nine o'clock here whatever the new video is I don't want to give anything away like you guys have some fun you know enjoyment watching it but it's titled how we get it back in the day so I'm sure there are some of you that will see something or a couple things in that video that you like good as well some of my audience just isn't quite old enough to know some of these things the main thing that I do in the video is a process that I was doing when I was not processed but a thing that I was going right on 600 not live not live properly washed and properly brushed [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] my personal opinion it this is the thumbnail from this video with some hash frothing and I also have some a bit in hash form of course washing hash not pressing rosin washing ash making super high caliber full mouth 2020 ones why don't you use you know your the beginning of that a couple years into that I started college and stuff and pursued an education little did I know that the education would have a roundabout effect and I would bring me back to what I did for fun in the dorms and what I did for cash in college you know make an action and I was good at it I've been good at this for a while anyway studying chemistry brought me back to cannabis extracts because of course right around 2007 and 2008 for me personally I know everybody's got a different date or whatever but for me personally was 2007-2008 and by the by the be very by January 2009 it was like where I was 2008 January 2009 BHO was in full swing and because I had some previous knowledge I was able to look at that knowledge aha that hydrocarbon extraction knowledge to cannabis abstraction just it just you know give me a little bit of a leg up and also gave me the ability to kind of adapt and learn and sharpen the tools or my little toolbox etc much easier or more easily than some of the other people who were maybe just hash makers it never one to actually study the chemistry behind it so fast forwards I'm going back into this Renaissance and solvent list and from 1998 to 2020 and I've said this a couple times no short no less than 29 of the times that I've come home I said I'm like and I'm like this is the best thing I've ever this is the best thing I've made yet best thing I made yet okay until I make the next best thing I don't know I mean of course I know what I did and and how what methods that's all you know I know what I did Sarah methodology data technical technique all recorded it just seemed to really go well I don't know whether I was being maybe a little more patient I don't know what but the rinsing everything just went amazingly and then of course when I was sieving the dried hash and as it was trying I could tell that things were going to be out of control as far as quality goods then of course I brought some into room temperature and it literally started flagging and greasing up just right away so I threw a little bit in the bag and pressed it and this happened and last night I took out about a chunk that you guys would normally say is like a normal dad for me because I take stupid sighs - I broke that dab and I took it in three pieces because I wanted to get big efficient fat lungfuls and then really finished the dad you know what I mean I didn't feel like mopping up any what might be really good you know I had no idea that breaking up that one big gap into three individual deaths was gonna have me literally wake up four and a half hours later I got finished last night around 5:30 I'm sorry 4:30 it was five said because the time change so it's 4:30 in my mind with my glasses on everything just like this like I'll be honest with you it's been a minute I mean Jesus just the other day I did a gram and a half to half of pure thta here on YouTube yeah put me down put me in the dirt like this stuff does and by very rarely I mean like never like [ __ ] never I love GMOs because I [ __ ] I love the flavor and I feel something and by that I don't mean to sound like a negative like when you get to this point your tolerance is so high you never enjoy Canada well that's not the case at all if you're if you get to this point and you let your medicinal usage of cannabis become regular enough that it will mess with your tolerance and of course and also if you are very rarely around new and different people and very rarely in new in different places your to something is gentle its cannabis its you're gonna get used to it it's nice its tolerance at that point it's just normality so for me changing it up a little bit is always a nice thing to do but every once in a while like the GMO I wasn't doing anything different first time I tried GMO and shots without I got some flavor I'm so bad let's not exaggerate different phenotypes of GMO washed into couple under cured but most into live resin or live Robins this is not GMO this is I'll put this jar right here of this stuff that I made a couple days ago not only up against any GMO but I'll pull it up against any [ __ ] hash ever that's in the last 22 years of making and smoking hash almost consistently I I know if I've come across some other product that had been this good maybe or better but it's just so rare so that's the real reason I was actually gonna I was gonna fart out on you guys and just kind of not thinking you guys have seen a lot of me giveaway but I start thinking about this ashen before I get into this jar and really enjoying I wanted this to get it on camera to show you this one is very much like a slushy misty Emma check it out from the bottom you can see how it's getting thicker on the ball I'm holding like that it's actually get that bump on the bottom man this is called rosin jam it's it's what we call the heat cure or jar tech for any of you interested there are a few great videos by lotus plates and ken wall here on YouTube for jar tech rosin or heat cure rosin check it out so again three dads last night dropped me [ __ ] drop me so one end I'm gonna go with switch it up a little bit and go with some of this super super minzy's GM uh it's it's just really no good I mean dude I think you know I don't have everything and I'm certainly not a rich man when it comes to fine hashish bleh I am spoiled and with a dab of miss quality we definitely attempt this [ __ ] since I wanted to be nice and loved like under five forty five thirty just under 5:30 perfect this is about 5:25 here ladies and gentlemen Cheers [Music] [Music] the GMO might actually be louder than this on flavor other than one teeny teeny dab about almost 48 hours ago I have not smoked any GMO at all so that could vary that was the first evidence and I love me some GMO and I've had some in the fridge sitting there it's hard not to that flavor but when I'm sitting here and I'm not even exaggerating I'm looking at a little jar of the best hash I've ever made I can't get sold the puffs go cheers to you too [Music] [ __ ] keep moose if you're still not probably not here seven tenth century modified grapes grape soda [Music] okay so yes and no okay so number one how you used to smoke cigarettes for a long time and I'm sure that has a major effect on how much I coffee beans really be like my throat and really make me cough a lot but goddamn [ __ ] so it's kind of like I just it's like Russian Roulette it's dangerous but it's just so much [ __ ] fun oh [ __ ] I'm sorry come on YouTube that was a joke anyway so maybe and no totally totally not true I've had a couple of those and to be honest with you here's what sucks about lefke I come even more with those because the gym of the dad was eating like way way way way loves is matter back to mo I know that some people would say that's ridiculous there's no such thing and I understand your argument because they're the lower the more preservation of the terpenes great you make a great case great point for some of us that have turkey analogies and the really turkey or extracts are already beating the [ __ ] out of our throat those 450 and 425 degree - I would compliment not sauce on a puff go and I would get one so if I wanted to like have a session somewhere in the woods or the puffs coat I'd be sitting there I mean the whole group about like the tent packed up and he's like sitting in the back of the truck like [ __ ] come on I just for me it's it's really simply this man more than yes I have a coffee problem because I have a consumption problem I've been doing this for a minute and I love it and of course there are healthier things that I could do I'm not making that up I will say that I am there are less healthy things that I could do to recreate like this personally I believe that alcohol would be much much more detrimental to my house too you know frat boy style drink all the time and I essentially like the way I prep fraternities like binge drinks is the way that I smoke cannabis because I smoke nothing but ashish and i dab well well can't concentrate whatever i spoke nothing but extracts i just want some flour about smile but and within and then of course in that I smoked exorbitant amounts of it is it necessary no is it good for me no is it helping my throat and helping me be able to take larger dabs without coughing helmet but I like it I'm trying to live my best life for some time aside from that this is the other thing with the coffin brother I keep it like I keep it real enough to keep from getting sponsored no realize you know all the means about it like like what's your favorite stoner looks like doing that 10 gram dab and he's like there's two hot girls behind him and they're like you're pushing your boobs you know everything's great and then the second half of the picture is like and ten minutes after and he's like he's crying and throwing up and the girls have robes on and they're like pointing at him and making fun of them so it might just be that it seems like I caught them with unusual because you may subconsciously be comparing me to the other people that you see I smoke like like I smoke on social media and most of the other people that I smoke let's look like I do on social media they cough like that me too some of them choose not to cough on camera very often and I get that that's why I was trying to cough into a cow I feel like it really helps in volume I don't know but but I don't sugarcoat [ __ ] I don't filter [ __ ] I don't always felt like from the beginning that that's gonna be the kind of thing that will separate me and I feel like it does so I apologize if the coughing bothers you you are not first and you will not be the last there's a beautiful lady sick to death so you're you it's not on deaf ears but but no no I had to puff goes and use them again consumption issue more than cough and you also wouldn't get oh yeah he said he's pretty naked that's hilarious I knew you met beg but that's funny as hell brother the same same you I can't convenience portability plus plus plus but I just can't quite get it in like I'm about you the way this I don't know maybe it's the fact that I was kind of horns of dabbing patch on quartz little nail that dome well hello Jackie for so long hey bro did you like and you're getting the perfect every time and the amount of consumption you win you're the winner here consumption check which is straight up again with it with keeping it real it's just not something I really am good at doing I like to [ __ ] hold it wide to the point that then when I get up the next day and try and smoke again it's like I can't even get high because of how much I spent the night before I mean I don't want to give it any instrument negative connotation but I smoke heavily what about 780 so let's go ahead and dig ourselves out of gab midnight mix not just gonna start calling it that little hair in here earlier it's just whatever man what whatever forever man hashtag baby okay 560 560 juice yeah the thing is when I use my mouthpiece my new slabs flutter I coughed like 110 it really does work um so if the puff goes working for you bros and that's it's beautiful you're consuming less and you're consuming at a lower temperature can't get it so such mode they were so cool as far as customer service when I burn up my first white bass and they replaced it so quickly that I thought it was maybe just a fluke you know but I was going hard a lot then within 60 days I had to replace that second one to get a third I can save it I wasn't using the search mode as much but I was definitely still using it a lot third white bass I said you know what I'm not gonna herd enough from enough people I'm gonna try without such much just [ __ ] whatever I can get out of a white job is what it is and then I'll just wait a minute and dads whatever's left and then wait a minute and dabbled up you know I mean single heat up and that second white bass is right now in [ __ ] it's either in DC or in Australia but it's kicking and it's the Lucid peak is in Australia and so that's my burnt mine up bro and and yes you know I understand that you shouldn't need to go that hard and go that in it but man I just I just wanted to have a little device that I could put on my cup holder that I could rip like [ __ ] granddad's out that's asking too much [Music] yep so anyway I think the secret mode is actually it's ten clicks and I believe it's just a you know it's it's it's it's like fur that's what we call them I'm an engineer analytic so something that if they have to work on a page or something like that and if they do those ten clicks then the sequence of lights or whatever happens the number of times whatever color flashes or whatever is that is a specific message or maybe even a specific diagnostic code as into what's where where things are failing or whatever there is no ability inside that be crazy that would I would completely avoid the warranty of the product which of course you know if you do the cuff coil repair thing then you absolutely have an unwarranted atomizer but from what I've heard which they they really became popular after I got rid of mine you can get a pretty good dad with this [Music] [Music] you are sadly you know it's like I love a medium device and you know I don't I'm not I was I've really liked it initially when it came out it was just such an amazing idea turned out to just not be efficient for my life accident how did dad like it I like and I'm like [Music] hey Thomas Jordan thank you very much brother welcome to the street 710 you were very right brother um it thank you we should comment it was a thing I did do a video about it I got a messages from like four people that day what does that mean and I'm like so you know being me rather than like reaching out to the company due diligence or research or anything like that I turn the live stream on I'm like what's going on here guy with my infrared thermometer I was able to determine it not only with nothing changing then every second company mate told me I was a fool hey soos you need good glass collection is always good but I like it no CRC brosnan is not only CRC the last seat in CRC is for chromatography the first color remediation chromatography the big thing about rosin of course is that solvent we processed you know it just like this which is frozen but to be fair this was flour mechanically separated anyway by being regulated - so you're regulated - using things that are water some people accept ethanol most people accept co2 almost everybody agrees that gravity is not a solvent even though I disagree anyway so this is some flour rosin I know what I did here was take flour rosin and pressed it and pressed it into a butter or oppressed it into a nice beautiful golden hue and I let it butter over about a 48 hour period and I took the bar of rosin butter and separated the terpene fraction from it and isolated the THC a melted back down the THC a put the chunks in there and put and put the terpene faction on top I think I started with around 10 grams and it was six and a half just seven so you think you may think well there's lost there it was very much the collection of the terpene fraction of the front and the isolation of the THC a in and wiping the muck out of the middle so this is guaranteed a way higher animal a higher quality product then the flour rotten butter by itself but anyway in answer to your question again you can't chromatography is not only you have to dissolve which I guess you could solve honestly water and which you're not you won't dissolved it's not soluble but in ethanol you can dissolve and that's considered food safe and some people consider that solidness so in that situation you can certainly dissolve but then if you were to go through a media which is like let's say some T 5 T 4 T 1 was at 5:41 or for 415 for 525 or whichever one is there's three different major t clays that are a common silica Magnus all was a number of products that people are really pumped on and you bake these powders so that they're completely dry mix them completely and by mixed they might be like to a specific ratio and then you homogeneously mix them and you fill a call packed full of it steal that call and pull a vacuum on it so then that that column is entirely under vacuum then you introduce that media with solvent so that that media is completely soaking wet after that you're going to pass the of that oil over top of it and through it and by passing it through that media through all those powders then what comes out of the bottom is I don't have let me count how many see I see alright yeah is it Jerry [ __ ] them I'm walking on there they're clear oil out of it when you don't have your media preparation dialed in you pull a whole lot more out than just fat and lipids in chlorophyll so it's quite the science with cannabis chromatography in itself is a facet of organic chemistry that you can devote your entire life to but as far as for cannabis it could be quite a bear to dial in and then of course as far as for doing anything solve honestly like rosin if you're doing that with your product men it's obvious it's not rosy no it's it's a solvent made product of BHO or a Pho QH other outfit qho because who knows all right let's see if I could you cheers to you too brother Ken's make me jealous I like it yeah oh [ __ ] let's yeah I'm back I was just reading them I'm sorry so I did no but I have you know a butane propane mix you came by it self proclaimed by itself etc all of us and to make the diamond store to do my first crash and then turkey fraction and protein fraction I said separate as much of course as I can and then I have rheda's all in pentane so that THC a which are you know a bunch of really small diamonds but small and sometimes gonna be a little cloudy when you want to clear them clean them up a little bit you can dissolve them in pentane and then you can with a couple tried-and-true steps of crystallography you can crash that thta back out of the pentane and it is very easy to clean pentane well residually it just vacuumed off easily and aside from that when you're making a crystal inside of it it doesn't trap itself in the lattice work very much or very easily and our crystals in here crystal so that's really the only time I've use pentane and a Pho and as far as for making a pho or diamond product and that of course the only reason you would do that is if you have a bunch of small diamonds and you want to read us all let them crash again into maybe some bigger stones that are a little more clear or a little more faceted where I am if you're growing stones it's all about the clarity you're growing like cloudy white just roundish stone yep that's beautiful the Jasmine that brother so this is some GMO that I believe is live no it's not it's not even I'm sorry it's not live either and that makes sense actually because it's got a good hue to it maybe it is its constellation cannabis is GMO and then this is a water hash that I made I pressed into rosin and it is again the best product I've made maybe ever but it is one of the best product hash products I wish I had I wish I had more of it that's usually how these situations go you know you uh no one ever catches like a whole field full the beautiful ones [Music] exactly purple parts when it's on the low temp you did how many you guys remember when I used to talk about this because I'm sure somebody eventually is gonna see this and look back but yeah I used to dab like with that trash can right beside me all the time because almost every video included like a vomiting [Music] and if you think I'm reckless now [ __ ] you need to go back in there this I 350 plus videos in this catalog if you go back to videos and there are a lot of things I can't really sum it up and one you could but again thank you guys for joining me tonight let's risk let slip one more together so this is a be free gavel highly educated course you can get these highly educated nights then of course and you can get them from me on my website the 710 extractions calm very very very fair price it's not unfair but I think I beat most people or match rights but also shipping included so in that because the shipping included I think I beat me people anyway doesn't matter that's not I'm not trying to race to the bottom it's the idea that if you want to get a banger of this quality you can get it from me and I will actually make it a little more affordable and a little easier for you and you can help support my channel so and then of course on the notion of supporting my channel I was talked into creating a patreon I actually had a couple games on Instagram in a row about it and we'll see what happens for those of you that are interested I am the second distraction everywhere I go so you can search for me there if you just go to pastry on or but this is a highly educated v3 gavel it has a much much deeper opaque bottom and even a cup like a little bit around the top and it functions like a beast I love if you wouldn't want to try the new courts the opaque work style from heaven sure it has the thick courts around it with opaque in the Senate and then for homey Kansas cutting down on vh o Allah yes II and because I'm not smoking a lot of Winnie let's refine pho that's really do act broader spectrum [Music] how did you see the versus a if you smoke like a drunk and not not vaporize at Lowton salt smoke any good if you're gonna smother she probably stick to some really really really really well upon beach they're removing all of the butane beyond the parts per million way cleaner than any air you breathe outside anywhere on this country on this planet anyway yep program you know that's yep you got it come on I catch up yes yes yes so this has a big lake in that so it has two layers on the bottom and then the third layer on the top which would normally be you would think we solid see how you can barely see the beach spinning around inside there shoot you can't see at all that'd be barely spinning around there that's because of the that third disc of opaque is just on the outside so it's coming up if that makes any sense I like my dabs to be all heavenly and [ __ ] and seven times n1 and the oven sure one is a clear quartz thick quartz bell-shaped aperture banger with just an opaque Center disc I think that's a very interesting approach very interesting idea you know what I'm going for it oh my god so when I was scrolling there guys and trying to get caught up if I miss leave a comment greatly apologize I guess I get stuck behind like that it's just me here trying to take some dad and chill with you imagine being acid you know imagine spoken with nobody's talking amongst themselves they're all just talking so I apologize but I will try and say it Chris Chris thinks it's funny and I appreciate that brother absolutely and that's perfectly now I will say this though if you're having that kind of a problem with your sauce is thickening then you're probably not but more often than not it's just that you're not achieving an efficient 2d wax you know as I'm sure you know you have to get a very funny incredibly super critical super critical it's just like clean or not clean it's not like you can get very clean you have to get very very very cold negative 80 degrees Fahrenheit and lower and you have to be able to maintain that temperature throughout the entire process and also if you're doing like cold super cold d waxes and you're doing it for 30 minutes or one hour or whatever if you're doing it for two hours then doing for [ __ ] 10 push your variables so far that you think like this is just a waste of time I'm just locking up all my equipment well write down exactly one that point it was when you locked up and exactly what temperature were at and then cut just before that during the on the next month try check out your results and then send me a thank you Dan but you got it that's the breakdown with for the put the bent for the Pentium rinse we call it and the reason we call it rent is because essentially it's rinsing the THC a crystal a lot of their impurities and cloudiness and by rinsing them of those it lets them precipitate in fewer points meaning that they will make larger stone if you have a million points of precipitation you're gonna have a million little tiny stones if you have ten points of precipitation you're gonna have ten [ __ ] boulders you see what I mean round numbers though obviously I'm not nothing specific in there Oh God profiles for round two after GMO so it is happening I guess that's a stupid question I uh no names no no cities and updates no no but on on the unregulated market I have seen this exact same thing happening being that I know what I know and I you better hope I'm not the one that's in the back of the truck if you're trying to hook my buddy up with a jar or something and then I end up getting the job I've made up handing me the drawing one let's see what do you think should I buy this and I'm like whoa and I literally said right back this is a pretty good this is a decent CRC job straight up as long as the price is good yeah I would buy this and the drivers started to argue and try to say that like you know oh no no no that's [ __ ] that's a lot of house rosin I'm like and my homie knew better than to even like question are you sure even or argue with dude or anything like I guess there you go that's how far none of us really knew how far these people were going to take care of polishing tech and really really use it to rip people off but the absolute pinnacle so far that I've heard is this taking CR seed oil and passing it off as solvent as fast rosin or solvents or when in some cases and by some I mean I hear about this a lot to CRC oil especially on the unregulated market is not usually properly purse or at least fully first because they for consistency means [Music] and again if you don't know your chemistry then you're not going to create the texture of batter that you want and be able to still get it clean by the time you get it clean you have nothing but dry crumpled even though like what the hell is wrong with dry white ash but anyway you see what I mean people are just sitting there getting your oil clean then why worry about produce cuz rosin so much more expensive I guess right but like why wouldn't you be proud of your product than me and say like you know what this isn't Rosalyn this isn't salt on this this isn't this is what I made and this is what I did this is if you're properly if you're doing that properly you can truly start with a trash bag trash can of pay and you may not yield a whole lot but you have some beautiful jars some beautiful jars whereas this was made from as far as yield percentages that was made from a small amount overall but considering how much made this much hash a large [Music] exotic so you know it's your prerogative right and that coin all I want a risin claim but it's chugging out not bother huh you know what that means whether the temps in an AZ and I believe but your temps you humidity literally each time you open your jar doing like what I'm doing right now leaving that open while I'm smoking you're forcing oxidation and it's the THC a count and the rosin is high enough like this [ __ ] but seriously a CA count is high enough and their interference present to act like a co solvent was just a little bit of heat and by he don't mean heat I mean room temperature like 70 degrees that's that's considered not heat that's definitely you can definitely you will absolutely encourage degradation at eighty degrees or consistency change so that's probably more than likely while your shits sugar enough and that's a good sign in rhythm I mean just [ __ ] fire again yes please do I knew the man my brother Chris hey you're the man a you know I so digger has a lot of import opaque bottom bangers and I used a lot of those for a long time and they they function pretty well but when I go to digger for a banner I go to dig out for a banger that's clear quartz that has a thick base now because I find that this is the micro injection of the air bubbles is something that is a delicate enough technology or science behind that it needs to be done it needs to be done properly and unfortunately some of these processes when done properly cost a lot of money so how do you you know you can't make a product cost x equals which you don't good get it for cheaper than that on my site hey one since day one you're the man you the man dude my phone is still on the same like I got it takes like 10 seconds to actually bring the app to the constraint but every time I type the word lift it when I go when I get like LIF GE and like if I had to eat in or whatever suggestion thing above it the middle suggestion one is always the word lifted with a why because if just messaging back and forth and we type in your name in or or whatever that's hilarious man buddy see brother haven't seen you in a minute stolen dad that baseball-sized I just dab the [ __ ] about that long ended up being it was 1.57 brand trashy absolutely making you know what's up with this um the older it is the harder it's gonna be to do that you really really really really want to bring it down then and see if you can possibly because in this situation with that older material you can actually start to do acts and cool a little bit of color with that too and that's essentially what's happening during chromatography but you're just doing it because some of your chlorophyll or your aunt assignment is actually precipitating out with the facts of the waxes if you do it they'll get a cold enough temperature push your variables brothers get them getting as cold as you can get it and keep it as cold as you can for as long as you can but do not leave anything of course Indians here in your system if your temperature is fluctuating that's just dangerous all right let's see where it has been so good we've been kicking it but I will say that I do have some more comments content coming if you haven't been to the page of one oh there's probably a couple new videos up dropped another big-eyed rockin video this morning and I have already one uploaded scheduled a joint or video prepared this amusing of thwack or a nice and I take it increase it just like a rolling paper and very carefully roll a nice cone out of it what's a nice big cone out of it I'm a little okay so as you can see we've done this a couple times I fit the mouthpiece end of it very gently down into my hash joint holder and there's a specific way to light it and to get it going and then a very specific way that it needs to ash itself and with just a tiny little bit of flour tiny trying a little bit of flour in the center you can smoke a very very large amount without ever having to lighted other than of course the first time that you light it with your lighter and then you are during the rest of the TEC it takes you at least 20 or 30 seconds there's absolutely no butane left happening so it's literally like a ring of hash that keeps lighting itself it's an amazing amazing process and I'd love to share so I have the hash made and I got a tiny little bit of flour I love the clean pumps huh my homie pot and her D hooked me up with one of these lockable ones the lockable ones and I just I love it I only use ice on that though I keep my DC cleaner and this little guy right here but anyway yes it's a great product easily okay it get things incredibly McKay I see somebody do the same thing with keeps and kind of collapses oh yeah so I find that I do the same thing and I take the key and with my strings which are you know again based off their just the bubbleman tri-cities thing Richard this they built based off of the idea screens that are made for screen printing anyway I get a little scope and stack shout out with those screens I'm able to grade the Keith and so when I depending on the extreme there is a specific grade or a size head or grouping of size heads that is always higher quality than the others and those always form the best papers no I'm sorry it's all combustion but there's no ignition anymore other than the very first ignition after that point we let it do it to itself you do it to yourself see you kids like the Radiohead you do with Jesus all right cheers ladies and gentlemen I love you I need you and I will see you so much it sure is my brother this is the turbo perfect that's why we had a little bit extra heat there um anyway this is called the thermometer you can check them out on Instagram it's thermometer but aside from that if you have any courts that you love and you want to take good care of it honestly I am not kidding this device is essential it's perfect you can tempt your courts and make sure that you never ever ever ever Chazz you back so the thermometer check them out on Instagram or you could just go to WWE are mad or calm and if you are going to purchase one don't forget to save yourself 10% by using my coupon code which is the same for every website that I ever have one for and I have a that I have anyway Oh 7:10 extract take the center of my name the 7:10 extraction is so seven one zero extract extr a CT and that gets you 10% off the kilometer and this it's a black device I wrapped a little skin that looks like let's put a fake wood made by GAD wraps around this and yes I'm working on that company for a coupon code I don't mean to town I don't I don't mean to take a sleep you know a hard left turn here at the end of the stream but does anybody else think it's kind of weird that this year International Women's Day was only twenty three hours long I'm just saying I love you guys all have a good night stay medicated it's Sunday it's officially Monday now do you think start your week off right and if it's just not happening for you take a second take a deep breath I'm gonna do something nice for somebody you can turn it around [Music] no it won't of course infrared thermometer can't really take it takes the air temperature of the air in and around the Banger it's not possible for infrared monitored properly we've done glass happy birthday flipped it looks so good to hear that brother I'm kind I'm so good to see you again but how are you eating it now oh so a blazer with a scope and stack upgrade kit on it and then I'm temping it with a turf honor love you guys here is to another week go out there", "EMk-UYMSpG4": "presentation understanding the impacts of a changing cannabis policy thanks for sharing your afternoon with us I'm tani Logan the executive director of the Sonoma County growers alliance to my right Ernie carpenter who was a former board of supervisor and Tony I just Salvaggio who is a professor up at Humboldt State and environmental sociology also engaged in a lot of good environmental work so I think the best way for us to get going on this is to lay a little bit of a foundation for people are really trying to understand the full perspective of why this conversations at the table for a sustainable enterprise conference and I'd love to hand that over to Ernie to talk about the history of cannabis thank you very much perhaps talking about cannabis is old hat a lot of people left the room but I'm going to wake you up and give you a little history so I'm going to take a little historical approach to marijuana I know this is about sustainability to me sustainability's three legs I'm going to speak to the social justice aspect and how marijuana has been unjust through time my father spent 32 years in the United States Navy and he smoked Marilyn marijuana maybe should just say pot along with other sailors before he became illegal the period was the mid-1930s merrell marijuana law became regressive in 1937 promoted by Henry J Anslinger who was the first chair of the bureau of narcotics he was the first hardliner on both drugs and alcohol under President Hoover around nineteen thirty the government began a campaign against marijuana let me read you some titles that appeared in articles youth gone loco marijuana assassin of youth Uncle Sam fights a new drug menace marijuana sex crazing drug menace the menace of marijuana and exposing the marijuana drug evil in swing music most of these authors drew their information from the files of the newly created Bureau of Narcotics just before Anslinger prepared his assault on Capitol Hill that is to get the first bad marijuana laws in the country one more quote that's and this is bloody the sprawl body of a young girl they crushed on the sidewalk the other day after a plunge from the fifth story of a Chicago apartment house everyone called it suicide but actually it was murder the killer was narcotic known to Americans as marijuana and history as hashish is a narcotic used in the form of cigarettes comparatively new to the United States and dangerous as a coiled rattlesnake this is the very foundation of the drug laws in this country Anslinger was given a boost to and it was discovered there was probable collusion between drug narcotics agents and drug distributors can you imagine that this is way back in the 30s skipping forward to 1992 we had the Boggs Act which assured in the undercover age targeting such seedy characters as musicians here's what you got for a first-time possession of marijuana two to ten years plus twenty thousand dollar fine jump to Richard Nixon 1971 of Watergate frame Nixon used drug policy to go after liberals and minorities to disenfranchise their voting ability quote look we understood we couldn't make it illegal of a younger poor or black in the United States but we could criminal criminalize their common pleasure we understood that drugs were not the health problem we were making them out to be but it was such a perfect issue that we couldn't resist it this is new information that just came out of the files due to the Freedom of Information Act and that was John Ehrlichman who was white House Counsel the president the chief of staff Haldeman said Nixon emphasized that you have to face the fact that the whole problem is really the blacks the key to is to devise a system that recognizes white recognize this while not appearing too so they authored the war on drugs and the Southern Strategy to disenfranchise voters to regressive marijuana law it included no-knock warrants and mandatory sentencing prior to this you might be interesting to know they picked on the Mexicans a whole lot because they were the purveyors of marijuana and in fact it's noted throughout that they were the people who gave the swing musicians the marijuana terrible during the late 1960s the famous counterculture popularized marijuana in the haight ashbury and even here in Sonoma County the communes and long hairs were growing and using marijuana many of the local sons and daughters started smoking pot and that brought about some real changes and local attitudes this kind of thing happened across the country and frankly it drove Nixon crazy President Reagan held that 100 marijuana plants were deemed the same as 100 grams of heroin during Reagan's term the number of people behind bars for nonviolent drug law offenses increased from 50,000 in 1982 over 400,000 by 1997 during the 1980s was a repeal of mandatory sentencing and marijuana was being differentiated from other hard drugs and the comprehensive drug act prevention and control act from 1965 until 75 jumping back a little bit in time returning veterans from the Vietnam War spread marijuana use from Maine to San Diego and Seattle to Florida yes the deep sell sell marijuana invade every corner returning vets accounted for more changes in attitude in the spread of marijuana than any other single factor to impact the spread of marijuana throughout this culture 1989 we had Bush's war on drugs even though nearly a dozen states had decriminalized marijuana Bush went back to the familiar terms I came in as a student in 1961 college that is and here's what I saw and this is the theme of my talk if there is one brown black yellow poor white poor people singled out picked upon by law enforcement arrests in a thing in the aftermath fell upon these populations is the same today but in much fewer numbers that is fewer people are getting arrested but roughly in the same proportion the ACLU estimated 3.6 billion per year as the cost of what they call our national obsession with marijuana new york times april 2014 they point out that after three decades of enforcement about 30 million Americans used marijuana that black and white blacks and whites use marijuana about the same proportion but that blacks are from nine to thirty percent more likely to be arrested depending upon where you are sentencing is even more of a disparity so come 1996 and we might say was from bad drug policy to the birth of an industry and here in California I'm running out so here's what I'm going to do it will take continuing People's Revolution to bring about change primarily at the ballot box this is what happened in California Oregon and Washington you cannot count upon your local politicians because they lack the wherewithal to create good equitable drug policy they run scared of public opinion as an industry you must educate the local people you must stand up to bad law and it remain the same if you don't the black to brown the yellow the youth and the poor will all be victims of this prosecution the best the tendency is for government overtaxed and over-regulated speak out against this it will be helpful to know the value of marijuana lastly is important to maintain representatives to government like Tonya Logan and Sarah Schrader to communicate the message and to stay organized we're only halfway home until marijuana is totally decriminalized we will suffer the same problems of differential enforcement and we will see the poor the brown and the black go to prison while most other people who can afford good lawyer skate thank you sure sure thanks your honor for that history really appreciate it my name is Tony sivaji Oh perfect just going to talk to you today a little bit about understanding the impacts of changing cannabis policy I'm a assistant professor up at Humboldt State University and I'm also senior researcher at the Center for cannabis and social policy and also a researcher at the only research institution in the state of California that studies cannabis and that's the humbled entered interdisciplinary of Institute of cannabis research today I want to talk a little bit about changing cannabis legislation and try to help us understand some of what that means for the region and for Sonoma County the title of my talk is opportunities and challenges prohibition and post Prohibition era and give you some lessons from the Emerald triangle I'm going to focus my comments on research into environmental issues related to cannabis agriculture and both the past the present in the future so an outline of my talk is I'm going to talk a little bit about the impacts of past and present cannabis policy and the impact that policy has had on cannabis cultivators in the region up north and the Emerald triangle and I'm going to try to help us understand some of the political economic reasons that the industry took a particular path to understand what are those opportunities there for cannabis cultivators to engage in particular types of practices and then I'm going to address how these issues were dealt with regionally and locally and finally I will end hopefully on a positive note and talk a little bit about Marissa and Amma a couple pieces of legislation there that we're going to be shaping cameras policy as we move forward so that said I want you to take a second and close your eyes if you could for me and then take a deep breath what's the first thing that comes to mind when you think of the word Humboldt alright yes exactly exactly it's certainly it's certainly not you know it's certainly not candy right the state may be the leading supplier of cannabis in the united states california we are actually the largest California's the largest domestic supply of cannabis we beat out Mexico recently but the Emerald triangle specifically Humboldt County is the center of the universe of cannabis agriculture and cannabis culture and it's been this way for decades even though many of many folks don't really want to recognize that some of the economics of marijuana agriculture I mean the farm value of cannabis has been estimated between 2.5 billion upwards 25 billion annually and that's in California alone nationwide we're looking at 13 to 35 billion dollars it is it is the cash crop of California and some would say the nation compare that in this ties a little bit too Ernie says compare that to the war on drugs about 50 million on the war on drugs failed war on drugs I want to note in Humboldt County marijuana alone contributes to around again these are estimates because we don't necessarily know the numbers 40 million 400 million to around 1.5 billion and this compares to what was the leading AG industry at the time timber which brings in around 40 million or 60 million so that said you know when I arrived as a grad student the mid-nineties at Humboldt State other than the occasional class survey of you know drug use there was no social science research being done on this on this topic Hsu and I think most institutions had an aversion to cannabis cannabis research wanted nothing to do with it it was a taboo topic and there was a stigma associated with doing research there even though many of us knew that it was the economic driver of the region the cultural fabric there was a code of silence even after prop 215 few academics touched this so we know very little about the industry still today at the time I was actually involved in the front lines of the forest battles trying to stop the timber industry from logging old-growth so I wasn't really necessarily interested in this topic though I knew and was embedded in cannabis culture and it wasn't until I finished up with my work up in Oregon i returned to humboldt in the late 90s when i reconnected with a cannabis community there and this is a post proposition 20 proposition 215 environment and I started to notice the environmental impact of both indoor and outdoor agriculture and cannabis so the agricultural practices of this industry started to resemble those practices of other industrial extractive industries you had massive impacts and I'll just show you a couple slides here these are dots these red dots are actually cannabis industrial farms thousands of plants and they litter the landscape this is about 2012 so what we saw then in my research pursuits we had massive habitat destruction we had illegal timber harvesting this is a before and after and no one's living up there this isn't a farm this is you know the support they're not growing apples up here right but you see here you have unregulated industrial agriculture taking place in an area that's already in recovery recovery of a hundred years of resource abuse by timber mining and AG and that was and I once say those were regulated industries so what we found was what I found in my research was that you know there was no one really wanted to talk about this issue the code of silence was there so I started to shift my attention to studying this issue and trying to draw attention to the environmentally harmful practices and understand the reasons why these things are taking place so I was the first sociologist to really put together a research agenda on this topic to address these issues and you know we needed to talk about it so what I started to do is arrange some forums Oh another issue is we'll talk about later some the tox but I started to address this issue by arranging some forms where the community can come together and talk about what path forward we could take to deal with some of these environmental issues to try to get the community to and policymakers to have a dialogue about the ecological and human health of the industry so we brought together academics agency experts growers and try to understand that problem and what it pointed to was prohibition and how prohibition creates these sort of social political and economic conditions for bad actors to engage in harmful practices it rewards people who do the most devastation so those growers with what I found trying to do the right thing those were the folks that were rated and those are the folks that were police the most the most environment friendly grows were the ones that were that got all the tension so you know what is the growers response when you get rated when you're trying to come into compliance well you know what just going to go indoor and the indoor issues are the indoors probably one of the worst ways to grow marijuana I have some medical advocates saying it's it's we should do some indoor because it controls but but the the indoor Agriculture's is really problematic so I started to have symposiums and other we started to break the code of silence we had actually an earth day symposium on marijuana in the environment is on 4 20 it was two days of panels that that brought together people who come from different sort of interest we had policy makers we have fed wildlife we had law enforcement we had we had growers and academics to talk a little bit about these and this is 2012 and 2013 so we're trying to push this conversation forward because this is the lifeblood of our community in the north as I such road earlier it's a multi-billion dollar industry so to address these you know I think the community started to recognize some things here one was as I said it's the lifeblood the other is that this industry is unlike any other industry that any other AG industry unlike big AG like wine you know vegetables where the workforce is paid slave wages and the working conditions suck right in this industry workers are paid well and working conditions are excellent right so it's a different type of Agriculture for Kent cannabis agriculture in terms of working conditions and such so these folks industry folks government folks are trying to work together to try to protect the economy and to craft rules that actually protect both business and the environment so that said you know to address these policy gaps local folks started to put together campaigns to push policymakers to craft legislation and I have a couple slides here this is recent cannabis legislation this is Martha this is the medical marijuana regulation Safety Act this was the first real change in cannabis policy in 20 years and what it did is it established some protocols for addressing the environmental issues it also addressed issues of pot doctors if you will which we can get into later but more more germane to the environmental issues it really set out some rules around what are appropriate environmental standards for cannabis agriculture that said that also folds into a ballot initiative which is going to be any on the ballot in 2016 and November coming up and that is the adult use of marijuana act these two acts mercy and Amma kind of go hand in hand and they reflect the concerns for both sustainability ecological sustainability but also economic sustainability there are some questions that remain in our community and that is big AG right we want to keep our economy there we want to keep our small businesses how do we address this issue of large agriculture corporate agriculture coming in and taking over everything and we lose that sort of cannabis culture that cannabis economy that is so important to us the other is the taxon and I think I'm just going to hit this and finish it up you know it's around fifteen percent plus a seven tax you know is the tax structure the right tax structure is it going to promote the black market in these environmentally harmful practices or is it going to be a structure in which folks will come into compliance so I think just I'll leave you here leave this here one more common is is I think important to recognize that growers want to come into compliance the growers that I interview and talk to they want to do the right thing they have to be treated differently than they are now I mean right now there's a stigma still the pot stigma you know you know you get somebody who owns a winery that walks in they're treated different than a pot grower and that's got to change on all those levels for them to feel like they're legitimate be treated legitimately so the stigmas got to be removed and our agencies and also we have to just own up to what it you know it's it's a huge part of our economy culture and we got to start talking about this and I think Tony's going to talk a little bit more about this issue and want some question as answers Thanks thank you Tony Thank You Ernie there's the setup for some good dialogue about what about today what are we going to do about these things now we have a perspective on how we've gotten here and what some of our primary issues are I want to first address one new one so i think is really important for just general public to understand there is a clear divide happening that we can see within the industry and i'm hoping that people can see in the industry from that a that are looking into the bubble of what is cannabis operations we've been seen as this one one you know drug growing harvesting just shooting entity but there's really nuances within it just like any other industry so when Tony earlier was talking about you know regulated operators and talking about you know the compliant operators and these excellent work spaces that we have our farm workers who are getting paid well treat it well we're talking about a portion of our industry where people choose to do the right thing even though they're not being rewarded even though everything could be taken away from them the next day because the feds might show up or camp might show up they still will go back to doing the right thing because that's who they are as a person and that's what's driving right now this movement towards towards mm RSA the medical marijuana regulation Safety Act that was passed last year through the three bills and that's what's driving us to have this conversation today we have good actors who are trying to do the right thing and change this industry into a responsible part of our local economy of our environment of the sociology of our community and right now we need to support those operators in their attempt to make that change for our industry we still have bad actors we have people who come into this industry because it's the quick and easy way to make money and they have terrible workplaces there are people who are worked down to the bone and then might not even get paid might not even survive the experience of working out on these farms that is happening right now and this is what we're trying to change and its prohibition has given them that place to hide because like Tony was saying earlier why are they rewarded why is the person who's doing the most damage being the most rewarded because of ROI they are putting the least amount of money into creating the most destructive cheapest way to grow the marijuana on the farm and they take that money and they run and they have the most profit and the people who are committed to their communities are giving that money into their local school and nope nonprofits and pain living wages and exceeding living wages by you know fifty to one hundred and fifty percent how are we rewarding those good actors and how are we supporting them in continuing to build a model touching on what earning was saying earlier i think that there's a really beautiful perspective here that the marijuana industry as an industry there was an inception and it was when prop 215 came into play prop 215 the compassionate use at this came from the AIDS epidemic in San Francisco this was the heart of the movement this was to give medicine to AIDS patients who were dying and couldn't afford the expensive aids medication from there an entire industry has come into play and now like everybody wants a piece of marijuana industry everybody's got like an angle and how they're going to participate and how they're going to get into this and you know everybody in this room right now at least knows somebody who's interested in what's happening with the cannabis industry or has been approached by a family member or friend about it with all of that activity let's not lose sight of the foundation of what this is this is a medicine and it has been a medicine and has been recognized by humans who have been consuming and feeling the connection to the plant and feeling the connection to themselves ultimately it is that connection to self that this plant medicine offers and we don't want to lose that so we need to continue to make sure that we're providing in all of our great ideas of how we're going to capitalize on this like new regulations and opportunities how are we streaming this you know a piece of this excess of funds that are coming in through our industry into good projects how are we putting it back into our environment how are we putting it back into public safety how are we putting it back into our schools how are we going to prevent youth how we're going to support youth intervention how are we going to support Latino communities that have been affected by this agricultural product and exploitation that is all of us working together so for 20 years to now now we have regulations regulations is literally the birth of a new of a new industry so like the car manufacturing industry in the wine industry and the tech boom that happened here's the birth of a new industry for the first time regulated market place where we have investors and we have players from all sorts of fields and getting involved in this because now it's safe to get involved people's doors are still being busted down you know farms are still being rated and unfortunately it's usually the low-hanging fruit the people that you know are not going to have a gun the people who are not paying off law enforcement or feds from coming to their house are the ones that take the biggest hit again how do we help this industry take that first step California is always the leader you know in the United States for progressive thoughts in creating sustainable enterprise we have we're about to burden this new industry and we can again be a thought leader by having a new industry boom that is from the get-go sustainable from the get-go engaging and making sure that we're really being contemplative on our effect on the rest of the economy around us and so this is really a great place for us to have a dialogue about how we can participate together so it's Sonoma County growers Alliance we're constantly looking for you know who are we going to work with next and what are we going to do you know what next environmental program can we get involved with and we just got our brochure translate it into Spanish because we want to make sure that that community is not missing all the information and accidentally being the ones who get rated next because they don't speak enough English to understand what the rules are we want to make sure that those who suffer from consumption and substance abuse have support programs that are appropriate that are no longer based off of propaganda and media you know the DARE program just removed cannabis from its list of substances we have an opportunity to come into the schools and have a real conversation when you tell a child that the that cannabis is as bad as heroin they can just as easily say so heroines not as bad it's as good as is cannabis because I smoke pot so I guess Harold's not that bad so we have to change the dialogues everywhere we go and when we hear an issue we have to say what's the solution and that's where we need more people to come to us with solutions like I've got a great idea or I'm concerned about this and this is what I want to see happen so this is where I want to take this conversation back to the three of us up here and jump into a couple pieces and then really like to invite you guys to think about a couple questions that you might have or suggestions and ideas that we can run with from there yeah you want to comment yeah well we didn't quite work this part out now we're now we're just free-flowing if it works we didn't quite work this part out something I neglected to say and really want to say if they were lucky to have Assemblyman woods and Senator McGuire because they seemed not to be afraid to take this on I think most of the changes that's happened with marijuana has happened at the ballot box and one should not ever overlook that it sort of gives the locals courage to deal with the issue and I'd like to address that as well i think you know we were talking before this about the OMA initiative for those of you don't know that's the adult use marijuana act and that is the initiative there's also the MCL our initiative that if both of these initiatives are trying to gather enough signatures just to make it onto the ballot for 2016 so you may have the opportunity to vote on whether or not California is going to legalize recreational use of marijuana in our industry this is something we've been really hoping for a really long time we're really excited for the opportunity to kind of remove some of the barriers because there's a place for medical and those are for people who medically needed and there's a place for recreational and those are for people who want to just consume it like they have martinis and glasses of wine and cigarettes and a beer at the end of the day so by allowing recreational we're allowing people to be able to go into a dispensary that has the that with just showing their there that they're an adult you just have to show your driver's license and that that recreational use will be heavily taxed and hopefully the laws will be created in a contemplative way and that some of that money will be able to provide access to medicine that is well tested that is that is consistent for the patients that need it because this isn't really you know an issue about whether or not the you know most cannabis users could afford taxes there's also a consideration that some patients flat-out can't afford the taxes and in the extra cost they can barely afford the medicine right now so let's continue to use that Compassionate Use Act and provide for them the OMA initiative is kind of taking a forefront I think mostly because they can really come out with the marketing for it it's big on the table there's a lot of considerations with that fifteen percent tax fifteen percent tax at a state level the localities can match that tax level that means that our industry could see up to thirty percent tax on year one of a brand new industry in my mind that's more like eating the Golden Goose then ensuring that it continues to thrive and support our community we have an opportunity right now to support this industry and guide it and help it give back to our community and help raise that tax revenue for our schools for a public transportation for the potholes for the public ways for Environmental Protection and we need to make sure that we're kind of helping that industry survive the first couple of years so i think that the omen or my time so all my initiative is an initiative that we will be voting on but it's really important to understand as well that there's a nuance in that initiative and this is where it gets kind of tricky maybe you do want to see recreational happen but at what cost in the oma initiative there will be a new license type introduced and then i'll be licensed type 5 license type 5 in in five years after it passes will allow for an unlimited canopy size right now mm RSA has a cap the largest cultivation site that anyone operator can have is one acre in agricultural terms a drop in the bucket but if we were trying to to invite big corporate AG into this new industry in California how would we roll out that red carpet how about unlimited canopy size you can have five thousand acres you can have 500 acres can I say so can I ask you to put is my powerpoint there I just wanted to put up the slide with Alma information on there and one of the things I think should be known as you know Oregon and Washington they have recreational it's legalized recreational in Washington state that push came from what we consider to be the social justice folks the n-double-a-cp and other folks that saw the sort of cannabis laws as being racist and unjust so how their law was written in Washington state is very different how we've written it here or how are the oma people are written it writing it here and go forward a little bit to the end i think it's the last slide so the social justice folks up there they text the hell out of it in washington state initiative wasn't written in in Washington to make money it was to get people out of jail how it's written now in California we have the folks we have the folks with interest strictly economics so it's a very different type of initiative with that said also as you point out here I mean the tax structure here it's kind of problematic for some folks question twenty-three percent that it's at point of sale and through men through distribution yes so as I've placed here there's the the tax structure here for OMA it's 15 plus is seven and then a nine and a quarter on flower and is set to a 2.7 I'm leaf right so again it's it's less than Oregon but it's still a pretty high tax sort of structure so the question for me is an environmental sociologist and for the growers like is this still is it going to be more profitable not to come into compliance and avoid this sort of tax here so it's going to be a question right and I think five years were going revisit the tax structure I think how this is written this initiative so it allows some flexibility but again right now where this stuff is still a bit up in the air yes and and I wanted tani keeps me balanced because I look and say oh my god bad law how can they do this again but as she points out as you're pointing out we're at the beginning so perhaps I can be patient for a few more years but what sonoma county does not know is the economic value of this crop they estimate 1.4 billion dollars for wine i'm going to guess as we said here that the value of marijuana to this county is equal or better but but the county needs to do that study because those who understand economics will understand this better than social justice arguments and and and lastly that economic value excuse me the bad laws and the over taxing and regulations will keep this in the black market you'll never bring those people out black markets not going away the worst that government does the more of that market stays underground yeah I'm going to bring this into a little bit of soil biology here and you think about when you have an anaerobic system something that's you know parasitical and if you internet introduce enough probiotics or aerobic biotics into that system it flourishes it pushes out that parasitical environment we can do that in this industry by supporting the good operators and feeding them and helping them like actually bloom into our communities and by default that will actually be forcing out the black market that has those illegal activities that we see in the newspapers it will help us create clear guidelines for our law enforcement because how are they supposed to know the difference when they're looking from it from a Google map or from the helicopter whether or not that person is actually you know a schoolteacher who is also volunteering on the weekends for our environmental group when they see to hoop houses in the backyard they can't make those personal decisions but when they go and knock on the front door and they see that there's a permit they know that person has actually gone through the system and proven themselves and that that if they're not violating in there any other laws then they're not going to have their door knock down and their and their crop destroyed and that's going to actually support more people making that change in making that shift and investing themselves into into a better marketplace and just a touch on that state tax when when Mike McGuire came out with a bill SB 987 with fifteen percent tax and when he came out with that there was a pushback from the whole cannabis community people were outraged at fifteen percent tax even though in omagh had already had it embedded for months and it had been public knowledge that that was there and and the issue was don't tax medicine well we need to we need to define when it's medicine and when it's recreational but are we ready to define that right now are we ready to as an industry that's like fledgling coming in who's never been regulated are we ready to actually make two industries at the same time and the same in the same year or do we want to support our local operators one last thing real quick is I just want to say that this industry itself is as agreed to be regulated unlike any industry and the history of Agriculture so it's going to be the most regulated industry and AG that you can imagine that you can come up with so the point for me on this is you know it's great I would hope that this model is transferred to wine to all food products but probably won't be into timber industry so there is a bit of an unlevel playing field here in terms of how this industry is being treated versus other agricultural industries and we're hoping that they actually come to our level our level the industry the cannabis industry level with these pieces of legislation probably not with the political power of big AG but that's a hope for the future and we also have right now a government that is willing to work with us and initiative was necessary 20 years ago when our government would not talk to us when they wouldn't talk about it when it was still a science and and there was this stigma around it but right now every time I go into the Capitol and I talked to one of you know one of our elected officials they've got a notebook and they're taking notes as fast as they can they are so interested in figuring out how to create the solutions we have a government that is working with us on creating these solutions we don't need a push an initiative that is unbendable we need to actually continue to work with the government and continue to create bills and add-ons because this industry is moving so fast when they when they created when when prop 215 was written we didn't have apps on mobile phones there was no way to even conceive of delivery sales happening on an app through the touch of a button like how could we regulate that we need to be able to change each year because that's how fast our technology is moving we need to be able to amend there's an app for that so you know we have this opportunity on local government side to create good regulations and we have that opportunity on state level and what we need is to be continuing to bring great minds the tables from new perspectives it is questions time so I'll open it up thank you i had an opportunity to speak to Senator McGuire last week and I asked him about that fifteen percent tax and it's on top of other taxes etc etc and it just seemed crazy and the response from his he and his staff was that the price would actually go down from what it is now therefore it be more of a wash I'm wondering what your opinion is on that and also if you know historically from Colorado Washington Oregon okay the price will go down at whose cost who will be receiving less money when the price goes down we're taking an industry that has been vertically integrated the cultivator is also the person who's running the team that's trimming it or processing they're also packaging or manufacturing then they are driving it to the dispensary in the dispensary is selling it so when that cultivator can no longer make that that sequence and the cultivator now has to contract somebody a manufacture and contract somebody to transport and contract a lab to charge fifty to one hundred fifty dollars per test per you know if we're lucky batch and lot system of a hundred square feet if cultivator then has to contract a distribute distribution team to sell to that retailer that's a lot of contracts that's a lot of addons so if the price is going down it's at whose cost because there's a lot of people adding adding on to it right now so I'm I I fear for the cultivators when I hear that anybody else two hands back there one up here I had this we can hear you hear me hello oh yeah sorry so this is questions for Tony be also wants to answer but I'm an advocate of public banking and that being a potential depository bank for the marijuana funds we establish our own banks in our own towns counties for that and other reasons but we've heard rumor down here in Sonoma County I've heard from a few people that up in humble there are there's a group of folks that are working on establishing a bank as a depository for them for the marijuana funds do you know anything about that they're working I don't know if they've been successful but and can you hit me up but in but in uh hello can hear me I don't think they've been successful yet I in Alma there is actually and there's a bill that's been introduced recently to free up a little bit of the constraints on banking and I forget to say Senate bill or assembly bill I for kb 1575 yeah samanta it's in the hopper now to actually allow for banks to accept money from from the industry but that's been a big struggle for the California cannabis credit union is the concept that had been proposed just to answer that a little bit more in depth as well and we are in an election year we don't know what type of president we're going to get and what kind of pushback so as a state I think there's a little bit more of a conservative pause that we're going to see in 2016 and then maybe bring that conversation back in 2017 as a follow-up can you just discuss how a be 1575 ties into the federal reserve if at all not that I'm aware of yeah that that would be a fun yeah over my prey grade hey I just wanted to know which legislators or decision makers are champing championing championing these bills and who's most excited about it in the California government we have senator mike mcguire Assemblyman Jim would we also have Assemblyman Bonta Cooley Lackey thank you and enjoy yer a I know Fiona ma who is the Board of Equalization district representative for us here has been probably our strongest champion in talking about what do we do with an all-cash industry the issues that we're seeing with the robberies and the theft and vandalism it's because there's tens of thousands of dollars in cash sitting in somebody's house in a safe yes and yeah don't forget the local level you're in the city now that prohibits everything which is somewhat ironic for having this conference Santa Rosa sebastopol have enlightened attitudes but that locally here it's all over the place in terms of clinics and and everything that goes with prop 215 so pay attention locally as well and don't forget to speak up when you think there's bad law I think it's worth pointing out that bans historically have never worked that's the conversation about prohibition that's the conversation about local level bands when you ban when you tell a teenager you're not allowed to do anything sit in your room they're going to figure out how to sneak out and then they're going to go do the things that you fear the most but if you give them guidance and you give them boundaries and you give them support they are much more likely to actually follow a good path so yes I think it's going to be really interesting to watch the next year of demographic research in the cities in Sonoma County and around the state that are creating good guidelines and regulations and the cities that ban and what the crime rates actually end up looking like hi Tony if you could address this some I feel like there's an elephant in the room that we haven't discussed especially sustainability being the broader topic here and that's what if California sees continued years of drought what happened to the outdoor farmer considering that outdoor plants can consume up to one gallon of water per day which is a lot of water when you're talking about a considerable farm when they limit water to grapes they can limit water to marijuana as far as I'm concerned there are big farms which are different but in this county you have people growing a few plants and I don't see that the water issue is a big issue it concerns us all but I don't know how do you pick and choose I have to pet pigs they drink two gallons of water a day I don't know you can't dry you can't dry farm vines to some extent after a few years cannabis plants you you can't oh you got the frost protection so you know this on so you know we have thousand we got over 4,000 some are upwards to 5,000 outdoor large-scale farms in humble County there many of them and if you haven't gotten a chance there's a there's a google video that I put out few years back addressing some of these issues the landscape and the rural communities is littered with small farms and they're drawing from salmon bearing creeks and streams at sometimes dewatering streams that we've been working on to rehab for years so you know there is a there is an impact and there's a cumulative impact that this industry has we have to recognize it and devise strategies to protect fish and the industry itself right now because of prohibition people are just you know black market right and those that do want to go into compliance and a great example is recently up in Humboldt County where someone had a huge bladder they stored water and the feds came and rated them right they were doing the right thing but the feds came said you're doing the wrong thing and see this big bladder look at these grows right but they were storing water so i think there's ways that we can do we have to develop best management practices and we can't talk about that it's federally prohibited at one point in Humboldt State you know I do these conferences I was I was banned from actually talking about best management practices because that's advocacy all right so we can't and I mean we're still dealing with these issues regulators can't help cannabis agriculture can because agriculture is because of the federal prohibition so until we develop best management practices you know we're going to continue to have this problem right and with the drought it accelerates this so I want to just I think it's worth pointing out that when that bladder was discovered and pointed out not only did they treat them like a bad actor though they were storing water they slashed it thousands of gallons not only / that was potential fire prevention in that entire valley but then the topsoil that went into the creeks there was an environmental investigation to find to sue whoever was responsible for that I don't know what the what the outcome of these are examples of again the the feds targeting people that want to come into compliance sure they got thousands of plants everybody's got thousands of plants out there but they're trying to do it the right way right and again what happens when you bust someone with a thousands of plants how do they make up that money they go indoor we don't want that indoor and that's exactly what they do they go indoor and that big diesel generators and I have a fear that with more this sort of hyper vigilant quasi prohibition that people are just going to start building shacks and diesel to open again and we don't want that so I mean to your question is best management practices I just want to clarify one thing is not the growing of the wine it's the producing of the wine itself the washing of the bottles a whole assembly line thing so when you get down to that and you start adding the new marketing event sitters where hundreds of people come and they have to use the bathroom and drink the water and you cook the food I'm saying wine uses more water than marijuana so just don't pick on this crop even though we're all against big illegal grows on national forests and keeping people out that's totally wrong are taking it out of the stream sorry just wanted clarity quick question here do the AMA laws have any provisions for growing hemp so hemp is going to be an interesting dialogue where we have to integrate and we have to integrate again you know intentionally it has a very cannabis has a large pollination zone I think up to 10 miles when the wind blows that could destroy an entire cannabis economy we have to put them in the right place half is a wonderful plant that we need to work with and the regulations need to be done well lots of hands hi I just wanted to offer a quick correction I'm a food farmer and so Tony I wanted to let you know that actually food farming is highly regulated and you know it down to sort of when you sell apples how many can be in a box if you sell it to a grocery store so please don't wish any more regulation on us um but but I had a question about kind of what the landscape look has looked like post legalization in different states I had heard that the price had dropped you know fifty percent after Colorado legalized which forced a lot of small growers out of business is that a trend in other states and what can we kind of expect if we do have legalization in terms of supply and demand in Sonoma County and in California so I'll speak to a couple and then maybe have a toddy talk i keep getting confused which one I'm going to hear what one of the things that we find in these states have gone legal is they're getting that we from California it's from us we're shipping it there right so they can't deal with supply colorado washington thousands and thousands of kilos are going all over coming from here the other thing is because they no one really addressed this issue these environmental issues in the toxic issue much of what goes into these these areas now is toxic weed right it's a nasty stuff it doesn't cut their testing problem so you know the price certainly is dropped right but not to the point where it's not profitable for people to continually ship it out and grow it here so I don't know how you can add to that okay so California is a major agricultural state cannabis is competing to be one of the biggest agricultural products in California we do not have that many people smoking pot in California so we probably are a bigger export state than anybody's really ready to recognize and when mm RSA comes into effect in 2018 and a licensed or permitted cultivator can only sell to a distributor who can only sell to a retailer those retail outlets will be the only way that millions of pounds of marijuana can be sold a year and when the black market continues to try to push it out by land sea and air and are shut down at the borders there is going to be a completely new shift in our cannabis industry that not even the cannabis operators can conceive of what that impact is going to look like there is an old history here where there are amazing cultivators coming out of primarily Humboldt and mendocino you know the Emerald triangle and there's a time where a lot of exportation has been happening over the years and there are the kind of headhunters if you will from Florida and New York and Michigan and Chicago coming in looking for the best of the best of the best the caviar of the industry and when they find it that never even hits the California market it goes straight out but if we shut down those borders we're going to see a completely different shift so it's there's no way to predict what our market is going to look like when those producers can no longer export nor is there a way to predict what's going to happen when our small farmers for the first time can proudly say i'm a i'm a i'm a cannabis operator you know i send my kids to waldorf school based on on my beautiful lake framed you know forever flowering greenhouse I think there's we don't know what this is going to look like this is a big giant experiment but what we can do is set it up to make sure that we set the regulations in place and we protect our local economy the only way we're going to protect our local economy is by protecting our local operators so you have to engage we have to have that conversation I have a friend who went to Amsterdam to find some seeds and he went over there and he found these seeds and he came back I don't know what the name of it was and he was talking some of the local surfers they said well we developed those right here in Sonoma County I think we have hit our time thank you all so much for your thoughts and your questions and your attention today on the subject and we really look forward to speaking with you offline", "8qesszRvoJo": "okay hello everybody um Here I am on day two actually the third day of drying um with this mindo breath and I went ahead and trimmed up these three buds here you can see they're trimmed to my liking a lot of people say trim more whatever but no there's trichomes all over it I've seen frost ear but this project particular string here I mean look at the top it's got a lot of clear trichomes so yes I did harvest a little bit early but that's my preference um everybody has their own preference of you know the type of high they want and stuff like that [Music] which if you harvest earlier you're gonna get a more of a sativa high you're gonna get more of a cerebral head high rather than a body high so and see I don't need to trim that maybe that part there but anything that's got trichomes on it I do not mess with I just smoke it as it is so that's a beauty right there mostly just clear trichomes um get out of there woman um there we go okay so and then these are the ones that they're a little bit smaller but they're still pretty good chunk is this is about this is gonna be a button ohms when it's all dried this but alone right now this one right here it only pick it up from this end so I don't touch the trichomes um this bud right here is gonna be 10 grams alone so at least it's already falling out of my hand like slipping through my fingers so yeah I love that I'm gonna preserve that as long as I can and just smoke the other stuff first so okay that's the update guys I hope you

coming to view at the Mendel breath air G man doing it you say you got a nice color to it earthy smell to it yeah maybe better back yeah that green brown hair good turkey smelled it we have some ground up in here my little Grandy some in the grinder get the road easily smell that as you can see them sitting outside today I figured what the heck I did an outside wheel did it ever so why not why not do outside why this one you get in readiness how do you get that pepperiness that the end of it just Eric gee yours had berry flavor but with the pepperiness at the end of it this this Mendel breath from fat Panda these guys it's more earthy but you still get the pepperiness to all knots I think I like cheese better yeah so that's my take on that got urging this to pepperiness on the outtake we get the diesel II smell after you strand it up but when you smiled out of here out of the jar you get that earthiness to it so alright man that's the end of it man if you do it that's it you know that bite again has out you know it's good stuff pat pat I was killing it but like I said it has an earnest with a pepperiness at the end of it yeah real good stuff big nice high with this that's my take on Mendel breath from fat Panda matches up with Eric but I think Eric G's garden I think got smoked at that mental breath all day long this because of the berry chase with the hit and then definitely this one's got the more earthiness it's not bad I'm not saying it's bad it's good it's good stuff but I'm just saying I'd rather smoke there geez Mendel fresco with this that's all I'm saying okay but fat Panda always killing at Mendel breath is is a good case to dirtiness if you like that earthiness that's it man now with the pepperiness kick to it so here we go as always got to do a combo man outside too so chilling it out man here we go alright man like I said that's my review I'm into breath from fat Panda can you get this at the shop say this toast cannabis where I work at

actually a mere carp and his name was gunter he died [Music] [ __ ] i died like i guess i was refilling my pond and i forgot about it and i went out and somehow the hose is knocked out because i'm like oh that's cool and then this morning i went out there and [ __ ] gunter was like laying on the gravel dead [Music] like he's still not all the way dead he's still got a few [ __ ] twitches or whatever left [Music] wait what i'm hoping [Music] [Music] my [Music] they were bred by months to be easy to eat [Music] and i don't oh they're very breezed again great come on sir come on you can do it yeah good breeze come on [Music] good all right i don't know how long this might take but i'm pretty sure [Music] three [Music] [Music] is there a plug for the sink mom what all right so he's breathing a little bit i saw his eye even move a little bit [Music] [Music] so [Music] facebook [Music] my name [Music] water [Music] [Music] good [Music] all right i [Music] uh very [Music] oh good tilting me [Music] [Music] um [Music] circulation examinations yes [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] uh [Music] a little bit being dusty [Music] keep trying to catch it when he gets like a chore like he looks like he's about to take off and start being normal again like i keep missing those jolts because it takes so long but then he does them and they just goes back normal or how he is now all right so that fish i tried to save died anyways and he was right there all night and i managed to revive him somewhat you saw i did some kind of fish cpr too where i had the sink running a little bit and i put him and i put his head in the water and then it kind of like filled his lungs up and then i did that for a few seconds and then counted it three and then would do that again and it's kind of like fish cpr and then i i left them in the sink uh after i did that a bunch and with the the water running where it's kind of getting air bubbles in his head and he's just like barely in the water it's slightly draining so it doesn't go that much further you know and how high it was and somehow that started reviving him and he started breathing and [ __ ] and then what happened was the [ __ ] maintenance man like because he still died the [ __ ] maintenance man like for my place like knocked on my door and he's [ __ ] like making me talk to him about all kinds of [ __ ] and then i i still i trying to hurry back and watch my fish you know but like then then it is [ __ ] dead i couldn't revive them again it's like you can only bring them back to life once like i had the water set up like i was explaining it was like it drained too far down so he wasn't even in water anymore but when he died i after he died i couldn't revive him anymore i ate him and he was the best fish i ever had like that i ate because this part uh he's a miracoi or mirocarp and those were specially bred by monks in the 18th century to be descaled easy because they got just big old scales randomly on them and i think they brought him to be good tasting too because that was that fish is like the most delicious fresh water fish i've ever ate for real like [Music] and then you know when you you got koi and sometimes some of them die you know you can eat them and they're pretty good sometimes that was the best one i ever ate like i haven't had [Music] you know some boys die and i ate they tasted good but then some of them taste bad like if a fluorescent one or a yellow one dies it's not gonna taste very good like those ones have a bad aftertaste [Applause] but like when you know when you have fish they just die sometimes and uh [Music] you know even if you've gotten to a point where you can keep them alive and they don't die just some random [ __ ] like your fish hopping out of the goddamn pond for no reason it could happen so i mean it'll probably be a long time before any more of these guys die but who knows like before you know i didn't even used to eat them i just put chord i'd i'd like feed him to my dog cindy he's dead now let's see i put this bones over here probably a cat or something [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hide so they can't see me i'm also there's four leaf he's got three fans [Music] i'm also babysitting my neighbor's fish he's got a big white one like i got and then he had he's got a really big orange one with really long pants he had to take his pond out so the housing people they put like a gate this yard going to nowhere because there's like a power box in all our yards and they're [ __ ] idiots and they made him move his pond but he was talking about just letting me have his fish and i'm like i don't really want the white one i got a big white one too the orange one's cool i'm just talking about letting him go if he wanted to even let him go and i was like well i would want to let my white one go too but i'll keep your orange one then that'd be cool if we let him go in a pond someday he's my neighbor's name's tom he's got a real scraggy voice he sounds like a pirate he's like i'm gonna take it up miller came down and let it go all right film that if that goes down well i better stop filming because my last balls and fish aren't gonna eat unless i go away and four leave he's really ballsy he knows he's special he got saved from being a theater because i noticed he was mutated he's a good luck charm i really don't remember all their names [Music] [Music] so quack [Music] oh yeah there's a [ __ ] rapper named little whack and i found out about that posting the video about my whacking fish a long time ago a whacking it's a fish it's a goldfish that has the body of a common golden fish [Music] and so that black wagon this is a real whack and then they're really hard to get i had a mail order but one time i found a wacom in the feeders where i got four leafs from you just mutated that way but feeder fish are often sick like [Music] it was you know every time you get a fish from that start it puts all your other fish in in jeopardy like if you put them just in your pot you gotta change the water a lot of sickness and also these guys are so big that already i mean in the smallest one it's still really big like if you put that in a in a pet store with you fish they'd be full size even that donald donald is uh thomas saba that's just mutated to be like that that's the smallest one i got in there he'd be [ __ ] even big if we put him in a pet store with the the biggest fan tells they have in there it just looks small because he's in there with all these huge ass fish like if i was i don't know probably if i got the biggest ones they have at a pet store that those actually like some of them like the bigger artists might be as big as donald or bigger but what i'm trying to say is if i got the baby once and this is kind of tragic like i can't get baby fan tails or anything or put them in here anymore because these [ __ ] will eat them and i really think it was [ __ ] gunter yeah gunther's the fish that died i was telling him it's a miracarp and he tasted delicious was the biggest on eating baby fish anyways like when they spawned in the past he was like the main one eating all the babies [Music] like when i had i i got some baby goldfish and put them in here um and uh he was the one like it looked like he was trying you know and then i even made it so like i put stuff into the [ __ ] pond that the baby goldfish could live in and they lived in there for goddamn months because i put them in there without that [ __ ] before and they got eaten and i put that stuff in they lived in there for months and then one day i found the [ __ ] skull thing like that i put in there knocked over and the [ __ ] dude was like bitten in half so i mean if i ever do that again i just need to get something even bigger like and more things because i mean once they get to a certain point that they don't fit in their mouth anymore they won't eat them but i really think it was future like gunter was a hunter and this was such a forceful fish he even jumped out of the goddamn fish pond one day like that kind of initiative would make him you know really [ __ ] push like a pet store uh crocodile skull or like one of those fake coyote skulls over to eat a little fish you know [Music] the circle of fish circle of life the circle of fish life the circle jerk of life it's like these fish so i keep them alive as long as possible someday when they die on their own they're gonna make a really delicious meal [Music] oh oh that was my neighbor's fish i don't know if he saw him yet that's the big orange one with really long fins he got out of the feeders usually you don't see the vlog fins like that even his handpins are on", "6KWUf082hBw": "thank you for joining the Council on foundations

next week and now I'll turn it over to sue Santa senior vice president of public policy and legal affairs at the council good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us on a Friday afternoon after a very exciting election week I know those of us who thrive on the political world always always love this first week of November because it definitely proved to be exciting and eventful and we have things we expected things we didn't quite expect and we're going to look at a lot of that today in this webinar we're also going to take a quick look at what this might mean for one of the issues that we absolutely care about all the time but certainly in the coming Congress which would be tax reform on mendo so I do want to say that the council will have lots of programming and tax reform so we will touch you on the issue today I get into it a little bit but we will we will not dig deep terribly deeply into that we are very very fortunate today to be joined by three true experts in the political world I'm going to introduce all three of them to you right up front here and then turn over to our panelists as we go first you're going to hear from a josh crush our who is the political editor for national journal and pens the weekly against the grain column since he has been with Atlantic media he's had several different roles including managing editor for politics at National Journal executive editor and editor-in-chief of the hotline Josh plays a really critical role in shaping National Journal overall political coverage and among the many many things that he does he has a period of the political analysts on television and radio including Fox News MSNBC CNN NPR and c-span after we hear from Josh we're going to hear from two gentlemen whom those of you who join us for four webinars throughout here have heard from before they are fabulous political consultants from from both sides of the aisle from the D side of the aisle we will hear from Rob Leonard who for more than three decades has been a distinguished practitioner in that small circle of federal tax and budget policy advocate Rob with served as chief Council and staff director of the committee on ways and means in the house and as chief majority tax counsel of the committee during his 20-year tenure on Capitol Hill he was centrally involved it really in all major tax and budget legislation at that time including the Tax Reform Act of nineteen seventy six the economic recovery active 81 tax act of 82 deficit reduction active day before we could go on and on but most notably of course the tax reform act of 86 we are also going to be joined from the wonderful ten keys who represents the Republican side of the aisle and as many of you know ken is the managing director of federal policy group he too has decades of experience and gentlemen I'm just sorry to say that I think between the two of you you have multiple multiple multiple decades of experience on Capitol Hill and at many juncture you actually were together on Capitol Hill on other sides of the aisle ken was on the hill at about the same time that Rob was he served as chief of staff for the Congressional Joint Committee on taxation and he oversaw the development of major tax legislation including the tax reform act of 97 but he has in addition to being with federal policy groups he's been with several other firms and we are always thrilled to have both Robin can join us and give us their perspective and before we dive in I do want to remind everyone that all of the participants on the call are muted by us not because we don't want to hear from you but because we all know they could not drum of having lots of people but you absolutely can put in your questions the typing them in and for our speakers who are not muted by us we just do remind you that when you aren't speaking sometimes it's best just to manually put your phones on mute so that there's a clear line for everyone listening to our speakers so with that I am thrilled to turn over the microphone on to Josh who from the National Journal perspective is going to tell us what happened on Tuesday Josh great to have you with us thanks a lot sue for that really warm introduction and like you said we're all of us in the political world are still catching our breath from a pretty pretty significant midterm election on Tuesday night and you know i'm going to give sort of a macro big picture and look at what happened what are the big implications from that and sort of look at the analysis that we can draw at least from early from from the results in the early takeaways that we can make the big picture i just wanted to just go beyond the 2014 elections 2014 marks the fourth out of five elections going back to two thousand six where we've seen wave elections a huge dominant performance by one party in the national vote over the other you know six democrats took control of both houses 30 seats in the house six seats in the senate and in really capitalized on democratic dissatisfaction with the president's handling of president bush's hambly in the war of the war in iraq 2008 democrats were winning house seats in some of the most conservative territory in the country President Obama was competitive in some of these districts I've turned out among Democratic core voters worse was through the roof and Democrats held a supermajority in 2009 in the Senate of 60 seats and in the house they had a significant significant majority than they had sometime uh 2010 was a reversal of that in Republicans game 63 met seats in the house they made big inroads in the Senate I was a big belief of the president who didn't call this election uh something but it but may made later marks recognizing the scope of of a 2010 Republican victory which came as a shock to many many Democrats at least when it came to the composition of the house 2012 the little more of an exception to the rule with Obama losing ground from his to 2008 original election but still a pretty decisive victory for for Democrats but 2014 again as we saw from Tuesday night's results was a decisive victory in all aspects for Republicans whether you look at the house where Republicans have their largest majority since at least the 1940s depending on some of these recounts and final counts it could be their biggest majority since the night the Congress that was elected in 1928 during the Hoover administration Republicans made a live a game seven seats in the Senate but it looks like no game on was on the recount and ballots are counted in Alaska and then pending the results of the Louisiana runoff in December which is looking very favorable for Bill Cassidy the Republican nominee the the governorships will go to a little more detail in a little bit also a big big Republican night across the board so this was a true true wave election I the voters are behaving in a much more parliamentary fashion than they did generations ago some well you have eighty-seven percent of voters and exit polls who approved of Obama they all stay seven percent of the voters rather who approved of Obama in the exit polls supported Democratic congressional candidates 83% who disapproved of Obama back to Republicans there's not a lot and you saw this in the southern races that took that Democrats lost a single handedly there's not much difference people are making a difference between President Obama and perhaps a more moderate democratic senator like a mark Pryor or a democratic candidate like Alison lundergan Grimes Michelle man who was hyped as one of the better Democratic recruits got twenty four percent of the white phone in Georgia President Obama in 2012 in 2008 rather got twenty-four percent of the white vote in Georgia people are voting based on party labels like you would see in a parliamentary system they're not voting on the candidates in these midterm elections which is a big change from even you know even a couple decades ago burnt during the Clinton years the big it's a big challenge for Democrats to in these congressional midterm elections and also finally in terms of a big big macro picture the environment which favored Republicans for the national vote favor republicans by about a seven point margin uh trump the tactics and democrats were talking about constantly about the Bannock street project and their 60 million dollar investment to turn out democratic voters in these big battle ground States but where when the underplayed stories from the midterms is that difficult that she did a pretty good job in some cases a very good job of turning out the Obama coalition their core voters so underplayed stories that Republicans didn't really talk too much about their ground game about their own get out the vote efforts and they not only came close in some states they surpassed the of the democratic party's efforts and turned out their own disaffected conservative older voters in general and they matched the Democrats in every step of the way one example of that is in Colorado which is where Bannock street is in Denver's that's where the project that Democrats had from their ground game was named well in Colorados look at the exit polls single women the core one of the core parts of the Democratic coalition made up more of the electorate in the midterm election than they did for a president obama in 2012 and they voted more for mark Udall who was the much-maligned Democratic senator running on you know Warren women running on abortion and contraception they gave me you know six for six points more of the vote than President Obama himself received in 2012 so the Democrats got their core vote in that I've got one of the big slices of their coalition to the polls problem was almost everyone else was turned off by the tactic of just narrow casting the election to be about abortion and contraception single men swing swung the other way so Corey guard or the senator-elect actually got seven points more than Mitt Romney did in 2012 and married men and married women also slightly shifted a little more Republican from the 2012 election so again it's an example of you know the coalition showing up Democrats did a great job turning out their voters but there were more voters who sided with the Republicans and more Republican murders that showed up in Colorado center with Hispanics Hispanics with a forty percent of the vote in 2012 they also made up fourteen percent of the vote in 2014 but more Hispanic voters actually voted Republican in this midterm election so again they turning out the vote helped but it didn't account for the changing shift in the voter voter mood North Carolina another big state that's the state that has every element of the the presidential coalition in North Carolina you saw a single women again another that the big slice of the Obama coalition only drop off one point in terms of the vote chair from 2012 to 2014 and they supported Kay Hagan more than they supported President Obama from from this that two-year span again it wasn't enough for Kay Hagan to beat Tom Tillis so I want to go a little bit more macro to start out and I guess we go backwards on the slides all the way back to that that first the first slide about the wave arm so I said nine said it seats about twelve to fourteen house seat game and uh you know you look at that map on the lower right hand corner and in terms of land area Republicans control at least at least pending some of these recounts eighty-six percent of the land mass in terms of house roof present representation they control fifty-seven percent of house seats it's the largest majority since at least 1946 I think it'll be I think we'll both pick up on two more seats what ll said and done and they'll have a the largest majority since the Hoover administration republicans uh they'll pick up three governorships and they'll net probably too they may lose the Alaska governorship which is still too close to call but the states were they won and where they actually won fairly decisively we're really remarkable you've got Maryland in here in our backyard where Larry Hogan would by five points and what he would Anne Arundel County seventy-seven percent of the vote just just a truly shocking result in a very democratic state of Maryland Massachusetts Republicans day in the bid one I think in Illinois Bruce rauner who really spent a ton of money President Obama's home state president Obama has now lost his home his old senate seat marker pick that up in 2010 and now Bruce rauner has taken for the Republicans the governorship in Illinois so to across the board Senate House and governorships a decisive victory for Republicans my colleague Dave Wasserman at the cook report has been telling the popular vote the so-called in the generic ballot or the action item related Eric on the actual houseboat and Republicans now it says 52.6 to 44.6 on your slide it's actually been updated over the last day so it's now about a seven point margin for Republicans but it's what all said and done it's going to be anywhere from six to about seven points of a Republican advantage when it comes to the national house foot which is a decisive total very similar to what we saw in 2010 to go to the next slide the big story and I wrote about this in my a post-election column is and this is even more than what we saw in twenty ten Republicans had quite a bit of success quite a bit of surprising success in we needed Democratic parts of the country in 2010 a lot of the Republican House games were actually in some of the most conservative parts of the country where Democrats had made gains in previous midterm elections the waves of 06 in a way Democrats lost a lot of those games and more but there were a whole lot of blue districts where Republicans were able to make inroads it was mostly a red district makeup that was very very different from 2014 where you look at the heads of is right now it's about 15 seats Republicans one Democrat that belief picked up three seats so you have a net of 12 right now but of those 15 seats that republicans picked up head of them were districts that president obama carried in 2012 so and I listed all them on the chart but you've got districts of New York main Illinois all the way down to suburban Las Vegas in Nevada for the three California seats that are Obama districts that are still too close to call uh though that number could jump to 13 districts that's a pretty sizable share of democratic turf uh that Republicans were able to pick up a much bigger share than what we saw in 2010 which was also a big wave election for Republicans in the Senate it done you know the turf was both basically a Republican turf but the fact that and I said before the election the test of this being a wave election is whether Democrats how Republicans do with a three battleground states were actually the for battleground states that are heavily contested and those were Colorado Iowa North Carolina in New Hampshire and I said if Republicans would be at least one before that's a clear wave type of situation they would pray before and he narrowly lost the fourth in New Hampshire scott brown lost by two points too chichi who was a sort of a bob Corker of 2006 the one democrat who who managed to win in a very challenging environment uh so uh Virginia was another we didn't even have Virginia on the map but I'd gillespie just a few minutes ago conceded the race to mark water but it was about a point eight point nine point margin my water had a extremely close race and no one ever anticipated again a song of the National Environment seeping in maybe get like I said no governorships with public clearest example of the waves with Republican when he republicans winning in Illinois Massachusetts in Maryland Paula page was a three-way race made and then you had the rick scott scott walker rick Snyder all of whom look like they were in deep trouble all who've got reelected mostly by comfortable margins so again the big development is at the blue states the Democratic leading states and districts many of them flip to Republicans which is a big big challenge for Republicans it actually shows that their brand is some somewhat slightly rehabilitated and it's a bigger change of 2010 when they're well there you know the Tea Party was was more closely a soda associated with the Republican Party brand if we go to the next slide quickly there's so much data from the exit polls and I went over some of the two big states Colorado North Carolina earlier but when you look at the national exit polling this is an agenda gotta favorite Republicans Republicans were men by 16 points they only lost women by four points which is a still a sizable gap but it's one that favors Republicans unlike 2012 where the gender gap was more favorable to Democrats married women voted by 10 points 54-44 to Republicans unmarried 62-38 for Democrats national excuse a nationally that's a pretty big shift there was a big focus in certain states and it paid off in Colorado for example for Democrats but nationally a single women which voted 6731 for Obama in 2012 actually flipped seven points towards the Republican direction and voted 1638 Democratic in this election Republicans would go back back to the yeah sixty or thirty eight white voters that's a constituency that's that Republican in the Republicans are gaining ground it was two points better than Mitt Romney's margin in 2012 Republicans do have trouble with Hispanic voters they voted 6236 Democratic they've been up eight percent of the electorate the same as in 2010 it was a good job offer from 2012 and many of them stayed home but it was actually a loss from the 2010 midterm electorate last time so again there's a real challenge for Republicans and that's going to be a big challenge but I'm in 2016 as well this was a very anti obama electorate forty-four percent said that they were good forty-four percent approved of the president's approval approved of the president's job performance thirty-three percent said they cast their midterm vote against the president only nineteen percent said they were casting their midterm vote for him so very like i was saying about said this is a very anxious electorate you know you look at all these macroeconomic indicators including the stock market the unemployment rate there was another good jobs report that came out this morning voters aren't feeling it only twenty-nine percent said the economy was good or excellent seventy percent said it was fair or poor forty-eight percent said that life for the next generation would be worse kids then it was to them it's a two-to-one margin over those who thought that it was going to be more optimistic for their kids a big big change from just 10 or 15 years ago a lot of pessimism in the country uh what finally I'm the second the last bullet you know there's a lot of talk about how the Republican brand is like dog food it's in the toilet it's an awful shape and it isn't in good shape but in the midterm election at least Republicans and Democrats are pretty much equally being equally unfavorably Republicans at a forty to fifty four approve disapprove Democrats and 4355 approve disapprove in 2016 it's going to be a slightly more favorable electorate for the Democrats so Republicans can't really excited about that number but what you hear the Republican Party brand is so much worse than the Democrats that's not really the case anymore the events of the last few months and really narrow the gap in terms of party brand fairly considerably to the next slide one of the looking ahead to the future Congress and I know that's a big big focus for all you it is about what is anything is good luck in the name of the game where it is there going to be progress made in terms of achieving bipartisan compromises and I actually think there's some silver linings in the makeup of uh of the nerds in terms of the results of the election and the makeup of it the new Congress uh first of all a debater who you know had so many problems dealing with his right work flake in the last from 2010 up to this election now has such a big majority that he actually has a rhotic Lee paradoxically he has more wiggle room to lose the 20 or 30 you know Tea Party members that Justin Amash is the tip of the whole scamp's of the world he could actually lose as many as 30 32 Republicans that could vote against him and if Democrats are entirely opposed to what he's proposing and that's a question mark but he even if Democrats are united bader can lose about 30 32 Republicans and still be able to pass legislation to the house before was more like 10 to 15 Republicans was illegal with the amount of wiggle room that's a big development the caucus is is actually more overall I would actually say it's a little more moderate not that's considerably so but what had you had a lot of very very conservative members in conservative districts to replaced establishment oriented ones and the big example of that would probably be Wisconsin six we're taught Petra retired very center right very establishment my did a long time legislator and he was replaced by a state legislator named Glenn drop crosman so I think you'll be hearing a lot more about he's going to be the Ted Cruz of the house he's going to be making a lot of inflammatory comments it's a very solidly Republican district but the example of what you have a primary and you nominate the base nominates a more conservative type of Republican you are going to see those types of districts elect more conservative members but because there was such a big Republican win in the house where you'll see as many as 15 Republicans 11 15 feet than many of most of those are actually in blue districts a lot of center-right moderate Republicans replaced Democrats so like not gold who was a former congressman from the north shore of Chicago he got elected and he's going to be one of Bader's biggest allies it he's going to be pushing the caucus bored in the middle lee zeldin in the Long Island district that was long held by tim bishop he is a very moderate republican and he is actually going to be the only Jewish Republican Eric Cantor's loss of the primary as not the proud Republicans of a Jewish member leaves eldon it will fill that category for the Republicans but again it's a very Democrats a democratic-leaning district he's not going to be able to be even if we wanted to be to get reelected he's gonna have two huge in the center at least the phonic the youngest woman elected to congress in history elected to an upstate New York District that's a very competitive seat and you look at the list of those blue district Republicans that got elected they're all going to be close to Boehner they're going to provide him and provide the caucus with a more moderate seen that in the past and I think it's going to actually another Republicans have ascended you actually may see a lot more compromise and a lot more a cohesiveness between the republican-controlled house the republican-controlled senate i really i mean i think the big questions to the lame duck will the president go through with an executive order on immigration which republic said would poison the waters from the get-go and what they think they can actually reach some agreement on other issues and the big question for the lame duck is who will the president nominate as Attorney General some reports today suggested that he was going with a real outside of the box selection the I believe her name was Loretta Lynch the US attorney for the Eastern District in New York was the leader in the clubhouse that would be a very interesting pic I believe that would be a much more a pic that's much more conducive to where Republicans are at someone who's not a part of the administration and who hasn't been a part of some of the ideological fights that have taken place in Washington in the last six years so that's the number two point is an encouraging sign for some level of bipartisanship for Republican the question is will Mitch McConnell be able to pass legislation with bipartisan support how many Ted Cruz's are there in the Republican caucus is it the Republican Senate conferences especially a lot more set aright frankly more establishment oriented than the house counterpart their house counterparts but the question is with Rubio running for president likely with Rand Paul looking at a presidential campaign with a lot of ambitious Republicans out there how will but I'll be able to unite his caucus he can't afford to many defections and you know my biggest bellwether in terms of whether Republicans are able to work together and help well you know fortune bipartisan toad in Washington look at the for Senate elect Republicans free of him got support from the club for growth one of them got support from sarah palin but all of whom are very close with McConnell and actually temperamentally much more center-right than tea party bomb throwers before that I'm referencing our chillier Stan Iowa Ben Sasse in Nebraska Tom Condon Arkansas and Dan Sullivan who is not officially a senator elect and looks likely to beat Mark Begich in Alaska are they going to be closer to Ted Cruz of rich McConnell if you read some initial carpinteria people think because they were supported by the club for growth because they've taken some votes in Congress that were very much on the right word side of the house caucus that they're going to be sort of an F Ted Cruz camp but if you haven't covered many of them having to interview them my sense is actually everybody going to be close to Mitch McConnell they're not going to be as temperamentally oppositional and has a Ted Cruz and I think you'll actually see a lot of these so-called you know principled conservatives actually play ball with McConnell and help him get legislation passed through the Senate but simply close eye on those four because they're very really gonna tell the tale of whether Republicans get things done and move more to the center right or they really let the Ted Cruz wing of the party take over I would go to the next slide really quickly uh you know 20 cm bubble editing questions on 2016 um the big the big takeaway for Hillary Clinton is that it's going to be a challenge for her to win over the same type of state that Bill Clinton did so well in in 20 in the 92 and 96 she campaign aggressively in Kentucky for Alison lundergan Grimes Bill Clinton spent spent numerous campaign swings in Arkansas his home state to campaign for Mark Prior mark Pryor one thirty-nine percent of the vote almost as badly decisively defeated as Blanche Lincoln was in 2010 Alison lundergan Grimes it was actually one of Mitch McConnell's least competitive opponents she actually lost by a bigger margin than almost every one of the opponent's and Democrats had put up against Mitch McConnell the working-class white vote did not make there was no inroads that Democrats may have a mug working-class whites which is one thing that Democrats on Hillary Clinton could improve on Barack Obama's performances in that demographic group so that's one sort of I don't think anyone ever thought she was going to you know totally change the dynamic of the electorate but it was just the Kentucky and Arkansas results of pour some cold water on Hillary Clinton reshaping the map for 2016 and picture Republic Republicans and Democrats don't start 2016 an enviable shape Republicans Vita brought their coalition they need to make inroads with minority voters that are making up a larger share of the electorate and they still haven't proven that they can do so so I do think if you look closely at something Scoob fernet oriole races John Kasich won twenty-six percent of the black vote in Ohio Bruce rauner campaign i was gonna story about the governor-elect of illinois couple weeks ago spent some time in chicago watching Bruce rauner campaigned on the south side of Chicago campaign in Chinatown campaign on the west side where Latino businesses predominates and he really made a big effort to broadly coalition there are a lot of other gubernatorial candidates that did the same so the book test from Republicans in 2016 can be cut into the overwhelmingly Democratic support among minorities if they can't I think it's going to be a real challenge for them to win a presidential election and Democrats need a safe the tough reality that it's hard for one party to win three straight terms in you know for president for efficient elections for president then last time that happened the only time that's happened since world war two was Reagan Reagan and Bush between 80 and 92 and that was a Reagan left office with pretty strong approval rates and unless the president obama they will turn things around sharply in his last couple of years he could be a big big drag on Democratic performance in the next presidential election so that's a reality than Hillary Clinton you know sue because she's a nominee or any other democratic company would face uh in two years Republican presidential prospects that's how their fortunes improved chris Christie in getting blue states turned to flip Republican his Republican Governors Association chairman that's a big big night for chris Christie John Kasich winning almost seventy percent of the vote in Ohio which no one was even remotely possible a year ago Scott Walker with avoiding to defeat and winning pretty comfortably with three wins and four years those are the big big Republican winners here like women i think it's sort of a wash like i said i think she is the one democrat that sort of can use her image to be above it all and not have the same baggage and other Democrats might bring to the table but um you know there were also some very cautionary signs from the results as well the big and the biggest good side for Hillary Clinton is that virgo valley who couldn't bring a Democrat man couldn't elect the Anthony Brown and Maryland O'Malley's horrible approval ratings of Maryland were big reason why the fact of Maryland is going to have a Republican as governor is I think a deathblow day is already small chances to take your filler Clinton are a run for her money and finally the final slide just some names watchin really quickly in the coming Congress or in the coming governorships senators you guys probably all know I mean I think Tom Condon is going to be a big figure on foreign policy for the Republicans Joni Ernst you're going to be seen a lot of just like you heard on the campaign trail Cory Gardner is going to be a phase that Republicans are going to try to have a lot and in fence as a big policy walk and I think you'll hear him articulating conservative views and ideas for legislation f of X Republican but this Republican Republican Congress is going to pass a big big big Democratic freshman Seth Moulton the Iraq war veteran who upset John Tierney in a primary that Noah thought he could do and is now going to be one of Ali Nina is decision at least be the leading Democratic voices when it comes to foreign policy he's from Massachusetts he's someone to watch just like Tom cotton was our up and coming Republican congressman last last election of Wayne Graham Florida Democrats have had such a thin bench this year that they had to run a former Republican governor for the governorship against rick Scott or finally they get a candidate now in when Graham who what a Republican favorite seat in north Florida is the daughter of former Senator Bob Graham talented candidate and impress eventually a very impressive lawmaker she's someone who's going to be talked about for for prostate my office calm possibly for the Senate seat as Marco Rubio may be vacated in 2016 so she's a big Democratic freshman member to watch out for two african-american Republicans are heading to the house in addition to Tim Scott seat in the Senate via love who's pictured in the middle there she won the Utah house seat and she's going to be someone who has some Republicans are going to turn to quite a bit I believe the coming coming months and will hurt the african-american from a majority Hispanic Texas district I was a big surprise winner last Tuesday night he's someone who I think will also be seeing a lot of it he could be a future Republican star and again the governor's we talked my router ho dogging and Baker briefly Gina Raimondo in Rhode Island is the state treasurer she won pretty decisively and she's someone who is real tackle the issue of pension reform and in fiscal reform in her home state and I think she's going to be someone to watch for going forward and finally troubles the one the other strong note for Democrats on election night winning a pretty decisive victory against up orbit and he could be another guy but let me mention on national ticket in coming years so with that I things over and if you love to hear from any questions about the midterm elections thanks so much Josh and that was extremely interesting and I think it's always great to hear the perspective from where you sit as a member of what I would call up the political media and and your assessments some of this kind of nonpartisan objective list and before we turn to questions what I want to do is add a little more flavor to this conversation so it's got a few different perspectives and hear from our political consultants who are on the on the line and who are really the ones who now have to kind of interpret what has happened in to the work that they do every day not only for the council but for their other clients as well and what I'm curious among the many things that I'm sure they'll say to here is reflecting on Josh's comment around whether the degree to which this was an anti-obama vote or was this really people voting for republicans or maybe against something else either democrats or that the President himself and what that might mean is we look forward and so I am going to first get our democratic perspective from Rob Leonard the Robin gonna turn the microphone over to you and going to give us a few minutes on cuz your take on what happened Tuesday evening sure and that thank you sooo in the council and all our listeners for this opportunity Joshua's obviously been very comprehensive and his analysis of the election I think from my perspective and the perspective of many Democrats there's no way to sugarcoat this it was a a route of the historic proportions as as Josh indicated a lot of history adverse to Democrats from the Democratic perspective was was made on Tuesday night and it was clearly a huge political victory but the distinction I would make is between a political victory and with that comes the responsibility to govern and I think govern governing is going to be much harder than winning the the majority in the Senate and adding to the majority in the house as occurred last last Tuesday because while the majority changed and obviously a lot of gavels in the Senate are going to change and we're going to get some new chairman as well in the house some very important ones that may bear on the interest of the council in terms of the tax-writing committees where we have two new chairman that will be in place as a result of these elections but certain things have not changed about governing and that's the distinction that that I would make this was certainly in my view I think in the view of most a referendum as most midterm second presidential term midterm elections are referendum on the president and obviously the president had very low approval ratings going in and those approval ratings certainly will not improve at all as a result of the election of last Tuesday Tuesday night but this having said this was a referendum on the president I think it clearly was this was certainly from my perspective I think the perspective of most Democrats an agenda less a election the Republicans didn't win as as well as they did on Tuesday night based on a new genda being presented to the American people this was about the president and how he's doing in the mood of the country and the the perspective of the country looking ahead and the dysfunction of the Congress and the government that we've seen particularly over the last two years and so because the agenda was not really a matter of focus here it creates a lot of uncertainty about what this new majority new leadership is going to do i think the perspective of most democrats there is a lame duck agenda which I know will talk about sue so I won't spend much time on it here but once we get into this new Congress there will be opportunities for the Republicans to a process legislation some of which will be bipartisan and acceptable to the president and we'll get a signature others of which will be quite confrontational particularly in the health area the Affordable Care Act I think clearly we see a confrontation that's occurred in the past and the house is likely to assert itself in the Senate and president has already indicated that he's likely to be forced to veto some legislation there in other areas I think there will be some some bipartisanship assuming that the Republicans themselves can reach consensus I do think there's some questions there Josh identified some fault lines I'm not saying they're fissures but fault lines within the Republican caucus both House and Senate I think more most prominently in the Senate as to how these new Senate Republicans are going to align themselves once they come to Washington but assuming that a consensus can be reached in Republican caucuses House and Senate and that is an assumption not a certainty I think there is an opportunity will be an opportunity for some bipartisan collaboration but on a number of big issues such as health care perhaps in the energy environmental area I do think that a lot of the confrontation and contention that we've seen in the past will continue in this in this new Congress just a quick couple of words and I know you want to quickly get it over to Ken about the tax agenda as I said briefly we will be dealing with two new Republican chairman of these tax riding committees senator hatch for sure in the in the Senate chairing the Finance Committee a little question I'll certainly defer to Ken but from my standpoint until an election for the new chairman is in fact tag we have to acknowledge that there are two contenders Paul Ryan who is the more likely a winner of the race but he is being challenged by Kevin Brady of Texas for the chair one way the other we're going to have a new chairman of both committees and the issue of tax reform I think it's been interesting listening and observing the joint Wall Street Journal op-ed by Speaker Boehner and leader McConnell as well as what they've said in press conferences the tax reform has been identified as a priority I do think that there's a lot of the devil in the detail when it comes to tax reform as the what is meant by it the scope of it and and and that is where the potential implications for the council and its members could come into play I don't think the Republicans themselves again I'll defer to Ken but from my perspective the Republicans themselves do not appear to be fully aligned as to an approach to tax reform and by that I mean whether tax reform is a focused exclusively on reform as as some if not many in the Republican Party have said or whether tax reform is more expansive as the 1986 act was and gets involved with issues not only on the corporate side but also the individual side and obviously to the extent that the individual side of tax reform is implicated or brought into the debate and decision making that's where there is some very important vulnerability to the council and its members in terms of the treatment of the charitable deduction in a tax reform contest so I know in the interest of time so I should stop and I'm glad to and defer things over to Kent thank you so much Rob we appreciate that and now we want to turn to Ken Keith to see a decent views from the Republican perspective good afternoon Ken hi Sue well I'm not going to give views from the Republican perspective in a program like this one where 42 minutes into it we're dangerously close to a point where it's all been said and it's all been said by everyone so what I'd like to do is just identify four aspects of this election that haven't been touched on that I think are significant and then briefly comment about where this may take us but the four things that I'd like to point out our first the state race is the state legislative races are a significant development Republicans will control the most seeds at the legislative state legislative level since 1928 they will take control of 11 legislative chambers that they were previously held by Democrats the most recent one is the house or the Senate in West Virginia where on Thursday yesterday a state senator it was tied a state senator review Slee identified as Democrats which parties which takes the west virginia senate into the into the camp of the republicans the reason that significant is that the state legislatures are the farm teams for the house and senate at the federal level and so so that these developments are pretty significant so that's point number one point number two is to touch on a topic that josh has touched on but just to have a little bit of further color and that is the gubernatorial upsets in Illinois a stunning win and rob's quite familiar with Illinois having worked for chairman Rostenkowski the normal pattern in Illinois is that governors go to work straight from the governor's office to prison in this case this is a different situation he's just going to lose but the fact that the Republican one there is a suggestion that tax increases have not been very popular at the state level the Massachusetts lost by Martha Coakley means that her political career is probably over as she's famously also the person that wats to Scott Brown in the Senate special election to replace Ted Kennedy losing this race there is certainly can't be helping her political career Anthony Brown might recover because I and fairness to him I think he lost because of martin O'Malley's 44 tax increases in the state of Maryland and Josh I think Ashley republicans picked up for governor's offices because I think Arkansas also switched as well although I could be wrong about that all right so point number three is to just point out a story that I think you're going to see a lot more attention to and it's in the USA Today the headline is how did pollsters miss the GOP tsunami and the whole point of the story which is being raised by others like Larry Sabato and others is how could these poll numbers so consistently wrong in Arkansas the Real Clear Politics final polling average had the Republican winning by seven he won by 17 in Kansas the average final average had Roberts losing by point 8 p-1 x 10.7 and that's the story consistently Virginia is another state where they wildly missed the fourth point in my final point is to say is the next two years unfold what you're seeing on the Democratic side of the aisle right now is what happens when party gets clobbered and Republicans have got clobbered before and they've gone through the same thing and it's the stages of a sort of behavior when you have the death of a loved one but normally it begins with denial then morning and then blame and the blame game have already started and the question I would raise is as Democrats reflect on how well they have done during the period that President Obama has been their leader are they going to blame him and the numbers when you focus on them are pretty pretty bad in 2009 Republicans had 60 center seat they'll have 45 in January in 2009 Democrats had 256 House members they'll probably have about 192 in 2009 Democrats had 28 governor's they'll have around 18 in two thousand nine Democrats controlled 27 both legislative chambers in 27 states in 2015 it may be only ten and in 2009 Democrats controlled 62 legislative chambers in 2015 it will probably 27 that Scott has has to make the Democrats as they reflect on how well they've done under the president not feel real positive about supporting his agenda for his final two years in office so then finally and then finally and I'm going to just make one of the comment and turn it back to you sit with which is where does what does that mean we go in this next two years and it's going to be a function of Rob says the Republicans are going to have to govern it's a two-way street the president is going to have to figure out if he is going to work with them and if is starting point is to do the immigration reform through executive order my prediction is very little positive will happen in the next two years because it will so sour the relationship has to make it potentially irreparable and I would just differ slightly with one thing Rob said it is true that Republicans did not get elected because of their agenda but they did get elected because there was a substantial rejection of the President's agenda their challenge now is to articulate an agenda that differentiates them in a positive manner from the president and that may mean passing things that don't get enacted but it may mean that they need to do things even if even if they realize they may face presidential vetoes and that'll that'll be a debate that goes on within the Republican Party as to how do we deal in an environment where we we can get some things done like maybe repeal the medical device tax may be eliminating the 30-hour rule under Obamacare possibly passing the Keystone pipeline and winning a veto override trade promotion Authority which they'd like to give the president those are some doable wins but when you get beyond a handful of those things and then start talking about big things like tax reform it is a very tricky environment to figure out how you could actually reach a compromise that would be acceptable to Republic in Congress and would be signed by by the President Obama so let me stop there soon I'll turn it back to you thank you so much to all three of you and I have a long laundry list of questions but we have a short amount of time and frankly a lot of what you all covered in your narratives hit on some of the issues that I had so for the three of you I want to pose one question that has not to come up and it's something that we at the council are definitely looking at closely and that has to do with the lame duck session that we will now head into presumably in the next week or so that we are all kind of predicting would run through about December twelfth which is the point at which the continuing resolution would either run out or need to be extended and that is of course for listeners that that provision which allows the government to remain open it is what funds the government so we have the lame-duck session upcoming we figure Italy you know maybe a week or two of legislative days long and one of the things that the council deeply cares about on behalf of our members are those provisions that are both both some provisions that are in the extenders bill but as we all know those those provisions that address the charitable sector have been lifted out and put into a bill called the America gives more acts that has a couple of additional provisions in it and would make those extenders permanent and that was something that the House passed with a relatively good bipartisan support back in June so are we absolutely are concerned about what happens ahead in the next Congress but we do have this very real very relevant issue which is merely days ahead in front of us so I'm starting with a starting with Rob and then going to Ken and Josh if you guys could each just give maybe two minutes or so on what you think is going to happen in the next four or so weeks before December twelfth with the lame duck session both on the extenders and what else might get taken up in that time so to that progress rodeo okay and again I'll in the interest time will be a quick our expectation here is that the extenders will be dealt with Wyden with the current chairman and majority leader for the moment Harry Reid both are very committed to their to the Finance Committee package which is a two-year extension of all of the 55 or so expiring provisions whether that package can pass the house or whether it is amended to a one-year extension which is one of the rumors another rumor is and again I'm going to defer to Ken another rumor is that there are elements of the house that would prefer that nothing be done with the extenders and it all go over to the new year where they will have majorities there are other others who expect that the position of the house leaders and chairman camp that there should be some provisions made permanent that's a natural compromise where you may get a two-year extension of most but a couple like the rd credit and perhaps a few others would be made permanent I really do think that the ultimate resolution of the extender package is is clearly up to the Republicans even in the lame duck session because Reed is going to need some degree of cooperation from McConnell and the Senate Republicans to process any kind of an extender bill so I do think that the Republican leaders in the lame duck session will have a lot to say on the composition of what happens but the expectation on the Democratic side is that the extenders will be dealt with for either a one or two-year period i'll say just as one quick thing about the america gives more act obviously that that act that bill has passed the house permanent provisions obviously beneficial provisions so you have an issue there of permanency but the other thing there's the one part I know it's very important to a lot of people on the call which is the simplification of the excise tax the foundation excise tax that itself is not an extender and so it does get complicated to accommodate that as a non extender while saying no particularly in the Senate to other provisions that are trying to find their way into the extender package but again I think that the extenders will be dealt with and the ultimate resolution I think will be left to the Republicans McConnell and Boehner to fill in thanks Rob do you can well go out on a women make a definitive prediction which is the extenders will be done for a two-year period that's point number one terrorism risk insurance will be reauthorized because that proair program extends at the end of the year and it's completely bipartisan the continuing resolution will obviously be dealt with possibly all the way to the end of the current fiscal year which is September 30 of next year but maybe into the bring where things get a little bit complicated because there's the Medicare doc fix expiring in March technically the debt ceiling expires in March too but it probably doesn't have to be addressed until August because of all the funny things they can do and there'll be some confirmations that getting the Attorney General's name through will be a little ugly but it may well happen and that's it now the good news here is that we should continue the pressure that we've been putting on to get the other aspects of the bill that passed the house that affects foundations we should continue to support that because when we get to next year Republicans are going to be looking around for things that can not only pass the house but also passed the Senate and the president may sign and I think the rest of our provisions could clearly fit into that category so there's every reason to keep the pressure on until Congress adjourns which I think probably will be December 12 oh thanks so much cannon thank you for for noting as well the importance of staying standing firm on the America gives more Act provisions because as we all know these things do carry over from one year to the next and things don't just sort of die and fall off the tree and we have to keep up our support especially signaling to those members of the House who stood up and voted yes on the America gives more actually need to show them our support thanks for mentioning that can and Josh I'm going to now turn to you and get your perspective in about two minutes on what you see in the lame duck yeah I mean as far as the politics of the lame duck I don't think there's any incentive and ending Robin and ten one detail this with the specific legislation but there's really no incentives to really give up the works and i think the tone of the next Congress will be set by my two things in the linen that are going to take place in the lame duck number one is the confirmation or nomination areas for the Attorney General nominee we don't know officially who that is but it looks like the the list of reports at least in the news that to be a little inch the booklet prosecutor that is going to be selected so it'll be very interesting to see how Republic it seems like that's a more bipartisan selection if that's the direction that the president goes in so that'll be a real home center for the upcoming Congress and the next big bigger question is whether the president is going to go through with the executive order when it comes to legalizing certain illegal immigrants unilaterally in the country and at his press conference Wednesday he seemed to suggest you would be doing that I think I talked to some folks close to the White House and suggested then it's not quite as definitive and still trying to figure out there at their own strategy but that would be alieve McConnell and Boehner both sort of set their own red line they michalek almost fairly conciliatory in his in his post-election comments but I think that would be it is the president wants to make progress with Republicans on areas where there is some genuine common agreement on trade tax reform in particular throwing the immigration executive order in the next right before the new Congress assorted would be a surefire way to really poisoned the relationship early on so I know those are the two two indicators to look at and that's going to both of them are going to be taking place during the life duck the immigration first and foremost but also how bipartisan vote is for the new Attorney General nominee thanks so much Josh we are coming up on our one-hour mark as usual there's lots and lots that we could say here I know for those of you who are as interested in these issues as I am we could probably sit for another hour and listen but we promise you all will be one hour on your Friday afternoon and I want to on behalf of the council thanks our three presenters it was incredibly informative helpful intriguing yet some turns up and so thank you very much to all of those who tuned in thank you so much we had a great number of people participating in this a few of you did submit questions that we were not able to get you however we know who you are and we are going to respond to you via email as always we try to be as responsive as we can on these calls and so please expect to get an email from us within the next day or so clear this afternoon if we can answer quickly if not we'll get to it there as quickly as we can with that have a wonderful friday afternoon a wonderful weekend in please stay tuned for future webinars from the council on foundations public policy and legal affairs team that will certainly include tax reform and what's ahead in the 2015 Congress as soon as we know a bit more thank you again have a wonderful afternoon", "Orp-sgPVLC4": "[Music] Thank You Suzanne I was honored to be invited to speak here tonight honored months ago and asked Suzanne what should I talk about and she said hey how about winter wellness and I said oh what a great concept or topic to speak on because I am a licensed acupuncturist and if you're familiar at all with Chinese medicine one of the basic tenants of it is that we as human beings are an integral part of the natural world we are the microcosm of the macrocosm we are a piece a piece of the larger hold and so with that being said I want to introduce to you another concept of traditional Chinese medicine and that's the Five Element theory and so here on the board you'll see that I have the five elements kind of written out here so we have wood fire earth metal and water water being the last one and water is the element that we're talking about tonight with winter wellness so here we are in November and it's fall why are we talking about winter in the fall well it's actually this is a really awesome time to be talking about winter wellness because this is a really good time to begin to prepare to dive deep into the depths of winter this is a good time to start thinking about really boosting your immune system as we just had our time change the days are getting shorter the nights are getting colder the environment is going to start to get more damp and so coldness and dampness right those things can kind of set into our systems and cause a lot of imbalance if we're not prepared if we are prepared then it can actually offer us many many gifts so that's my hope tonight is to just present a really elegant simple tips and tools for you to you dive into the depths of winter in a way that you can maintain your health and just conserve energy and store energy and really take time to rest and retreat get to know yourself better and just honor all of the opportunities that you have within yourself and within your environment to heal so that when we get into spring we can spring forward and just like burst forth with all of the amazing gifts that we have so fall the fall the other thing about the fall is that the fall is mostly connected with the metal element and each of the elements have an organ associated with them and the organs associated with metal are the lung and the large intestine large intestine we gather all the nutrients from the harvest right right now we're harvesting the last of our summer crops and some of our fall and winter crops are starting to come in if you're gardener you might have put your cabbage into the ground and your garlic's into the ground and you might be enjoying the squashes and some of those awesome late summer produce it's kind of at the end of that so we're really using our large intestine to get that the nutrients to head into winter and then it's also the metal element is also associated with the fall and the lung and the lung in Chinese medicine is actually a really important organ because the energy of it supports an energetic system that we have in our body called the way Chi way w/e I Chi Qi and that's that trick that's Chinese but it translates into protective field or protective energy and so we have it's similar to our immune system and our lymph system and we have this energetic field that exists all around our whole entire body and it is about an eighth of an inch above the skin and an eighth of an inch into the skin and their way chi that energy circulates around our body we want to keep that forcefield really nice and strong and solid so that if the pathogens the external pathogens come in come towards us we want to be able to reflect them so they don't come into our body and get into our organs and cause disharmony on a deeper level so we have that energetic system that's associated with the metal element right and you see and I started with wood fire earth metals where we're at right now in the fall and then we're heading into the winter time and go figure the wintertime would be associated with water that makes perfect sense because what happens in the winter it rains it gets damp and so the water element is the winter so here we are in the winter and the first thing on the handout is a poem by John Seuss and it's actually in one of my favorite books this is called earth prayers I don't know if you've seen this book but it's really awesome and it's in the section of earth prayers called cycles of life and the poem reads to be of the earth is to know the restlessness of being a seed the darkness of being planted the struggle toward the light the joy of bursting forth the love of bearing food for someone the scattering of your seeds the decay of the seasons the mystery of death and the miracle of birth and so you could see that things in nature are cyclical much like they are in our lives so where are we at in the cycle of our lives right now we're you know the veil is really thin we just celebrated Dia de los Muertos this is a time where there is a lot of introspection and kind of like tenderness as we head into this time that you know it's cold so we want to wrap ourselves up and scars I'm kind of just start to really hunker down for the winter so that we can conserve our energy and just bite down and chew and receive the nourishment from the harvest and so winter right what happens in winter in nature happens in our bodies and what happens in winter well let's see the fall just happens so that all the trees are leaving it losing their leaves right now but what's gonna be happening is that because there's not gonna be a lot of leaves and above-ground activity going on the roots are just gonna be riotous the roots are gonna be celebrating and storing all of this awesome energy that it's got that they've received from the sunlight and all of the energy and love that's been happening in the atmosphere it condenses into the roots so we're moving into the time of water winter and so what happens in the winter right that happens in the winter all the energy comes in to the roots and it starts raining and there's water and what happens in our body well our body is sixty percent water more than half of our bodies on average its water and so this is a this is one of my whatever I think one of the most interesting elements because water is so interesting it can like break down a rock and it can move around whatever it encounters and it can be contained and it can be a vapor and it can be ice so this water is this dynamic fluid and static it's kind of like everything all at once and nothing all at the same time water and then water winter right in the five element Theory each of these elements can be related to anything in nature a sound a smell a grain a number a season right and so the organs associated with metal I mentioned earlier were the lung and the large intestine and with water the organs associated with water are the kidney and the bladder all right and that makes sense right those are kind of like really watery organs the kidney let's talk about the kidney for a moment what is the kidney do well in Western medicine the kidney is closely associated with water metabolism and water metabolism also helps with the function of the heart and blood pressure so kidney and heart have and the heart is the fire element right so we have water and fire that relationship right there kind of opposites they can extinguish each other or turn one into vapor right they have this really dynamic relationship and so the kidney in Western medicine that is that is the function of the kidney and Western medicine and in Eastern medicine or traditional Chinese medicine the function of the kidney is much more energetic it's a little bit more esoteric and the energy of the kidney in Chinese medicine it dominates the ears hearing it dominates the bones which includes the teeth and then it also dominates the which I think is really interesting the brain or the marrow to dominates the marrow and the brain is considered marrow in Chinese medicine because the brain is enclosed in the skull in the cranium and then also the spinal cord that comes down is also enclosed within each vertebrae and so that's considered marrow as well and so the kidney the wintertime there's this really close associate with mental health and with the nervous system as well right the nervous system is very much an electrical system and the water in our bodies helps for those electrical firings to happen it gives it kind of like a base for that to happen the reproductive organs right the kidneys if you can feel the bottom level of your ribcage and then you go back into your back the kidneys are housed right they're actually really tiny they're pretty small and they have a little adrenal on top of adrenal gland on top of them it looks like a little acorn hats on top of a acorn actually so they're so we have these two little kidneys in our back and the kidneys the energy of the kidney is very much it's kind of like a pilot light for our body so the kidneys are this little tiny pilot light the mingming fire if you've ever done any like chi gong or Chinese medicine Chinese exercises you rub the bottom of the belly to like keep that area warm and you rub the back the low back to keep it warm because you want to keep that pilot light ignited and so what does that do spray the kidneys in charge of water metabolism and so that little pilot light allows the moisture to come into the kidneys and then the kidneys filter the water right they have the nephrons or not yep and yeah nephrons that filter the water and so they separate the pure from the impure and the impure goes into the bladder to be excreted out and then what happens with the pure water that the kidney filters well that little pilot light turns that water into vapor mind you this is all Chinese medical Theory turns the water into vapor and then the vapor comes up and it just mists and lightly moistens and nourishes all of our organs so that they can remain soft and supple flexible moist so that they can do all the metabolism and all of their jobs that they need to do if we don't have water things like you you see rivers kind of dry up and they you know you can look at a dry river and it doesn't look as vibrant and alive and healthy and inviting as a river that has water in it but you just kind of want to dive into so urinary bladder the urinary bladder is the other organ associated with winter in Chinese medicine and the urinary bladder is this container that receives the impure water from the kidney and then excretes it out and that you know it's pretty the energetics of the urinary bladder are pretty similar in Western and Eastern medicine so that those are the functions of the kidney and the urinary bladder but what happens when what happens when there is an imbalance well if there is a deficiency in the kidney or the urinary bladder right I said that the kidney and urinary bladder they they dominate the ears it's the organ that's closely associated with it so sometimes if someone has tinnitus ringing in the ears it could be that the kidney the moisture isn't coming up in nourishing and moistening it so that physical structure and the energetic structure of the ears gets kind of dry and hard and it's not supple it can't run a can't like vibrate and resonate the sound so it gets kind of rigid if the kidney and urinary bladder are deficient the moisture might not come up and nourish the brain a lot of times if there's like forgetfulness or like other certain dis harmonies in Western medicine that present like dementia Alzheimers just that kind of like the brain is slowly starting to slow down and then it's function it's not receiving that nourishment from the kidneys that's kind of like sometimes it can be the brain like drying out a little bit energetically the other things that the kidney and bladder dominate is the low back in the knees so a lot of times if there's low back pain or knee pain it can be related to kidney and if the kidney and urinary bladder are not healthy and plump and happy it can also cause a lot of fear fear is the emotion of the kidney just like these elements are related to an organ a season a color a sound they're related to an emotion and so if the kidney can't distribute water properly it affects the heart right so if the kidneys deficient it can't feed the heart which is the fire element and it can contribute to anxiety and fear and a lot of that too has to do with its connection to the brain so why am I talking about organs you guys came here to learn about immune system and you're learning about their reproductive and their and the respiratory and all these other systems well they're all really closely interconnected so I just wanted to give you that as like the the basis for what China how Chinese medicine views the immune system and the wintertime right they're very closely connected I want to talk give you some exercises let's see in your handout here am i keeping on track you guys yes emotion fear exercise so some exercises that are really great so just exercise in general is really great right we all need exercise we all need to move because if we're not moving if we're not exercising then we get stagnant and then if we get stagnant then the energy doesn't move the water doesn't move and things start to just slow down and get stuck and that is a disharmony things in nature just move right change is the only constant so we're constantly changing and moving and so movement no matter how wild and big it is how small and calm and soothing it is is really important so exercise seasonally is a really interesting thing to think about because in the summertime your exercise might look really rigorous and you know you might do a lot of different dance classes you might it's just so nice out in the mornings before the heat of the day comes in you might just want to go for a really vigorous walk well in the wintertime exercise is a little bit different or it should be in the wintertime the exercises should be more like really long slow movements really gentle movements so in the summertime where you might want to do dance and lotsa and just expend a lot of energy because that's the time of a lot of outward growth and a lot of movement and a lot of warmth then a very young in nature the winter time is kind of the opposite of that the winter time is very in in nature so the winter time we want to kind of slow down and be more gentle with ourselves and so a really good like nice slow chi gong movement or yoga stretch or just instead of a really vigorous walk he might just want to walk really slowly and just feel your feet on the earth and feel the slow movements right because cold contracts it's a time of contraction we want to mirror within our bodies what happens outside of our bodies in the environment and if you look at all the plants that are our teachers and our friends they're contracting they've lost their leaves their energy is down in the roots so we want to mimic nature is it really a mimic I don't know because we are nature so it's we just want to be more so than mimic pub so slow down short walks right so the first exercise that I listen we get to do some exercises are you guys ready yeah exercise so the first exercise above in addition to all of the ones that I just mentioned that you can do is to rub your ears the kidneys open into the ears so the ears are really important right the whole body there's a micro system where you can treat the whole body just by treating the ears and you can rub your ears for five minutes a day and the way I like to do it is to start out with thumbs behind the ears and just go through and get you can go do a good round around the edges of the ears and you might feel your ears start to warm up if you just really get in there and give them a good rub in they might start to warm up anyone's ears feeling warm it starts to warm up yeah so that's gonna be do a two and a half minutes like that and then flip your hands the other way so you can get the full benefit and continue rubbing your ears like that this is actually a chi gong this is a really important opening exercise to rub your ears and just really get in there and look around the base of the ears and so the first exercise you know this is a really this is something to give you a couple exercises that are really easy and gentle but effective you get energy moving so I can feel my ears just from that little bit of rubbing they're warm they're probably bright red so rubbing your ear is really important the second one is marching in place and you can stand up or you can do it right from your seat whatever is more comfortable for you but the kidney Meridian on the bottom of the foot the kidney Meridian the opening point acupuncture point is on the bottom of the foot it's the only acupuncture point that's on the bottom of the foot and so this is a really interesting element of the kidney Meridian the pathway of energy because it really connects to the earth and so when we this the second exercise is marching in place right and this is so you'll do this you can rub the ears for five minutes and you can march in place for five minutes and by marching in place it's like really just like flat you can even just tap your feet on the ground really just get a like nice and flat and just feel your hold and so when I'm doing this what I'm feeling is I can feel energy come up the back of my legs and actually I can feel my kidneys kind of vibrating a little bit right can you feel that Lucy like you can just feel that vibration come up with the back of the legs up into the kidneys yeah uh-huh the sacroiliac is where the sacrum the sacrum and the iliac crest meet so right here if you do have an injury or if your if your low back is is injured you might want to be a little bit careful with that and you can just just you know as lightly you can even it can even just be this gentle but so when you're doing this what you want to practice is just feeling and even if you just have to imagine it you want to feel the kidneys kind of vibrating in your low back right and what it's doing is you're resonating with the earth right so you're getting Earth's energetic field up into your kidneys so what's that Marilyn yeah you barefoot on the earth is probably the best way to me yes and okay so and not actually okay you can let's see are we gonna stand up fern oh yeah so while I have you all up let's do in the next one but that brings up a good point Marilyn is that there is an actual exercise called earthing where you stand on the earth and it's really important too because just like we have an energetic field around us the earth does too and that's like through this acupuncture point on the bottom of the foot that's how we connect into that and it's really important for our energetic electrical Chi system to connect with it because we're all one right so the next one is rigorously rubbing the kidneys right so I said that if you find the bottom of your cage and you just go straight to the back your kidneys are right here and so what you want to do is just vigorously rub them again kind of like the ear got warm you want to feel that warmth in your low back and this keeps the kidneys warm the kidneys like to be warm the heating pad hot water bottle vigorously rubbing them you feel so good the kidneys do like to be warm it helps them to function it helps them to transform the water it helps them to move the impurities out of our body all right so this is really important and then the next one it's a chi gong exercise called the counter swing or the cheese swing and I'm gonna do it kind of big so you could see but you can if you want to practice it right now you can do it kind of smaller and then on your own you can go bigger with it it's kind of what kind of a dance yeah so you're gonna you stand and you keep your waist straight and you're just gonna twist just just twist at the waist kind of like you're bringing out the top of the body right you're just wringing it out and if you just do that you'll see that you're right I'm gonna be exaggerative here you'll see that your arms start to swing out okay notice I'm not moving my knees I'm just moving my waist my knees do bend a little bit and so see how my arms are I'm kind of flinging my arms out and they're kind of they're hitting their lightly tapping rather at the front and the back of the kidneys yeah lightly tap front in the back so you can see it from the back how I'm kind of just like just moving my waist and my hands fly up in the hip tap where the kidneys are so you're getting this is like a two-for-one deal here right you're good not only are you like wringing out the kidneys you're also kind of tapping them and so you're really giving your internal organs a massage which is great because what happens in the winter things contract and slow down and massage is great right Lucy yes oh that's a great way to just give your kidney a little bit more love keep that warmth keep that movement happening in there yes yeah great question hot tubs are awesome so the thing with hot tubs that you want to be aware of is that when you get out of the hot tub your body is in a warm state and it's open and so that that gives the opportunity for cold and pathogens to come into the body so you want to be able to just get out immediately be covered up don't let your body be exposed to cold wind cold damp right so here's the other thing is that you do want to expose your bought this is a delicate balance here because you do want to expose your body to cold like right now when we get into lifestyle you'll see that there's a suggestion but right now is a really good time to start taking cold showers because it it or at least in your shower with some cold because it causes a contraction and it actually stimulates the immune system so cold is good but you and if it's good to cool down after a hot tub you don't necessarily want to like keep all the heat in but you don't want to let wind and the dampness kind of get into it see there's a it's it's a delicate balance yeah mmhmm yeah no great great question I love hot tubs I want one uh-huh the last exercise that I have listed in there is just take a break take time to reflect take time to receive the nourishment and really let it sink in be like the roots of the tree you know like the trees we're in the spring and summer and even in the fall they just have these beautiful flowers and they're all out here and then in the winter they're really just receiving nourishment and a lot of the activities have underground so you want that to be happening in your body you want to rest you want to meditate you want a journal you want to do self-reflection it's a time to really start thinking about that would like the poem that I read in the beginning to be of the earth is to know the restlessness of being a seed you're kind of in that seed stage where you're underground and you have this potential right so this is what happens in the winters that work home cool underground and we just have this potential that we're giving nourishment we're giving thought we're giving and we're conserving and storing and replenishing that energy so that when we move from metal which is fall into winter so that when we move to fall into spring which is the wood element we can be like a tree and the flowers we can just burst forth and kind of be flexible sway with all the winds that come in our direction and really yeah I mean I know in my life there's been winters where I was moving or starting a new business or doing all these things and then the spring came and the business started to get busy and I was exhausted so I can look back and learn from that life experience did that this year I moved in February but I did get to have a lot of really rejuvenative time so so exercise some things you can do real right simple tools any other exercises people like to do in the winter anyone have any anything you like to do in the winter okay take a nap great Tchibo from the yellow Emperor's classic of internal medicine which is a really great book it's this it's one of the it's thousands of years old and it's this classic of Chinese medicine I'll get to yeah and it's like the way that it's written is like this conversation between Huang Di and Qi bow and then Huangdi is like this meta submitted Chinese medical scholar and Tchibo is is apprentice and so they're sitting in the forest and Cibo asks Huangdi all these questions and Wong Dee answers him in these very esoteric ways about nature tchibo is asking him about what do you do in winter and Huangdi says well in winter you go to bed early and rise late you rise late after the Sun has come up and been able to warm the atmosphere because if you wake up early when everything's still contracted your body's still contracted and then you have to get up and well and it's rigid still and it's a lot of work so conserving energy in the winter really important yes yeah Thank You City you wanna see keep moving yeah yeah so she sits if you're sitting keep moving always keep movement even if it's just a gentle undulation of the spine yep all right yes yeah yes chair exercises like that exercise of tapping the feet lightly on the floor you can sit at the edge of your seat and just roll your spine back and forth all great suggestions I'm just gonna rip through a few your other nice simple tools that you can do there's some pressure points that you can rub on the first one is large intestine 4 and I've outlined to them and this is a great point if you vet some people you might have heard of this one for headaches this point is the command point of the front of the face and it moves energy around the whole body and it helps with pain around the whole body so this is a really great acupuncture point just to get in there and just give it some massage so it's between the pointer finger and the thumb there's this web and it's kind of right in the middle of there Ryan so right there so you can just get in there just rub it you might find a little tiny tender spot and you can just hold that spot um it means that there's either an excess or deficiency or that's just a good place to move energy from and the next point is do 14 so like right where a t-shirt collar would lay on the neck this is so this point was the the command point of the front of face this point is kind of the command point of the back of the neck the front of the face on the back of the neck or portals for like cold to get into the body and cause disharmony so you can you can just rub that area there and again you might find a tender spot but that's a really great place to just rub and really connect in with you just rub your hands together and get him warm you can place them on there just keep that warm and then when you're done put your keep that heat in because that's a precious gift you're giving yourself stomach 36 you have your kneecap and then if you just rest your hand at the bottom of the kneecap again these are it's not a while it is an exact science but I'm doing acupuncture if you're just doing self massage it's not that big of an exact science and just along the side here you can just rub right in there and this point here actually stimulates the immune system and it helps with digestion and digestion is really important cuz that's where we get our nutrients from right and that's what we're doing in the winter is we're storing our nutrients so stomach 36 on the outside of the so four finger widths below the kneecap on the on the lateral side the outside of the shin bone there's a muscle there and the points right in the muscle right in the head and that muscle the big part of the muscle it's a pretty big area and again you might find a small soft spot that's like kind of mushy or tender and then spleen six if you go to the inside of the leg and then just above the ankle and on the back side of the shin bone if you rub down that line there you might find a tender spot this tends to be real tender this tends to be really tender on people and this this point here it helps moderate water in the body and again it moves all of the energy in the body so it's a really great point for just keeping movement in the body and the last acupuncture point acupressure points because you guys could do any pressure that I listed was kidney three and this one is on the inside of the ankle you have the ankle bone here and between the ankle bone tendon there's that divot right here right between the ankle bone and the tendon there's a divot right there and if you just get in there and rub that that helps move the kidney energy around the body so it's a really great point for winter because it helps keep the water moving and nourishing everything so that we don't become contracted and rich in you know I would I think 5 minutes twice a day is a really good general rule of thumb for these acupuncture points the all of these acupuncture points are very gentle very effective then we think about some other things that happen in the winter we eat right in the wintertime so that it's like it's so dark and we just want light so we go and we go to these parties and we eat and we have fun well food is really important in the winter time it's important to eat very warming foods so I made a ginger tea ginger honey tea ginger is great it's warming cardamom I listed a bunch of foods in there that are great to eat you want to eat foods that are warming you want to start to do make dishes that put you put more time into cooking roasted root vegetables stews soups winter food so the way that you cook your food you're putting heat into it and then you could have warmer foods let's see what did I list here and there's also black beans kidney beans right so look just like each of the elements relate to a sound and an organ and a season they also relate to a color so foods that are kind of black or dark blue in nature tend to tonify the kidneys more so we have black beans kidney beans and then you know what if foods look like walnuts actually look like the kidneys right they also kind of look like the lungs so walnuts tonify the kidney and the brain the kidney the lung and the brain yeah walnuts my teacher always said five walnuts a day Michele five walnuts a day and I mean the oils walnuts are great they're really good stuff so the foods you want to avoid or cold foods raw ice two drinks because those contract and it's already cold in the winter so we don't want to put any more cold in our body right we're trying to achieve balance when it's cold and damp outside we want to encourage warmth and not dryness but not dampness we don't want excess damp so we don't want to eat a lot of dairy and the foods that cause stamina sin our body glutinous rice white rice is gluttonous the Rice's that that when you cook it it gets kind of gooey so a lot of the white Rice's as opposed to the wild Rice's that aren't really they don't have that stickiness to them yeah sticky rice is more something that you could eat like in the summertime when you want to hold on to that vinegar is kind of a stringent it's it contracts right hahaha apple cider vinegar apple cider vinegar is more of a neutral vinegar yeah so so vinegar is on a food too to avoid during winter yeah because it's it's more cooling and it's kind of a stringent so it's kind of like it's kind of contracting and this is Chinese medical theory right so Chinese medical nutrition yeah the balsamic vinegars tend to be a little bit more they also are astringent lemons are neuter are more neutral yes because they're cold if you steamed the spinach that would be okay but you like cold raw vegetables when you take them into your body it takes heat and warmth to digest them so in the winter months you want to avoid anything that's gonna utilize that heat and the other thing is lifestyle just like in general habits that you can have washing your hands getting plenty of sleep which is when we talked about reducing stress in any way that you can it's really important because what does stress take stress takes like mental and emotional thought process and that's an expenditure of our energy that in the winter months we really want to start conserving that and then I talked about that cold shower thing that I saw a couple people shudder on right now it's actually really good time to expose your body to cold showers at the end of it you can take a warm shower and then at the end if you just take a little bit of cold it contracts the exterior to keep the warmth in and it actually stimulates the immune system so just keeping warm again like warming the kidneys keeping a scarf around your neck cuz like the front of the face the back of the neck and the kidneys here and then the bottom of the feet those are the places where the warmth tends to really come into our bodies the most so being mindful of that it's really important really fluid movements you know if you go for walks in the morning don't walk like this try to walk with like with really fluid long slow gentle movements with that yeah lengthening exercises and strengthening I really good right now and just taking time to really listen and recharge really important I'm the last thing in my handout is the list of herbs yay I love the herbs and I started with a couple different Chinese medical or Chinese formulas that are really popular you ping Fung Shawn which is the jade windscreen which this is the the palace of jade is the back of the neck and so it's the Jade windscreen is the name of the formula astragalus is the main herb in it so it really protects the back of the neck and keeps the pathogens out of the body keeps that outer energetic field strong so that viruses and pathogens can't enter into our bodies and then there's some herbs that you all may be a little bit more accustomed to a straggle s elderberry which is one of our natives and our native plants a lot of people make syrups out of that and it's just it's really great to keep your immune system going echinacea olive leaf really great for supporting immune function and providing antioxidant support and oregano which helps support healthy digestion and flora so that's it for my handout I hope that I've provided you with some really simple elegant thoughts on how to boost your immune system for the winter as we're here in fall and moving into winter questions one of the herbs that I listed there is a straggle s and a strapless is called an adaptogen and so it's not necessarily an herb that's gonna give you a boost of energy but it'll help you to adapt to stress and over time it'll strengthen your whole being so a straggle astiz really great I think I like a straggle as' really it's an adaptogen so it helps the body to adapt to whatever is draining your energy and it helps to strengthen the body so over time really gently it gives a good energy you know there's other herbs and things like like there's like a caffeine which just like gives a quick burst but then it's actually depleting so you want to be careful with herbs that like give you energy because a lot of times they can just deplete you over time yes I have olive leaf and it's not exactly my favorite tea can you suggest things that we are compatible with olive leaf that would cancel out yeah well olive leaf is is as a tea is really very strong so in capsules is good olive leaf the antioxidant support right we have like I think blueberries are really great antioxidant we have like a lot of our wild berries here like huckleberries and blackberries really good and because they're fruits they're cold they're cooling in nature but you can make a compote and add them to vote me Oh and that's a really great way to get that and then the anti the olive leaf really supports immune function but it's also really not sure why you're taking all bleep it's also really good because it's a it's antibacterial antiviral so elderberry the elderberry also is a really good one for that because my question was that you know drinking it and usually if you're gonna really be drinking tea in regular basis you're gonna be more likely to do if it tastes good you know and then that sound that olive leaf tastes horrible but just like me you know it's nothing right so you're wanting suggestions for a immune-boosting tea that you can drink well to add to olive leaf yeah have you tried a straggle Asit has a really sweet earthy flavor yeah you might want to try a strapless I'm really a huge fan Claudia did you do it liminal perfect thank you okay so lemon balm is a really great suggestion lemon balm is a really smart herb but because and it grows it loves to grow around here and yeah and tons of it so you might want to try a straggle s and then if you and I have some in the office and Mariposa has some and Mountain Rose has some and if if you have any more questions we can talk about that later or if that and give me some feedback if you do get to try that school cap is also in the mint family and it's a it's a tonic and it's an it's a it's an adaptogen it helps strengthen the body it's also it is really good for the immune system as well yeah yeah school caps a grader it's great too you know what up so what I'm saying more is that then putting warmth on to the neck is keeping the cold off of it it's really the important part yeah you wanted you do want to keep it warm but even more important than like yeah keeping it warm is important keeping a scarf around your neck but what you really want - you want more than like been putting adding warmth to it is you want to just like keep your natural body warmth and keep be sure to keep the wind and the cold and the damp and the drafts off of it because this is kind of like a portal in the Chinese medicine in our energetic system there's kind of like this opening here where the wind can enter into the body and so you want to just shield and protect on if you've ever felt that the urge to go like that cover your neck right does that make sense yes when I just started doing it about a month ago as I get cold when I go to bed in in my chest and of course I trade scarves and you know you've got all your plants and what I did of course I'm an ample size in my hips so I took a pair of my pajama bottoms and they there you go that's a great idea yeah in the Jetta so the other place to keep warm is the low back in the in Japanese culture I forget the name of it but what it is is it's a wool blanket that's about this big with a sash and you take the wool blanket and you put it up over your hips or over your kidneys and then you take the sash and you tie it and then you flip it down and there's an extra blanket that they wear on the kidneys to keep the kidneys warm I have a t-shirt where I spend a piece of flannel right over the kidneys and we're that under my other under guard and where did you get that it was that an idea just something innate that she felt somebody advising me to keep my kidneys for yeah I knew that was a way to do it so she said she pinned a piece of flannel into her shirt to keep her kidneys warm so soon did you have something when I feel like I'm gonna get sick what I do is I make something called fire water great question yeah so Mariposa makes fire water so if I'm in town and I'm not at home with my little cabinet of herbs and things I will go to Mariposa and get something called fire water and basically that tea that I brought tonight it had I bite got a ginger root and I cut it up and I boiled it or simmered it for a while and I added lemon and honey but what the fire water is is it's lemon honey cayenne pepper and I like to use molasses because it has a lot of minerals that are bioavailable in it and that fire water I will drink that and I make it hot with lots of cayenne pepper because it helps to sweat right and push that pathogen out so I will drink a cup of the firewater and I will take a hot shower and I'll go to bed and put all my covers on and just like hunker down and I will sweat and just push that out yeah so lemon water lemon ginger a sweetener I like molasses or honey and cayenne pepper lemon water and they do Mariposa just like oh I'm in town working and in start to feel good even if I just feel a little bit like low-energy I'll do that because it warkz warms me from the inside and kind of gives me that vitality if you can't stand anything hot like cayenne peppers there's two other herbs that are really great that you could use that our diaphoretic that help you to sweat and that is the yarrow flower and the elder flower so yarrow flower and elder flower also get the body sweating so bring the temperature up to a high heat right it kind of knocks the pathogen virus down virus load down and sweat great question thanks Suzanne my name is Michele gene come in Xiamen licensed acupuncturist and

you know it's funny I'm tired right now oh look it's plain cuz I've rented to uh anyways long story short I watched the movie I was at home one night I just I was tired and then I saw the movie was our old school spot I didn't know that was Spike Lee's first film right I didn't know that I would have known that watching it it was dope and then I saw the show the the new show I watched the show first inning I saw the movie how was it movie was good like I appreciated oh yeah you know I don't I feel me I feel nola in both positions like I feel her they're different women in different times you know no she's the same thing she in this new when she was bolder she wasn't willing to compromise but she still had that same spirit she came around to wanting to be with Jamie in the movie it wasn't like I've seen one episode of the show I heard that uh I heard that opals I heard that oh who is come oh man I thought you watched it like oh no no you know no okay check it out and need talk to me right well I saw the movie and I saw the first episode you know I heard that opal is way different issues no Melissa Beast I heard if she [ __ ] is a gorgeous woman okay she's fine open gorgeous woman okay you know cheese like she's except she's materialistically success and she's using that to average okay yeah that's interesting a little bit but you know and she has you know the other guy who's a you know photographer or whatever and then she has the guy who's like a banker yeah all right we don't worry I don't really know what Jimmy did Jamie does yeah and then got more and more right and I was feeling like Martha I usually played lunch buddies please please and that's why I really watch the movie because you know mars blackmon you saw him in the jordan commercials yes classic iconic man's every day where Jordan versus man yeah man spike had a huge impact on the culture yeah man I got to meet Spike actually really yeah tell me tell us about it I was in a London man and why are you a Morehouse yeah and I just ran into him and you know talk to attract it up for a second we need Jews that you remember from that interact no no no why I mean you know I got a picture but that's cool you know but it was just good thing on them you know one thing I did learn is that he actually did mostly studies at Clark Atlanta another school I was in a easy shot a clerk at Lynn yeah make away I forgot what the modeling is make away again Dennis I'm something like that I don't you know this you know you were there for everything else moving right along moving right along Oh looking at the at the clock it's about that time for a walk [Music] opioid crisis trade your drugs for weed this comes to us from anti media this is from Lebanon Oregon as the opioid crisis continues to plague the country one cannabis company in Oregon is is proposing a new solution caius Holdings the first publicly traded company to open and operate a medical cannabis dispensary it's planning to set up an opioid for weed swap program where addicts can trade their pills for the plant this is pretty good yeah the CEO said that they wanted to do their part after 45 announced that the war on the opioid epidemic and he went on a site preliminary research that suggests that cannabis is linked to the reduction and help your dependence weight is legal Frank also referenced 45 recent declaration of emergency so hopefully this works you know that's that's a nice start that's cool yeah and it's good that it cuz you know Republicans are always talking about things need to come from the private sector things need to come from the private sector and this is something completely completely different [Music] hi I'm ELISA um I go to Wash U law I'm in the vaccine litigation office and thank you for doing this so statistically guns kill significantly more people than marijuana does homicides suicides deaths through accidents a lot of them when kids are in the home you support pretty harsh policies for marijuana and pretty laxed gun control laws I'm not even sure where you stand on the assault weapons ban so I'd like to know since guns kill more people than marijuana why lacks laws on one well that's uh apples and oranges on a question I would say first and foremost but the Second Amendment you aware that guarantees a right to the American people to keep and bear arms and I intend to defend that Second Amendment it's as valid as the First Amendment and so that's my basic philosophical view about it look there's this view that marijuana is harmless and it does no damage I believe last year was the first year that automobile accidents that occurred were found to have been caused more by drugs than by alcohol marijuana is not a healthy substance in my opinion the American Medical Association is crystal clear on that you believe that okay so doctor whatever your name is so you can write the AMA and see why they think otherwise and to me so we need to have a little education program here's not necessarily the Department of Justice primary role the ONDCP what they used to call it drugs are used to drive the message of what the science is these drugs but I don't think America is gonna be a better place if marijuana is sold in every corner grocery store and as what happened in Colorado the yeast particularly young people went up dramatically I don't think that's something people didn't seem to mind really hammering tobacco which is a long-term health problem for people but I think likewise we should be talking about some of the dangers of marijuana so in here Thank You Jess session is pretty much advocating there just because it's the Second Amendment people can't we shouldn't expect any type of enforcement or changing gun laws all right he's a strong advocate a Second Amendment he believes just equal to the first name but that's that's not fair but even there we but we need regulation on gun laws to where more people don't get killed more children he and the sad thing is after Sandy Hook no type of action was taken even after this one you had two back-to-back shootings when in Las Vegas one in Texas at the church and nothing has happened after the either one of these shootings nothing I mean you know unfortunately that it feels like commonplace but yet marijuana he's trying to enforce the law is so tough right and increase in him imposed these extremely harsh penalties right which makes absolutely no sense going back to a draconian day I think you know guys like Jeff Sessions you know by way that's why I said you should have a shirt I'm gonna get one yeah thank you you know they just in it for the money and whoever's paying him someone's paying or he just doesn't like we know he just doesn't like marijuana he doesn't like cannabis but I can see that there would be plenty of pharmaceutical money and that and so I get it you know if he works for I saw a picture of somebody on them everybody knows everybody care you know everybody could win though government wins pharmaceuticals can we how can pursue taboos win because you can develop medicines based out of cannabis with the companies that are winning now probably won't be doing that yes they really yes they will yes they will who trust me they were either paying for it to be so that they create and line up everything that it is that they want so they're just getting more time look at it we know that cannabis has medicinal effects we know that Israel does a lot of work in medicinal cannabis research we know they're Mexico has legalized for medicinal cannabis use we know that Canada has been had medicinal cannabis use and now is moving to a full-scale legalization we know that Jamaica has medical medical tourism canna tourism so you can go there with a prescription from a different country and still be able to get your meds yeah so so companies can we farmers can win the little person can win like this everybody can we know I'm not gonna lie to you I am highest it I was just like a child with me yo man yeah this is what we do man I'm just looking forward to the day where you know I'm traveling I was looking at the the world like you know some of the world's coolest places to travel and I just like damn I got to start traveling the world that's a must do [ __ ] so where's some places that you want to go through I thought um oh wait we did this I'm like one of our first episode oh yeah I think we did do something like this acts of our ladies that we wanted to smoke out and stuff yeah that's true I'm curious now as to what are some places that you would like to smoke well there are some places uh you know do by how much smoking - bye okay no I'm saying New Zealand be somewhere else you know why loser they say it's like you know there's a place in New Zealand that's like the adventure capital of the world like it touched by something like that go parachuting and all type of stuff they had these uh like these they call it cabin dairy I think it's like these caves water it's kind of dangerous I wouldn't really want to do it but why not they have some date you know some some light stuff you can do so it's kind of cool like you know some light stuff but I wouldn't be doing it all out [ __ ] cuz I say you can get a mowing you're doing it's not a sport sometime no [ __ ] like the cowboys and Indians had to do it to get to these caves and [ __ ] the swim you know not New Zeeland bro you said Museum yeah I'm past that already but wait no how did this [ __ ] right yeah I guess in my mind I'm I just flip the page you know there [ __ ] that was a runoff city yeah it's I think run our story okay okay okay okay so New Zealand is the parachuting in a venture capital according to this magazine yeah then you say caverns yeah that nice thing too right there oh I thought that the caverns were there in New Zealand along with the parachute they might be they may be but sorry see this is confused that's cool all right now a new thing here Himalayas you know going through the Himalayas is another thing why the Himalayas we know they had a nice little culture and they're you know they got the mountains this year type of culture you know they got like yeah execute we are on I'll have to Britain hey man you bro I can't recall this is great hey man I'll bring the magazine next time okay next episode cuz I mean yeah there's it was not a little some really beautiful [ __ ] because look at the story is this how I was playing then I mean this but this is real [ __ ] though like I'm not making this [ __ ] up I was looking at this [ __ ] in the magazine you know saying while I was waiting on my my [ __ ] from Whole Foods making my smoothie girl forgot about my [ __ ] actually that's why I had time to look through the whole magazine you know saying this I paid my money you know I'm saying aye aye man look something that's been helping me like for everybody before we go on the show like you know I'm saying like drinking these smoothies or whatever they may be [ __ ] kind of uptown yeah Whole Foods it's like a Carol spinach some other [ __ ] I'll be putting hemp seeds in my [ __ ] you know I'm saying I'll be tasting the kind of tasted like a little you know there's some some but I'll be drinking like this [ __ ] for breakfast right I would get the large I drink it for breakfast like it hold me over to lunch and [ __ ] this [ __ ] tastes good as [ __ ] and it's a and I just other place I went to Karl juice land they got [ __ ] called cushion Oh Dre bro that [ __ ] tastes good it's [ __ ] you smoke so I plan on going clean 2018 my last episode I told you I was gonna probably try to start trying other books you know saying doctor save you said three or four months back the doctor say he said three or four months and takes the cleaning out your body you know saying you know I'm saying so it's time to get strong too y'all so so you know smoking in 2018 ah yeah yeah no marijuana whatsoever ah probably like edibles and things like that you don't smoke every now saying I getting clean what like how are you defining getting clean right you got you gotta clear it out but how are you defining the word getting clean how what does getting clean mean to you just getting clean mean obviously it doesn't mean completely no drug use I can see consider marijuana drug maybe that's on there that's the solid you're just quitting but smoke but smoking definitely smoking in definitely clean you know I would definitely hold off on the weed for intake for at least again three to four months on everything anything that could be you know like you know hinderance to this complete clean clarity so clean with me know we'd also and that three or four months now after again some edibles and things like that okay yeah because you running together again okay yes better like that's fair I would be clean but I'ma be on edibles but my way what the [ __ ] now after three or four months bro for the three or four months to completely clear it out this will be interesting it will be this will be interesting it will I think it'll be a very interesting that added in certain dimensions of the show I've already been kind of cutting back on the smoke and I was smoking more papers and [ __ ] I haven't smoked a blunt and I'm down there a week but I just do too much they're not they're uncalled for it really in my eyes but that's only because I smoked by myself and I'm good with a paper that's my butt muscle you can do it [ __ ] I forgot the stop by smoke shopping pick up some more papers especially gonna say if we got the mention our sponsors oh no but looking at the time the most about their time shout out to the sponsors the professional Blackstone there yeah XIV grams is this show and you do that professional break starting their sponsor along with protocol vaccine coach to Seattle [Music] absolutely [Music]", "GgDCsqN75V8": "alright man we got some gg4 here I mean it's a week old about two weeks old Oh mom I mean then we got this one over here this one's about a month old almost about three three-and-a-half weeks I mean we got Gigi and then we got this one right here Gigi for me and then we got over here we got something it's supposed to be kay-kay I don't believe it's KK I believe dude you know he's talking about but he gave me new was messed up I mean I had problems in my solo like I said before and he's my first girl man I don't really know what I'm feeling I mean just throw some seeds in the ground meat all day girl pretty much I mean we got up here we got another plant that someone gave me and they [ __ ] up this one's in flower she's healthy you know just gave her food like yesterday [Music] [Music]", "ZNhCtXlQ9Fw": "thank you Chris while they're getting into the presentation ready for question I just want to say because does some really amazing work because one of the main things with organic farming as you own though using the word organic is really tough so there's a lot of people out there that think that they potentially are farming organically and unfortunately they're not cuz they're yeah there's a lot of people that are not as informed so he's a great wealth of resource of information our next presenter is Miss Kristin ibadallah she's a pioneer of our industry she co-founded the EGA she's a director of the patient resource verification program I might mess that up good well I'm I am the director of patient for the certification which is a project of Americans for safe access so we are a non-profit third-party certification program that's based on standards that were produced for the botanical and nutraceutical industry so the products Association and the American Oklahoma copia to develop guidelines for this program my presentation is a little different in that I what we are not a sustainability certification and we don't sort of a certified to organics we're more of a product safety workers safety standardization of medicine program we do a lot of Education as well it is a component of the program that all staff has to be educated and one of the education programs that we like to offer is on sustainability so generally this presentation takes me about an hour and a half to get through I have deleted vast portions of it and even with an hour and a half we could talk forever about sustainability and what I'd like to do is challenge you to look at it as a way of thinking a practice in life right there's so many facets and components to how we move forward as a sustainable entity or farm on this planet that it's really looking at the broad spectrum of all of our impacts so we're just going to start willing to talk a little bit about appropriate and available planting spaces some of you know I think what Chris had really resonates that we don't have the flat land right Humboldt flat is always sloping so as we're setting up our gardens making sure that we're using as much naturally flat area as we can and that we aren't cultivating beyond what property allows us to do space terrain is gonna be a part of that water is gonna be a second huge component in that piece this is where we find ourselves getting out of balance here if we are creating our own flat spaces make sure to do professional engineering of those flats were creating work with a licensed contractor to execute the plan we talk to your native soils right if your gardening somewhere scrape your native soils off due to your engineered flat building put them back on and then go back and cover the bare earth before we have rains sedum with native grasses and that's really important not just to keep the sediment out of the waterways but to keep the nutrients out of the waterways as you're building up your garden this is really what not to do all of the really ugly hideous examples of someone who do not engineer their flat most likely did it by themselves didn't cover any of the barriers back up the rains came and you can see the big ditches that were created and above them beyond the lack of responsible action that happened we also see which is less noticeable that the locks have been kind of Jax trout over the hillside here and they actually buried another way so you know we're gonna move away from the sis regulations come in and you know the second big factor to how much you grow is how much water do you have because it's not about finding the water when you're in the late part of the season and something you're like oh no I can't draw water from my spring anymore or it's dry and my resources are gone so I'm going to ship water it's not staying within the carrying capacity of your land right plan for what you plant because you know how much water you can store and you're going to water a bunch of that area that you're planting so you know exactly what you use it's just going to be like and then you're going to plan appropriately right and as far as water used to reduce it you know cannabis is a vert escape plan and what we've really moved into is a heavy feeding heavy over water usage with this plant and a lot of that is unnecessary so we can plant in the ground we've kind of been a culture of planting in pots right and as we can as we build soil and we move our plants into the ground we conserve water please don't overwater I think I love the product that Casey talked about that's one of my favorite 1/2 inch drip emitter embedded water products from dripworks get your drip irrigation together and make sure that you're using it appropriately this isn't a flood and dry crop this is a you know multiple shorter cycles for irrigation are going to reduce your water use they're going to make your crop happier you're going to have better results and you're going to be more environmentally friendly and mulch right IH build healthy soil we've built healthy soil we have more ability to be dry consistent and you know again storing your water if you look like multiple different things I do want to say if you're going to use these pillow bladders make sure you have fun some you know we don't want critters getting into them they're easy to chew through and you can always collect rainwater right rainwater is amazing the fact that one inch of rain on a thousand square feet of roof service surface equals 600 gallons it's pretty phenomenal you can really rack up some rainwater storage so it can look like this in tanks it can come off a roof it can look like ponds right and also think about how you interact with your water resources in a sense of making sure that you're always protecting them make sure you store your fertilizers or pesticides your mediums and your other gardening chemicals properly right there should be away from water sources they should be in a very dry and enclosed area so that the rain water isn't getting into them and washing them into any of your waterways and cover crop your beds you know I mentioned it a little bit taking care of your soil but cover crop your beds close them up with soil with I mean I'm sorry with leaves or with mulch over the winter to keep those nutrients and that soil in place right especially if you're turning regularly if you're a soil turner I it gets loose and really need to take the right actions to get there in the beds it's a big investment you don't want to lose in it and don't allow water whether it's clear water or nutrient water you don't want any of this water overflowing out of your tanks this picture here is a little shoddy but it is the only picture I really have them a float valve it just looks like the giant valve in the back of your toilet but much bigger your tank fills the water intake turns on that water stays in the ground which is the best place for it to be stored so you know simple little tricks can go a long way and then overflowing nutrient tanks you never want to do that it's a really easy source or way to contaminate ground water so if you're going to put nutrients in a water tank of any you just cannot do it without ever go about in it I would recommend I never recommend doing that carbon footprint this comes up a lot right in carbon footprint he doesn't just mean our energy use it means I'm as far as the lights are concerned means our energy use as far as how much travel does it take us to get our supplies to our location and how our supply is created and so it's a larger conversation right it's the total sets of greenhouse gas emissions caused by an organization and event a product or a person that's huge and all-encompassing so our my products my names right and the products we've used renewed recycled and just to go back a little bit and talk about electricity specifically I mean I think this is a good reminder that in 2011 according to dr. Evan no study energy up in smoke you know the u.s. spends about five billion dollars in electricity to produce and distribute cannabis that's pretty huge and if you look at the emissions that that resulted in it would be about 17 tons of greenhouse gas and breaks something like that down you're talking about a kilogram which is about 2.2 pounds you know equaling about 2.8 tons of co2 and making your joint you may have had this morning as a patient to Medicaid they put them about 2 pounds of greenhouse gas some of what's interesting about this is it got broken down into kind of categories within the industry graduate lighting ventilation and airconditioning you know close to 70% or more of the actual carbon footprint that you calculated we can do really easy things to reduce those factors alone indoors we have packed lighting oftentimes because we're making up for the Sun when we move into greenhouses we start to reduce that and when we move into what we tend to see more often here in the hills greenhouses that are off the grid right so here this greenhouse is vented with roll-up sides and the fans are powered by solar the other thing about this greenhouse as you are it's off with grumbling this entire greenhouse here is also from the winter and it's not using electricity but when we also when we select our mediums but we're going to cultivate in and what kind of methods we're going to use we want to be mindful of that as well as we talked about a little bit earlier soil investment your medium investment this is a disposable investment right these aren't disposable commodities and they're expensive propagation materials such as Oasis and doesn't really break down in the environment we don't exactly know what it's me of its carcinogenic rockwool well it's made from a natural substance doesn't break down and peat plugs well this photo here well hard to put it into scale it's about a 14 foot deep hole and it's a peat bog that's being - it's not going to come back right so if you're buying these products I mean I think having some images like this with some thoughts about what it does at the location that the product came from having that in mind is helpful and knowing that it's it's never going to come back so you really need to cherish those products all with a lot of products are mine right Pete parlez Coco core is a byproduct but generally shipped into our region from very very far away right we aren't necessarily known for coconut producers here so it has its own carbon footprint because of shipping associated with it so what do we do you know we do our best to reduce reuse and recycle if you are following a clean green or organic standard of cultivation and you're not using synthetic fertilizers your medium is likely going to improve over time as opposed to be reduced to having to be thrown out over time so really the more you can do to take care of your soil the more you're going to do to take care of the environment and the planet here so beyond that purchased local products when you can write shipping soil compete from all over the world it's not helping us to move to sustainability even if those products are organic ok so I maintain and improve the soil it will take care of you in a much better way with each planting add compost back in you know you've got food scraps coming you've got brush scraps from your place put it into a compost pile sit back into your soil it brings in tons of beneficials and helps reduce your disease issues it recycles amendments and fertilizers you know one of the things that I think happens with the cannabis industry because the questions have not been asked and there's been very brilliant marketing on behalf of fertilizers or nutrient companies is that there's this idea that more is better right more fertilizers and more nutrients do not make your product better and so there's nothing about cannabis that requires additional nutrients based above and beyond what the recommendation is from the manufacturer it's just not worth that and liquid nutrients very water slide will right they're suspended so as we're pouring them into our Gardens we really need to be mindful about we can stick with a lot of dry fertilizers amendments manures green manures just like other farmers and some of these are going to be your most effective and most cost reducing and most sustainable options over fertilizing really can need to crop health issues the try this molds excessive vegetative growth and lying products really want to avoid those as much as you can I mean folks chemists industry and quantum has been really popular over the years Phil see bird and bat guano and people should know what's happening to these species so as sea bird and bat guano is being mined out of these caves were losing whole species of bats those caves are never coming back landscapes and islands are being decimated and then we're shipping them overseas thousands of thousands of miles and they're in absolutely no way renewable so we're actually destroying whole ecosystems using guano Center industry and that's not the only one right we look at these mine minerals so I will just encourage you to think about limiting your use of those products and be mindful about other choices fertilizers that are based on food scraps where food leftovers are really great fish byproducts rice hulls name seed meal feather meal and not everything is going to be available in an organic format but just you know down to earth is a huge resource your local garden stores are a huge resource and you don't have to use the same fertilizer every year right I would encourage you to price what's available look at what's most organic source what's locally into as you can to make the best choices staying within the range of what you need for your to successful crop and then he brings us back to crop diversity right I think Casey talked a lot about this and I really love what she's seen amber and other farmers in the area are doing there it's cannabis and it's other crops and its food its flowers its herbs and these are home studs that folks are used to having what they need in their garden between whether it's vegetable and culinary edible fruit for the mature you name it and when we look at crop diversity we do practices like poly culture and permaculture and we bring in companion plants which act as indicators in our garden they can tell us where disease is starting to come on and we can start to really mitigate it they also bring in our beneficials and as we have these other crops in our garden and they bring in beneficial insects they help to mitigate the pests that we don't want on our campus plants or out of their crops so you know plant and crop diversity helps to create a healthy ecological environment and that's really what we're looking to do as farmers right we don't want to push against Mother Nature we want to encourage all the benefits that she brings to the table and work within and what she has to offer and help support not just what's happening in the flora and fauna around our farm but what's happening right in our farms and agricultural total space so with that very much biotech and mechanization where the world there really has been a shift in the last two to three years with a seminal report by the United Nations Commission on Trade and Development being published in 2013 called wake up before it's too late how small farms in sustainable agriculture will feed the world in a changing climate and I wonder if the three of you could address the issue of scale from the certifiers perspectives bigger farms versus smaller scale how are those impacting what you're seeing in the certification and secondly how the small cannabis farms may play into this larger transition that civilization needs to make to restore stable agriculture yeah so first of all things I'd like to start by discussing this idea that well obviously as soon as it's legal all the real farmers are going to grow in the Central Valley and we're out of a job you know cannabis cultivation if you look at third-world countries they can grow stuff on hillsides they do lots of terracing so I think that there's a tremendous potential for us to figure out how small farms are going to be functional in the future for us without cannabis we would not grow vegetables the work is too hard the pay is too little so for us it has been this very crucial fulcrum that has enabled us to support the community and move forward as farmers build our business and be able to work for the future and so you know again it's this question of are we cheating or is this something that's viable and I think it's totally viable and I think there's a very interesting question of terroir you can grow a million pounds of grapes in Fresno but nobody knows about Fresno wines so there's something special that happens in the climates around here and we grow a special kind of cannabis and it's it's special in its world we now and so the question is how do we as farmers set an example for the future and say we've been able to make this happen for ourselves we need regulation that's going to honor us and allow this to continue so that small farms everywhere can have this as a support tool it's a crucial tool in the belt small farms need every bit of support they can get so I you know tantor speak to mr. Kynaston I wanted to mention that I'm a huge fan of intensive planting right so as where I'm working with multiple types of crops one of the ways we see small farms become really successful is when they use their space very wisely so we have cannabis for example can be a very long-term annual whereas lettuce and and kale can be a short-term annuals so planting food crops in between your cannabis plants if you're doing a very long term season for cannabis as opposed to like that for something like that it's going to help make your farm and your space more efficient and that's how we're you know it's what just one of the ways we're going to move forward with having these very sustainable smaller farms I think you touched on some really important points but I think what we see available as far as practices with no-till reduced inputs small cars really embodies that when we get into large industrial egg we're time saving we're cost cutting where we're plowing fields were applying trailer loads of nutrients at a time and in the smaller firm studying we are canta caring for the environment and that's a huge difference as far as public of reaction we get from that environment and what kind of footprint we leave on my environment good thank you well I could pick the easy answer in the door the anyway the easy answer is God bless the small farmer in and they're wonderful and the Sun rises and falls on them the honest answer is how many people walk through the aches eight section of the Safeway and look for the cheapest takes probably a lot of us the person said you know like a firm and Ramon said well you know in Vermont we grow we have dairies like this yeah but Vermont doesn't feed the world California's Itza we're big isn't necessarily bad biggest broad you know but we sitting in America for example you know but so we can't just say biggest bad smells good there will not be big egg agriculture of any kind really in the hilly marginal counties there are absolutely going to be small micro climates that grow the perfect wine the best canvas and when we grow the best cannabis is in the world so the answer is and if you're asking me I come from a small farm I grew up this small farm I build a small farm I raise my kids in a small farm I worked my ass off on a small farm like my small farm got run over by the government that's what kicked me into law school so I live and breathe and eat small farms how can they prepare to move into the future I think that one of the best mechanisms is the mechanisms that's used by small farmers in every crop you know it's the coop the agricultural cooperatives already established in California this is why I keep saying let's get back to what's already established for California agriculture you know I put myself through college growing up working on avocado orchards small avocado orchards were able to take their small avocados down to Cabo now Kalama was able to maneuver and market in the larger world's small farmers in the Emerald triangle have a excellent opportunity to band together so that when they go when it becomes legal and when you're looking at a buyer that says we want twenty thousand pounds of cannabis they don't have to talk to a thousand different growers they can talk to or to co-op representatives and fanuc of an agricultural co-op is one that were like four avocados when we were growing for Cabo we know how much it costs to process the avocados we know how much Bob was getting paid to drive the truck we know because it's transparent and with that transparency you build confidence and and and comfort with that level and the other thing though is that if we grew good avocados so they got processed we've got a better rating and a better value if the next person didn't grow up with avocados they got a lower grade II didn't it so everybody is able to me the money that the product is worth in a cooperative model but you're now able to walk to a much larger table and compete with you know these hypothetical you know large growers that are going to move and they will move in and one example is I've got a green house grower in Santa Barbara County he's got 40 acres of greenhouses that are abandoned because roses and orchids not going to telephone you very much anymore as soon as Candida he's a farm family farmer he's a small family farmer but he built everything himself now as soon as cannabis becomes legal he already knows about permits he already knows about pesticide use he already knows about all this and is going to be able to grow top quality cannabis in a year or two because he grew top quality workers and roses so you know we the people that do not get on the training now will be left behind and at the very first stop there's a whole bunch of people that are very qualified that are ready to get on so there's small farmers in our areas the boutique and the high quality I think is what's going to keep them in the game and then working with their neighbors for you know co-op centers one last thing sorry liquid fertilizer is not only transporting that the fertilizer but she also shipping ninety five percent water so liquid fertilizers is not and the reason why there's interest in this now in the cannabis is because the market the price is coming down so as the price comes down people need to look for standard agricultural firm I think so shipping water from Europe never made sense so thank you I'm the moderator on the last panel today finally talk about labor and that's an equally important variable in terms of scale production and my experience is not in the marijuana industry it's a panoply of legal crop industries which are completely dominated in California throughout the US by huge large scale producers often billionaire financiers who never even go to the farms who hire everything out and who have led to the sort of labor issues that are in the headlines every day and that are a never-ending source of problem the fact is that if we allow large scale producers to take over this industry in California they will through their power while political connections etc they will marginalize this industry and there has to be protections structured into legalization to protect small-scale growers or it will go the way of the agribusiness model elsewhere not only is that very harmful to the environment including even the so called large scale organic producers but they're terrible with their labor with the conditions for labor in their workplaces and so we really need to protect small-scale growers now under the legalization process because otherwise it's going to be little dozed away for me I just love it like oh you know guys are gonna fire up acres of OG give it a bad see how it wakes up we hold it down for craft and maintain our quality that's what it's about Chris is dead-on with the cooperative I'm a little leery of the agricultural cooperative for the time being because cannabis is not a crop so my thinking has tended towards a marketing services co-op which says we represent our fine farmer members we help them navigate the world and sell their products to find Medical dispensaries and now that's without actually taking possession of a product and without violating federal law as it moves I just want to say we've been advised by counsel that cannabis cannot be currently organized into a cooperative given the lack of regulatory certainty on the issue so the agricultural co-op is one of the market incentives that small farmers have existing in the state and it's unclear from our perspective if that's an incentive program we have access to we're asking for it they're definitely advocating number one it's it's specifically mentioned under the culture the Attorney General guidelines as a mechanism and but the other thing is that what I like is it can operate as a nonprofit as well and what I try to tell my farmers now is that get them to start getting them set up now because 2/16 is coming around something's going to change it's mandated you know it's it's a protected category in California it's gonna take a year a year and a half to get a co-op up and functioning your orange your standard meetings work with your other crops your aggregate crops trying to get them in the market so that way you're already up and rolling when it is see then that's exactly what I got into it with I was like I'm gonna do agricultural crop cooperative we grow vegetables this is great and then I realize ninety percent of my farmers weren't ready to sell other crops and that it really was just going to be a cannabis cooperative but at that point is that you know I don't know that this is the best move forward for us and so because we thought about it a lot and an agricultural cooperative scares me for the time being I think you know it's this question of are we exciting innovators stepping forward into a thing that we want to be totally legit about or are we gonna ask permission later and you know traditionally our culture has asked permission later but in this instance I feel that it's it's very dangerous I'm and then just one quick addition that I think I mean Casey kind of touched on it a little bit when you talked about the fields or the acreage of OG in the Central Valley some of that's going to happen right but we have a marketplace with patients and soon adult consumers that's very diverse and one of the things that's really expanding amongst that marketplace are these concentrated and product development pieces that are coming forward flowers that are produced in a crop way don't generally make it into those products some of their flower by-product does and that's really what we have here in these small terroir or farming communities is really high-end flower product our byproducts can go into making other products but these fast feels that they are likely to see in the Central Valley are probably primarily going to be used for product production and less so for individual flower or high-end recognizing the market forces so it comes to play here in terms of some of the big companies and such personally I think that you know based on all the other industries that we have in Carmel County we compete my specialization and that means that you know we haven't you know we depend on there being big guys out there they're doing in a different way to help differentiate ourselves in the marketplace so yes please let's have big agriculture goons all in place also the exams themselves does amazing problem yeah but product but the question I have is when we talk about what detect our small farmers who might have you know have it all be about a small farmers here in Humboldt County as a way to differentiate I've never heard anyone define a small farmer and every word I've always been in the big guys always loves someone bigger than me thank you so what I do guys okay I think in the California you apply if you register with the California Department of Food magan's apartment they're gonna ask you what your gross income is and they're gonna bill you according to that so a small farmer has already been established in California we don't have to make up that and if we make up our own definition and we go to the state the Kenai well that's cool but this is actually what it is so the small farmers already been described in California because we already have a tiered fee structure so that I think it's already established but one thing I do think for the large-scale farms I don't think they're ever gonna be able to grow the quality you're right you know they're not gonna be able to grow the money but we were talking about what we couldn't do especially in this job area is we could say you can only throw the cannabis that you can store the water for now that would essentially put a kibosh on with you I don't think we're gonna be able to say you can't have big farmers we're not gonna be able to say that you can't say that you know but you know because everybody has the right to grow what everything again but you can say the regulations require that you have to be able to catch all the water or store all the water that you can use and we could put mechanisms in the regulatory structure that would make it difficult for large farmers to get into the game and the numbers we've been playing with is 5,000 is a craft and 5,000 square foot is craft and 10,000 is small less than 10,000 small less than 5,000 is crafted that's total canopy so you know for instance if you measure you know a hundred seven by seven would be 49 hundred square feet so that you know just to give you like a range there weren't any heritage farms bigger than 5,000 square feet between the choppers so we figured five thousand square feet would cover all of the heritage farms and then five to ten would provide a what do you call it the streamlined process for you know slightly smaller or slightly larger than heritage and then a month 10,000 was requiring the full of dollar square foot licensing fee along what full sequel I don't the egg Commission we're doing to them contact the county and commissioner and Delano you you know the problem with a revenue-raising point is price volatility as we transition and during the transition period it would probably be good to steer away from a revenue breaking point for small and stick with an area in production because we don't know what's going to happen with the price but you apply every year so it changes every year and then I think it's going to be very difficult to go to the state and argue a different format and other what they've been using for you know many many years so you know every agricultural crop is good years and bad years tradition informational can you tell us what the criteria are for determining small farmers well as far as I understand it it's simply income 10:55 motherly breaky so 250 is less than 1500 it's $50 well kind of pick this is little bit baked and they'll have its over broken down rates fee schedules in those days it's like if you make a million or less you're a small farmer do you get permits anything so professionals yeah we go thank partners so collect permit Israel vegetables to grow this is great because you're him $15 have a nice day and like I've talked to the AG commissioner mando he's pretty much like I'm not touching anything so it comes down from on high and I was like well can you bump me up the chain he was like no and I was like what if I write a letter will you look at it it was like I look at it I'll give you some cops but they want their there all gunshot everybody's doing somebody tell us on for long I have a permit for your non cannabis speaking of the microphone Chris this target area we going to see the FFA meetings every year for our organic company and for the past four years I brought up cannabis parties and every single time they say we are and there's the head of the California Department food and there's a head of the California processed foods department every year at these meetings past four years they said we are absolutely ready to move in to regulate this new industry as soon as we are tasked with it so they have not been tasked with it but when they do they're from I did have not gotten the indication that they're going to ask us what we think I think they're going to be able to move it right into the existing regulatory framework which you know does provide a lot of protections first of all the best way to get into the sustainability framework is to take a permaculture design course it's it will change your life 10 years ago and it absolutely changed my life and it does everything that Kristen's recommended secondly if somebody really wants legitimatize the business my there is a way to do that with the IRS and Casey you're right on with your vegetable farming because in order to take advantage of federal tax law you all you can deduct you the expenses of your soil and the cost of all your vegetables etc as part of your working expense so if you set yourself up properly through the legal ways of the IRS there is lots of ways that you can benefit as a business buying multi cropping and having other products as well that may be offshoots of the cannabis that's how we dodged the 2ae because we know everything is for vegetables the cannabis to society cannabis is kind of the invisible but you know you just declare everything the right way and my husband is a specialist in taxation so he does this a lot in Wake County but I mean the last thing is what is the cost of the certification I know I imagine it's a sliding scale but the Queen grade certification actually gets $2,500 a year and that includes every farmer every year it gets a three hundred a hundred and fifty pesticide screen from a federally licensed agriculture lab on-site inspection its we follow the same criteria sames starts as we do with our National Organic Program which is actually a little bit more expensive but it's not you don't so for the cannabis the inspector we incur all the expenses the inspector is a separate from the person that makes the reviewer we've got three master's degrees on our staff of sustainable farming of sustainable dairy growth master's degree process engineer so the inspector the low person goes out and protects the farm work since of the report so we have separate set of eyes reviewing it so that I can't say great Casey looks great give me my money here's a thing so we maintain all of those protocols in place and then nothing gets done and the profile doesn't move forward until we get a hundred percent clean pesticide screening back people people mistakenly think I'm making a fortune on this figures like 20 grand I will say that it throws in a talkative attorney that works in medical cannabis compliance so it's a little bit of a different program so the Aces certification includes two inspections so we do a pre certification inspection of the facility and we have the ability to certify in cultivation and processing as well as distribution of lab testing and manufacturing so our every staff whether they're volunteer or paid person is required to go through training not just a medical cannibis training talking about the history the federal laws the type of products that patients may or adult users may be consuming or looking for but also a state legal training so we cover local and state compliance as well as the training to make sure that those entities are adhering to the American travelpod Association and the American herbal pharmacopoeia guidelines the certification program ace the certification program is in some ways for farmers definitely more rigid or tighter than an organic certification so our pesticide protocols are not Amarillo or organic they are however a tolerance accept so the only products legal to use or able to be verified under the PFC program are those that are currently tolerance exempt list which is now what's required in California for cannabis farmers and the program is a little more expensive because it includes two audits so we have a pre certification on it and then about six months after certification happens we come back with a surprise audit to make sure that compliance is still underway Farms also an entities within the ISA program also have to have written SOPs employee manuals so folks have to bring their businesses their cameras businesses up to a standard of operation that is akin to botanical nutraceutical industry and so the farming piece is based on what we would see Department of Agriculture use for crops produced for human consumption so I said it on one of the 9.31 program down in Mendocino County and every time you go in from the a committee or talk to the same guy probably you talk to give you a package of the bolar to do the same bottom line with me and so one of the things that he brought out that really I bag is that if we give an extra minute if I mention that we would all have to meet you know Disability Act standards so that's funny thing to be thinking about that there also had to be a protocol for what was going to be the process of giving you know bro protocol etc well we do home testify training so like right now the Department of pesticide regulations in California just release pesticide protocols for cannabis specifically and so we do cover that in trainings in DC we are approved by the government in DC to provide trainings for medical campus facilities to meet those requirements so it really just depends on whether or not the entity who is requiring the training approves the curriculum that we have that orbit than Humboldt County as the standard that we wanted to dispatch or lurking if you ask me whatever no I said we don't that it depends on how many employees you have how big your business is family farm the Department of pesticide regulation just released a statement maybe two and a half weeks ago is it online I couldn't find out the details so basically what you can use is a very short list right it's those products that are deemed tolerance exempt so sulfur is in there bacillus subtilis the solicitor in Genesis the essential oil products mean is on that list and they did release it in the form of us management practices which i think is really nice it identifies some of the pest issues that we might be dealing with as cannabis farmers and then products that we can use what they did is they and it's the same that a National Organic Program for ASA or the Gingrey program you're only allowed to use products that come from EPA list I think it's number three or five inertness and that inert list is called grass generally recognized as safe so when what we've been educating our farmers is that there are no registered pesticides or insecticides or milta sites for cannabis there are none and so what we've done is we limit that to those pesticides and insecticides that use EPA lists and with three or five which is grass generally recognized as safe and those are roses and everything that's allowed under the National Organic Program or standard so California cannot say we're going to allow you to use chemicals that are not registered for that particular crop unless the promoters rest", "MXaSCYbMR3A": "Wine is an alcoholic beverage made from fermented\ngrapes.Yeast consumes the sugar in the grapes and converts it to ethanol, carbon dioxide,\nand heat. Different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts produce different styles\nof wine. These variations result from the complex interactions between the biochemical\ndevelopment of the grape, the reactions involved in fermentation, the terroir, and the production\nprocess. Many countries enact legal appellations intended to define styles and qualities of\nwine. These typically restrict the geographical origin and permitted varieties of grapes,\nas well as other aspects of wine production. Wines not made from grapes include rice wine\nand fruit wines such as plum, cherry, pomegranate, currant and elderberry.\nWine has been produced for thousands of years. The earliest known traces of wine are from\nGeorgia (c.\u20096000 BC), Iran (c.\u20095000 BC), and Sicily (c.\u20094000 BC) although there is\nevidence of a similar alcoholic beverage being consumed earlier in China (c.\u20097000 BC).\nThe earliest known winery is the 6,100-year-old Areni-1 winery in Armenia. Wine reached the\nBalkans by 4500 BC and was consumed and celebrated in ancient Greece, Thrace and Rome. Throughout\nhistory, wine has been consumed for its intoxicating effects.Wine has long played an important\nrole in religion. Red wine was associated with blood by the ancient Egyptians and was\nused by both the Greek cult of Dionysus and the Romans in their Bacchanalia; Judaism also\nincorporates it in the Kiddush and Christianity in the Eucharist. == History == The earliest archaeological and archaeobotanical\nevidence for grape wine and viniculture, dating to 6000\u20135800 BC was found on the territory\nof modern Georgia. Both archaeological and genetic evidence suggest that the earliest\nproduction of wine elsewhere was relatively later, likely having taken place in the Southern\nCaucasus (which encompasses Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan), or the West Asian region\nbetween Eastern Turkey, and northern Iran.The earliest evidence of a grape-based fermented\ndrink was found in China (c.\u20097000 BC), Georgia from 6000 BC, Iran from 5000 BC, and Sicily\nfrom 4000 BC. The earliest evidence of a wine production facility is the Areni-1 winery\nin Armenia and is at least 6100 years old. A 2003 report by archaeologists indicates\na possibility that grapes were mixed with rice to produce mixed fermented beverages\nin China in the early years of the seventh millennium BC. Pottery jars from the Neolithic\nsite of Jiahu, Henan, contained traces of tartaric acid and other organic compounds\ncommonly found in wine. However, other fruits indigenous to the region, such as hawthorn,\ncannot be ruled out. If these beverages, which seem to be the precursors of rice wine, included\ngrapes rather than other fruits, they would have been any of the several dozen indigenous\nwild species in China, rather than Vitis vinifera, which was introduced there 6000 years later.The\nspread of wine culture westwards was most probably due to the Phoenicians who spread\noutward from a base of city-states along the Mediterranean coast of what are today Syria,\nLebanon, Israel, and Palestine. The wines of Byblos were exported to Egypt during the\nOld Kingdom and then throughout the Mediterranean. Evidence includes two Phoenician shipwrecks\nfrom 750 BC discovered by Robert Ballard, whose cargo of wine was still intact. As the\nfirst great traders in wine (cherem), the Phoenicians seem to have protected it from\noxidation with a layer of olive oil, followed by a seal of pinewood and resin, similar to\nretsina. Although the nuragic Sardinians already consumed wine before the arrival of the Phoenicians The earliest remains of Apadana Palace in\nPersepolis dating back to 515 BC include carvings depicting soldiers from Achaemenid Empire\nsubject nations bringing gifts to the Achaemenid king, among them Armenians bringing their\nfamous wine. Literary references to wine are abundant in\nHomer (8th century BC, but possibly relating earlier compositions), Alkman (7th century\nBC), and others. In ancient Egypt, six of 36 wine amphoras were found in the tomb of\nKing Tutankhamun bearing the name \"Kha'y\", a royal chief vintner. Five of these amphoras\nwere designated as originating from the king's personal estate, with the sixth from the estate\nof the royal house of Aten. Traces of wine have also been found in central Asian Xinjiang\nin modern-day China, dating from the second and first millennia BC. The first known mention of grape-based wines\nin India is from the late 4th-century BC writings of Chanakya, the chief minister of Emperor\nChandragupta Maurya. In his writings, Chanakya condemns the use of alcohol while chronicling\nthe emperor and his court's frequent indulgence of a style of wine known as madhu.The ancient\nRomans planted vineyards near garrison towns so wine could be produced locally rather than\nshipped over long distances. Some of these areas are now world-renowned for wine production.\nThe Romans discovered that burning sulfur candles inside empty wine vessels kept them\nfresh and free from a vinegar smell. In medieval Europe, the Roman Catholic Church supported\nwine because the clergy required it for the Mass. Monks in France made wine for years,\naging it in caves. An old English recipe that survived in various forms until the 19th century\ncalls for refining white wine from bastard\u2014bad or tainted bastardo wine. === Etymology === The English word \"wine\" comes from the Proto-Germanic\n*winam, an early borrowing from the Latin vinum, \"wine\" or \"(grape) vine\", itself derived\nfrom the Proto-Indo-European stem *win-o- (cf. Armenian: \u0563\u056b\u0576\u056b, gini; Ancient Greek:\n\u03bf\u1f36\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 oinos; Aeolic Greek: \u03dd\u03bf\u1fd6\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 woinos; Hittite: wiyana; Lycian: oino). The\nearliest attested terms referring to wine are the Mycenaean Greek \ud800\udc15\ud800\udc36\ud800\udc3a\ud800\udd00\ud800\udc1a\ud800\udc3a\nme-tu-wo ne-wo (*\u03bc\u03ad\u03b8\u03c5\u03dd\u03bf\u03c2 \u03bd\u03ad\u03dd\u1ff3), meaning \"in (the month)\" or \"(festival) of\nthe new wine\", and \ud800\udc3a\ud800\udc1c\ud800\udc37\ud800\udc34\ud800\udc2f wo-no-wa-ti-si, meaning \"wine garden\", written in Linear B\ninscriptions. Linear B also includes, inter alia, an ideogram for wine, i.e. \ud800\udc96.\nUltimate Indo-European origin of the word is the subject of continued debate. Some scholars\nhave noted the similarities between the words for wine in Indo-European languages (e.g.\nArmenian gini, Latin vinum, Ancient Greek \u03bf\u1f36\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2, Russian \u0432\u0438\u043d\u043e [v\u02b2\u026a\u02c8no]),\nKartvelian (e.g. Georgian \u10e6\u10d5\u10d8\u10dc\u10dd [\u0263vin\u0254]), and Semitic (*wayn; Hebrew \u05d9\u05d9\u05df\n[jaiin]), pointing to the possibility of a common origin of the word denoting \"wine\"\nin these language families. The Georgian word goes back to Proto-Kartvelian *\u0263wino-, which\nis either a borrowing from Proto-Indo-European or the lexeme was specifically borrowed from\nProto-Armenian *\u0263\u02b7einyo-, whence Armenian gini. An alternate hypothesis by F\u00e4hnrich\nsupposes *\u0263wino- a native Kartvelian word derived from the verbal root *\u0263un- ('to bend').\nSee *\u0263wino- for more. All these theories place the origin of the word in the same geographical\nlocation, Trans-Caucasia, that has been established based on archeological and biomolecular studies\nas the origin of viticulture. == Variants == === Red wine === The red-wine production process involves extraction\nof color and flavor components from the grape skin. Red wine is made from dark-colored grape\nvarieties. The actual color of the wine can range from violet, typical of young wines,\nthrough red for mature wines, to brown for older red wines. The juice from most purple\ngrapes is actually greenish-white; the red color comes from anthocyan pigments (also\ncalled anthocyanins) present in the skin of the grape; exceptions are the relatively uncommon\nteinturier varieties, which actually have red flesh and produce red juice. === White wine === Fermentation of the non-colored grape pulp\nproduces white wine. The grapes from which white wine is produced are typically green\nor yellow. Some varieties are well-known, such as the Chardonnay, Sauvignon, and Riesling.\nOther white wines are blended from multiple varieties; Tokay, Sherry, and Sauternes are\nexamples of these. Dark-skinned grapes may be used to produce white wine if the wine-maker\nis careful not to let the skin stain the wort during the separation of the pulp-juice. Pinot\nnoir, for example, is commonly used to produce champagne.\nDry (non-sweet) white wine is the most common, derived from the complete fermentation of\nthe wort. Sweet wines are produced when the fermentation is interrupted before all the\ngrape sugars are converted into alcohol. Sparkling wines, which are mostly white wines, are produced\nby not allowing carbon dioxide from the fermentation to escape during fermentation, which takes\nplace in the bottle rather than in the barrel. === Ros\u00e9 wine === A ros\u00e9 wine incorporates some of the color\nfrom the grape skins, but not enough to qualify it as a red wine. It may be the oldest known\ntype of wine, as it is the most straightforward to make with the skin contact method. The\npink color can range from a pale orange to a vivid near-purple, depending on the varietals\nused and wine-making techniques. There are three primary ways to produce ros\u00e9 wine:\nskin contact (allowing dark grape skins to stain the wort), saign\u00e9e (removing juice\nfrom the must early in fermentation and continuing fermentation of the juice separately), and\nblending (uncommon and discouraged in most wine growing regions). Ros\u00e9 wines can be\nmade still, semi-sparkling, or sparkling, with a wide range of sweetness levels from\ndry Proven\u00e7al ros\u00e9 to sweet White Zinfandels and blushes. Ros\u00e9 wines are made from a wide\nvariety of grapes all over the world. === Fruit wines === Wines from other fruits, such as apples and\nberries, are usually named after the fruit from which they are produced combined with\nthe word \"wine\" (for example, apple wine and elderberry wine) and are generically called\nfruit wine or country wine (not to be confused with the French term vin de pays). Other than\nthe grape varieties traditionally used for wine-making, most fruits naturally lack either\nsufficient fermentable sugars, relatively low acidity, yeast nutrients needed to promote\nor maintain fermentation, or a combination of these three characteristics. This is probably\none of the main reasons why wine derived from grapes has historically been more prevalent\nby far than other types, and why specific types of fruit wine have generally been confined\nto regions in which the fruits were native or introduced for other reasons. === Mead (honey wine) === Mead, also called honey wine, is created by\nfermenting honey with water, sometimes with various fruits, spices, grains, or hops. As\nlong as the primary substance fermented is honey, the drink is considered mead. Mead\nwas produced in ancient history throughout Europe, Africa and Asia, and was known in\nEurope before grape wine. === Starch-based \"wine\" and wine-based products\n=== Other beverages called \"wine\", such as barley\nwine and rice wine (e.g. sake), are made from starch-based materials and resemble beer more\nthan traditional wine, while ginger wine is fortified with brandy. In these latter cases,\nthe term \"wine\" refers to the similarity in alcohol content rather than to the production\nprocess. The commercial use of the English word \"wine\" (and its equivalent in other languages)\nis protected by law in many jurisdictions.Some UK supermarkets have been criticised for selling\n\u201cwine based\u201d drinks, which only contain 75% wine, but which are still marketed as\nwine. The International Organisation of Vine and Wine requires that a \"wine based drink\"\nmust contain a minimum of 75% wine, but producers do not have to divulge the nature of the remaining\n25%. == Grape varieties == Wine is usually made from one or more varieties\nof the European species Vitis vinifera, such as Pinot noir, Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon,\nGamay and Merlot. When one of these varieties is used as the predominant grape (usually\ndefined by law as minimums of 75% to 85%), the result is a \"varietal\" as opposed to a\n\"blended\" wine. Blended wines are not necessarily inferior to varietal wines, rather they are\na different style of wine-making.Wine can also be made from other species of grape or\nfrom hybrids, created by the genetic crossing of two species. V. labrusca (of which the\nConcord grape is a cultivar), V. aestivalis, V. rupestris, V. rotundifolia and V. riparia\nare native North American grapes usually grown to eat fresh or for grape juice, jam, or jelly,\nand only occasionally made into wine. Hybridization is different from grafting.\nMost of the world's vineyards are planted with European V. vinifera vines that have\nbeen grafted onto North American species' rootstock, a common practice due to their\nresistance to phylloxera, a root louse that eventually kills the vine. In the late 19th\ncentury, most of Europe's vineyards (excluding some of the driest in the south) were devastated\nby the infestation, leading to widespread vine deaths and eventual replanting. Grafting\nis done in every wine-producing region in the world except in Argentina, the Canary\nIslands and Chile\u2014the only places not yet exposed to the insect.In the context of wine\nproduction, terroir is a concept that encompasses the varieties of grapes used, elevation and\nshape of the vineyard, type and chemistry of soil, climate and seasonal conditions,\nand the local yeast cultures. The range of possible combinations of these factors can\nresult in great differences among wines, influencing the fermentation, finishing, and aging processes\nas well. Many wineries use growing and production methods that preserve or accentuate the aroma\nand taste influences of their unique terroir. However, flavor differences are less desirable\nfor producers of mass-market table wine or other cheaper wines, where consistency takes\nprecedence. Such producers try to minimize differences in sources of grapes through production\ntechniques such as micro-oxygenation, tannin filtration, cross-flow filtration, thin-film\nevaporation, and spinning cones. == Classification == Regulations govern the classification and\nsale of wine in many regions of the world. European wines tend to be classified by region\n(e.g. Bordeaux, Rioja and Chianti), while non-European wines are most often classified\nby grape (e.g. Pinot noir and Merlot). Market recognition of particular regions has recently\nbeen leading to their increased prominence on non-European wine labels. Examples of recognized\nnon-European locales include Napa Valley, Santa Clara Valley, Sonoma Valley, Anderson\nValley, and Mendocino County in California; Willamette Valley and Rogue Valley in Oregon;\nColumbia Valley in Washington; Barossa Valley in South Australia; Hunter Valley in New South\nWales; Luj\u00e1n de Cuyo in Argentina; Central Valley in Chile; Vale dos Vinhedos in Brazil;\nHawke's Bay and Marlborough in New Zealand; and in Canada, the Okanagan Valley of British\nColumbia, and the Niagara Peninsula and Essex County regions of Ontario are the three largest\nproducers. Some blended wine names are marketing terms\nwhose use is governed by trademark law rather than by specific wine laws. For example, Meritage\n(sounds like \"heritage\") is generally a Bordeaux-style blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, but\nmay also include Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot, and Malbec. Commercial use of the term Meritage\nis allowed only via licensing agreements with the Meritage Association. === European classifications === France has various appellation systems based\non the concept of terroir, with classifications ranging from Vin de Table (\"table wine\") at\nthe bottom, through Vin de Pays and Appellation d'Origine Vin D\u00e9limit\u00e9 de Qualit\u00e9 Sup\u00e9rieure\n(AOVDQS), up to Appellation d'Origine Contr\u00f4l\u00e9e (AOC) or similar, depending on the region.\nPortugal has developed a system resembling that of France and, in fact, pioneered this\nconcept in 1756 with a royal charter creating the Demarcated Douro Region and regulating\nthe production and trade of wine. Germany created a similar scheme in 2002, although\nit has not yet achieved the authority of the other countries' classification systems. Spain,\nGreece and Italy have classifications based on a dual system of region of origin and product\nquality. === Beyond Europe ===\nNew World wines\u2014those made outside the traditional wine regions of Europe\u2014are usually classified\nby grape rather than by terroir or region of origin, although there have been unofficial\nattempts to classify them by quality.According to Canadian Food and Drug Regulations, wine\nin Canada is an alcoholic beverage that is produced by the complete or partial alcoholic\nfermentation of fresh grapes, grape must, products derived solely from fresh grapes,\nor any combination of them. There are many materials added during the course of the manufacture,\nsuch as yeast, concentrated grape juice, dextrose, fructose, glucose or glucose solids, invert\nsugar, sugar, or aqueous solutions. Calcium sulphate in such quantity that the content\nof soluble sulphates in the finished wine shall not exceed 0.2 per cent weight by volume\ncalculated as potassium sulphate. Calcium carbonate in such quantity that the content\nof tartaric acid in the finished wine shall not be less than 0.15 per cent weight by volume.\nAlso, sulphurous acid, including salts thereof, in such quantity that its content in the finished\nwine shall not exceed 70 parts per million in the free state, or 350 parts per million\nin the combined state, calculated as sulphur dioxide. Caramel, amylase and pectinase at\na maximum level of use consistent with good manufacturing practice. Brandy, fruit spirit\nor alcohol derived from the alcoholic fermentation of a food source distilled to not less than\n94 per cent alcohol by volume. Prior to final filtration may be treated with a strongly\nacid cation exchange resin in the sodium ion form, or a weakly basic anion exchange resin\nin the hydroxyl ion form. == Vintages == In the United States, for a wine to be vintage-dated\nand labeled with a country of origin or American Viticultural Area (AVA; e.g., Sonoma Valley),\n95% of its volume must be from grapes harvested in that year. If a wine is not labeled with\na country of origin or AVA the percentage requirement is lowered to 85%.Vintage wines\nare generally bottled in a single batch so that each bottle will have a similar taste.\nClimate's impact on the character of a wine can be significant enough to cause different\nvintages from the same vineyard to vary dramatically in flavor and quality. Thus, vintage wines\nare produced to be individually characteristic of the particular vintage and to serve as\nthe flagship wines of the producer. Superior vintages from reputable producers and regions\nwill often command much higher prices than their average ones. Some vintage wines (e.g.\nBrunello), are only made in better-than-average years.\nFor consistency, non-vintage wines can be blended from more than one vintage, which\nhelps wine-makers sustain a reliable market image and maintain sales even in bad years.\nOne recent study suggests that for the average wine drinker, the vintage year may not be\nas significant for perceived quality as had been thought, although wine connoisseurs continue\nto place great importance on it. == Tasting == Wine tasting is the sensory examination and\nevaluation of wine. Wines contain many chemical compounds similar or identical to those in\nfruits, vegetables, and spices. The sweetness of wine is determined by the amount of residual\nsugar in the wine after fermentation, relative to the acidity present in the wine. Dry wine,\nfor example, has only a small amount of residual sugar. Some wine labels suggest opening the\nbottle and letting the wine \"breathe\" for a couple of hours before serving, while others\nrecommend drinking it immediately. Decanting (the act of pouring a wine into a special\ncontainer just for breathing) is a controversial subject among wine enthusiasts. In addition\nto aeration, decanting with a filter allows the removal of bitter sediments that may have\nformed in the wine. Sediment is more common in older bottles, but aeration may benefit\nyounger wines.During aeration, a younger wine's exposure to air often \"relaxes\" the drink,\nmaking it smoother and better integrated in aroma, texture, and flavor. Older wines generally\nfade (lose their character and flavor intensity) with extended aeration. Despite these general\nrules, breathing does not necessarily benefit all wines. Wine may be tasted as soon as the\nbottle is opened to determine how long it should be aerated, if at all. When tasting\nwine, individual flavors may also be detected, due to the complex mix of organic molecules\n(e.g. esters and terpenes) that grape juice and wine can contain. Experienced tasters\ncan distinguish between flavors characteristic of a specific grape and flavors that result\nfrom other factors in wine-making. Typical intentional flavor elements in wine\u2014chocolate,\nvanilla, or coffee\u2014are those imparted by aging in oak casks rather than the grape itself.Vertical\nand horizontal tasting involves a range of vintages within the same grape and vineyard,\nor the latter in which there is one vintage from multiple vineyards. \"Banana\" flavors\n(isoamyl acetate) are the product of yeast metabolism, as are spoilage aromas such as\n\"medicinal\" or \"Band-Aid\" (4-ethylphenol), \"spicy\" or \"smoky\" (4-ethylguaiacol), and\nrotten egg (hydrogen sulfide). Some varieties can also exhibit a mineral flavor due to the\npresence of water-soluble salts as a result of limestone's presence in the vineyard's\nsoil. Wine aroma comes from volatile compounds released into the air. Vaporization of these\ncompounds can be accelerated by twirling the wine glass or serving at room temperature.\nMany drinkers prefer to chill red wines that are already highly aromatic, like Chinon and\nBeaujolais.The ideal temperature for serving a particular wine is a matter of debate by\nwine enthusiasts and sommeliers, but some broad guidelines have emerged that will generally\nenhance the experience of tasting certain common wines. A white wine should foster a\nsense of coolness, achieved by serving at \"cellar temperature\" (13 \u00b0C (55 \u00b0F)). Light\nred wines drunk young should also be brought to the table at this temperature, where they\nwill quickly rise a few degrees. Red wines are generally perceived best when served chambr\u00e9\n(\"at room temperature\"). However, this does not mean the temperature of the dining room\u2014often\naround 21 \u00b0C (70 \u00b0F)\u2014but rather the coolest room in the house and, therefore, always slightly\ncooler than the dining room itself. Pinot noir should be brought to the table for serving\nat 16 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F) and will reach its full bouquet at 18 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F). Cabernet Sauvignon,\nzinfandel, and Rhone varieties should be served at 18 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F) and allowed to warm on\nthe table to 21 \u00b0C (70 \u00b0F) for best aroma. == Collecting == Outstanding vintages from the best vineyards\nmay sell for thousands of dollars per bottle, though the broader term \"fine wine\" covers\nthose typically retailing in excess of US$30\u201350. \"Investment wines\" are considered by some\nto be Veblen goods: those for which demand increases rather than decreases as their prices\nrise. Particular selections have higher value, such\nas \"Verticals\", in which a range of vintages of a specific grape and vineyard, are offered.\nThe most notable was a Ch\u00e2teau d'Yquem 135 year vertical containing every vintage from\n1860 to 2003 sold for $1.5 million. The most common wines purchased for investment\ninclude those from Bordeaux and Burgundy; cult wines from Europe and elsewhere; and\nvintage port. Characteristics of highly collectible wines include: A proven track record of holding well over\ntime A drinking-window plateau (i.e., the period\nfor maturity and approachability) that is many years long\nA consensus among experts as to the quality of the wines\nRigorous production methods at every stage, including grape selection and appropriate\nbarrel agingInvestment in fine wine has attracted those who take advantage of their victims'\nrelative ignorance of this wine market sector. Such wine fraudsters often profit by charging\nexcessively high prices for off-vintage or lower-status wines from well-known wine regions,\nwhile claiming that they are offering a sound investment unaffected by economic cycles.\nAs with any investment, thorough research is essential to making an informed decision. == Production == * May include official, semi-official or estimated\ndata. Wine grapes grow almost exclusively between\n30 and 50 degrees latitude north and south of the equator. The world's southernmost vineyards\nare in the Central Otago region of New Zealand's South Island near the 45th parallel south,\nand the northernmost are in Flen, Sweden, just north of the 59th parallel north. === Exporting countries === The UK was the world's largest importer of\nwine in 2007. == Consumption ==\nWine-consumption data from a list of countries by alcohol consumption measured in liters\nof pure ethyl alcohol consumed per capita in a given year, according to the most recent\ndata from the World Health Organization. The methodology includes persons 15 years of age\nor older. == Culinary uses == Wine is a popular and important beverage that\naccompanies and enhances a wide range of cuisines, from the simple and traditional stews to the\nmost sophisticated and complex haute cuisines. Wine is often served with dinner. Sweet dessert\nwines may be served with the dessert course. In fine restaurants in Western countries,\nwine typically accompanies dinner. At a restaurant, patrons are helped to make good food-wine\npairings by the restaurant's sommelier or wine waiter. Individuals dining at home may\nuse wine guides to help make food\u2013wine pairings. Wine is also drunk without the accompaniment\nof a meal in wine bars or with a selection of cheeses (at a wine and cheese party).\nWine is important in cuisine not just for its value as a beverage, but as a flavor agent,\nprimarily in stocks and braising, since its acidity lends balance to rich savory or sweet\ndishes. Wine sauce is an example of a culinary sauce that uses wine as a primary ingredient.\nNatural wines may exhibit a broad range of alcohol content, from below 9% to above 16%\nABV, with most wines being in the 12.5\u201314.5% range. Fortified wines (usually with brandy)\nmay contain 20% alcohol or more. == Religious significance == === Ancient religions ===\nThe use of wine in ancient Near Eastern and Ancient Egyptian religious ceremonies was\ncommon. Libations often included wine, and the religious mysteries of Dionysus used wine\nas a sacramental entheogen to induce a mind-altering state. === Judaism === Wine is an integral part of Jewish laws and\ntraditions. The Kiddush is a blessing recited over wine or grape juice to sanctify the Shabbat.\nOn Pesach (Passover) during the Seder, it is a Rabbinic obligation of adults to drink\nfour cups of wine. In the Tabernacle and in the Temple in Jerusalem, the libation of wine\nwas part of the sacrificial service. Note that this does not mean that wine is a symbol\nof blood, a common misconception that contributes to the Christian myth of the blood libel.\n\"It has been one of history's cruel ironies that the blood libel\u2014accusations against\nJews using the blood of murdered gentile children for the making of wine and matzot\u2014became\nthe false pretext for numerous pogroms. And due to the danger, those who live in a place\nwhere blood libels occur are halachically exempted from using red wine, lest it be seized\nas \"evidence\" against them.\" === Christianity === In Christianity, wine is used in a sacred\nrite called the Eucharist, which originates in the Gospel account of the Last Supper (Gospel\nof Luke 22:19) describing Jesus sharing bread and wine with his disciples and commanding\nthem to \"do this in remembrance of me.\" Beliefs about the nature of the Eucharist vary among\ndenominations (see Eucharistic theologies contrasted).\nWhile some Christians consider the use of wine from the grape as essential for the validity\nof the sacrament, many Protestants also allow (or require) pasteurized grape juice as a\nsubstitute. Wine was used in Eucharistic rites by all Protestant groups until an alternative\narose in the late 19th century. Methodist dentist and prohibitionist Thomas Bramwell\nWelch applied new pasteurization techniques to stop the natural fermentation process of\ngrape juice. Some Christians who were part of the growing temperance movement pressed\nfor a switch from wine to grape juice, and the substitution spread quickly over much\nof the United States, as well as to other countries to a lesser degree. There remains\nan ongoing debate between some American Protestant denominations as to whether wine can and should\nbe used for the Eucharist or allowed as an ordinary beverage, with Catholics and some\nmainline Protestants allowing wine drinking in moderation, and some conservative Protestant\ngroups opposing consumption of alcohol altogether. === Islam === Alcoholic beverages, including wine, are forbidden\nunder most interpretations of Islamic law. In many Muslim countries, possession or consumption\nof alcoholic beverages carry legal penalties. Iran had previously had a thriving wine industry\nthat disappeared after the Islamic Revolution in 1979. In Greater Persia, mey (Persian wine)\nwas a central theme of poetry for more than a thousand years, long before the advent of\nIslam. Some Alevi sects\u2013one of the two main branches of Islam in Turkey (the other being\nSunni Islam)\u2013use wine in their religious services.\nCertain exceptions to the ban on alcohol apply. Alcohol derived from a source other than the\ngrape (or its byproducts) and the date is allowed in \"very small quantities\" (loosely\ndefined as a quantity that does not cause intoxication) under the Sunni Hanafi madhab,\nfor specific purposes (such as medicines), where the goal is not intoxication. However,\nmodern Hanafi scholars regard alcohol consumption as totally forbidden. == Health effects == === Short-term effects === Wine contains ethyl alcohol, the same chemical\nthat is present in beer and distilled spirits and as such, wine consumption has short-term\npsychological and physiological effects on the user. Different concentrations of alcohol\nin the human body have different effects on a person. The effects of alcohol depend on\nthe amount an individual has drunk, the percentage of alcohol in the wine and the timespan that\nthe consumption took place, the amount of food eaten and whether an individual has taken\nother prescription, over-the-counter or street drugs, among other factors. Drinking enough\nto cause a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.03%-0.12% typically causes an overall\nimprovement in mood and possible euphoria, increased self-confidence and sociability,\ndecreased anxiety, a flushed, red appearance in the face and impaired judgment and fine\nmuscle coordination. A BAC of 0.09% to 0.25% causes lethargy, sedation, balance problems\nand blurred vision. A BAC from 0.18% to 0.30% causes profound confusion, impaired speech\n(e.g. slurred speech), staggering, dizziness and vomiting. A BAC from 0.25% to 0.40% causes\nstupor, unconsciousness, anterograde amnesia, vomiting, and death may occur due to inhalation\nof vomit (pulmonary aspiration) while unconscious and respiratory depression (potentially life-threatening).\nA BAC from 0.35% to 0.80% causes a coma (unconsciousness), life-threatening respiratory depression and\npossibly fatal alcohol poisoning. As with all alcoholic beverages, drinking while driving,\noperating an aircraft or heavy machinery increases the risk of an accident; many countries have\npenalties against drunk driving. Wines can trigger the positive emotions in\na short period of time, such as relaxed and comfortable. The context and quality of wine\ncan affect the mood and emotions, too. === Long-term effects === The main active ingredient of wine is alcohol,\nand therefore, the health effects of alcohol apply to wine. A 2016 systematic review and\nmeta-analysis found that moderate ethanol consumption brought no mortality benefit compared\nwith lifetime abstention from ethanol consumption. A systematic analysis of data from the Global\nBurden of Disease study found that consumption of ethanol increases the risk of cancer and\nincreases the risk of all-cause mortality, and that the level of ethanol consumption\nthat minimizes disease is zero consumption. Some studies have concluded that drinking\nsmall quantities of alcohol (less than one drink in women and two in men) is associated\nwith a decreased risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes mellitus, and early death. Some of\nthese studies lumped former ethanol drinkers and life-long abstainers into a single group\nof nondrinkers, hiding the health benefits of life-long abstention from ethanol. Drinking\nmore than this amount actually increases the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure,\natrial fibrillation, and stroke. Risk is greater in younger people due to binge drinking which\nmay result in violence or accidents. About 3.3 million deaths (5.9% of all deaths) are\nbelieved to be due to alcohol each year.Alcoholism is a broad term for any drinking of alcohol\nthat results in problems. It was previously divided into two types: alcohol abuse and\nalcohol dependence. In a medical context, alcoholism is said to exist when two or more\nof the following conditions is present: a person drinks large amounts over a long time\nperiod, has difficulty cutting down, acquiring and drinking alcohol takes up a great deal\nof time, alcohol is strongly desired, usage results in not fulfilling responsibilities,\nusage results in social problems, usage results in health problems, usage results in risky\nsituations, withdrawal occurs when stopping, and alcohol tolerance has occurred with use.\nAlcoholism reduces a person's life expectancy by around ten years and alcohol use is the\nthird leading cause of early death in the United States. No professional medical association\nrecommends that people who are nondrinkers should start drinking wine.Excessive consumption\nof alcohol can cause liver cirrhosis and alcoholism. The American Heart Association \"cautions people\nNOT to start drinking ... if they do not already drink alcohol. Consult your doctor on the\nbenefits and risks of consuming alcohol in moderation.\"Population studies exhibit a J-curve\ncorrelation between wine consumption and rates of heart disease: heavy drinkers have an elevated\nrate, while people who drink small amount (up to 20 g of alcohol per day, approximately\n200 ml (7 imp fl oz; 7 US fl oz) of 12.7% ABV wine) have a lower rate than non-drinkers.\nStudies have also found that moderate consumption of other alcoholic beverages is correlated\nwith decreased mortality from cardiovascular causes, although the association is stronger\nfor wine. Additionally, some studies have found a greater correlation of health benefits\nwith red than white wine, though other studies have found no difference. Red wine contains\nmore polyphenols than white wine, and these could be protective against cardiovascular\ndisease.Although red wine contains the chemical resveratrol and there is tentative evidence\nit may improve heart health, the evidence is unclear for those at high risk as of 2013.\nGrape skins naturally produce resveratrol in response to fungal infection, including\nexposure to yeast during fermentation. White wine generally contains lower levels of the\nchemical as it has minimal contact with grape skins during this process. == Forgery and manipulation == Incidents of fraud, such as mislabeling the\norigin or quality of wines, have resulted in regulations on labeling. \"Wine scandals\"\nthat have received media attention include: The 1985 Diethylene Glycol Wine Scandal, in\nwhich diethylene glycol was used as a sweetener in some Austrian wines.\nIn 1986, methanol (a toxic type of alcohol) was used to alter certain wines manufactured\nin Italy. In 2008, some Italian wines were found to\ninclude sulfuric acid and hydrochloric acid. In 2010, some Chinese red wines were found\nto be adulterated, and as a consequence China's Hebei province has shut down nearly 30 wineries. == Packaging == Most wines are sold in glass bottles and sealed\nwith corks (50% of which come from Portugal). An increasing number of wine producers have\nbeen using alternative closures such as screwcaps and synthetic plastic \"corks\". Although alternative\nclosures are less expensive and prevent cork taint, they have been blamed for such problems\nas excessive reduction.Some wines are packaged in thick plastic bags within corrugated fiberboard\nboxes, and are called \"box wines\", or \"cask wine\". Tucked inside the package is a tap\naffixed to the bag in box, or bladder, that is later extended by the consumer for serving\nthe contents. Box wine can stay acceptably fresh for up to a month after opening because\nthe bladder collapses as wine is dispensed, limiting contact with air and, thus, slowing\nthe rate of oxidation. In contrast, bottled wine oxidizes more rapidly after opening because\nof the increasing ratio of air to wine as the contents are dispensed; it can degrade\nconsiderably in a few days. Environmental considerations of wine packaging\nreveal benefits and drawbacks of both bottled and box wines. The glass used to make bottles\nis a nontoxic, naturally occurring substance that is completely recyclable, whereas the\nplastics used for box-wine containers are typically much less environmentally friendly.\nHowever, wine-bottle manufacturers have been cited for Clean Air Act violations. A New\nYork Times editorial suggested that box wine, being lighter in package weight, has a reduced\ncarbon footprint from its distribution; however, box-wine plastics, even though possibly recyclable,\ncan be more labor-intensive (and therefore expensive) to process than glass bottles.\nIn addition, while a wine box is recyclable, its plastic bladder most likely is not.Some\nwine is sold in stainless steel kegs and is referred to as wine on tap. == Storage == Wine cellars, or wine rooms, if they are above-ground,\nare places designed specifically for the storage and aging of wine. Fine restaurants and some\nprivate homes have wine cellars. In an active wine cellar, temperature and humidity are\nmaintained by a climate-control system. Passive wine cellars are not climate-controlled, and\nso must be carefully located. Because wine is a natural, perishable food product, all\ntypes\u2014including red, white, sparkling, and fortified\u2014can spoil when exposed to heat,\nlight, vibration or fluctuations in temperature and humidity. When properly stored, wines\ncan maintain their quality and in some cases improve in aroma, flavor, and complexity as\nthey age. Some wine experts contend that the optimal temperature for aging wine is 13 \u00b0C\n(55 \u00b0F), others 15 \u00b0C (59 \u00b0F).Wine refrigerators offer a smaller alternative to wine cellars\nand are available in capacities ranging from small, 16-bottle units to furniture-quality\npieces that can contain 400 bottles. Wine refrigerators are not ideal for aging, but\nrather serve to chill wine to the proper temperature for drinking. These refrigerators keep the\nhumidity low (usually under 50%), below the optimal humidity of 50% to 70%. Lower humidity\nlevels can dry out corks over time, allowing oxygen to enter the bottle, which reduces\nthe wine's quality through oxidation. While some types of alcohol are sometimes stored\nin freezer, such as vodka, it is not possible to safely freeze wine in the bottle, as there\nis insufficient room for it to expand as it freezes and the bottle will usually crack.\nCertain shapes of bottle may allow the cork to be pushed out by the ice, but if the bottle\nis frozen on its side, the wine in the narrower neck will invariably freeze first, preventing\nthis. == Professions ==\nThere are a large number of occupations and professions that are part of the wine industry,\nranging from the individuals who grow the grapes, prepare the wine, bottle it, sell\nit, assess it, market it and finally make recommendations to clients and serve the wine. == See also == == References == == Further reading == == External links == Wine at

work and life is to create a map for riding the waves of life in health and peace so I chose this poem because it has movers and shakers in it and that's where that term comes from so it's influential our muscles are one of the most influential parts of our body I like to think of myself as a champion of the muscles there's and really the muscles are part of a whole system that we're going to talk about and as you know the body is incredibly complex it's a universe of in of parts and places and my one of the things that I enjoy doing is making the body as simple as possible and so I've chosen about 18 or 20 muscles to talk about tonight which is called trigger points dotnet anyway trigger points net has 111 muscles listed which is most of the muscles that move around and has the the name what they do and a very simple picture of the referral pattern that we'll talk about so I consider self massage to be one of the 10 self-care seeds and that little term comes from my children's book seeds of wellness these 10 self-care seeds if we do these 10 basic things and if we learn them when we're in kindergarten we have a chance of staying healthy our whole life self massage is one of my favorite things to talk about the muscles are I kind of think of them almost like the stepchild of the body there when you look at an x-ray we'll see when you look at an x-ray everything disappears but the bones and actually the bones are something that you can operate on and it will kind of regrow Nene for the muscles once they're cut they they just don't repair quite the same but we have I'm sure there's lots of good techniques and talking about the muscles might seem kind of like a superficial thing it's a very physical thing to talk about but I think of it as a great entree into becoming more aware of our bodies and I actually would go so far as to say that we've kind of been kept ignorant about our bodies and you know feels kind of radical to say that but part of that is that all the parts of the body it's like any any science it's all in Latin right and like like we said on the poster I said can you say sternocleidomastoid that's that's one of the muscles I mean what a silly name for a muscle for further for us to try to learn that it's named after the parts that it's connected to but but and so I've given a simple easy name for all the muscles and feel free to use those and we're gonna go over all of those one by one you can go to vimeo.com and put in avenues to wellness or put in my name Diane Smalley and the talks that have been given here as part of avenues to wellness will come up and you can watch them all again and so we're gonna go over quite a bit of material and so don't be too concerned if it doesn't all sink in because a lot of it's on the handout which I recommend reading a little bit later tonight because then it'll start to sink in that's a really good thing to do after you learn something and then also you can watch the videos as much as you want so welcome everyone no see I think I know every single one of you so this is awesome this is great to have all my friends here real basic there's three types of muscles skeletal smooth cardiac they all have slightly different well quite different Stipe types of cells my favorite one is the heart types of cells in the month the heart are unique and it never sleeps it beats beats beats all through our life and just a moment of gratitude for that heart that beats all through our life and keeps us alive then we have smooth muscles and what I like about this picture is you know here's kind of what the muscle looks like when it's extended but then it has these fibers that make it kind of crinkle all up that's how it works and smooth muscles do everything from peeing to seeing and this is a bladder and I chose to put the bladder muscle on here because you can see that the bladder except for the layers you know on the inside outside the bladder is basically a muscle and it contracts and relaxes and another thing I learned freely recently is when the Kegel muscles the perineum when that is contracted the bladder relaxes kind of handy thing to know then like I said seeing the iris of the eye here is smooth muscle and so just the very fact that we can see our way through our life and then check out this little that's a hair that if you didn't see it when it contracts it makes that makes that's a muscle that makes the hair rate stand up so that's a smooth muscle also so everything from the hairs on our skin to our lungs and also fur so forth so now let's get into more into the skeletal muscles like I said it's a system musculoskeletal system and I thought that was kind of cool all the layers and what this is showing here is obviously the bones and the muscles but in between here is more talking about the fossa we're gonna talk a little bit more about that so on the deepest level of the bones are in intimately connected with the muscles you can't separate them out there they're all part of the same thing we're gonna be talking a fair amount about the pelvis area and so you notice that there are five different bones the base which there's a name for the sacrum the tailbone the coccyx the blade which is this toughest part right here the blade and then the pubes and the sit bones the sit bones are obviously what we sit on they're peeking out right there and then the pubes in the front and there's very little movement in that bone it's essentially essentially a solid piece we'll come back to the pelvis gonna be talking a lot about that kind of a private area so I want you to be able to work on that area and again here's there's a joint between the blade of the pelvis and the Bates the sacrum and the ilium and that joint is the sacroiliac how many of you have heard of the sacroiliac all right sacr\u00e9 de croo Illya and so ligaments are the next level ligaments link the bones bone to bone they're not terribly stretchy in fact we really don't want them to stretch too much we want them to stay healthy and and there's not a lot of fluid exchange at ligaments there and inside the joint capsule it kind of we want that to stay kind of like a little sacred chamber in there then moving on to fossa kind of coming out a little further I like this picture it's it turns out there's a whole system of working with the fossa which would be kind of like working with the little finger I mean you can't really separate out the fossa so fossa is a rapper if not the hip up guy and sasha is also it it's a fibrous kind of material that surrounds every muscle every muscle fiber every muscle group and every organ the liver would just be kind of a blob without that facha wrapper every all through the skin there's a layer of fossa through there and that's where the nerves and the blood vessels flow in fact the the fossa hat is considered to be more nerve you know have more nerve connection to it and so I chose this because you can see these are these are this is a tendon right here of the trapezius muscle we'll talk about but the white part is is the muscle fibers have ended and it turns into the tendon but down here it's more of a see how it's more of a layer there and it needs to move so the the fossa is gonna be more moveable and it can stretch as well and we want our fascia to be more stretched out than tough and actually being sedentary is going to cause things to be more tough and I like the two pictures because it shows how when you move it moves with you and what's one of the most common areas of pain is this low back area and so you can see there's a lot going on there we're gonna we're gonna go down through the layers so now we're down to muscle although up in the right-hand corner that's a little close-up of what the fossa looks like it's kind of like a cobweb the fibers are go all different directions to form a layer and so here we have that fascia wrapping the muscle and then when we come down to a little bundle of muscles there's another layer fascia there and each little layer has its own wrapping and then each fiber has it each muscle section has its own wrapping and then it comes together and becomes a little more cord like and that becomes the tendon that attaches the muscle to the bone so tendons attach muscle to bone and then the bone also has a layer of Faja around it too and I chose this picture mostly just to show here's that here's that layer where the fascia is and that's where all the blood vessels and lymph vessels and nerves will be flowing so a little bit about the close-up of what's going on in the muscle obviously this we're using the bicep as an example here and the bicep is probably one of the most the muscles we all know it's like flex your bicep and it's a short word too so it's a good one to choose here so and you'll see that the bicep is lifting the weight and contracting and then relaxing and that's the typical thing that the bicep is considered to do and and but what I love about this is see how it when its contracting these little tiny fibers come and grab those green things and contracts and pulls them together and then when it relaxes they release and it relaxants I think that's such a cool drawing there so here and here's another interesting point so my when I lived something my bicep contracts to lift it but then when it's going back down I'm keeping I'm you know unless I just go like that I'm controlling that release that that extension so so contraction and extend extend is called so when I'm when the bicep is flexing that it's kind of designed to do that it's shortening but when it's extending against the weight it's it's kind of stopping dropping and that's actually a little bit harder on the muscle the action of lifting is is sort of normal for the muscle but extending under a weight is harder and that's the difference between walking up stairs and going down stairs do you notice the difference with that so when I take a step down I'm this muscle instead of instead of contracting to straighten my knee it's extending against a weight and that puts a little more load on it so that's why sometimes it's easier to go down backwards or and and but walking down a hill you want to be careful to use that muscle so you're not clunking onto the knee and also you know that's where we start to use the control to strengthen the muscle going down a hill is great way to strengthen the muscle so just review bones are the shape and the structure of the body the ligaments link the bone to bone the facher wraps the muscle fibers the tendon attaches the muscle to the bone and the muscles are I like to think of the muscles as breathing and moving because there's a very important muscle we're gonna talk about a minute that does our breathing moves us through life here's the amazing two sided person it's got back and front on on one side it's pretty cool and there are over 600 muscles in the body and that's counting the two sides a lot of those but not sinks under distinct ones and I like to think of muscles as the verbs I can't tell you how many times I people come and say oh I threw my back up and so through there's only one thing that can throw and that's a muscle and the bones just don't decide oh I'm gonna go over here so it's usually the use of the muscle in some way that's pulling on them the bone to move it out of where it was and so we always say well what were you doing well I was shoveling that's a great way to throw your back up and you know there's usually something that the person was doing we got cause the muscle the bone to move and it feels like a bone is out what we're gonna see is that most pain is related to the muscles my favorite muscle to talk about and one that's kind of hidden in there that we don't know much about is the diaphragm and if you want an easy name it's the breathing dome or just the dome we could call it and there's there's our other favorite muscle the heart inside there you can see that they rest right on top of the diaphragm with a Fache in between and so every time we breathe it's massaging all the organs in the body so let's have your hands like this here's the diaphragm and it's it attaches all the way around in fact let's let's go to the next picture here this is a great shot of where it's in the in the ribcage there it makes a dome inside and just to really get a good picture of it that's from the bottom and there's three openings 1 2 3 and this is this is a tendon right here so all the fibers are going towards the center makes it a really unique muscle so here's our dome and what happens to it let me see what it does when you breathe in good I see ok it flattens out if you have a if if something is this shape and it's getting shorter it's gonna flatten up okay so that's so let's breathe in it seems a little counterintuitive doesn't but it's flattening out on inhale and then exhaling and relaxing and so that's why the belly gets big when we breathe in because it's got to get out of the way of that diaphragm that dome so breathing in let's let's now put your hand on your stomach and notice that it's breathe when you breathe in they get bigger and exhale now when you when you're breathing on purpose it's good to say breathe in to out for something like that otherwise you'll hyperventilate I've seen that happen before now we're getting a little more complex here and here's the diaphragm it's kind of cut and we've got some abdominal muscles coming around and now we're adding another another muscle the deep core or the iliopsoas it starts here above the diaphragm comes down that's the that's the main part of the stoechas muscle can you see okay and it's got some other parts here it's coming down it's right next to the spine there's the spine right there and here's the pelvis everybody oriented it's coming down and then it's joining with some fibers on the inside of the pelvis there that blade has muscle all covering the whole inside it joins together comes down goes over the pubic bone there's a there's a ligament there and it comes down and attaches to the top of the thigh bone wraps right around underneath it now what would happen if that muscle was tight to this joint right here it's gonna kind of pull it up a lot of hip replacements in this town and in this country and so some of that could be caused by the psoas muscle being tight we're gonna see what causes it to be tight here in an anatomy book you'll when they're drawing the nerves in they'll be yellow check big nerves out here this is there says s1 it's coming from the sacrum is right there the base this sacrum the part part of the pelvis coming through the holes which we'll see in a minute coming and that becomes the sciatic nerve so this is a vulnerable area there's a lot going on here and then the third muscle in this tri triad are the abdominals the six-pack you know we we think of this as the six-pack but really there is abdominal muscle all the way around as well which we'll see and here's another picture of the psoas without the diaphragm there and some other deeper muscles but here's that so again coming and wrapping around our CV here's the here's the thigh bone without the ligament the last picture had the ligament in there which was really good to see you don't see that very often and so now now let's see it without the ligament and you can see and there so see there's there's the actual ball and socket right there so a lot going on right there it's a good muscle to know about we call it the iliopsoas but you can also call it the psoas psoas what it mostly does is say you're driving in the car and you've got your foot on the gas pedal that's the psoas it's kind of working that mostly it can start deflection you know remember when we did sit-ups as a kid where you'd like ompletely flat on the floor and sit all the way up well that first part of starting the setup is somewhat the psoas so there's no point when doing sit-ups like that that's why we do them at knees now and but at the very top or say you're running up the stairs and taking two stairs at once that's the psoas muscle ok so then here's all the different pictures of the different belly wall I call it the abdominals we see that they're not on you know that's we know think of as the abdominals but they wrap all the way around and really the abdominal muscles are back muscles because their job is to keep stability of the trunk to the pelvis and support the back so the more toned are about arm Donald's rbailey wall as the safer will be with our back and the more the psoas can relax all right here's here's that same picture of what we were just doing the diaphragm also never sleeps it has it has a nerve going to it that says contract and the air flows in and then relaxes contract the air flows in isn't that lucky you don't have to think about it so there are special nerves that tell the diaphragm to to be higher and lower and as it flattens out it increases the size of the lung cavity and so air is gonna rush it so this is a just a good little recap here of well not it so I love this picture though see that belly rising on the inhale and then it comes back down this was actually from a movie it was it was pretty cool when we're sleeping when we're at rest and sleeping we're pretending to breathe into the belly through the nose and the exhale is gonna be a little longer than the inhale so when we purposely breathe that way I'm extending the exhale breathing through the nose into the belly that sends a message up here it says Oh things must I must be safe I must be relaxed so that's the best first most important way to calm yourself down we just found that the the dome and the wall the the diaphragm and the abdominals work opposite each other when the diaphragms contracted the bellies relaxed and vice versa and also something that we want to know about is that when the abdominals when the belly wall is coordinated when it's on and we're gonna do a little exercise in a minute for that then the psoas can be more relaxed it's easy for the abdominals for the belly to be kind of confused and this is what happens this guy's holding his breath it's a little hard to tell but the best picture I could find and so he's holding his breath because he's under the impression that when he lifts it sort of splints the spine but but it triples the blood pressure to the brain when you hold the breath like that to lift a heavy weight and so you want to exhale on effort that's the whole point there and often times you'll hear after an operation will say now don't lift anything over five pounds because it's easier to say that than it is to say be sure to exhale when you lift because that that takes a lot of rearranging of the brain cells but that's the idea is we want to exhale and ever okay coming back to the pelvis and love this picture there's I've got a picture from the back too and you rarely see a picture of the bones like that with all the ligaments in place so here's that that ligament between the thigh and the pelvis and that ball and socket it's all encased in that ligament and then one place that there's two places on the pelvis that there is some movement and one is right here at the pubic pubic symphysis it's called between the pubic bones there's it's a little spongy there it can move a little bit there and you can't see it in this slide but there's a joint the sacroiliac joint sacrum ilium secreto and there's those holes that the nerves came through but look how it's just pasted together with ligaments it's extremely strong ligaments and very little movement right here it's kind of a shock absorber so now turning around from the back there's that ligament again at the ball and socket joint and look at all these ligaments holding that all together here's the thing that really amazes me so let's look at the next slide amazing disappearing ligaments and so now we're showing that the muscle attached is there but it doesn't attach straight to the bone like that because there's a ligament in the way now I've asked a few physical therapists you know when those back muscles come down do they attach to the ligament or do they kind of the fibers go through the ligament to the bone and they neither one of them they both said so at any rate though there's a lot going on right here because now we've got the back muscles he's very strong back muscles which will come back to that and the gluteus maximus the Papa Bear I call it attaching right there at that and here we're starting to see a little bit of that secretary and we're also going to be talking about the hip strap too so there's a lot of forces on that area so now we're going to get into so these are four common low back pain is extremely common I see a lot of people come to me for that and the the most common place for the pain to be is right at that sacroiliac joint now we can see it a little bit more there it's picking up sciatic pain traditional sciatic pain tends to go down the back of the leg and then hip pain is also very common so so like this picture here come through here so she is getting up from sitting down have you ever had that experience of driving a long ways and standing up can you kind of go like that that's because she was sitting and when we're sitting that psoas muscle so it goes from the hip joint up to the spine so now in this position the so is a short word can you see that and so when we go to stand up and then so if the saw is is is chronically shortened its going to tend to pull the back forward like that and because it doesn't want it lengthen this is we this is ideal it's it's extended so as it is extended in this position so sitting is one of the hardest things on the back and a couple of good pictures I found obviously the ones on the left here see how our head is forward she's got her legs crossed and ideally we want to have the head over the hips that's true for sitting and walking as well and I love this one too I was looking for a picture for this so leaning forward like that as when we're when we're lined up when when the muscles are lined up there's very little effort involved as soon as we start to lean forward even if we don't even feel it those muscles are now on and so she's got her she's got the door open under her sink she's got a foot thing and that's a magic thing to realize is if you have a job where you need to stand for a while getting one of those rubber rubber made stools or a little stool of some kind to put your foot up on and then you can trade feet makes all the difference because now instead of having to have everything lined up have got kind of an a guy you know prop out there to to support your back when muscles are overused like leaning forward over the back over the sink they do two things they they tighten up they spasm or sometimes they even cramp and as you know that's very painful like for instance this I take from the diaphragm or how many people get cramps at night when they go to bed it's pretty common and then so now we've got a muscle that's tight and I kind of think of it the muscle wants to keep going so it spreads the pain out and that's called referred pain and another interesting thing about the muscle is that so say that I'm using my bicep I'm hammering or something and the fibers will kind of trade around this fiber will do the work then this one then this one then this one and eventually the whole muscle gets fatigued and that's when it will tend to cut me spasm and so basically that sensation of the spasm is the muscle talking to you sending a signal out saying hey rub me and so the that referral pattern can throw us off a little bit because if we go to rub exactly where it's hurting it might not be tender there but it feels like a lot of times people will rub their knee when really the problem is and so we have to kind of be a detective and start looking for the tender spots this is this is the technique this is on your handout and I'll just I'm just gonna throw a few of these out here you can play with these unfortunately we don't have a lot of wall space in this room but let me show you how this is gonna work so so yeah we've got lots of good wall space can everybody see me if I go back here so I'm gonna take this and I'm going to put it on my back and I'm gonna lean up against the wall and massage my back with it so you can get to any part of it back any part of your body with a tool yeah so so these are just socks with a ball inside and we can maybe later people can try using those and find find some wall space this is a fabulous book the trigger point therapy workbook highly recommend it they usually have it at book juggler I've got a few copies up here you can look at there's a third edition now it has more drawings which is great and the text is excellent it goes through in a lot of detail and very well written about how to work on your own muscles and there's a whole array of tools which I brought with me and you can try later this is an example of so here's the iliopsoas muscle we're working on and these X's are spots that are commonly have trigger points in them the only one that you would be able to get to is that one right there because this is deep deep deep under the organs you might be able to get just inside the hip bone but you'd have to go through the abdominal muscles to get to it so this one will tend to refer pain the red stippled area is is where you might refer pain might be refer to you say you think oh gee there's something wrong with my the front of my leg but really it's it's on the psoas muscle and here's another key thing look at that what when you think back pain that's gonna be the most common area where it's gonna be it could it could be happening anywhere in here a little less likely out here in the dotted area and you know you might be working back there and there might be muscles that are tangled there as well but really it's gonna be deep inside and so is is a little tough to get at so another spot that people will say oh gosh my back hurts all the way across and look where it's coming from the six-pack here in the front so so we want to shorten the muscle a little bit and get in there with the the dowel and you can use your hands but it's a lot easier to hold this than it is to use your hands to work on anybody ever heard of Egoscue I think it's Pete Egon scuse ya this is the classic they call it static back which I don't really care for that it's lying on a cube but this is a great exercise or relaxation to do to relax the back and it's a great position to then do some self massaging as well you can just use a chair stack up some pillows but they actually use this cube and that is highly recommended for when there's back pain before we go forward let's learn how to activate the abdominals and there's a way to do it standing up so let's all do that it's time to take a little have a little stand-up break put your feet kind of parallel but not right next to each other and what we're gonna do is we're gonna kind of rock back and forth about two or three inches back and forth and do you notice when you rock forward the back kind of engages and when you walk back the front kind of engages okay so that's exactly what you want if we inhale on them as we rock forward the better that's coordinating the abdominals cuz you abdominal are relaxed when we rock forward and they're relaxed when we breathe in and then when we rock back we exhale because the abdominals are on when we're rocking back and they're on when we're exhaling okay so that's that's something you can do when you're waiting in line inhale forward exhale back okay and then this is this is something we'll do at the end as well okay very good go have a seat so I'll demonstrate this and you can do it on the floor if you want but so this is the way to do it lying down you're going to inhale arch and then exhale and lift your head in one leg inhale arch and then exhale and what that does is it is it causes the abdominals to be coordinated there's two nerve centers that tell the abdominals what to do one has to do with the breathing the other has to do with you know moving the torso and so by coordinating those two now the abdominals are on and if I do some abdominal exercises the the belly wall is gonna say yes I know what you're doing and I'm there for you and I'm going to strengthen people can have you know when the abdominals are are off there tends to be there tends to be kind of a lordosis here we call it an extra curve and so you can kind of tell and that that will also make it so the back isn't being supported so now not only is it pinched it's not supported and so there's gonna tend to be back pain there so one of the best ways to help back pain is to coordinate the abdominals then the Skell underneath here is doing a hip hinge and you know we've a lot of us have been taught that you pick up things by bending your knees well that's really hard on the knees actually if you do it for a lifetime and so we want a hinge from the hips if you want to stand up again sorry if you feel that hinge at the hips and it feels like you're sticking your bottom out so that's just kind of what it feels like so and then you hinge forward and your knees are are loose not straight they're kind of bent a little bit and you and if you put your feet way apart then you can get down to the floor and you you can rest your elbow right on your knee and you can get down to the floor and pull those weeds so that's and but the point here that we're saying is we want the back to be nice and straight see how she's good she's checking her back there as soon as it's curved like that that's going to put a lot of strain on the back so what and it it took me a long time to figure out what I always wondered how those people could plant rice all day you know it's bent over like that but really once I'm doing that my torso is literally just hanging from my hips and I'm just find its kind of resting on my legs almost one thing though it really requires nice long hamstrings so well we're gonna be coming back to that a little bit too so moving on we're still on the hip hips and low back pain and I came up I just came up with these names for these three muscles Papa Bear mama bear and baby bear and we all know the gluteus maximus that's the main butt muscle but underneath it are two fan-like muscles in fact there's another picture here a little bit more artistic and I like these two because they they have some of the ligaments there but see how they fill in that whole hip blade right there and then underneath that one is another one down a little lower and these are the muscles that are responsible for walking keeping us up on upright if you stand on one foot that that gluteus on that side is really those bears are really working and so every time we take a step we're on one foot right we're going from one foot to the next so we want those muscles to be nice and free and they're working our whole life so we have to work on them it's just they really need that and now let's look at the referral pattern for those now does that sort of look like sciatic but it's it's the gluteus muscle there have a nice meditation and and it's referring to all these areas and again this is on that trigger point Snecma can refer to that some more let's look at the for the mama bear now it's spreading out even a little more and look at that right to the center how many times would have you had pain in the center of the back when it's really coming the momma bear and then the baby bear goes all the way down the leg so that muscle and those three muscles are the only ones that attach right to the tip of the greater trochanter the pointy bone on the top of the thigh bone there and then there's the ball and socket going in and so they're the ones that hold that hip and so that's a good one for the you can reach those with that dowel see if you can find a tender spot you know if you put your hands on your hips you'll be on that ilium there that blade and just below that up a little higher right right down from the top in fact feel for that bone there that that blade that top of the blade just below that can you feel some tender spots okay that means it means it needs some massage no I would use it like that so we skipped right over that so we're using a tool we're looking for the tender spots and notice I'm I'm not I'm not going like this I'm taking the skin with me I'm taking the clothes and the skin with me that's really important and so I'm pressing into the muscle layer and and I'm doing kind of a circular motion I'm pressing one direction and then circling back to where I started and pressing in one direction and circling back so I'm just on one tender spot and you don't want to it's not back and forth fast it is circular motion press and return press and return so we're pressing in one direction and it's kind of slow like that and we count to ten if you find yourself doing it's like oh it hurts so good but after you know I don't half a minute or so you kind of bruised it a little bit so everybody does that I've done it myself many times and so you want to you want to just count to ten and stop and then do it again count to ten and do it again okay another muscle the hip strap the piriformis so here's that hip strap again and there's the sciatic nerve coming through that muscle so most sciatic pain is because of a muscle in fact there's they're starting to call it the piriformis syndrome and so this must this picture also shows the other rotator muscles the piriformis rotates that leg out and so it needs work you want to be careful not to press right on the nerve and then look at the referral pattern for the piriformis looks just like sciatic pain this is a good stretch for those so as you probably all done that put one foot up on the other knee and you can start by just sitting up straight with that and then coming forward just a little bit you want to keep your back nice and straight don't you don't have to go forward at all just once you sit up you'll feel that so is stretch okay be careful with that then we've got what I call the pocket muscle this one right here and look how it has a tendon that goes all the way down to the knee that's the fascia we're talking about and this can be incredibly tender and there's there's one just like it on the inside of the knee I don't know about you but that's one of the most tender spots and I always wondered why is that so tender and I realize now studying this learning this the fossa there is part of why it's so tender okay so now we're going into looking at knee pain and love this picture of the quadricep quad means four right and there's four of them there's the outer the inner the main one in here and there's one underneath that so there's four muscles there and those are the that's the biggest muscle group in the body and it's responsible for walking and we want to keep these muscles free of tangles and we want to keep them strong so we can walk for our whole life here's a here's a sad knee right here that's called inflammation just a few words about inflammation here so great picture of a cell just breaking up so when there's inflammation a cell breaks up and the signs of inflammation pain swelling redness heat and impairment and this is this is just a place marker here for when's that when the cell wall breaks down there are some little chemicals involved and one of them our train are created one of which is called resolving I love that name because it's those chemicals are like the person with a clipboard who says ok let's heal up this inflammation we're gonna bring in these cells and these cells in these cells and we're gonna do this process of resolving that inflammation and unfortunately the formation of those are blocked by in advil and I'm which is ibuprofen and so forth ibuprofen is used all the time for inflammation and what it does is it suppresses the inflammation and when it wears off it comes back up so the solution is Mareva or a form of turmeric that's like that and there's a whole page on that and your handout as well a very good anti-inflammatory so there's four quads the top one refers right to the knee this this this tangle up here is referring right to the knee and then we've got the middle it's not going down to the knee so much but look at that giant area of pain the middle quad the inner quad on the inside of the leg going right to that inside of the knee and attaches right in there and the outer quad look at all these areas along here this and this could be also part partly the pocket muscle there that and here so here's the muscle with all the areas that it refers to here's a really key point is when the muscles are tangled into a knot because of a chronic spasm they're weaker so by working out these tangle points by massaging them out then the muscle comes back and we have that muscle to use again rotator cuff shoulder pain can't lift the arm I counted a little 14 muscles that do and if any one of those isn't working quite right it might kind of do that then it's gonna put the work on the other muscles so we want to find that and so I named I named these muscles this is so here's the collarbone and so that's on the front of the shoulder blade it's a muscle covering the whole front of the shoulder blade and then here's the back of the shoulder blade with the spine of the shoulder blade right there it's like a shelf and there's muscle there's a muscle under on the underside and the top side and they come together and that so the rotator cuff is a cuff of muscles that's the scapula so if we're having a shoulder blade sandwich or a scapula sandwich I call those the bread muscles there's one on the front one on the back and so and this is where we're gonna start to use the ball against the wall it's this cuff of muscles where they attached yeah and here yes yes the tendons of the muscle come and cuff the top of that shoulder children there's about three or four muscles here so the back bread the one that's on the back this is also very common people come and say oh my shoulder is hurting right here and I know right away it's from the back and what I finally realized is that muscles on the back we never see it but it those those blade muscles those bread muscles are always working and so so it's gonna refer to the front of the shoulder blade right there and I put sign up because that's what the the front the back one does it you hold the sign up it's the muscle that does that and the one on the front puts the sign down even though they're holding the sign up it's the one that's going like that so so if you're playing a guitar that left hand is is that infraspinatus is gonna need some work he's got his arm up here to show where the muscle is coming from it's deep underneath so here let's find let's find this edge of the shoulder blade right here and what I do is I cross over and see if you can feel the edge of that bone usually kind of tender reach underneath your arm there anybody having trouble finding it you've got you've got that lay that edge of the blade so you want to go behind that and also underneath in the front if you let your arm kind of drop you can just barely get into that front bread muscle that's signed down muscle which is tough so that's one reason why shoulder pain kind of lingers a lot is because that muscle is hard to get to so here's another key muscle I call them the guy wires of the neck they're the scalenes they attach to the sides of the neck come down under the collarbone which is cut right there that's the collarbone being cut to the first rib and the second rib as well these muscles are always working see if you see if you can put your fingers right on the side of your neck and just kind of go back and forth you'll feel flexing a little bit so anytime you're using your arm that muscle is gonna be working and so and they're small muscles and here's the the kicker with that look at all the places the scalenes these are called there's three or three little muscles look at where they refer not only the front of the shoulder but this spot right there anytime there's pain under the shoulder blade there you want to work on the scalenes and check it out so here they are again it's a little little bit hard to see but here's that collarbone again it's cut and here's that first rib where it's attaching and remember what yellow things are they're nerves and they they've been cut as well but those are the nerves that go and they're like the sciatic of the arm it's the brachial plexus it goes out and runs the arm and look at what they're doing they're getting pinched by those tight muscles right there so it that's why they refer down the whole arm so any kind of arm pain you want to work on the scalenes very gently those muscles are kind of small so we want to be real careful with those we're come back to those in just a second show you how to find them and one more on the back the check-rein it's called sometimes at the shoulder blade coming up here and that can cause a lot of havoc in the shoulder as well that upper part of the shoulder it's called the check-rein because any time the head goes forward that's that's the muscle that keeps it from going cold you think you think well gosh my head's not gonna fall forward but it's because we take the muscles for granted sometimes look at all the muscles on the back of the neck and look where they attach all along there all along up here yeah so those muscles in the back of the neck there's a bunch of them they all start with us look where they refer to how many times you had a headache by that by your eye a band around the head these these ten cause that band look at the top right top of the head right there so that's where we would use I got they sell these at Rite Aid it's the same material that they make those blow up balls those exercise balls with you put it on your bed or on the floor and you lot you can lie on it you've been if you bend your knees up and kind of roll your feet back and forth you can roll on it and massage your neck it's really great yes that's what it's for this little baby's got to be about six months old because that's one those it it takes six months for those muscles to really start to work as I'm sure all of your parents know so so they've been and once once we learn how to lift our head do we ever think about how we lift our head again no no here's a keiki headache muscle and this is the one from the flyer I call it the say no sternocleidomastoid and it's named after the three parts it's connected to the sternum the colic light of some reason is called collarbone and then the mastoid up here if you say no you can feel that one working back and forth right kind of in the front so cross over with one hand you can kind of hold the elbow it makes it leisure and see if you can really grab that whole muscle you're too far back doozy well for their front it's for its further front than you think his remember it's coming feel it right down here by your collarbone and then so it's in the front now where your finger once you have that where your fingers are pointing are the scalenes though those guy wire muscles okay yes yeah that's a gentleman it's on an angle like this okay anybody having trouble finding their sternocleidomastoid and there's muscle there's muscles in the front in the back here too so usually there's more than one muscle going on easiest one of the coolest muscles ever it look how far down it starts right in the middle of the back and these fibers go so so all muscles have two two ends two attachments so this muscle is attached all along the spine all the way up that's the tendon and then the other side is the show of the shoulder blade all along the shoulder blade here that shelf of the shoulder blade is where it attaches and so the bottom fibers come up the middle fibers go straight across and the top fibers come down to the shoulder blade and we tend to use the upper part all the time and who doesn't have knots on the top of their trapezius so here's a here's a cool thing is to see if you can gauge that lower trapezius kind of pull the shoulder blades down feels really good and but that one can use a lot of work and it causes lots of problems in the head one more for the head here chewing muscle is a completely different picture so here's the muscle right here I can see the drawing of it it's the strongest muscle in the body for its size and look at where it refers to all up above the above the eyebrow okay masseter that's from when we used to catch our food with our teeth let's run through them real quick so I'm waking up I'm gonna I'm starting in the east starting east I'm gonna exhale as I stretch I'm not gonna hold my breath when I stretch I'm gonna rub my neck a little bit lift the hips we did that already bring the knee to the chest or maybe both knees to the chest then sit up on the side of the bed stretch that hamstring by sitting up straight with a nice straight back do the other side and then do some bring the shoulder blades together let's see that's a great stretch for the back and if it hurts to do that that means you want to do some massage on that trapezius because we do so much like this that this part kind of gets rounded and weaker okay and then now we're up now we're up and we're at the kitchen in the kitchen and we're gonna do a little plank on the kitchen counter can you can do some push-ups so it's a real gentle way the body is very heavy doing full-on push-ups is a little tough and then we're gonna raise the heels work the calves and when I say stretch both calves that means with the knee straight and with the knee bent then we're gonna do some squats work those quads keep them keep the knees over the toes not too not in front put the feet out do some do some horse stance you know work work that when you're working if the counter is too high you can put your feet apart like that get yourself down low it's great stretch great workout for the legs and then my favorite one of all I'm not gonna do it grab the kitchen sink and stretch back like that through the back straight it feels really great or it's even better with a limb or a chin-up bar or something like that like you're gonna sit back holding that and pulls all that out which is the opposite of what we do all day so let's see and then up in the top corner there this is exactly from your handout I'm gonna let's all do this let's put one foot back not very far just a little bit kind of parallel and then your knees bent all you're gonna do feet weight on both feet gonna tuck under the pelvis you and the leg that's back is being hyper extended you feel that a little bit in the front you're stretching the psoas you're tucking the pelvis under tucking the pelvis forward like that you're stretching the psoas muscle so so we want long psoas and toned abs that makes a happy back and I don't think we need to go through this but this is the moon Salutation I put this on your handout it's the opposite of its Sun salute because that's all this plain moon is back and forth reaching out stretching so that's that's a nice stretch process and some doors only open from the inside so by working on our working on our bodies it really is a door to the rest of our life [Applause] okay well stretching involves using the muscles and and that's because you might be hydrated after not no water all night dehydration thank you so do you drink plenty of water through the day okay at night you might try taking some magnesium a good form of magnesium like magnesium glycinate or 308 or tor eight or malate citrate is okay might cause loose stools those other ones don't tend to do that and you probably wouldn't would cramp as Magne muscles need magnesium that's that's another little thing I had here yeah the muscles really need all the minerals so you might be low on minerals and magnesium is the main anti cramping most mineral yes yeah Carlin just had a great suggestion rat when you when you go to stretch flex your feet up push with your heel when you stretch instead of because if you point your toe that's gonna let the calf cramp so do you try that some times then this cramps yeah then the front cramps yeah I get cramps on the side and it's the peroneal it's the weirdest feelings like your legs blowing up but it's be it's needing more water and try the magnesium yes okay so arthritis arthur means joint and itis means inflammation and it's a word that's kind of gotten used for a lots of different things everything from you know sprained a spring would be arthritis arthritis but then when it becomes chronic it's either from taking ibuprofen because it blocks the resolution of the healing that's going to be the main cause and then when so let's see muscles in relation to our thighs well if the muscles are tangled they're weaker they're not supporting the joint and that's especially true in the knees and feet and hips because as I lose strengthen these muscles the joint is not going to be supported and so now the joint was going to be hitting itself and the joint is not going to be working as well and so when we can work out the comb those tangles out and bring the muscle back then it can support the joint again good idea more to rest that or to definitely rest they call it rice rest ice compression elevation if that's a if it's an acute thing what the more recent the inflammation is you'd want to use some cold for a day or so because that causes the blood vessels to constrict and then they really they get tired of constricting just like when you look at something red it gets tired of seeing red and it sees green then the nerves then relax and it allows more circulation than just heat would heat can kind of congest things sometimes but yes definitely rest and massage and elevation is important to putting your foot up really so if something if something was strong enough to break a bone or sprain and the joint is now inflamed think of what it did to the muscles it's going to over stretch those muscles also if we take a fall god forbid the the muscles tend to tighten up to protect us and so they're going to be they can trauma can actually cause some cramping of the muscle so we want us to calm it out Sana's your question I see yeah and so okay so we talked about initially ice then after a day or two maybe it's good to do hot and cold and I do hot cold hot cold hot and the hot is maybe five minutes six minutes and the ice is two and a half or three minutes so six three six three six that's a that's a really good workout because it causes the vessels to do this but wrapping it wrapping the joint for a little bit while it's you know kind of give it some extra support but definitely you don't want to keep overusing it because that's just going to cause more trauma okay Mimi was saying that sometimes working on the front helps the back and vice versa and we saw how the rectus abdominus cause back pain and yeah it really I really go for the tender spot that's because the tent tangles are tender knots are tender and and so they're they tell us where to rub and calm out that muscle bring the fibers back to their where they want to be but is that the diagnosis well it depends so again it depends so looking at the shoulder a lot of shoulder pain now if there's been an injury if there's if you personal has fallen on the shoulder that's where there that's where we get in trouble with tears and things like that but if it's just from use that can also cause tears and tears are inflaming but it's the body trying to heal itself so probably the very best thing would be to not use it at all so that it can heal so the tissues can heal and nutrition is super important all the time you know our sugars and our grains are the hardest thing on the body and so and then doing the massage finally working on those trigger points because I think a lot of problems are diagnosed as arthritis when really it's it's a muscle spasm that's causing the referred pain it's quite a journey learning about all the muscles and parts [Applause] you", "l9aqnLEtiAQ": "[Music] well again my name is Diane Smalley i practice acupuncture here and Willits I'd like to start by talking about the mission of my practice which is to give you a map to so that you can ride the waves of life in health and peace as I believe that each one of you has a gift to give to the world and more rested you are the better you'll be able to give that gift that's why we're all here technically this talk should be you see a little about come in there we're talking really about eight hours eight hours is not written in stone and some people do better on a little less some people do better on a little more for instance children and teens especially teens tend to need more sleep so what keeps you awake anxiety thinking about thinking about what you have to do pain catch Louisburg stupid three hours and now this wake up for no reason okay I have no idea wait just wake up for no reason so okay we're I'm just repeating that so everyone can hear and that we're going to talk about all those things anyone else everyone else sleeps through the night can't shut your brain off how many of you here do feel like you sleep pretty well through the night wake up once or lesson alright and so if you have any insights that I don't have please feel free to add ideas our first thing that keeps us awake is stress and my best definition of stress is changes anytime things are changing it calls on our ability to adapt and especially if those changes are unpredictable especially if the changes or challenges are quite dramatic the bigger the change the higher this dress obviously and it could be a pleasant thing or unpleasant low blood sugar we're going to be talking a lot about that that's one of the main things that we causes us to wake up that night and I think that's probably what keeps me awake when I'm not eating properly we heard the word pain also illness and a lot of times that Center is in the bladder and the prostate sometimes kind of a little bit of both our environment most of us live in places where it gets pretty dark at night so that's another problem but who sleeps with their cell phone in the room okay talk about that things like and just being mentioned shiftwork people who have to work all through the night and have to have to sleep during the day obviously that's going to be a problem and things like jet lag going you know you can't fly 12 hours and expect to be chipper and then many drugs have the effect of causing insomnia and many drugs have an unintended effect of causing insomnia last but not least you find that a lot of people wake up because they stopped breathing and the word apnea Pinilla means to breathe PN EA or pneumatic you've heard of a pneumatic drill or things like that that's we say at PN that means dream breathing and a means not so it's not breathing so that's you hear that word a lot which leads me to a really important point is that that is a latin word and all of our medicine terms are in Latin and that's so that different doctors can speak to each other and understand what they're talking about very specifically in fact that's true in all of science however it's something that has kind of kept us from understanding our bodies and so what I've been doing these days is taking all the things I've learned the last 30 years and distilling them down to the kindergarten level because I figure if a kindergartner can understand it and so in some ways this class is really about doing nothing because sleep is just stopping and resting and we think we're kind of doing nothing when we're sleeping but actually the brain is clearing itself out we're producing growth hormone in the night to repair the body so we have physical restoration and then the mind is doing a lot of sorting and restoring important memories and things like that so there's a lot of things that are we have to start somewhere and what I recommend if you're following along at all I want to say that all of the words that are on this PowerPoint except for a few at the beginning on I'll let you know are in here so it won't have to write anything down from what you see on the slides but this back page is kind of a overall map of where we're going and we're going to start in the West with easing stress this little guy right here has an advantage over us he has something and can't hear or she has something in common with us right about in there in the brain right in the center of the brain they have a structure it's called the hypothalamus and we have that in common it's called the mammalian brain or the mammal brain emotional brain sometimes it's called and we'll come back to that so this is a beautiful picture of I believe China the most basic principle that we use in Chinese medicine is called yin and Yan and it comes from looking at the hills and the valleys so that's where that drawing of the yin and Yan comes from it's a matter of spectacular and so we have a we have the dark and the light and so here's that yin and yang symbol right there and so what I the reason I drew it on on an angle like this is because if we take this curve right here see how steady my hand and if we continue that out we have what I like to call the usual wave this is our this is the way that we operate on all day long and it's basically involves night and day dark and light sleeping and waking and we're going to find out that its cortisol and melatonin cortisol and melatonin and if you start looking at it there's you examples of yin and Yan all over the place everywhere you look you can find those this is where this is where ideally we spend most of our time if an emergency happens what happens to that wave it turns into a storm wave and so now I'm on the boat and I'm adapting the boat was rocking I wouldn't just be tossed around with it I fall down so I my body has a natural ability to adapt to those rocking waves and so we call that basically when there's an emergency were either angry or afraid those are the two basic emotions that I've got to stimulate our stress response and so we call that fight-or-flight if I'm angry I'll fight I'm afraid I'll run so where does the blood go it glowed the blood tends to go away from the center out to the limbs to get us ready to run our fight and so this is how we adapt to the changes and so then ideally when the emergency ends we have a chance to settle down and come back to what we call the rest and digest so we could call this alarm and rest we're either in one or the other we're not wearing there's no such thing as being in both at the same time and so it's easy for though it's easy to go for that stress that emergency state that alarms to get stuck on as well see and so in order to sleep the adrenal glands need to be quiet and so once again I was pointing on that little arctic fox to this particular part of the brain right in the center it's kind of right behind the eyes and this slide is hard to read but and that's not important but light comes in and it stimulates this part of the brain to then set us up for all the rhythms that we have in our body and that part of the brain is called the hypothalamus I like to call it the monitor it's watching all the time monitoring everything that's going on in the body so it's very busy monitoring what's going on it and when it finds something that it needs to change it sends a message to the pituitary pituitary's the operator and the operator sends out the messages to the different glands it's many different blends all the endocrine glands in the body so we call that the operator and one gland that that it sends message to is called the adrenals they sit on the kidneys are called the renal so the adrenals sit on top of it Kitty and I like to call them the adapter glands as it says here the adrenals produce two different hormones adrenaline and cortisol produce many different hormones but these are two of the main ones that we think that we talk about and we want to really focus on cortisol because that is the hormone that directs our day that directs that usual wave look at all the things that cortisol does and it's not intended for as soon as I read all this but it's a long list of things and there's many other things but mostly stabilizing the blood the blood sugar the blood pressure supporting healthy bone etc one way that we can tell what's going on with the cortisol of the bodies we can do a test of the saliva so at night the cortisol is were is replenish and then this is showing during the day this person took four samples of their cortisol of the saliva the cortisol level was measured and it showed that was fairly high in the day this is a normal sample and then it goes down and flattens out a little and then goes down and then it replenishes in the night when people are stressed will see cortisol going like like this or it might it might go backwards and then over time as people become more and more fatigued the core I've seen cortisol that's going down about here at this level and we find that cortisol works in the day and we build at night so what are some of the things that that cause cortisol to go up there's three or four main things that we can talk about when there's injury that causes the pituitary to send that signal to produce cortisol the blood sugar is uncontrolled and mental and emotional distress so there's kind of two levels of stress when were younger maybe or if the stress is fairly new and we've been something we've been dealing with for a while the cortisol will be high to handle that stress but over time when that fight-or-flight kind of gets stuck on that's a sign that upstream the monitor is now getting tired and it's and it's saying okay okay there's enough cortisol being produced and so I'm gonna stop Purdue I'm gonna stop sending that signal and so we lose our ability to adapt to stress sometimes but it can be repaired and cortisol just kind of goes it's reduced you know this is this is something that I learned many many years ago and it's been really helpful for me to understand it as I tell you this you're going to know more than 90% of the people out there because this is a really unique way to think of this I call it the merry-go-round so we've just talked about how when adrenaline were getting the fight-or-flight mode adrenaline goes up and so does cortisol and so one of the things that happens I just mentioned that the blood that causes the blood to go out to the running and fighting muscles and so the blood there's less blood in the digestive tract and the stomach needs a good supply of blood to make the hydrochloric acid in the stomach hydrochloric acid is very important we need of that hydric hydrochloric acid to break down our protein to break down calcium break down iron to create b12 and things like that so that so as we make less hydrochloric acid in the stomach that's already going to cause stress where's the first place we feel stressful that's that's the stomach going down and function and so when we just think of the protein going into the stomach if it's not really being broken down by that really strong acid it's got a pH of about 1 or 2 so it's breaking the protein down into a liquid if it doesn't break down it kind of just sits there and now because the hydrochloric acid hasn't been produced we're making we're stimulating less bile flow from the liver I gave a talk on this a few years ago called the happy belly and I highly recommend it you go to the Avenue some avenues to wellness site and check out the speaker series in there because there's an archive speaker series archive has all those talks listed and they're on Vimeo and they're great to watch so I gave a talk on this so I'm not going to spend a lot of time on this concept but trust me when there's less hydrochloric acid in the stomach if there's less bile flowing the liver and gallbladder and as a result we're really having a hard time breaking down that protein then the protein just rocks and protein does not smell good when it's rotting and it and one of the things that happens when protein breaks down too far is it produces histamine in the body histamine is a natural substance that we produce all the time as cells are turning over and breaking down we're producing them and what it is it's a chemical messenger that goes through the body especially the lymph system to trigger the inflammatory process and so that now we've got histamine we've got histamine building up and we've got more inflammation going on especially than I just have tracked at least at this point and it just so happens that we have an anti-inflammatory in the body called cortisol you've probably heard of cortisone or prednisone these are the synthetic cortisol and there they are what do they do who knows what prednisone is used for inflammation it's a very powerful and effective anti-inflammatory and just so happens that the cortisol in our body does that too so if we're so so now we're on this on this merry-go-round what was an external stress that caused the the adrenals to respond is now an internal stress in causing more inflammation in the body if I have this much histamine in my body I'm going to tend to have this much inflammation and at 10 as the histamine builds up it goes up and so where are we now are in the springtime and anybody who's having allergy type of symptoms from and so forth that is the classic histamine response so the histamine tends to store in this area and when the pons come in they're kind of spiky and they trigger that histamine to be released and so we have the itchy eyes and they're runny nose and so forth a lot of people take an antihistamine and what that tends to do is it tends to drive the histamine back into storage but as soon as you stop taking and histamine it kind comes out again and so we have lots of good ways to get custom eeen out of the body so that's what we want to do is we want to have a pathway for getting the histamine out and it's mostly the liver that does that and if we can get off this merry-go-round so if we can handle handle our stress that's the first step is finding ways to handle that and then maybe take maybe take a little digestive enzyme and eat foods that stimulate the bile to flow then then we tend to slow this merry-go-round off and we can get off that Mary girl example is all your vegetables vegetables are our medicine I like to think of food as medicine and that is what cortisol is elevated that is the main thing that gives us a hard time falling asleep how many people when they go to sleep they they kind of lie there and it takes him a long time to fall asleep that's not that's not a big problem here so or how many people wake up at some point in the night and they look at the clock and it's kind of the same time every night people really recognize that okay so it's the adrenals that are doing that so we're gonna talk about melatonin in a minute melatonin people tend to know that it's that sleep and wake regulator and cortisol and melatonin melatonin are kind of a yin and yang pair like I was saying before when cortisol is high it's kind of hard for melatonin to come up and stimulate the sleep cycle to happen so the adrenal glands what they really need the most is regularity predictability things to be even eating regular meals if if we're really into a big debt with the adrenal glands eating a good balanced meal and I'll come to in a minute every couple hours you know a small snack every couple hours that can really help the imbalance for people who are you know going along pretty well breakfast lunch dinner the main time I do that is when I go visit my parents because we my folks always eat breakfast lunch and dinner on the clock that's this is one of my challenges is having those regular meals because of working the way I do here's some really key things to help to balance that cortisol and my my favorite signature thing is to exhale on effort so let's just take a moment right this second and and what I'd like you to do is just feel the chair that you're sitting in just kind of become aware of the chair and and really feel how sturdy that chair is and you can really trust that chair to hold you so that's that's a good first step to just let your weight be held by that chair and so then let's emphasize the exhale the inhale happens automatically we don't really have to think about inhaling but the exhale we have a little more more say over that and we can and of all the reflexive functions in the body the breath is the one that we have the most immediate control over so we can really use our breath to calm us down when we're at rest the exhale is naturally a little a little longer than the inhale so by extending the exhale it sends a message back up to that monitor up here that we're at rest and obvious things like having a massage and laughing then certain nutrients are really important vitamin C the adrenals are a huge report posit or abundancy in this country we call vitamin C ascorbic acid ascorbic acid is this shell of the vitamin C the way I like to think of it in shorthand is ascorbic acid will not cure me but but but lime juice will so it's the whole vitamin C so ideally we get these nutrients from our food and we'll talk about ashwagandha ashwagandha is an adaptogen herbal we'll come back to that little bit omega-3 is pretty common how many people take omega-3 okay so the first step in with the adrenals is the cortisol tends to be increased to handle the stress but over time it can become loan I'll come back to this in a minute why the reason why when the stress is prolonged the cortisol can be lowered and so that's a sign that the problem is upstream from the hypothalamus or the monitor and so this is an example of a tonic that we use to repair the adrenals this is one of the best tools that we have it's kind of an international formula because Romagna is a Chinese herb that's classically used to heal the kidney so it's a kidney tonic herb but it doesn't it's not exactly an adaptogen ashwagandha is an adaptogen herb and so that means adaptogens have that word adept so it generates our ability to adapt if we've got too much energy it will lower it if we've got not enough it will raise it so that's what an adage up adaptogen does it has an amphoteric effective but it's a balancing effect it's called so those are the two main herbs and then we put some echinacea which is a good herb for the immune system and just generally helping to repair and then a small amount of licorice licorice helps is the classic herb we use in Chinese medicine to take the herbs to the whole body but also it is beneficial for the adrenals and we use a very small amount so it's not a problem for anyone with high blood pressure has anyone ever had the experience of sitting down or doing something in the garden crouching down and then standing up and feeling light-headed kinda dizzy that's cold that's Oh what happened what's happening there is so if I'm if I'm lying down and I get up and start to walk I want my heart to be able to come along and beat a little harder to make it so that I can keep going but if my adrenals are low the adrenals are what stimulate that so there's like oh it was a change I was lying down now I'm standing up and so we want the adrenals to kick in to get us going so that we can do whatever it is we want to do the adrenals are low they're kind of sluggish and get the blood pressure going quite fast enough and so what we do is we take the blood pressure lying down after resting for a little bit and then we have you stand up and take it again and depending on what it does we want it to go up a little bit but some people who are very stressed the blood pressure actually goes down and we can tell quite a bit from that test now we're going to go around the map to the south and so we're going to talk about balancing the blood sugar the more are about blood Sugar's balance the less work the adrenals have to do and I chose this picture because I was making my omelette on Sunday morning and these were all the ingredients and so I thought I'd take a picture and all of these eggs red bell pepper mushrooms onion there's some garlic there somewhere the egg yolks there and the greens this is some parsley these are all the foods that the liver uses to detoxify so your question about foods that stimulate the body flow this is it we're going to learn about three different organs in the body there are three main organs that balance the blood sugar the liver pancreas and the adrenals and so here's a here's a good little picture of the adrenal glands right here these little guys right here sitting on top these are the kidneys and the adrenal glands sit on top there they're fairly small just kind of the size of an adult and they have an in and inside and outside and they make different hormones the main organ we think of when it comes to blood sugars the pancreas right so the pancreas makes insulin and that gets the sugar to go into the cells and then if it's time for some sugar to come out of the cells that the pancreas can also make glucagon to tell the sugar to release glucose because but it sugar the liver stores the blood sugar stores the sugar in the form of glycogen and the adrenals are one of the triggers to tell the pancreas to release and tell the liver to release sugar it's up to the adrenals because they're the ones that are in touch with the monitor to know when it's time to do all that so this is what we call the blood sugar roller coaster and this is a main cause of waking up in the night and we'll see what so when when we eat some sugar because whew the blood sugar goes up and so that the insulin is secreted and so the blood sugar goes into the cells in the body and technically this should be a person that's what's not shown on this is this person is kind of overweight because they've been eating too much sugar especially late at night and so they've been putting on fat because insulin triggers fat storage so does cortisol Turner fat storage but then what tends to happen is when what must go up comes down so the blood sugar drops so when there's a big flow of insulin the blood sugar tends to drop and at this point cortisol tells the liver we need more blood sugar again make some take some glycogen and send it back out into the body so that's how a blood sugar is maintained but ideally we go along a little bit more like this so that the blood sugar is more even less for the adrenals to do and so that is the key that's what we want to have going on at night and so if if we've been good to our liver pancreas and so forth we've got a nice even blood sugar and they've got good stores and sugar in the liver so that we can move fast through the nut that's where the word breakfast comes from as we've fasted through the night and so blood sugar like I said it's the main reason we wake up in the night when the blood sugar drops it kind of stimulates the adrenals it wakes the adrenals up and in order for the adrenal glands to do what they're doing to save our life by getting a little more blood sugar back sugar into the blood they have to be awake so when that cortisol goes up we wake up so they need us to be awake in our body to be awakened to work and that's sort of a little-known fact and so like I said happy liver has that good store of glycogen how do we stabilize the blood sugar so so how many people tend to do that wake up and have a hard time falling back to sleep at night and it might be different times okay what you can do is have a small snack so what when you make your dinner what I recommend is save a piece of broccoli and just a bite or two of that chicken put it in a little container in the fridge or something like that and then a few hours later after you've had your dinner go back and have that little snack just a bite or two of a couple things we'll talk talk about more about what foods because what that does is it kind of stabilizes the blood sugar gives a little food in there so that it can make it through the night and any meal or snack ideally has protein carb and fat and I like to think of carbohydrate more as a vegetable most people know a protein is that's our animal foods and if you're vegetarian be more like the beams and then fat often is part of the protein here like egg has some fat in it as well but some other good fats would be coconut butter cheese avocado things like that so now we get the idea a little dinner and some other ideas pick them up if you nuts yogurt and fruit anybody ever eat avocado on grapefruit together it's actually really good and a shell cooked egg I have a recipe for how to make shell cooked eggs in your notes so that's there and I call it shell cooked rather than hard-boiled that's kind of how we think of it I like I don't like to boil eggs I like to put it in the water so so that it's just coming to a boil up at the done time and when we when we cook anything in water it's a lower automatically at lower heat and so it's going to preserve the good things in all right moving on around any questions about blood sugar yes it it could be and you could actually go and get that little bite because and what's also is happening is cortisone that's a sign of cortisol going up cortisol has an effect of making us a little hungry kind of says okay it's time to eat now and and going back to that saliva test that I showed you we take those those samples of cortisol at those times because cortisol is kind of rising at meal time and so that explains that also it might be it might also be sometimes we think of hunger so you have a little feeling in your stomach sensation in your stomach does that happen to you it's more like food must have food so it's probably more that this adrenal function one yes [Music] it almost you're on a roll [Music] so when you wake up you're having a little almost of a shaky feeling kind of a revving and kind of almost like riding on a bumpy road yeah I would say that that is Corozal either too high or too low and it'll be good to test that to see what's going on there I have the I have little boxes if there's a there's a company there's several companies that do saliva tests there's a company that I use called Diagnostics they're up in Seattle and they're the only company I know of that test pituitary hormones and they seem to be quite good and and you just sent you do collect this alive I put it in a box and send it off it's too low so you want to pump it up a little bit by eating right too much exactly and it's very important what we choose at that time and we'll see in a minute there are some other problems with that so eating eating healthy balanced a balanced meal that that is not too high in carbs it's okay to have some carbs in there but not too high in fact nowadays you hear more about people saying it's it's good to eat carbohydrates in the evening for that reason to store something tonight I'm a little skeptical of that I haven't really seen that but so is that your question okay okay yes that he wakes up hungry but he doesn't eat so what does he do in his body when he doesn't okay the question is what should this come he named Luna what should Lou do when he wakes up hungry and my feeling is that it would be okay to have go and have that little snack just a couple of bites of something and because that will satisfy the adrenals and keep the blood sugar more even so that you can fall back to sleep so I'll keep thinking about that what about three legs on it to do that exactly exactly so what you want to do is have it by the bed set that's you know have it as close as you can because that's a really good point and we'll see that in a minute when we turn the light on that changes everything okay so we'll come back we'll keep working on that so does anybody know what this is okay another perfect example of inflammation although that's not the kind of information we're going to talk about pain is a sign of inflammation well I recommend using for inflammation is turmeric and there's a lot of different forms it's their rage right now is to use turmeric and we what I have found is I have access to all the best supplements and there are some that bond the lecithin that they take the active ingredient from that turmeric that curcumin and bond it with lecithin and that really gets it into the cells unless event is an emulsifier it's made by our liver actually too and it mul suffice the fats in the cell wall and gets it right through and takes it to where it needs to go and I'd rather use the turmeric than an ting other anti-inflammatory pharmaceuticals once again they're they work now and they work every time things like ibuprofen in the different NSAIDs however they cause more they cause more injury to the intestinal tract which causes more inflammation as we've seen and they actually block the resolution of the inflammation and that I think that the overuse of the NSAIDs especially the over-the-counter type are what are causing a lot of the arthritis epidemic that we have in our world saw something I just read something about how Corey's like I'd go actually are the imaging it's a cardiac believe so mana was saying that the anti-inflammatory the NSAIDs can damage the cardiac the lining around the heart so and those that information is out there knows it's coming along we have our solution and I don't want to take too much time on this but this is actually a really good thing we'll come back to this too as we're falling asleep when we're lying down it's a perfect time to do some self massage so and as we're going to see we're going to tune in and see where are those pipes and paints and just holding that part can be very helpful but giving it some circular rubs and we'll talk about this well actually I think I have a little bit longer so giving Smith I call it combing out the tangles we call it ten on the tender let's see this book here is my favorite book of all time the trigger point therapy workbook you've all heard me talk about this and here's someone using what's called a theracane it's kind of a hook like thing so she can get around to the back and press on her back and you can work on your haulback you can work on your neck it has all these little points on it and if you talk it's talked about in here and here's a picture from this book of someone using a ball against the wall here but took on a role on that muscle on the bottom there we have 300 muscle over 300 muscles on each side of our body and any one of them can be tangled anything that we do repetitively causes those fibers to contract and release and eventually tango on spasm that's how that's that's the body talking to us pain is a signal from the body talking to us and telling us basically if we listen what it's saying is rub me and rub that spot so we find the tender spot and we give it ten little flushes just a couple more things about the effects and medications because this came up to many many medications almost in fact I took this from a book called drug muggers it's written by a woman who's a pharmacist her name is Suzy Cohen and she goes through all of the nutrients that we need that tells the effect of medications on all of those nutrients it's a book is listed in her handout it's an excellent book she writes quite well she writes kind of I call it Reader's Digest style kind of folksy kind but it's good and also it's really good to look up their drugs on drugs comics the easiest thing in the world to do I see a lot of people who are taking seven and eight ten medications and just just yesterday I was working with someone a gal and she was great because she was really didn't want to take she only wanted to take as few medications as she could I said you know a lot of people don't know what they're taking she Jeremy said people don't know what they're taking she just couldn't believe that but again that who can pronounce trophic opium I mean it's just these crazy names and you know here's a few of them well benzodiazepines that's a whole class of anti-anxiety drugs and there these are the main drugs that are this is it these are the sleeping pills and they're the ones that end in Pam diazepam lorazepam that's Valium Xanax ativan and so forth they knock you up and they knock you out now and they work really well you you vote you go to sleep you're at least you're in bed and your eyes are closed and you're not away but they're really interfering with that deep sleep that you need and another thing is they kind of loosen your inhibitions a little bit so you go oh yeah Diane said to go eat a snack oh yeah there's that cake I'm gonna have half of that instead of the broccoli and the chicken and so that and so that's a brother but I want to make sure to say this really clearly we do not stop any medication at all especially these right away they have to be taken down very very slowly and carefully because what they do is they interfere with a lot of our natural processes if we stop them and those natural processes have nothing to go on and so there's real problems it's it's the same thing with going off the opiates that were seeing in our country now and with some new ship nutritional support that can really go a long way but it's really between you and your doctor to take care of that so now we're coming to the center of the wheel here and I love this term diversity of culture because it's true on the outside and the inside we you know a diverse community is a strong community right I took this picture at the Standing Rock Day and look at all the kids it was really fun and but we also need diversity of culture in and in the microbiome of the body so we're gonna work our way towards that so this picture don't need to spend a lot of time on this picture but it sort of shows that we wake up in the morning and then we have noon and evening and night and and there's they find this this was just testing a group of people and they found that different things happen at different times like the lowest body temperature I'm not crazy about this because they say melatonin melatonin secretion stops and starts and I don't think it actually stops and starts it's a wave just like everything else it shows that we have certain things that happen during the day and I found this was this really answered some quite good questions for me I love doing these talks as I learned so much there's a chemical called adenosine and it kind of builds up during the day as we go along and when it when it gets high enough we turn it become sleepy and then it kind of gets it's cleared out at night and so we wake up and this explains how you can take a nap during the day we don't have to wait till yeah naps are not really on their circadian rhythm but if we have enough adenosine built up we can take a little nap so that gives us the drive to sleep so we're coming back to that first slide of the monitor the operator and the adaptors and now we're adding another little structure that's right there near the hypothalamus probably hi Neil most people have heard of the pineal gland as being the gland that watches the light and responds to the light and so we're gonna call it call that blend the clock because it's watching the light to go come and go during the day when the light becomes dim it triggers the release of melatonin which tells the body to go asleep and in the daytime like all the other all the other hormones they're feeding back to the hypothalamus and saying yes we've got enough where you know we're producing it and we're you know it kind of checks in all the other glands and hormones that they produce feedback to the hypothalamus to make sure that we have all the information coming in so that a hypothalamus knows how much - how much more to send out what's happening here is cortisol and non tonin are in a wave relationship with each other so so in cortisol is high melatonin is low like I said before and another thing that I wasn't able to fit on here is that cortisol can have a negative effect on the pineal if the cortisol is high basically that's saying the same thing cortisol can can block the effect the effectiveness of the pineal so that's why we we ten o'clock comes and goes and we're a little sleepy but we woke up and got that second wind how many people experienced that and we keep going and can stay up so that's cortisol I'm going uh uh we're not gonna go to sleep now we're gonna stay up melatonin is sold everywhere and it doesn't really make you drowsy it's what it's doing it's regulating that sleeping and waking cycle and so it's not really the best thing to take as a sleep aid per se so as the light fades the serotonin in our body kind of goes to melatonin is melatonin works by making the gaba released of them in the brain gaba is an inhibitory neurotransmitter so it slows everything down and then in the morning when the when the light starts coming in the window melatonin scurries away and now here's the key most of our serotonin and melatonin are made in our gut in the intestine the microbes in the intestine have a circadian rhythm as well so I've you see all different kinds of numbers but think they say we have about thirty trillion cells in our body well we have ten times that many microbes in and on our body and what I also like to say is they invented us to carry them around and it's really kind of true because they are communicating with every every cell in the body the brain especially brain health is extremely realizing a great deal on the health of the microbiome I call it now and so that's where we want to have that diversity of culture the healthier the microbiome I don't think that the healthier that culture is in the body the better our circadian rhythm is gonna work so this is a really good place to focus so things that are hard on that gut are any kind of processed foods especially gluten especially sugar obviously and high fructose corn syrup that's in the sodas that's why we don't drink sodas anymore then we want to plant with probiotics are the actual microbes themselves and cabbage has a natural affinity for lactobacillus bacteria so if we ferment it we'd let salt it and let it sit it turns into sauerkraut it's delicious and in fact there's a gal here in town Michelle who have you seen her Mendo ferments at the farmers market she's selling them at Mariposa now and this one is the fresh turmeric sauerkraut it has cabbage fresh turmeric ginger fennel grandeur black pepper fenugreek and salt fenugreek is a great thing for kind of thinning the mucus and getting wonderful that is medicine right there this is this is food as medicine right here and you and you eat a little you know a little glob of it with your eggs just fabulous kefir other fermented foods they're super easy to make as well and then we want to feed microbes with prebiotics either there's pre and pro and I've got a big list of those in your handout for you and they're all really delicious there's a few foods and I've got a longer list in your handout as well a food that promote melatonin production but we want to remember that melatonin is a hormone and when hormones feedback to that hypothalamus say so if we take a hormone as a pill that hypothalamus is going to go hey we've got enough melatonin we don't need to make anymore so if I stop taking that melatonin how much what what wait how do I make more melatonin because it's all fooled it's gonna take it's gonna really mess up my ability to to regulate those hormones so now finally we're up in the north and we're setting the environment for sleep and so our sleep environment we want to take care of the light nowadays they people are making amber lights there's two different kinds of light bulbs you can get that are kind of amber and so you can have those in your bedroom and keep the light low and you it's good to have blackout curtains if you live in a place where there's a light that you can't get out but generally instead of blackout curtains we tend to a favor wearing a mask because in the morning a little bit of light comes in and it and it does the job of help wake up so earplugs for noise one of the best things that I know for getting that cortisol to reduce is taking a hot bath or a warm shower and then sleeping in a cool room because that it sort of raises the corazon mantel opposite that's what though the amber lights do is they don't have the blue light in them and so we have a little bit of light here it's it's still early in the day Sun still up well Chris was just saying is that if if if you're working in a room where you have lights below you you know that's why we have lights on the bedside instead of up above so turn over the Oh turn off the overhead lights that's great important to have a comfortable bed my favorite is a latex foam rubber bed I'm not sure how available they are I know there's a place on the coast that has wonderful very nice foam latex beds and air beds anybody else have a type of bed that they recommend tempur-pedic people like that snoring can be a sign of sleep apnea and it's a very serious condition that needs to be handled and I was looking that up a little bit and there's there's basically two types of sleep apnea and there's obstructive sleep apnea where the palate gets in the way and causes that kind of noise but then if that goes on a long time it can become central apnea where it's more those the brain is waking the person up and one thing I saw so daughter of a CPAP machine which is sort of forces some air in there but there's now something that I saw and I checked it out just so you know what it was it's called a winks where it kind of pulls through a little suction pulls the tongue and the palate forward to keep it open so anybody tried any of those anybody how did you know that weak links with an X WI earners that is very important and pets can I say get them young and trade them to sleep in their own bed not to mention children okay and like I said I asked earlier about sleeping with your cell phone in the room I absolutely want to cut down on the Wi-Fi as much as possible I have access to a meter wasn't able to bring it tonight would take too much time anyway but there are meters on the market where you can actually test the level that's coming off of that and what we find it so if this is a cell phone right about here that the EMF drops off quite a bit so that's why we use our speakerphone I really do don't recommend holding it up to your head ever and so we want to have a place where we plug the phone in that's not in the bedroom yeah put it on airplane mode this is kind of important it's all it's all pretty self-explanatory but what we want to do ideally is it's ideal to have a regular bedtime and it through through the whole week even on the weekend if you have weekends off so with most people have to get up at a certain time and so you take that wake-up time and you count back seven and a half hours and you go to bed at that time and you set your alarm to wake up at that wake-up time and if you woke up right about when the alarm was going off and you feel refreshed you've got your ideal going to bed and waking up time if you were sound asleep when the alarm went off and you put it on snooze four or five times that means you need to to come back a little bit and and try again with a little bit earlier bedtime if you woke up before the alarm an hour before the alarm you could probably go to bed an hour later so it's it's a pretty obvious way to determine that so the basic sleep tips to fajn to finish up here as we want to really slow down you know something I've been trying to do is some of the extra things that I'm doing so that I have more time to have an extra hour to to prepare for bed at night and again the adrenals really like regularity and predictability really ideal especially if you're having adrenal fatigue to give yourself a couple hours to really prepare for Betty and turn the lights down take a bath that sort of thing and short list of some of the main herbs that we use I have a few more of them in your list and there's one of my favorite sites for herbs just for quick informations herbs mm oh they have they always have really good simple information if your cortisol is high Tulsi is a wonderful team we can get that now at the store Tulsi is also an adaptogen again if you're if you're too high it'll bring it down if you're too low to bring it up so Tulsi has a really good effect on lowering that high cholesterol and then we already talked about the adrenal tonic for a lower cortisone magnesium is one of the very most simple best ways to calm me down and I've listed a few different kinds I'm just trying out the magnesium three and eight glycine and threonine aren't two amino acids and that's how the magnesium is often prepared it's kind of chelated with an amino acid and threonine or magnesium three and eight and it's pretty much the only magnesium that's known to cross the blood-brain barrier so it has a really nice calming effect I use that last night it looked great yes I've been taking money but would you recommend it yeah yeah yeah magnesium at nights perfect change and gaba like I was talking about before as an inhibitory neurotransmitter nerve transmitter serotonin and gather are the inhibitory nerve transmitters so we want to promote those you can actually take gather as a supplement and if you really feel like you need to use melatonin especially if you were a shift worker or something like that I recommend starting with half a milligram it's hard to find that in this store I can get it but have to maybe one milligram would be okay about an hour and a half before you won't even want to go to bed not right before because it needs to take some time but then you want to you you don't want to do that every single night and I hear about people and I've seen recommendations for different illnesses of taking large amounts of melatonin and what does that do it feeds back up here it says stop making melatonin so we don't make our own melatonin anymore and it's it's really not a good thing to do I won't spend a lot of time on this foot bananas have a lot of magnesium in them and the peel has three times the amount in the banana so we make a tea out of it just wash it off cut off the ends and boil it just lightly for about three minutes and then steep it for a little longer and drink the water it's delicious it's a good source of magnesium yeah yeah the whole banana with the field yeah and just cut it in half so now it's morning the skies blue have you ever seen the vultures sunning their wings I thought that was a great picture so in the morning we want to take a moment to reflect on your dreams and the most important thing is to get out and see the Sun which now that we finally can or be outdoors see some blue sky or if you need to use a light box with a full spectrum light that really resets the melatonin better than anything to have that light in the mornings like it's a very very clear signal to the brain oh it's morning and whalemen is stopping and then that sets the circadian rhythm for the rest of the day water really important insomnia is a sign of deep or hypo hydration low hydration so drinking plenty of water through the day in the mornings of a great time to start drinking water green tea is one of the three things I know that stimulates the body to make antioxidants it's fabulous along with broccoli and turmeric there's our turmeric again breakfast is the most important meal of the day as we all know and it's really important to have protein how many people don't eat any breast it's so what we want to do to start with is just have a bite of some protein step I just gradually sort of work your way in to have the protein again got the shell cooked eggs recipe for you moving around in the morning is really important and if you have any kind of difficulty with your joints that keep you from actually going out for a walk or you can just wiggle a little bit he's kind of move all the joints with your fingers and your toes we're going to circle your wrists and ankles that makes a huge difference to get things going and and of all the things that I read about exercising in the morning is one of the best things to to to ensure a good night's sleep you call it forest bathing walking in the woods so now we're coming back down to the end here and we want to build a nest ways to relax we'll take a moment here so let's pretend like it's the end of the day snuggling in bed and we want to check in with how is our breathing going is it kind of tight or are we breathing it all what's my energy level how am I feeling sleepy or just wide-awake wired and tired that's both mental and physical fatigue when that's happening and it's a good thing to do just kind of scan through the body take a moment kind of scan through see if any part of your body's talking to you right now these sensations or maybe happening I call it the food to digestive tract what's going on in there is how is my nutrition today and my self-care in general and it's really important not to judge ourselves too much we do this just on just observing very lightly observing and you know what's the mental chatter what am i holding on to anything and so I've got a little touchstone here called enter without breathing extend to exhale that's easy but all of us have our breath with us we can always agree that with our energy we can build a nest and when I say a nest I'm thinking of an image in your mind's eye or or if you're not visual maybe it sounds maybe it's something tactile that feels really safe and comfortable to you a place you can go that where you are completely in charge of everything all your needs are met and so I encourage you to create an image of a nest you know how nest is made up of lots of different twigs and feathers well we choose we choose our favorite music our favorite people and our favorite color is our favorite location what does the ground feel like under your feet what is the air smell like it might be nice to have a little bit of essential oil if you like that sort of thing to evoke you know if you're a very smell or injure person to evoke that feeling of relaxation it's something that can be repeated and if there's pain and we go and we massage that part of the neck especially find those tender spots you give it that tan on the tender perfect time it can reach most the parts you can reach your legs really easy you can reach your neck it's relaxed when you're lying down and reach your arms if our belly is talking to us what do we do we eat a few bites of some vegetable and protein that's the ideal and if there's mental chatter we work to release that to relax that in Chinese medicine we say that our mind is here and so you know just just even putting in our hand our heart is about the size of our fist and so sometimes our heart is tight as if this too so if we just imagine this area relaxing can just hold our heart and breathe into that and exhale through it and that's one of the most calming things we can do if you have a lot of things to remember make a list so that it can you can forget about it the classic thing is to go through and think of things that you're grateful for and I also like to think of the body kind of kind of like an island you know how if you were cast a seed and you washed up on an island at first it would seem all mysterious and complicated but if you but within a month or two going around that Island they're learning where you are you'd know every rock and every tree and the body's kind of like that it's it's it's not linear the body's not linear it has lots of ins and outs and ups and downs and so but I encourage you that to get to know the body there's lots of good ways to do that the more we know ourselves the more we have choices of how to up to carry on a day definitely by about 9:00 o'clock when the Sun is gone down definitely want to be heading towards bad about that time that's or earlier and just remember that sleep is the most natural thing we don't we don't have to learn to sleep it comes naturally and so you can sort of forget about what we talked about tonight and really when we lie down it's it's something that just happens naturally all of those hormones just flow you don't have to make blue light one of the electricians that that's something that can't if the frequency of it can't really be replaced with Lane they can get close but if there's a hole basically goes up and it drop it down so you're not getting even full spectrum bolts don't quite get there because they can't reproduce that group so essentially they're good and bad blue light and when they get you know you've got manufactures that oh it's good to get good good blue light like it's not good to have around in the evening when you get ready for bed but it's good to have morning's like you said we wake up to day after life I have a feeling also that just regular lightbulbs kind of trick the eye a little bit and unless the light is specifically screening out the blue light and if it's an amber light then it helps us then it doesn't trigger that part of it so yeah fibroid glad in the endocrine system isn't that the main gland of the whole endocrine glands well it's good that you brought that up because I kind of purposely didn't talk about the thyroid that much pink but it but I sort of see the thyroid the thyroid is a Kegel and up here and it I see the thyroid if if the adrenals are happy the thyroid is more happy because if the adrenals get off balance then the thyroid has to come in and try to balance everything so as long as the adrenals and the reproductive hormones they're the base of the triangle they're the stirring levels if they're balanced then the thyroid can go on doing what it's doing and yep it's definitely part of sleep too so hope that didn't mention codependent tryptophan is also an amino acid like threonine and the lysine and tryptophan is the base of serotonin and it's it also is possible to take tryptophan or what's called 5-htp 5-hydroxytryptophan serotonin is 5-hydroxytryptamine and trip serotonin and trip 5-htp is high 5-hydroxytryptophan so they're very close that's something that we want to be careful with also because we don't want to over produce serotonin but take you and eating foods that have tryptophan in them like chicken and turkey both are good sources of tryptophan so yes in actually in your resources I've got a note for that that's something that I carry but it's kind of on the expensive side for me to hook to carry so I've been recommending that people go to any one of the sites that sell some supplements like vitamin cost or whatever higher there's a brand called source Naturals that is sold in the health food store I haven't checked at Mariposa if they have it but but you can get it online for just a little bit more than one I can even get it for whole so sorts Naturals brand they call it turmeric with myrrh even I've got that written yes that that's really ideal for it it that's kind of halfway between herbs and medicine it's it's a produced product it's the most effective thing I've found but people are making turmeric milk now with with little coconut man look at a little pepper because those are things that are considered to get it into the sambar but just eating turmeric like curry it's a wonderful food it's great for the liver it's cooling it's just excellent it's a great antioxidant but it's not as medicinal as the turmeric um are you sure you can cook with turmeric all you want that's great I feel like I feel that probably medical doctors are going to eventually go into that area because it's a huge industry um but sometimes you can find a functional medicine physician who has studied more than you know more different ways of healing but I'd be happy you know one of the things I like about what I do is I get to spend a couple hours or an hour and a half of people and that's really unusual and in Chinese medicine everything's connected you know there's nothing that only thing that's left out of Chinese medicine is the brain it's just the marrow but but you know everything and we see how everything's connected on it someone with headaches might have headaches because of neck pain or because of stress or because of eating the wrong foods so so we try to look on all three as we try to find out what's going on wait my wish for you is that you have sweet dreams [Applause] [Music]", "oHhzsm8OXVE": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of that crazy mixed up place you call your local dispensary today we are taking a look at a vape brand that is quite huge and one that has managed to escape our attention for some time here on wheats and that is the fine folks over at legion of bloom legion of bloom yes legion of bloon they make all kinds of different 5 10 um thread vape pot or carts as well as i think they partner with packs and make um different packs pods uh with their under their legion of balloon bloom line as well we are taking a look at their mendo breath indica 1 gram here today on the back we've got their lab testing results uh showing it coming in at if it'll focus uh 78 and thc uh and then as everybody's gonna want to know this comes in at 45 for a 1 gram but it'll never focus terrible at that 45 bucks for the one gram uh cartridge uh at a dispensary in long beach which puts it right smack dab in the average cost range for uh uh vapes at this dispensary mendo breath uh is a a strain that i'm not a huge strained guy but one that i do tend to like um and let's go ahead i'm a big fan of uh and by a big fan i mean i usually hate reading these sort of uh overly flowery uh pros that they these companies include on their packaging to sell you on them so let's let's lead you a little bit of the legion of bloom's story here legion of bloon is a coalition of eco-conscious cultivators with a deep reverence for the cannabis plant we carefully select terpene-rich genetics and capture their essence through solventless extraction methods combined with triple refined cannabis oil the result is a full spectrum experience unmatched in flavor and purity we invite you to join our legion nate let's join so let's go ahead and open this bad boy up uh let me go ahead and mention this packaging really beautiful packaging by the way uh it doesn't look that um crazy opulent either in terms of materials it's just very neat looking i really like the design it's sparkly and gold and i guess i kind of um uh you know um have the uh the sort of uh brain attention of a bird and like the shiny sparkly things gets my attention like this does uh i want to build a nest out of this legion of bloom cartridge packaging so we've pulled the little tab here let us slide open now is easy not too bad more uh marketing materials there and then in here we have got the thing itself wow okay a lot of materials nice thick plastic there and we're finally to the cartridge itself oh that is some nice looking oil guys yum that that oil actually looks incredible uh very thick looking uh incredibly pure oh i'm excited to give this a try this has got me really amped up uh it's got like the ceramic uh tip with that well it might be some kind of plastic it feels like ceramic um but it is a nice material i've seen a lot of uh the newer cartridges using this either higher quality plastic or some kind of ceramic uh it works a lot better than the cheaper acrylic tips so here we go let's finally give this mendo's breath a try hmm uh oh well my battery was showing that it was drying but i'm not getting anything let me try a different battery i have one here on standby let's give another shot well looks like i've got a bum battery sorry beloved um raw gardens battery you look like you're finally gonna have to join the collection in the sky uh but this battery works fine and this cartridge tastes great i forgot to mention they call this the monarch um with a hundred percent cannabis derived terpenes so this is uh triple refined cannabis oil and then all of the terpenes that are added back in are the terpenes from the mendo breath strain itself um it tastes like mendo breath that i don't know it's a very hard to describe taste almost spiced in a way i like it i like it a lot um and the oil itself is uh appears to taste as good as it looks uh quality wise so smooth um wow man that is quality stuff um yeah that just vaguely spiced taste that uh some mendoz mendo breath strain has this has in spades uh quite high already uh after those couple of hits you saw how smooth it was too i didn't really feel it at all going in um but rather big hits off not very hard draws as well um nice cartridge design seemingly as well from uh legion of bloom or they use a nice cartridge so far so good here oh wow guys i i i mean i barely feel it going in uh certainly feel it in the head as it's going out uh strong tasty um and just some really quality quality oil um this is a big old thumbs up so far for legion of bloom i can see why they have are a ten times award-winning company good for them uh great tasting not bad uh affordably priced right in the uh average price range at the dispenser i go to so so far this is a big thumbs up for a legion of bloom uh with their mendo's breath strain uh i am really really looking forward to finishing this one off uh as like all of our weeks reviews i'm gonna review the whole cartridge not just these first couple of hits because these things tend to leak they tend to clog they tend to break down all these things can pop up as you guys know so it'll probably take me about five days or so to finish this gram off uh really looking forward to doing that and as soon as i do i will come right back here let you guys know our wrap-up thoughts of this legion of bloom experience but first half so far so good anyways we'll see you guys right back here for part two in just a bit thanks for watching [Music] welcome back to weeds guys it has been about five and a half days since we started our journey with the monarch from legion of bloom their mendo breath strain this one gram 45 cartridge five days later my impressions are just as rapturous as they were before i really really really liked this one i like the quality of the oil like the taste of the strain that sort of spiced nutmeg cinnamony vague taste of uh the mendoz breath here was great um that oil as i said quality top to bottom never got that burnt taste never got that never started to burn that uh or get those big cloudy sort of vapor heavy hits nothing like that um just fantastic quality uh cartridge design worked incredibly well no clogs didn't have to get that like big first draw to get it going just a fantastic uh product really happy uh with the legion of bloom system not sure again why it's called the monarch it's got the mendo breath strain and the name the monarch but we'll forgive them we'll forgive legion of bloom we'll forgive the name the monarch because it's so good big old thumbs up here just as i had hoped and anytime we have a thumbs up this big we like to give a little cherry on top a little something extra that you can enjoy that is not necessarily weed related and you don't necessarily need weed to enjoy although this recommendation might want a little weed beforehand because it's going to make that penis all the better that's right we're talking pen 15 on our cherry on top a show that just entered its second season on hulu a phenomenal show hi thank you a phenomenal show that just entered its second season on hbo and by hbo i do mean hulu uh it is a one joke premise it is about two uh 30 something year old women who pretend to be middle schoolers around the era of y2k and they act with a bunch of 12 13 year old kids and say a bunch of foul-mouthed inappropriate things it sounds like it should get boring very quickly but it's actually hysterical and if you are like me in your early to mid 30s you're going to be very very at home in that aesthetic so check out pen 15 or as i prefer to call it penis on hulu and check out legion of bloom the monarch at your local dispensary two things that i enjoy having in my mouth a whole lot well", "lgNBBzDd6nI": "what up guys it's your boy genocide and sit here gonna

guys happy new year I'm pretty impressed the first week of the year you're out here you're out of the house you're like thinking about big questions in life probably right your wellness what you're gonna do next so we're going to have fun with this talk and there's a little theme running in with the subtext the theme is cancer and which is a villain and heroines are tough women the care providers and the people that are mastering it this woman is one of the more famous movie actresses named Mabel Normand yeah she got famous and a movie called race for life so I thought that was perfect and as you know this is me ob/gyn the more a contemporary way of saying ob/gyn is women's health and that's my daughter Olivia No so start out with a quote assumptions are dangerous things to make and like all dangerous things to make bombs for instance or strawberry shortcake if you make even the tiniest mistake you can find yourself in terrible trouble so thinking about health it's my intent that we get up to facts so that we're not making even the tiniest mistakes with ourselves and when we talk about cancer and women mostly but what I'm putting up this person today might know who this is yes because she did not in fact I have cancer she died of one of the most common thing to die of especially in older age but she was in the hospital at least 70 times had at least 3 different kinds of cancer and so I you know her personal life was somewhat more interesting at times than her career life but it was all interesting and she's pretty amazing and there you have it she died of heart-related complications so heart related complications or heart disease or heart attack is actually the number one killer of women in general which is maybe surprising everybody thinks with cancer but it's it's heart disease but if you took people by different ages the thing that you're at risk for it is different so young people the number one thing is accidents people in the middle it is cancer two people at the end it is heart disease but these people who you may or may not recognize all represent some other cause of death so the big picture Grace Kelly so she yeah she's supposedly had an accident because she's only like forty four or something but they think she had a stroke and strokes in the top five and then the top right she is so beautiful but she was not that hot of an actress eight gave a partner she was born on a tobacco farm smoked and she died of respiratory complications emphysema pneumonia and that's in the top five and then bottom right very good now we would write so she actually didn't have an accident also under spurious causes butt cancer Italy says leading cause of death in that middle age group 44 to 65 Green flus and what we can do to protect ourselves these are the top cancers in women so most people what do you think of breast right because it's so publicized but really the number one cancer number one numbers of cancers in women skin and we'll talk a little bit about skin number two is lung probably nobody thinks at one and then breast and colons but what kills people from cancer the most common are not the most commonly found but it's lung cancer and ovarian this beautiful woman did not have either of those she had another weird cancer pancreas so do you recognize her he's pretty old Joan Crawford I know I'm trying to find interesting photos of them bridgitte okay so we're gonna go into the first cancer I want to talk about and they're part of the reason for showing all the celebrities is because we are all celebrities to somebody and everything we do is influencing other people and then actual celebrities whose wives are so open to us they really have an impact so when the stars start smoking or when the stars when it becomes popular to be tan naked on the beach and tan the whole country starts doing it and what you'll see with the statistics of what kind of medical issues we've had over the decades it does change as we adopt and unadopted a lot of times are started by these people that we admire so brigitte bardot do you know the top right right and the the bottom right is somebody may not know her name is Eva Cassidy's has one of the most beautiful voices you have never probably heard of and I put her in because she grew up in a farm in Maryland was outside all the time and at 33 died of melanoma so she had like three or four albums produced after she died she was so beloved so skin cancer that's what they're up there for there's three types melanoma is the nasty one that's pictured there it's the one that's tends to be more deadly the other two are squamous cell and basal cell basal cells the most common neither one of those tend to kill you but they cause a lot of disfigurement because you have to have them burned or frozen or cut off and the risk factors for skin cancer sun damage smoking and the one thing that I would advise is getting an annual screen most people just think their general doctor is gonna pick up on this most of the time you hit like 3035 all of a sudden whatever you did as a child starts showing up on your skin and then at 50 a whole nother crop of your life shows up on your skin with the skin in particular it's something as different than it used to be so funny shape irregular borders it changing the color a bigger diameter or something that's growing over time you probably recognize the guy yeah Christopher Reeve so his wife Dana Reeves was actually the person who was affected and then the bottom right is a famous opera singer right you guys are rock stars they are bringing us to the next cancer which I wanted to point out Dana reads because this is really not fair but it's the fact she didn't ever smoke but she got lung cancer and secondhand smoke or smoke that you're exposed to when you're a child is as damaging so this is the number one most fatal cancer men and women and its more common than breast prostate and colon combined this one in 16 will be diagnosed and that increased 114 percent increase that's about the time after all those beautiful screen stars glamorized smoking and before we debunk this whole thing that cigarettes weren't dangerous okay so this you guys recognize this one yes so there she is smoking looking you know knock out dead gorgeous so symptoms of lung cancer cough chest pain shortness of breath coughing up blood weight loss fever and loss of appetite next body part so the big picture she's actually a real star yes judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg she's amazing person who's really done a lot for civil rights women's rights and Farrah Fawcett and the singer is Eartha Kitt so two of them had breasts and Farrah had what we're representing with this picture which is : so risk family history of colon cancer or one of the hereditary cancers or personal history of a polyp or sometimes other cancers like ovarian or breast those can increase your risk of colon it has a age-related risk kind of goes up over time then it drops down like an 80 Crohn's they're all sort of colitis you're at increased risk and then there's people who eat a fattier diet people who smoke people who are overweight and people who are not as active and it's independent so it's not diet leads to and diet and sedentary leads to overweight it's all of those things independent and that's a picture of the colon so it's not I you know there's the esophagus the stomach all the small stuff that the colon is just that part and she is yes breakfast took me yeah she's been diagnosed with that so lifetime risk so compared to what did we just do wrong which is one in sixteen as one in 20 still a lot third most common cause of death and it's kind of silent so I have a lot of people come into the office and they say well nobody has cancer in my family or I don't want to have that colonoscopy because I don't have any symptoms it's like yeah well if you have symptoms you definitely get checked so change in bowel habits and I'm going to get really glamorous to talk about that less frequent more frequent change in caliber change in consistency blood or black weight loss and being tired if you come in and you get checked you're in that left hand side where we're going to find Apollo before it becomes a cancer if you don't get checked over time that little polyp will grow and then it will start maybe having symptoms but when it's at the stage of a polyp you're not going to necessarily have any symptoms the procedure is the thing to do which is a colonoscopy so you have your cleansing and then you go in and have some nice sleep and so they put the camera in that whole length and as they're backing out they're looking at every inch of that and if they see a pulp they take it out twenty minutes if it's negative you're good for ten years colonoscopy so we see it and we take care of it and if the pulps gone your risk of progression is gone as well exams and those imaging studies only do that sigmoid part which in Idol pointer but that the bottom like curve so all the rest of the bowel that you're looking at where all these numbers are 1917 11 6 that all that so half of it more than half of it gets missed melissa etheridge rate and the top right gloria steinem right on and then the beautiful English version so now we're getting serious 1 in 8 the reason why you can think of so many people including your friends and family probably is because look how often it shows up one and eight but then the next thing one in 36 chance of dying from it so that means that we're actually either finding a lot and they're not that serious or we're carrying them either way that's good there are lots of types so I bring that up because there's lots of parts to the breast there's a glands ducts nipple fat skin all the different things can create a cancer and when you're talking to your friends and relatives and you think well the doctor didn't do that for me it's because the management of stuff is different for whatever stuff you have and breast cancer is so common and there's lots of comparing and contrasting of what we're doing and what the doctors are doing all the time in all of these subjects but this one's really easy to visualize I think so the risk factors for this are reproductive history which means how old you were when you got your period how old you were when you've had your first baby did you breastfeed how old were you when you quit having a period how many pregnancies did you have did you use birth control pills those kind of questions get at EFT probably weight is a risk factor smoking again as a risk factor certain chemicals lack of exercise and then this is also very well known to be related to some hereditary syndrome so a genetic defect we have identified can increase your risk we'll get to that in a second screening so again with all these things like skin cancer we look at your skin colon cancer we do the colonoscopy the rest cancer we do a study trying to look for things earlier then you're gonna find it by the time it's a full-on disaster and the the typical things are depending on what the symptom is again if you had a nipple discharge you're gonna do that bottom thing dr. Graham but for most people the screening test is a mammogram and sometimes in a young person an ultrasound and sometimes when we have a finding it's all of those mammogram ultrasound an MRI to try to calm down on is this real and what is it likely to be but the diagnosis is by a biopsy that's the only way you're going to know yes so that's light on the right shows more birthdays have been celebrated because the death rate from breast cancer is going down down down down down part of it is mammogram Mammal around picks up 90% and it picks it up 10 years before you're going to feel it some people say well what about this kind of test or that kind of test every other screening test out there doesn't do it okay so this is a more contemporary start and she's up here to write on all right they're not a good picture she is to remind me to talk about those hereditary syndromes so 80 90 percent of the breast cancer just come up it's called autosomal dominant so you have to you've got one that's messed up you're going to get cancer and then you could pass that on so there's the dad with two genes and the mom was two genes in it the mom passes has a 50-50 chance of passing it on to the kid then the kid has a 50-50 chance and that's what Angelina Jolie had she her mom had a cancer so she got tested she had that Braca one that's what they are bracket 1 bracket 2 she had that gene and she decided to have a double mastectomy to decrease her risk and was that a reasonable decision sure she had a funny mammogram she had a pre cancer the pre cancer doesn't tend to go to cancer but it does say she's at increased risk plus she had the family thing so it was very very hard to find any pictures or any celebrity or any well-known people have cervical cancer I think the reason is the risk factors for cervical cancer are a little bit different than all the other cancers which we think and on the right is this really fascinating book about American woman who was treated for cancer got a biopsy and then they just took hers hers biopsy material and they started cloning it and it was the first ever cell line that didn't die so it got drawn you write I still write to this day there's enough first all I need to go around blow up a few times so she's immortal she's dead or so and that's a cancer cell line but they have used that stuff to diagnose genetic diseases and cancers and test drugs it's amazing it's kind of amazing cervical cancer has decreased 50 percent as a result of screening so this is like a real win story and sort of medical care some guy came up with a test that you could easily do in the office on wait patients and would identify people who were at a pre cancerous stage and give you plenty of warning to go do something about so they didn't get cancer and the treatment was easy that free cancer stage so there was a big push in the last few decades to get I'm going to get that you don't get the only cervical cancers that have seen in ten years last ten years of mine for years people who have been like five seven years between each other and they come in HPV is human papilloma virus and this is why I think was hard to find famous people who came out to X or attention we need to like talk about this against out in public because it's a viral infection that's passed between coats and all those it's an STD there's about 100 HPV viruses identified and there's about 15 that are significantly increase your risk themselves when their cervix that could be compounds there is now coming in like five eight years of vaccine against those big types so in my own personal practice days to spend 50% of the time treating pre-cancer now and i have this really nice expensive machine i could've bought a car but i bought that and i really use it like ten times it's so sad look good for you people because it means we're let me wait Reuters early detection needs to cure her Betsy permits this is like what you wanted all the medicine fine either than anything and fix it before it starts or vaccinate against it or figure out what risk factors to Italy and then at the last week of her find it early so that close just to be redundant risk factors for cervical cancer anything that increases the chances that you're going to get exposed to one of those 100 HPV viruses so the earlier start having sex with more party pad and again smoking has there been anything that showed up on this that didn't have smoking in there that's interesting so most of your body is constantly making cancerous cells all day every day but your body is also whitening about all day every day it's when you start to lose the battle for the race that you actually don't get the cancer and so these insults chemicals toxins bad food is compromised which might be the entire rest that is sort of helping you lose all right so symptoms so these are say you're not one of those really but people who come in change pain that's it okay so where are we going on this eat away First Amendment oh okay this is the bottom right really famous great okay so top right friends with any of the photos that she is that heard about a legendary intellectual one so we started out the cervix and then we're going up to the top of the pair rarely enemies this is the most common gon happen so the gon cancer cervix uterus ovaries fortunately it's the most common is is easiest to deal with because it tends to have a warning sign very curable found early and gently because most of the time people are changing rapidly and changes painting so when I have to come in office who used to have a five day period now I've so big that it doesn't change in my mind I've laid out the thought process of I have to make sure they don't if they're they have changed in only 35 and they were police Sam you know anybody who has any period or any believe you not gonna quit I didn't agree for this most commonly it happens and the other associated respect is our weight diabetes high blood pressure infertility unopposed estrogen yeah you can get it from medications or like some people they'll go to the story take custom and there's so pain problems your remaining sometimes mass weight loss so then the any prices dress so the nanny she's like the first person to get a lot of public notoriety around endometrial cancer and then she may be like five years after she was diagnosed start organization team called cancer schmancer so yes it was said that freaky Wanderlei corona Christine she is something she so he got shot and she'd been there so that's everything all the stuff the civil rights and going to that with everything and she just stepped in and took it over she didn't stop she and then the top right and then the person who could really brought this one into so this is not very common so most of us can't think of anybody but when he do know something it was bad it's used so the lifetime risk is really little number compared to rest with one in eight this 173 most of the time you are not finding it till your stage 3 or 4 X usually we go 1 2 3 4 1 is easy we always wanted n to be true now everyone and I think you're right but we always seem like a lot of times we're finding over exact 3 or 4 so it's like 40 and so that's why it's the highest number of female cancer death because we get it too late you don't have a good screen you don't know how it's gonna be even on a pap smear we don't have you know it's not that it's it's harder to find it to us too late and the risk factors so as you it's the same as with all the other ones are so it goes up and up and up over time and then it maybe dips down a little bit it seems like if you live to be easier like cruising weight reproductive history again which has to do with how the deworming starting period did you interrupt your periods path pregnancy to use birth control pills and how old are you stop that seems to pregnant personal history feminist and the severe symptoms the symptoms are so big is why we don't find it very soon but if you promise when I find somebody with it I can always dig back and find out yeah they did have something but they did just think that much of it they obviously older but something it kind of ignores it because it's a little bit subtle so bloating belly pain swelling and a lot of us who never leave us with the house and it will last the beginning and it's different for you it's worth not getting insomnia out of freaking out this we're thinking maybe I should get a outside opinion changing their function sometimes so that right hand side is to show that everything that happens with it over existing cancer most of it isn't and young people 99% of it isn't and people over 50 probably two-thirds to 70% isn't but non or malignant tumor because they always have all this other stuff they do all the time they make sis that's its job is to a go where the egg is coming out of this kind of system that's the dilemma is when we were looking at the ovaries a lot of wrong stuff doesn't look that different that stuff so you have to fine-tune I look at I have to look that over time if the thing does go away and then you get excited bigger you get excited if it's solid so help me to be good for a long time you picked up on the theme - 20 years right before I went to medical school my daddy's rapist newsletter at Thanksgiving to all the family and they asked me to put the article in there so I have put an article on you know five whole tips it was five SS because I didn't but it's the same fight when I was 20 years old seat belts so big thing that comes death in young people is car wrecks sunscreen safe sex may be sensible wait so that did one category to say eating the right things not eating too much of certain things having kind okay so here's four heads she did it on heels [Music] all right is there any age when people should not have pap smears or have them less frequently so you can have them less frequently if you've had a number of normals and are with the same burger and your test is negative and they they do two things we do the path and we do the actual HPV test which is new if you're me all that and you're double negative you go five years if you just have a negative packet you know three if you have no cervix this is new you don't even have to do it if you have a hysterectomy so the little cervix left and you've had it for something besides cervical problems you could play which is different than they used to say the pap smear recommendations have involved the most of anything because the test is getting better and better all the time and the better the test is more you trust it so we really trust it and we usually don't start young as we used to used to start soon as that robot in the room now we don't start to dr. 20 and the reason is people a lot of people have HPV and they get rid of it so we don't really want to know if they have HPV because we don't know what we're back to a cos they're going to hear it on their own and so we start worrying about 30 why do you think about the three years I'm place I'm okay so that I I what I have done in my practice for those on every year when I got here as I slowly well advanced people yeah you know as I got to know them know because part of it is a lot of people haven't even been to the doctor in ten years so I would like to pay you know try to make the most of that maybe I had you know I was going to quit but I did one last one in the national so I think it's on paper it is okay but I haven't really gone for the five year most efficient so most of those even family it's discouraged but that for ready three breast ovarian cancer things that I have the shadow Braca so the tip-off is of male and your family somebody who's for all the genetic things so there's a you know so maybe in town whose son under twenty had a colon cancer that's a tip up to do the genetic testing bilateral so yeah i cancer both eyes twelve restful kidneys you can't both sides affected that's a typical student test so too young or the wrong gender so you have a man and family on breast cancer so the wrong gender has it by one-on-one younger than you'd expect and what i usually ask in the obviously is high relative so mother sister daughter in do a few should like i should ask the father said crossly so people with that age they're at risk for lunch we find little people they because that will decrease your risk of breast and almost increase surveillance or sign especially if they're young but because the longer they live because screen and then there's really specific tests there's not just one test where do we catch genetic consults could you talk about the resources in our community here they're not here I think we have to at least get the center resident John you're probably the city kind of few people that have gone into each direction so I'm a regular do you and are running a cheek I don't you care of actually that cancer there's GYN cancer specialist and non do you man can't there are the ones who would actually take care of people with find it I'll go away to get you there take care of you afterward so usually that first person is - a genetic test but like you were interested then we without find something yeah you mentioned fats diet yeah and diet and I'm curious but I'm curious what you mean you know if you could say a little more about that what I'm so fat sir overall it's not it's the kind of fat so it's not a low-fat and nonfat it's the trans unsaturated they're trans stuff so why I never want to tell somebody they shouldn't even when it should be Webster animation became you over it's kind of there's too many variables but what it seemed like most of the good signs protein and animal fat isn't necessarily bad but how you prepare it so butter is fine marker is not that great both that milk they're locating it's not that much of it baby there's stuff they're putting in it that's actually probably cottage cheese of this stuff up there gene and maybe that's not that great but almost everybody says lots of vegetables and plenty of fruit the whole stuff not the juice honey not sugar they're saying are Gavi as to stuff we always think is great like soy based on soy is this is my convoy editorial now I think of the GMO yes wait corn I was just reading an article from an old consumer report a few days ago they talked about so much of the gluten-free products are made with rice flour as we know yes and the arsenic in rice and is really very serious levels to the point where children should not be given lots of vegetables they need Rhonda you just give up a delivery thing well see that's a problem you're not [Music] [Applause] do you have women in your practice who have had hysterectomies and they're dealing with the sudden onset of menopause yes but what's interesting is even if you take out their ovaries because of chronic rejection from breast cancer or ovarian cancer you can give them estrogen back because the amount of estrogen your body is putting into system they're like 10 or 14 times what that little bit after them isn't that the data does not seem to increase your risk just miraculous so of course actually even putting the system has made a comment you're anything to get they're gone it's not related but it doesn't seem like it's increasing the unfortunate thing is people are so so worried about breast cancer because it's not that they don't want to take any chance even though the fact is they're probably there individual but I not against it at all people have to live in live well then there's people who never need it go to every dentist and I have no urge to give them and then there's people who were 80 and there's daughter and we are not the same without it what do you think so the the main thing about osteoporosis is fracture so number one about fall and that's the baby think seriously that's not silly but the biggest thing you could do is to maintain a good weight and continue to be active so that you continue to have good balance and there's Tai Chi really brilliant for helping all of your sentences go over time your ears your eyes your taste buds and your balance is one of those mean doesn't tell you people start walking a little whiter because we're not that great with balance after all right it's all drinking but so number one don't fall and waiter do to work on us stay active and watch your weight of a single stuff but so now what we have evidence that the medicines and we'd like to give you we maybe just can't give you forever so some people don't want to get her arms forever can't and other people don't mind me on phone bill goes forever and it shouldn't be because any stress do not look that great so the the logic is if you're going to be on hormones go on and stay on them till you feel like you can't and then there's going to be a link yeah once you go out on your own you're going to start to get thinner and then there's a time when you might consider going on a bone agent and you want to get on that if you're gonna do on it when it's going to be really relevant so when your bones are kind of bad and the risk of falling high enough that the risk is higher than that there was good drug until they do all these fancy calculations and so we used to start screening for bone but penis versus like somebody that middle-class he'd wear it longer a service now we kind of don't do that anymore I don't mind if somebody wants it I would do it it's easy but we really must check like 7075 because that's when your yes but yeah I think I mean some people don't think that's right I I think by the D is going into the many ways and the more studies that come out there I see that yeah calcium and vitamin D are building blush they've gone so if you don't have the building blocks unless you have a medical reason where you shouldn't take too much like a thyroid parathyroid or some of the kind of kid anything where you're doing something funny with your calcium I think most people can BL see any other presentation because it seemed like the recommendation was bigger and then a few years ago it sort of got ratcheted down yeah I I know that's out there and it has to do with the stone and I think that's a overreact that so much to stuff but I know that there's dr. John Callender they're kind of confusing they say you know you probably should take about two cups with any not say well why not and what would I take so I still say the same thing that they're menopausal and not a moment it's five hundred three times a day did your body work so much and you know if you're taking remand it could be less you get a lot of your diet k2 590 put things where they belong that's the latest about here the whole lot of nutrition and supplements huge omega-3 you know good it's best to get everything in your diet if you can there's a few things that if you need iron vitamin b12 I would say first take that 12 today kind of priestly kind of improve muscle in your nervous system good for your brain and that summer later this year you're going to talk with all centers because fermented were helpful but also at which time [Applause] you", "zlLQ4VKS-Ck": "okay hey stow the liver oh this groove here this is right whoo this is the left lobe this is the inferior vena cava hepatic portal vein a paddock artery and then this is the round ligament sick apart here and then they'll continue to form the falciform ligament then we'll talk about ducks by all dug these little things a little green lies you see represent bile ducts they'll join to form the right and the left hepatic dozens of which will join to form this which is the common hepatic duct and then this is the gallbladder or bile excess file is stored by Oh will come up through the cystic duct and then this is stick duct in the common hepatic duct will join together to form the common bile duct which will go into the small intestine they do autonome of the small intestine that's it", "rfspZrI1_ew": "[Music] [Applause] this program has been agreed for many of us for many years firstly when I was from the Bay Area and 25 years ago I wanted to health education program and now we have one I really happy to present Diane and the speaker tonight Diane's been licensed acupuncturists for since 1985 and been in wells for 10 years and her passion is making our very complicated body simple for people to understand it and to really make some positive changes once they understand it so I'm happy because that plans Molly [Applause] thank you everyone I see a lot of familiar faces everyone have you noticed going down commercial is beautiful with like trees all around town it ropes us to look up and we're looking out and springtime is a time that we say that the lure is most active and I'm going to be sprinkling a little energy medicine type of things throughout and so if you have questions about those fill three different my batteries but springtime is is the time when the liver is a twinkie nothing and couple years ago I realized that that's one of the function and that's one of the ways we use the flowers as we see them and through our eyes that the eyes are related to the liver so that wakes up our liver and we're gonna be talking a lot about the livers you might say so I'd like to do a little experiments with relatives and I believe that when do you kind of wiggle your fingers or with your hands like that yeah but we call that the twinkle it sort of connects the two sides of the brain so everything tonight remember don't [Applause] [Music] toki that everything three months everything I'm going to say is in a handout and so another strategy I have is nodding that kind of gets the sound like rocking the brain it gets all the juices going in the brain and so that will get the information in there this is very important information so anytime you feel like it you know you couldn't let your head nod and so I have three main goals for us and I'm gonna I'm gonna say right now so the first one and then what this dearest to my heart is to admire so that's one of our goals and appreciate and we're going to make a connection with all the digestive tract and the whole concept of inflammation inflammation and you ever noticed how there is a million diets and books some experts telling you what to eat how to eat it Michael Pollan dr. oz Adelle Davis Robert Atkins Julia Child so well I have one of those ideas too but and it's something that I've been using now since I first started my practice and it has to do with and one thing I'd like to you make real clear I hear a lot of people talking about eating an alkaline diet this this is this is the pH scale and but before I go into that I'm gonna say a little bit warm up that idea that I learned up to me that's a little bit abstract the only way to know what my saliva the page of my saliva is test it with strips that means I have to carry something around with me well guess what we always have with us are not so if we use our body as a reference heart we're going to be able to feel drop down or feel what's going on we're going to be talking about the digestive tract and we have to admit it's kind of a delicate subject certain instrument thing you are a digestive tract and it's really typical for do you even have that kind of reaction how many of you have that okay well actually that's a completely normal thing to to feel because it's it's in our interest to have an aversion to see and that's why we now eating is completely automatic thing in fact once we come out of the room and we're born we breathe first ideally but then what's the very first thing we do and we're so run from the beginning eating is is central to our lives if you ever noticed how hungry we have to eat three meals a day or warm sometimes so and and so let's see mmm feeling hungry you know I don't have to say where's that refrigerator again it's completely automatic and when things are that automatic individual if we want to make changes it's something that we need to do very slowly and gradually and we want to be gentle with ourself surrounded me make our eating time more conscious and I'll bring it into our conscious awareness and eating it so automatic it's kind of like driving did you ever notice when you first start learning to drive you've had it don't you Karla like this we've been trying if you had a shift and all that so there's a lot of church after a while you know you can it's completely natural when you come up to a green light what do you do and so what we're gonna find out tonight what we need to sit down to eat so what do we do when we see something like what do we need when we sit down to eat [Music] pH is how about the blue P big H and it what I believe it stands for you combine different definitions but since for the potential of hydrogen to be taken up or given off this anyone know hydrogen is the most prolific you're pretty smart living and so and so it's it's a scale for for the potential of hydrogen to move around to connect and the scale goes through the 0 to 14 with 7 feet right in the middle and the plastic neutral substance not either is water it's not always a 7 but generally engines and just so happens that our blood wants to be between 7.35 and all the organs in our body have something to do with with keeping that pH even we don't even have to think about it it just happens underneath a suspenseful now we are going to be talking about two different parts of the digestive tract and the first one is under that has has an acid Dornier one is one to be under acid control and door number two is going to be under another way to think of it is that acid is hungry and so it it's empty so it wants to take on those hydrogen on it so it eats electrons further we go to alkalinity it has extra hydrogen ions so it wants to donate electrons if you ever heard how an alkaline burns consider to be more serious than a passive burn because it's it's putting stuff in instead of just taking my collages are all the ready so I made a collage and the first so I've got it kind of covered up here because the first most important part okay this is a model of a restaurant we're going to talk about flow of food through the restaurant and then we're going to use that as an illustration for how food flows through to and the most important part of the restaurant are the managers so they are sitting around the table deciding what to cook and and how to promote the restaurant and so forth and their information comes out to them and so starting here and I've got this color green for a reason as you can see it's the same as what's on the pH chart and here we have the farm it's a nice green farm people making choices choosing foods to eat and to grow and with excites the senses and then the food is trucked in through the road into the kitchen where the chef is at work making soup and we have lots of different kinds of chefs and in this restaurant this is a soup restaurant and if you notice you could see these these bowls of soup have little garnishes on them and so just before the soup goes out the door it is who the dining room it gets a little garnish put on it going through the door and now we're in the dining room or people are having fun sitting there eating their soup and loving their food and I love this guy and absorbing the nutrients they're they're taking the food and then lastly as out the back door 1:02 is here we have the bathroom our week out that we could say straps are going out from the kitchen into the compost pile and the cyclist that's our restaurant on the very front of your hand so let's let's now focus in on what we're carrying around with us our food too and we're going to kind of use some of those restaurant ideas to a straight so we start out with the mouth what you call that the farmer because in the mouth we're preparing the food tuna and getting it ready to go to market and what we're going to notice that there there are different secretions and all the different stages of the edges of travel and the secretion of the mouth is saliva and we're also going to look at the pH of these different secretions just because the pH tells us something about what it does this is how I first learned it from my teacher if you get in a hot tub you're all relaxed and warm and everything and sort of floating well if we took your pH we took your pH we'd see that you were more on the acid side heat causes the body to go a little bit more towards acid an acid has the effect of relaxing a little more assertive relaxed on the other hand what happens when you go out on a cold day start shaking well we could say that cold brings the body a little more towards alkalinity this way and and it costs 50 shoes to contract this is really important acid plastic ethylene contract that's not the the saliva is slightly alkyl in this others there's a little bit of contraction maybe not that much in fact in a little bit we're gonna have a treat and I encourage you to when you when you drink the carrot apple celery parsley that we juice em just kind of let it sit in your mouth and notice how what happens with the cilantro so the key here we would see an alkaline environment that's the proper environment for the enzymes to work and there are enzymes in their saliva that start the starch digestion mainly and I heard enzymes described as molecular scissors today so then we chew our food up and slaughter for most City esophagus and now the food is in the kitchen we could put what we call that the stomach and the stomach is where the food is I call it them the macro digestion if food is being broken down into a soup into a liquid it just so happens that the lining of the stomach makes a very very strong acid and here it is stomach acid one point one it's really really sparkles we love that acid because it helps us to adjust our proteins and it's but an also calcium and iron without that hydrochloric acid we would have a hard time digesting them now we also I also mentioned there a little bit on the floor floor to talk about what are some occurs when you're under stress well the stomach needs a good supply of blood to make that hydrochloric acid but Tiger came in through the door right now I would go into an alarm mode and when I'm in alarm mode the blood is being shunted out to the arms and legs so I can run or five depending on and afraid I'll tend to run we don't always get to do that but that's that's how we're wired temporarily the blood some of them are not but some of the blood is gonna be shunted away from the digestive tract and so when I'm in that alarm mode that is not a time to be eating or digesting yeah that whole process kind of stops for a while and then it comes back when we get a chance to rest and so that term you know that tends to cause the storm to not work that well when we're in that so now do you think we'll how come the stomach doesn't just digest well the chef is really clutter and the chef makes a nice mucus coating to protect the stomach like it's just an amazing [Music] okay so now we've got a nice acid contents in the stomach the stomach contents are leaving and going into the small intestine and in most cases there's flow from the vial has both from the pancreas coming together into one two and then it enters into that small intestine here's the small intestine that's that's a commonly that's what it looks like not everyone some people have to open there's all kinds of so now we've got this acid coming through here and we're coming through the door between the kitchen and the dining room and what does acid do new tissues relaxes them so that door opens up and we have float in Congress [Music] guess what the pH of flow from the liver gallbladder and the pancreas vary and so today so the first thing that's gonna have the main thing that's gonna happen is it's gonna neutralize the acid coming from the stomach really important we don't so it neutralizes the stomach acid now it sets up the proper environment for the enzymes to do the magician now we're in the small intestine and it doesn't look anything like what I draw here in fact that I brought my amazing mom and I'll tell you I've spent a lot of time trying to make a body it doesn't look anything like because nature does a much better job but the reality and the reason I the reason I did this is because this month because what we think of the small intestine it's not just this big long - it's a long - but it's encased in this membrane it's got this incredible memory because and I've actually read just recently that that it's actually in life it's more like 10 feet long but it tends to relax we've got we've got this is how this is how the blood gets to the small intestine you know because it's blood vessels don't just go along they couldn't make them and they all collect they all come down together and collect all the way down to the end here and then we have the large intestines starting here and they all come together this is the most important thing is that from the small intestine all the blood coming from the small intestine and that's this blue stuff here it's all coming together and attached into the liver right so here and you and on the backside of your front page you have a picture that looks somewhat this is really more detail and so we've broken our foods and elements of such tiny little particles themselves there's small intestine it looks like a tube at first but it's extremely full than a mustard and the whole temples and so when we look down tiny detail we see that there are what they call it villi micro digestion that's breaking down by the enzymes happens and the food it's so small that it can actually pass in through these cells out in between here's a blow-up of the actual edge and see the folds have holes this small intestine is smart and knows what can come in or what Canada so it allows them through and eventually they get absorbed into the bloodstream and this this diagram here showing the lymph vessel and there are lymph vessels and blood vessels each one of these blue of their life but the vessel is mainly where the fat tends to be absorbed and then the blood vessels are all the nutrients going and all of this goes first doesn't travel through the body no peanut butter your lips just so the liver has a job in deciding what to do and so now we've got door number two here at the end of the small intestine and we call that the ileocecal valve it's developed between the end of the small intestine the beginning of the large intestine which is community and now coming through here it's different from up at the beginning we have a very alkaline environment since the stomach continues to produce a little bit of alkaline substance in it becomes more alcohol as it goes along and now we've got a nice alkaline environment here and that's going to hold that door closed when there's nothing needing to move through we want that door to be closed exactly a large intestine is where all those bacteria butter novel probiotics there via the good bacteria all the trillions and trillions of bacteria they live in the large intestine and their job is to break down what's left into a form that can be eliminated smoothly and so we don't want that waste coming back into the small intestine so we want that door to be kind of closed when it's at rest but when it's time to move through we want things to be able to move on through it just so happens that the large intestine or all of that good bacteria that's living in there the main product is some lactic acid so there's a slight acidity to large intestine and that allows that door to open when it's time so just to review that we started out with the farmer and that was slightly out of the way we went to the stomach very strong acid and we went to the small intestine were absorbing so what's not wrong on this charge but what is illustrated really Bo in this beautiful small intestine I'm looking for names for my creation so far I've got in Tokyo when it's over so this blood supply all this blood supply is going to the Liberty so the liver receives that one and it one of the main things it does is it filters the blood and produce this bottle we make about a quart of violet day this is a quart the Bible is out flow just like the kidneys make your liver makes bile so and here are some attributes a bottle so I'm getting to your question so so that is a flow of things it was the waste of material but anything we want to get rid of deliver packages in the way that it goes out through through the small intestine helps to emulsify fats the two main components of bile are lecithin and cholesterol so vial is an outflow for cholesterol right liver makes cholesterol and so any extra cholesterol there might be you can flow up through lecithin is the emulsifier if I had if I had a jar oil and vinegar dressing you ever notice how you shake it as soon as dr. active minute it separates well if I put a little bit of less of it in there sure it would mix together into a milky that's the function of so lecithin is a key quality in our in our bathroom it helps us to them just fast without that lesson we're not going to break our fast are very long and guess what every single cell in our body has fatty acids our steroid hormones are made from cholesterol what are the sternum was cortisol from the adrenal testosterone as for estrogen progesterone those are the steroid hormones so cholesterol and the quality ones are very very important and also there are fat soluble vitamins these 5 vitamins here super important to be able to break those down and absorb them well is very Outland like I said neutralizes two hydrochloric acid which means that the pancreatic enzymes can heat or work in alkaline small intestine and helps the ileocecal valve work properly helps us to assimilate minerals and so forth now the liver is constantly making bond and it's constantly it what actually really stimulates the bottle to flow is it at a meal and it flows even better if there's a little bit of fat and good quality so without the gallbladder then Luke the bile is now pretty much just flowing straight from the liver into the small intestine and really the gallbladder is just kind of a temporary storage sack it's not really it's not like the tube coming from the liver and then a gallbladder and then it goes on it's not really like that it's kind of like over here so it's and so also we got letters and you'll see this on me drawn here but it's got a lot of lines around it being here it's sitting in a bed of capillaries and all leather has the ability to concentrate product to make it thicker and over time it can get thicker and thicker and it cholesterol some of the cholesterol can precipitate out of stones and that's that's what the goal that also has the ability to kind of contract of it and to squirt bottle and they say that a lot of the bile that goes into the small intestine comes from the gall bladder but I just don't I just don't really believe that because we make a quarter bottle a day it needs to really flow but as long as we're eating foods that stimulate the balance of flow and when we're if we relaxed when we're eating and we will acid contents coming from the stomach and here's a really important point we do have a lot of control over our body we're kind of taught that there's a drug cure for everything and there was a program on Alzheimer's and some around and I didn't get to hear the whole thing I don't know if anybody got to hear that but they're looking for a drug cure for Alzheimer's and I'm here to tell you let's start a revolution and Willis we are able to have to heal ourselves from these chronic illnesses they start what we eat and exercise and a number of other things that we do have control and they keep talking about the genetic guess what the genes don't just kind of separate and we come together but it's a process and it requires nutrients for that to happen and so by the by the food we eat you know what we choose to think and believe it all makes a difference I was looking up to see how many cells we lose a day and it actually wasn't one thing I found it it's in your hand eyes we lose about a million cells a second hmm well we've got every time every time I read how many cells are those for ten to twenty to thirty to forty or fifty trillion cells and so and so you could think of of all your forty to fifty trillion cells about a million there those are just sloughing off and being replaced every day in fact one of the areas of the fastest growing cells in the small intestine so those cells are actually we hooked up every week or ten days we have a whole [Music] and that's actually one source of one of the things at the at the bottom of this chart is a billy Reuben is a free radical scavengers so there's actually a lot of immune properties involved in the digestive tract with saliva has antimicrobial is that super strong acid to the stomach it's strong enough to keep a helical back to pirate pylori particularly it's when we're strapped when we're stressed we actually make less so now so what do you get when you mix red colors red green and yellow so you all know what this tool is because it's those well there's pigments that are really amazing pilots that come out in the Bible it's a big part of that core tobias1 now let's move on to violet blue dude so we've talked about how the stomach is strongly acid and that's a key by up close to me we also also touched on the idea of an alpha so perfect and now we know that this outdoor flow right here is what most people are talking about their safety announcement that because it's actually foods that have a little bit of acid naturally beets have a little bit of hydrochloric acid and then we have our leafy greens that are that have a stomach acid and that acid will stimulate the backbone and citrus fruits have citric acid so those are foods that when we eat those foods if we took the pH of that food is actually massive but it's having an outgoing reaction and basically it's all the fruits and vegetables those are really our staple foods so so they didn't get that before we go into more detail about which foods I want to say something more about fats so well you know it's like like if you have go to buy milk do you get that [Music] well you know in some ways I guess you could say that when the milk has been processed it they're not it's possible that having a low-fat milk is better for you but but if we get whole milk if we get whole raw milk that is amazing especially if it's from cows that have you dress that food have that look is much more digestible and it's a whole food so that's it and so there's a lot of just confusion about facts and really here's what let's clear it up once and for all let's just use the term damaged fast facts are not stable they when they're out if you leave some flax oil out on the counter it will oxidize it will go around sit and we have a natural aversion to that said it doesn't taste good when we cooked that it would be time it would break down in a way that hydrogen fuel filled up and it becomes such it becomes saturated with hydrogen and so that also is not going to stimulate about to grow very low and so ideally we want oils in their natural state as close to home as possible so we do want to watch out for our oils that has been heated or exposed to air that are too old and exposed to light so that's carrot apple celery hardest like you've got more juice and these are really the main BIOS is vegetables so now we think of human well if I want to cook something with what would I use and so the idea there is we want to use a fat that's naturally saturated it's just sort of comes that way butter and coconut nowadays we can get really good quality cooking in there they're more stable if you look at Mt in its natural state that one is going to stimulate the box of fatty acid it's a massive food that's been a student at flatpoint we've suppose that asset to keep it's going to be from hydrogenated the closer to air becomes oxygen those those are now not really and if they lost their asset quality so they're not going to stimulate about what's going to happen they're accumulating more than it should okay now let's take it one more step this is gonna be the finishing part of the concept of blue cheese we talked about how ideally the food me it's broken down into the small particles of control if I eat something that I don't rent my body doesn't recognize as a food or I don't have the enzymes to break it down this this is the problem buta nowadays these men are careful in the old days wheat was really tolerant and they decided they wanted it to grow twice a year so they've made it really fast their fellow thank you so they hybridized in higher so the best and they can twice a year double intercrop well because of all that hybridization and so blue tends to not be broken down by the pollutant is kind of like blue is where we get the word yeah that blue team is hanging out up against the villi here that can cause these cells to break down and now we're going to have a larger opening one large your molecules can pass through and that's going to be congested to the liver not only that this is really cute is that when cells break down here's here's one of those cells and when cells break down and you lose some of their cell wall and the contents of the cells fill up and in size these cells are mostly protein protein is made up of amino acids and when histidine is outside the cell come floating move not lose anything he grades into history probably heard histamine well histamine is kind of Paul Revere drives around six cells are dying cells are nice start the inflammation process and we wanted that so the inflammation is a very necessary process we need to have a way to respond to an irritant and in this case the gluten hanging out here was the irritant and it caused the cell to break down so he wants a monk inflammatory response to heal themselves and so a student who travels through the body telling us to mount that inflammatory response this is a key word and inflammation is star in the Testament and like I said these cells are slept off and healed every week or ten days and so we have also had a good opportunity to feel this now the byproducts of all that are going to travel back to the nerve and that's going to cause the liver to have to work harder it's going to give the river more to do and as a result that is going to cut down on our ability to respond to information so the key is get that bio flowing keep it flowing keep that liver nice and open flowing and the body will have a much better chance of healing information responding to the puritans they're comfortable don't always have a lot of control and we purchase that kind of environment so we want to keep ourselves what you use for the juice so there's a question about what's in the juice and altogether ideal ten pounds of carrots ten pounds of apples about six cucumbers a bunch of parsley and two bunches of celery celery carrot apple celery thanks very much I know it's really cold so it is that on the collards kale Romanesco who's ever seen [Music] nature is smart Oh check it out so that family needs to be cooked okay you leave you have some cool slides okay / - but but overtime taking a lot of Nicole family uncooked can be hard how much is a lot how much is a lot I'd say well for instance into a popular make smoothies now put a big bunch of kale in there and that is going to be I [Music] would say I would say a couple two or three times a week no sauerkraut okay that's one of our profits make it that's a processing that cabbage or whatever and so that's it to ferment that's one way to break it down that's a classic traditional so and then we also have a wonderful fruit slaw a winter melon made for it looks like they're dishing for the next family is the pea and bean family you know it's probably okay what's wrong those sweet peas but generally your best take they just have a little bit of toxin in business it needs to be neutralized just a lights just blanching go ahead what about the shirts that season no I'd have to verify that but I'm pretty sure that it's that same family it's just too best to blanch the hyperbole and then the third vegetable foods mushrooms I see some faces mushrooms the key the key quality that mushrooms sounds they have a sugar in them except around its color that isn't found in foods and it's a key part of our immune system and so another thing I included on here is how to make your own salad dressing [Music] [Music] speaking of garlic garlic and onion are two amazing abuse for ever and help deliver to denotes work the question is cooked or raw olive or onion 1 garlic is raw it's considered to be antimicrobial so if you're having some kind of lung infection or just hit the raw garlic because the garlic goes to the longer when when the garlic is cooked is more immunise that's interesting Richard was saying that you just want to prepare garlic cook it and let me cut it for whatever so just as a review when you see the green lights what do you do when you sit down so now you know more about your digestive tract our website for question though real quickly is if you want to make juice or just now because it's best to make the juice and another at least what the juice right now this to chop the celery [Music] yes there are quite a few furnance happening now is the whole point of those permits one of the main points putt either maybe to eat something they would want to eat wrong because it's the fermenting kind of breaks it down the enzymes but also it produces a lot of really a huge variety of different microbes that then help our to go to our large intestine to infect another food that's similar to that is - mother Jerusalem artichokes these actually potato as well have something called inulin which is a starch that we don't use but the bacteria Nicole and you love that it's food for them so he comes a wonderful substitute so when we cook with or first most important thing is to use a low heat because it's going to damage the one of lips and butter is naturally saturated so it's more stable that's the other point that I wanted to make about about the seed oils like flaxseed oil is an oil that has lots of omega-3 but you wouldn't want to cook with it because it would turn it's not stable those are our unstable whereas butter coconut use a flax oil or think of those as a condiment as your salad dressing no wow they came up with oil-free dressings no we've got a nice steam and I've got off my page on how to steam a nice steamer full of vegetables we put on a play and it actually tastes good and it mixed those minerals more to us and combined [Music] that's a much less stable night I don't know um oil and ice doesn't have a flavor coconut also quite a flavoring step Laura all the seeds all the seed it will be much less all the oils that are in nature and all our students tend to be fairly high in omega-6 and omega-9 oh maybe three are the two essential fatty acids we don't manufacture but we need them to manufacture all we need them about in the same ratio six maybe six is very easy to get in such babies you have this imbalance between many six three and so we really want to work towards getting our officials yeah yeah you eat and get up and go do something if it's going to cut down on the dungeon without drinking water while you're eating everyone who serves water is the impression that guy will spit accidental yeah drinking too much water will do that a little bit of water helps to mixing that's the way of it and the question about water something I learned recently is drink you drink a nice lot of water when you first get up and then between meals think of having a sort of quench your thirst rather than sipping all through the day because when we drink water at cuttings the body says okay water's coming okay nice big big amount okay we can use that have a little sips through the day it's like [Music] yeah I I really this is reform of less than non-gmo this is a big Bryant air they sell it at a generic digestion that goes back to this stomach and remember how we talked about how the stomach you need supplies well there and one of the things I mentioned was that if there's less acid being produced by the stomach there's going to be less mucus coming I didn't mention that actually so and the valve right here between the stomach and the esophagus if it could talk it would say oh it's really acid I've got to stay nice and closed but if as we age if we're making less hydrochloric acid or under stress and we're making less undergoing gas and we don't make none but it's just in time yeah and so that's when we function to have tens out that's a simplification so this would help to take vinegar at that point can make your stomach acid and that'll show you that vinegars and under goodbye make that yeah bit about what we're talking us dummies close yes apple cider vinegar it might not have that immediate reaction because vinegars move nowhere near as acid is right but that's a good tonic probiotic and nowadays it's not a condiment it's perfectly fine to take some some microbes it was like the best lactobacilli so if they get that they can make it that far and they helped to colonize the New Testament but it's where we get things to run back Nigeria himself because there's a lot of good bacteria [Music] [Music] you", "dECyvoGTbkk": "[Music] [Music] what up guys welcome to the CCC I'm Shane I'm Daniel and we're back for another strain review today we are checking out some flour from a company that we have not featured yet on the show this is some garlic breath from pistol point that's right this is an organ company originally they just started popping up in Cali I've seen them on the Shelf that a few different shops I believe they're on the Shelf at Garden of Eden up in Hayward but yeah this stuff is Dave so this garlic breath it says right here Barbary Coast times pistol points so this was a collaboration between them I'm not sure in what capacity Barbary Coast collaborated in this all I know is it's exclusive to them it's the only place that you can get it Barbary Coast in San Francisco that's where we pick this stuff up the first impression and the jar appeal were what made us go with this one honestly it was some of the best looking flower that they had on the show this is a cross right here GMO cookies and a GMO being that chem dog GSC cross obviously that's where you get a lot of that garlicky smell at least when I had the GMO cookies a very peppery garlic the fire nonetheless we love [ __ ] with chem dog in it as you know having a lot more screens on the show lately they kind of have some of that old-school Kim lineage I don't know if I put this one quite in that class but a little bit of the influence in there this stuff looks incredible first off we'll just talk about you know the way the bud catches your eye when you peek into the jar I mean this isn't really what you want your [ __ ] to look like it's completely caked up the structure on this stuff is really really nice it's not you know it doesn't look blown out it looks natural but at the same time these mugs aren't banging they are banging not really sure what the THC percentage is on here it says 895 point three milligrams in the eighth so we're just gonna have to get used to this we're gonna have to figure out this conversion y'know this or just stop doing it because we all know the THC percentage doesn't [ __ ] matter but I always like to throw it out there but I'm saying it less and less which is kind of weird I feel like that's definitely a marketing tool so start putting the damn percentages back on there and game guys come on anyways garlic-breath it definitely caught my eye that's why I bought it but when you crack it it smells really good almost smells like Cash's grandma's cookies that's what I was gonna say so we've we've reviewed a bunch of strange lately crazy crazy names I forgot we've had this you actually did this the other day on the video we rolled up a [ __ ] cone or the strand of you forgot we even had it I almost just did the same thing let me just get this thing going real quick but we've been doing a bunch of strange lately gushers skittles all these different streams that have a name that implies how you would think it would taste or smell this one kind of falls into that category for me but honestly I'm not getting as much of the garlic thing as I have just even on some other GMO like you said it's kind of giving me that cash vibe that grandma's good mr. keen oh yeah I like the name but you're right I've had GMO and to me GMO should be called garlic breath you know that smells really garlicky to me this smells more you know skunky doughy very cookie ish I'm getting a lot of like every cookie almost like a really really really good form cut so growing medium on this stuff was a 50/50 mix of soil and cocoa that's kind of cool that they put that some of that information out there online on their website and stuff for people to check out they give you a little bit of info on how they actually grow their weed if more companies start doing that that might kind of be a cool thing to be able to compare because obviously we will have a little bit of experience growing in different mediums but most the time when I'm trying weed unless I get it from the grower himself or herself you don't know I don't know what it was growing it yeah yeah it's kind of nice to have that little tidbit of information I personally like soil don't I mean there's nothing against coca some of the best growers I know you scope though pretty nice to know that this was a 50/50 mix you know super soil and cocoa because you know I think Shane can say he probably likes soil too is just that's what I feel like it gives you a little bit more natural flavor of it brings out the flavor of what the strain should really taste like and I could be completely wrong but that's just my preference yeah I don't know why I don't know the reason behind it but personal preference for me soil again because of the flavor like you said for whatever reason we just tend to taste a little bit better but I would imagine there's you know a perfect mixture that you could find just like for you know hash oil we always you know a lot of people did straight butane a lot of people did straight propane I always like that like 70/30 mix yeah 70 butane sorry okay I'm sure there's a you know depending on the grower depending on how you do things I'm sure everybody has their own kind of sweet spot for their style you know yeah and growing medium is just one of those factors you know the effect on this [ __ ] is great bro I mean regardless of THC percentage or milligram each it's hitting me right between the eyes it's almost making me like get a lazy eye super heavy honestly for me I know it says it's a 50/50 mix but I think it's hitting me a little more indica getting harder and harder to talk but I do know one thing I know that 895 milligrams and 1/8 is a lot so I'm guessing that's gonna be somewhere around 25% I feel like maybe I am getting a little bit of garlic my taste now through the through the joint yeah a taste I didn't I don't smell that at all when I smell this again when I said oh this it's not that it reminds me more of like the OG k be cooking us or the Cash's grandma's cookies that's the smell for whatever reason that I'm getting that out of this but the taste is a little bit different and actually getting some a little different joint ya know I mean I can see why they called it garlic breath but it's just not as strong as some of the GMOs that I got when I smelled the GMO like damn that's one like sure you garlic shit's crazy super peppery this has some of that in it it's just not as present we should get a microscope to do these reviews that meets a little like USB microscope like a pretty decent quality one I'm sure that's pretty inexpensive now that'd be cool to kind of get an up-close look at just the trikes on it and get you know kind of the macro shot of the bud this stuff to the naked eye looks like it just has those tiny tiny trikes but they're just covered every however you live especially on the underside of the inner bud I mean it's got that typical really good top top shelf cookie look this was what top shelf cookie looked like when it first came around a little more calyx II a little bit so somewhat a little bit more crazy looking at you know but I don't know I just mmm I like the smoked purple crush almost every day of the week yeah this is close to it but not quite okay going on another rip from the bong here what would you go with this if we were gonna give it a radiance so I'm gonna give this one a solid 9 I think the flavor could be a little better looks our 10 effect is a 10 I'm very high but you know when when judging Bud critically it's also a little dry for my liking like like you can feel this now here there's really no moisture to it it's very dry yeah so this this bud a bunch of the last few strains we checked out have past the stick factor you know so this bud does not want a whole dick factor it like wants to grab it this is not sticky weed I would not you know yeah it's like this right this it wants to grab but it's just not sticking very kind of more of a dry resin or just not as sticky of a resin I don't know man I would say this wind looks really good it's something a little bit different I am enjoying it I don't think this would be something that I would smoke personally like on other faces it just doesn't pack quite as much of a flavor profile for what I'm looking for it definitely has set in kind of a nice buzz I'm feeling it set in up top I kind of work its way down really like the high a lot that's why I bumped it up nine might be a little generous but pistol when I'm talking with you on this [ __ ] I'm giving it a nine yeah I'm gonna go with an eight on this one like I say just maybe not quite it may be more of a personal preference thing on this one for me with the flavor but it is interesting this is I like to try something new every now and then and this is definitely something new I would maybe try it again but if I wouldn't you know see this being something out I'll put in the regular rotation I feel like I feel I'm just giving it a bone because if you get a ten on Lex and ten on effect ya there you gotta give it respect so a nine and an eight that does it for this strain of you please like and subscribe down below do all that [ __ ] do your homework appreciate you guys joining us for another one we'll be back next week for another strand of you once you're out of the CCC I'm Shane I'm Daniel peace bye this is probably down the Dow still smokin oh gee Danny [ __ ] with some Bank doubt good

and I have two doctors in here with me this morning which is explaining to them how cool that is I have dr. Ethan SRAM and dr. Steven banks and this morning the topic Martin O'Neill Cancer Center and all that they have to offer and what you do there and welcome gentlemen it's great to have you here thank you so let's see let's um shall we start with a doctor SRAM I have here that to talk a little bit about what you do and what's available at the Cancer Center well I'm a medical oncologist which means i don't do surgery and I don't do radiation I deliver chemotherapy usually by vein or by mouth our Cancer Center offers something pretty unique in the North Bay what we generally do what we have is a lot of clinical trials which usually are something that's offered only in large academic centers so we have access to a lot of cutting-edge treatments that you can only get in places like Stanford or UCSF in fact we have an affiliation with ucsf that helps us make those trials available to people here in the north bay oh that's wonderful and so talk to us about I see you have a clinical care navigator what is that a clinical care navigator is in our case woman named Colleen winters and she is a social worker and works essentially to tie together the picture of a patient's health and their family history and it's actually able to make it easier for families and patients to get the care they need and with special needs they may have so it's kind of see in the big picture is the big picture together absolutely oh that's amazing and then cancer risk assessments and genetic testing is that for someone who maybe doesn't have cancer or doesn't know if they have cancer to just get tested correct or may have a family history of cancer so pretty complete urns okay and a lot of times somebody may come in with cancer at a young age or an advanced age and report a family history and they may want to have family members tested as well you see the family members at risk as well so genetic this is it so that cancer can be genetic Canton okay I realize that cancer can be genetic depending on what type of cancer we're talking about saying hereditary cancers account for five to ten percent of cancers the rest are probably sporadic but there are some cancers that we find at a young age and it makes sense to have family members tested and we offer that service so that with the genetic markers mean that there's a predisposition or your your chances are higher not that you necessarily are for sure going to get it correct it increases certain chances and there are certain things we can pull out of a family history or using markers give a ballpark estimate of what somebody's chances are of developing a cancer and fortunately we have some screening techniques and some preventative strategies to help people prevent actually developing a cancer Wow okay and that leads into my next question you have an oncology certified registered dietician we do because that's important right absolutely every patient we have it Martin O'Neill gets to see our dietitian and nutrition is a key part of our treatment strategy and something we offer that a lot of other places don't offer so nutrition is important in terms of preventing future cancers and also managing the treatment side effects and staying healthy through your treatment gosh we could probably do a whole show on that I'm coming back talking about the nutrition preventative and and helping someone who already is going through the treatment and then what's the patient experience team patient experience team is something we have it's it's one of those intangibles where any patient who comes in basically everyone on our team from the nurses to the dietician to the doctors everyone knows every patient's name and it's it's really something we talk about it each each of our weekly meetings we really get into our patients back stories in our their social situations and are able to deliver the care that they need some people need a lot of care some people need less and experienced team is something that I think distinguishes us from a lot of places yeah I'd agree it's it sort of starts with the people who work in our front desk answering the phones every patient who walks in the door gets to me Marjorie and she really gets to know them and at the end of a course of treatment will provide a custom sort of personalized gift to that person to say thank you for putting your trust in us and letting us help to take care of I have to say that's not real prevalent in my experience no she's sort of a clinic mom she is she's fantastic that's really ninth at so important when you're going through something like this in the middle and it continues on into our resource library and Pam who's there who does a fantastic job as well helping guide patients into research that they may want to do themselves at home that's nice too and I you know here's something i really like complementary medicine acupuncture movement therapy I'm silly we have we have massage therapists oh well you often time if you're walking through our treatment our infusion room seeing patients in chemo chairs actually receiving massages or getting acupuncture and so it's really a holistic approach to medicine both western end and more traditionally Eastern medicine we've also just recently instituted some trials with movement therapy as well as music therapy and we've had a woman who comes in and plays the harp in the waiting area I've got to tell you it's just a magical feeling when she's there it's calming right nervous and outside of the cancer center there is the healing garden which is a beautiful respite area with redwood trees and a nice water feature that cascades down a hillside into a koi pond and some tables for patients to sit and relax and that's important too you're treating the whole person is what I'm hearing with compassionate good medical care but you also have the compassion part of it and just in helping with their spirit too yes correct we forgot about pet therapy that's right too we do we have a therapy dog who comes by and visits on a weekly basis at least as well that is wonderful dr. Stephen banks also with this this morning tell us a little bit about what you do so I'm a radiation oncologist so whereas dr. schramm provides chemotherapy and other systemic whole body treatments I'm a radiation oncologist and provide radiation therapy which is a more targeted therapy essentially aiming at tumors or areas of disease or concerning areas that may Harbor disease to try and treat specific areas of concern now when you were on the show before we talked a little bit about the Calypso correct machine I was blown away by that so tell us about that calypso or GPS for the body is a yeah a unique feature that we have at the Martin O'Neill Cancer Center it was installed in August and it really has been a fantastic addition we've now treated about 20 men on the Calypso system for prostate cancer specifically we've had patients come as far away from mendocino willits and lodi all who have come and actually decided to get treatment at Martin O'Neill Cancer Center because of Calypso not to mention a lot of local patients as well so it's really been a great addition and I've been very happy with how it's working for patients we're hoping that by the end of this year it will have been expanded its use outside of just prostate cancer to include lung cancers and possibly some intra-abdominal or breast cancer features that may may become approved and useful as well so we're very happy with how it's working along the lines of prostate cancer the Calypso is also potentially going to allow us to move into a new treatment approach for prostate cancer what's called stereotactic body radiation therapy and we talked I think a little bit about that last time that I was here as well stereotactic body radiation therapy is something that we've used a sense about august or September at the cancer center and it's a more focused targeted form of radiation gives a very intense treatment course in maybe three to five treatments as opposed to 30 to 40 treatments and is is being investigated and evaluated for prostate cancer and there's now finally some long-term data showing safety and efficacy with that treatment approach what we're looking at is maybe being able to use the the Calypso system along with stereotactic body radiation therapy and we're evaluating some clinical trials to try and get involved with that here now if I remember what you were saying last time about Calypso it allows you to better targets exactly where that cancer is absolutely we put in little beacon transponders that act as a GPS type of a locator to help us see exactly where that tumor is and exactly where it may be moving during the time that radiation is being delivered so typical radiation treatment may take 20 to 25 minutes and the prostate has potential for motion during that period of time based on gas and the rectum or filling of the bladder things along those lines and even just with respiration or breathing so the Calypso allows us to monitor that possible motion and correct for it and it's the only system that has that potential to do that in real time excuse me that's going to become that much more important if we start looking at stereotactic body radiation therapy in that situation the treatment may take as long as an hour to deliver and so there's a lot greater potential for motion of the prostate and with the stereotactic body radiation since you're giving such a high dose of radiation in such a short period of time you really don't want to miss because the potential for harm to normal healthy tissues like the rectum or the bladder is really excessive so using the Calypso system it may give us a real benefit and our patients a real benefit to help reduce their risk of side effects and improve the efficacy of that stereotactic treatment and I see that there are a couple of things that people can get involved with one there's some current clinical trials open for patients and you also have a symposium coming up that's open to the public tell us about those two opportunity as far as clinical trials relating to radiation therapy we currently have clinical trials open for patients with head and neck cancers which include cancers in the mouth or throat we also have trials open for lung cancer and then prostate cancer all that include radiation treatment and we're looking at possibly expanding into other types of areas pancreatic cancer esophageal cancer and it really depends there on whether there's a need for that service in this decision geographic area as far as the symposium that mentioned very excited about that option that's going to take place this thursday from noon to 130 and it's open to the public free of charge and involves lunch it's going to be at the villagio inn and spa and we're very excited that Peter Carroll one of the internationally known experts in prostate cancer down at UCSF has agreed to come and he'll be discussing and presenting early-stage prostate cancer some prostate screening issues because that's an area of controversy now and so we're looking forward to having him talk I will be discussing and presenting new techniques and approaches for managing men with high-risk prostate cancer because that often falls into a radiation oncology approach and then dr. Harr Stark is a medical oncologist at UCSF and she's an expert in urologic cancers as well and she'll be coming up to discuss management of patients with advanced prostate cancer patients whose cancers may have already metastasized or spread and talking about all the new exciting developments that have occurred there well that's great so tell us how we can get hold of you dr. banks or dr. schramm or get more information on any of everything we talked about today well for the symposium I would recommend that patients call Pam Turner and that phone number would be 707 9675 750 to RSVP that way we can get a correct headcount for space and also for lunches that will be provided as far as general contact for patients who may be interested in finding out more information on this or coming to see us for evaluation calling the cancer center at 707 9675 721 or have your referring physician contact us either way we'd be happy to talk with either of you and then the website for the Martin O'Neill Cancer Center can be accessed through the st. Helene a hospital's dot org website and find out more information about all the things that we've discussed here great well thank you both so much for being with us this morning you're welcome that's healthy communities brought to you by st. Alina hospital this is a Sacramento International Airport travel advisory you", "ZIn14kgvTzQ": "me introduce Ben we kind of been working our way down south we started in Alaska or the last two presentations from Washington now the next to our enemy here in California fans from the Army Corps of Engineers he's going to talk about the use of captive brood stock to supplement ESA listed coho in the Russian River so please welcome to them hello my name is ben white biologist for the US Army Corps of Engineers I've actually only worked for the core for a couple months now but I've been working on this program for about eight years and I just want to give you some insight to a coho recovery program that's just now out of its infancy stage and we're just starting to see some glimpses of success glimpses mind you so the Russian River watershed is located in the central California coast ESU it basically runs through southern Mendocino and sonoma county's Warm Springs hatchery where the the captive breeding portion of the program is located is at the base of lake sonoma and warm springs dam lake sonoma is one of two water supply reservoirs in the watershed and the dam is managed and operated by the Army Corps of Engineers and the facility is owned and completely funded by the Army Corps of Engineers a little background on the facility we get all of our water from lake sonoma we're able to draw up from fairly low levels of the lake it's a flow-through system so all of our a flute effluent goes into settling pond where it's naturally filtered before returning to dry creek and yeah we have a constant source of cold water year round so we're really lucky to have this facility for a program like ours and water temperatures they're nowhere near as cold as Nome Alaska but 10 to 12 degrees Celsius year-round it's cold to us so just a little history on the decline of coho and the Russian River watershed it's believed that historically somewhere around 32 streams supported wild runs of coho and over the last you know 10 to 20 years that numbers dramatically declined like most of the stocks in the CSU and even with that declining number the number of streams with three consecutive year class was really down to next to nothing and coho being on that real rigid through your life cycle once you start missing year classes it's really hard to re-establish those unless you have you know healthy adjacent populations which in this case we didn't so yeah that that one stream with three year classes is really how we jump started our program and I'll get to that so extinction of coho salmon in the Russian River watershed was essentially imminent without some sort of immediate intervention so in 2001 state and federal agencies along with nonprofit groups collaborated to begin the captive brood stock program and I really want to drive home the point of this sort of collaborative partnership this multi-agency partnership a number of the resource agencies represented here today are all major players in our program a number of the people that sit on our subcommittee are actually sitting in the room here today so it's really representatives from all these groups that really drive all the major decisions and let us know what to do when to do it that sort of thing and I can't leave out cooperating landowners almost the entire watershed is privately owned so all of our efforts outside of the hatchery really have to be done in coordination with cooperating landowners and that's everything from broodstock broodstock capture to all of our releases to all of our monitoring efforts we really have to establish and maintain these healthy relationships with landowners so the principal goal of the program is to reestablish self-sustaining runs of native co-host I'm back into streams that historically supported coho salmon within the watershed and there's two program components the hatchery component and that's the part that I oversee I spend pretty much all my time at the hatchery but there's also the monitoring component that's an essential part of our program that really drives a lot of our release efforts lets us know how productive each stream is how many of these fish survive over the summer over the winter they do all the spawner surveys all the in-stream characteristics in terms of flow and temperature stuff like that the monitoring component is run by the UC cooperative extension but is now also funded by the Army Corps of Engineers so real briefly the recovery house remodel this is just the life cycle of salmon what we do is we go out and we collect juveniles during the summer months when the water levels are low easy to capture we bring those fish into captivity where we can really increase survival provide them with plenty of cold water food eliminate predation we essentially turn a few fish into many fish and we take those fish that we produce and we stock them back out in the streams I historically had coho salmon we're not trying to create a hatchery run a fish we're trying to reestablish wild runs self-sustaining runs of fish within the watershed broodstock collection this is just the picture of some folks out collecting brood stock we use hand sayings which are really low impact and non-invasive on the fish we go out in the summer months when the water levels are low and we capture pitch to bring back to the hatchery and just to give you a sort of an idea of what our brood stock population has been comprised of over the years you can see that between 2001 2003 we were able to collect two to three hundred fish from the wild to really jumpstart jump start the program but beginning in 2004 the number of wild fish we encountered was was literally next to nothing so we're really lucky we started the program we did even if we would have started this program about a year later we would have been missing a year class and it would have been really hard to re-establish that year class so since 2004 our brood stock population has really been reliant on captive fish these are offspring of fish that were spawned on the spawn at the hatchery and just held over for broodstock purposes beginning in 2007 you can see we started pulling fish from outside watersheds and I'm going to get to that here in a little bit and that's part of an out breathing component it's an attempt to increase genetic diversity within our brood stock population and in 2010 and I'm going to get to this as well we started sort of revisiting this wild component we started we're starting to now see adults coming back and wild juveniles are starting to pop up throughout the watershed so we're starting to bring those back at back into the hatchery and try to get away from a completely captive broodstock population so raising brood stock to maturity basically at about a year a year of age we weep in tag each fish in that pit tag this Court is in conjunction with a genetic sample that gets sent down to dr. Garza and his lab we raised all of our fish completely in freshwater on the never sea salt water we raised them in these large 20 foot diameter tanks and some actual improvements over the last few years as we've added many more of these tanks we now have about 12 large circular tanks we also have a building over our tanks I keep everybody sort of high and dry and comfortable and we have about 24 starter tanks that's all sort of dedicated strictly to the coho program we started supplementing their diet with krill something that they would naturally eat out in the ocean and we've seen a huge response to the addition of krill to their diet much better growth rates which was in turn resulted in better spawning success with our fish and then we do routine Bruce documentaries basically go through every one of our fish quarterly just tracking growth rates health development that sort of thing keeping tabs on everyone ensure they're still there right ms sorting this is this is a tricky part of our program obviously in the wild these fish decide win the spa who to spawn with and we're to spawn in captivity that all falls on on my plate actually so we use ultrasound to determine not only the sex of the fish but to monitor go nan-oh development this is especially important with the females just like their sensitive nature in the wild very sensitive in captivity it's very difficult to determine when a female should be spawned so we use ultrasound to monitor egg development we can actually see when those eggs become hydrated when they're actually starting to detach from the skains getting ready for first bonding and stuff like that we also use a number of additional physical characteristics to determine spawn timing in terms of the soft softness of the abdomen coloration you know whether they're ovulating or not it's sort of this series of factors that we use to determine when a female's ready or not we do use gnrh implants for some of our fish obviously in captivity some of these fish just don't get with the program a lot of the females are delayed or they stall out so we use the implants on females only on an as-needed basis but we use it on almost all the males to provide reliable milk production and high volume of milk production and then we actually use external disk tags for easy identification during spawning I'm going to get to our spawning matrix and stuff like that in the next slide but it really makes it really makes the spawning effort a lot more efficient when I can just look at a tank and find male number 100 to spawn with a specific female instead of having to go through every fish scan them for a specific pit tag so that that dis tag is correlated to that pit tag for each fish brigstock spawning so I think maybe some of this was covered yesterday but all of our males are ranked for each matrix for each female we spawn according to a spawning matrix that's provided by dr. Garza and his lab we don't spawn any fish at the half sibling level or greater we spawn one female was up to four males and each male is spawned up to four times in a year before we take them out of the matrix so that not one male is over-represented during a spawning effort and then we check motility on every male before we fertilize the eggs making sure the sperm is viable motile moving alive healthy and then we track survival rates of each full sibling group as separately through the swim up stage so we've sort of customized these heat incubation trays divided them into four quadrants so one tray will be one females eggs spawn with four different males so we can actually track the success of not only each female but every male spawn partner in our program so if one of these sub Lots was really bad and pouring low survival rates we can kind of attribute that to the mail whereas if the whole lot was was poor survival we can attribute that to the female so we can really track the success of every meeting in our program was not the right button this is just the example of our spawning matrix it's literally an excel file where every one of our females is listed across the top row and then every column is a list of every male in our program the highest male on the list is the highest priority least related to that female and the red is just to demonstrate fitch related at the half sibling level or greater and under no circumstance would we spawn those fish with that female and this is an example of our meetings with and without the matrix so you can see that the spawning matrix really drives our spawning efforts if we were not using the matrix we would be in reading all over the place the Russian River stock was really genetically bottlenecked depleted very low diversity so the spawning matrix is extremely important for us in terms of our spawning efforts and you can see that with the matrix well we're well below the the half-sibling level in terms of our meetings this is brings us to her out reading effort a very small founding population along with the absence of new genetic material being incorporated into the program has resulted in very low genetic diversity among our brood stock population this was kind of referring back to that graph whereas in 2004 we stopped seeing any wild fish we stopped bringing any outside genetic material into the program so we had this sort of depleted source population and we are spawning according to the breeding matrix so we were mixing and matching all we could increasing variation but our diversity was kind of at a standstill we weren't really adding that sort of outside wild component into the program so it was decided in 2008 that twenty-five percent of our spawning effort would be dedicated to out reading the Russian River stock with the neighboring Alima Creek stock and a Lima Creek is sort of synonymous with the lagunitas system as well they kind of connect before they hit the ocean and it's considered one of the healthier more intact populations in the CSU although over the past few years they've also seen a decline in numbers but it made sense for us to use this stock for out breeding efforts I think it's believed that historically when these populations were abundant and healthy there was probably a certain level of straying and Inter breeding between these stocks anyways so this was a this made sense for us in terms of bringing in an outside stock for out breeding efforts and this is a graph just I think the scale on the bottom is a little off actually the point 25 is actually supposed to be right under the arrow but it's supposed to demonstrate sort of a health in the diversity of the two stocks and you can see that the Russian River stock was really far on the right side of the x axis meaning very low diversity very few family groups and the Lima Creek stock I was much more to the left on the x axis a lot higher diversity a lot more family groups so really uh hopefully a benefit to our program to bring in the stock and on a small scale to start interbreeding them with the Russian River um coho and we have seen some early success in our out breeding efforts this is comparison of egg to fry survival rates between Russian River females and Lima Creek females so we've been doing this is our fourth year of spawning and we actually just finished spawning last week so I don't have all the data from this year spawn effort but you can see over three years Alima Creek females have outperformed Russian River female significantly our egg to fry survival rates is basically a product of our I operate our hatch rates and our swim up rates and across the board they've always outperform them in terms of early life stage survival rates and even when I'm dealing with these fish and spawning this fish there's a real much more consistent development with the Lima Creek fish there they develop in a much more regular pattern they're a lot easier to determine when to spawn whereas the Russian River fish are just kind of really all over the place so I think this has been a huge sort of addition to our program in terms of increasing diversity and I think we're starting to see that in not only in the hatchery but hopefully in the wild as well outbreeding summary offspring from OC females have significantly higher early life stage survival rates than Russian River females we have seen similar early life stage survival rates among offspring from alema Creek males and Russian River males spawn with the same female so one thing we've been doing is what we're calling a paired outbreeding study and we're taking one female whether it be russian river or lima creek and spawning her with two different males or two different stocks of males so if you remember that incubation tray divided into four quadrants we would take one females eggs spawn her with to Elima creek males to russian river males use the eggs as sort of our control to see if there is any differences based on the male's input to the offspring and we really haven't seen any significant difference of subtle differences but nothing significant so really it comes down to the health and the viability of the eggs as opposed to the sperm quality and this is the first year we just finished spotting but this being our fourth year of outbreeding we're actually using f1 hybrids created from our first spawn season of out breeding and it's really neat to see that early data collection is suggesting really similar survival rates between our f1 hybrid fish and our Alima creek females we're literally all of our offspring are in the egg Alvin's stage as we're speaking so we're still collecting data but it's looking like the f1 hybrids are performing on the same level of the aleem as the Alima creek females were so this out breeding effort seems to be benefiting the program this is a little graph on the juvenile production history on the left-hand y axis we have the number of fish we've produced the right-hand y axis we have the number of females spawned and you can see this really kind of symbolizes not only the growth of our production but the growth of the program over the years I mean early on we're still trying to figure out what we were doing how to raise these fish how to spawn these fish we've really gotten better at what we're doing over the years and our production is really shown I'd like to take all the credit for this but there's been some major changes that have gone on the hatchery too gone on at the hatchery to get us to this point some of those are just the inclusion of more circular tanks so we can not only raised more fish but we can raise them at lower densities so we can improve growth rates improve the maturation process we've added things like filtration to our incubation stacks to remove a lot of the sediment and silt we've actually started treating our eggs with formalin to prevent fungal growth coho eggs are extremely susceptible to fungus the addition of krill to the diet was a big one and then over the last few years the incorporation of the outbreeding effort has really driven up our production numbers so juvenile releasing and tagging we release juveniles into now about 20 different tributaries throughout the watershed three different times of the year spring and fall of their first year so these are 0 plus fish going out as a fingerling or an advanced fingerling and then we also do small releases I'm going to talk a little bit more about this all of our fish receive adequate spin clip and coded wire tags and then approximately ten percent of them received pit tags so we have sort of an expensive pit tag monitoring setup on a number of our creeks that include not only all the antenna arrays but downstream migrant trapping and stuff like that and then we actually pit tag all of our fish according to these genetic Crofts types that we're producing so that we can see if we can evaluate any potential differences in post release growth movement and survival among these different cross types and i wish i had some data on that early data suggesting that some of these hybrid groups are I'm surviving better but something that's more of a monitoring question this is our annual juvenile releases by live stage so this is basically a breakdown of when we release our fish and there's really pros and cons to both of these all of the three of these different strategies obviously for our spring release the fingerling stage you get this fish out early they spend less time in the hatchery and more time in the wild which is really what we want ultimately you know they're subjected to natural selection early on we avoid domestication effects at the hatchery the downfall of those is you have much higher mortality rates these fish have to over summer and some of these creeks that tend to dry up sometimes and it's in the summers but you get you give very fit fish if they can survive throughout the year in the freshwater system and you get very low stray rates as they have to spend a year in that Creek so they really have enough time to imprint on those creeks and return to those creeks now with our small releases obviously they spend a lot more time in the hatchery so that are subjected to selection effects domestication effects not to mention just the time the space that it takes to take care of them and then you also have the whole situation with imprinting those fish you can't just release smoltz out into the creeks and expect them to return to those creeks of spawning adults likely that you're going to return to the hatchery so you have to have some sort of imprinting technique with the smoltz so most of our fish go out in the fall of their first year that bypasses those really hot critical summer months but it still gives them about six months in freshwater system to imprint on the creek so that they know where to come back to and we don't have to keep them at the hatchery for a full year so over fifty percent of our fish go out in the fall of their first year but we really have a sort of spread the risk mentality we're not we're never going to put all of our fish out at one night age we've kind of spread that across a number of different life stages in case something goes wrong with one of them and kind of always have a insurance policy from the hatcheries to the streams this is probably my favorite time of the year it gets me out of the hatchery and into these creeks for our spring and our fall releases we use these water filled aerated backpacks and we literally hike the fish throughout the entire stretch of the creek and we're looking for high quality habitat deep pools lots of structure large woody debris and we're essentially scattering this fish as much as we can we're trying to ensure survival every step of the way since these fish have to spend a significant amount of time in that freshwater system for our Smoltz like I mentioned you have to have a way to imprint these fish on the creeks so we've been playing around with a couple different techniques we do streamside imprinting tanks where we literally set up small circular tanks next to a creek obviously you have to have the right situation the right landowners power stuff like that so we're pumping water from the creek into these tanks will hold groups of fish in a tank for anywhere from three to four weeks at a time hoping that they'll key in on the characteristics of that creek water before we release them back into the creek and we've also been using flash board dams established some relationships with some landowners where they've allowed us to you know block up these flash board dams we hold the smoltz in there for same thing three to four weeks at a time before pulling the damn boards and letting them go there's just a lot less control with the flash board damn situation those fish are prone to predation prone to changes in flows and storm events so we've had to build fish screens and stuff that will let water out but not fish but really the flash board dams aren't meant for holding fish back so those have kind of been we've had up and down success with the flash board dams we're really starting to lean towards the streamside imprinting tanks because it's just a much more controlled environment we know how many fish we put in if we lose any fish over that three to four week period we know how many fish we release it's in no predation no that is it's just a much more controlled situation and we're going to try to set up more of these imprinting tanks this year on a few other creeks and adult releases this has kind of been a I'm not gonna get too far into this I think Carlos is going to talk about this a little bit after I do but a long story short we've come up with every year we get some excess broodstock more than what we need to spawn at the hatchery instead of let just letting these fish expire naturally or go to waste we figure why not put them out there and see what happens and I think early on nobody really expected a whole lot from this but every time we've done this it's been successful really we're taking these fish that were raised in captivity their entire lives freshwater their entire lives we take them out to sort of the lower portion of these creeks they still have that innate ability to swim upstream find the spawning grounds find a mate spawn successfully it seems like every time we've done this it's been successful so it's a really it's a really valuable recovery strategy because you don't have to deal with the whole spawning effort and associated egg care in the raising of juveniles and the tagging and the marking and and really you allow for natural mate selection and the offspring are technically wild fish they're subjected to natural selection as soon as they come out of the gravel so there's definitely a huge benefit to this adult release and I think we're going to continue this effort in the future early on it's just kind of been sporadically we've had fish will put him out there but over the last few years we really sort of had an organized focused effort on this and one of the places we've been doing it is in salmon creek which is a small coastal rotted watershed just south of the Russian River we've been doing it for four years now every year these fish have spawned successfully there's now a sort of a monitoring component that goes along with it taking genetic samples from the fish that we're finding so we can actually look and see who was mating with who and I won't touch on that too much because I think Carlos is going to follow up on that and recovery in progress this is basically a boat with cohort minima adult coho returns to the Russian River watershed over the last 10 or so years you can see from 2002 about 2008 we were really just treading water I like to say we're just preventing extinction and we weren't even really in the ballpark of recovery but over the last two years those numbers have dramatically increased and even though they're only in the hundreds right now obviously for recovery we need those up into the thousands it's definitely a move in the right direction and and this is just a minimum a minimum count so I think we can look at this so this current number for this past winter or the winter we're currently in is right around 200 but once we analyze all of our pit tagging data I think that we can extrapolate and estimate that number to be much higher quite a few times higher than that for instance if we pit tag 10% of a certain release group and we get 10 unique detections on an antenna where we can assume that there was probably around 19 on pit tag fish associated with those so once we analyze all of the data we can estimate these returns to be a lot higher and it's it's not where we want to be but it's definitely a step in the right direction and for us it's extremely exciting because it's been years since we've seen any sort of significant number coming back to the Russian River watershed and over the last two years we've really seen it jump in these and these these last two years are from juvenile releases of 80 and 90 thousand fish so we really haven't even gotten into our adult returns from our releases of 160 and 170 thousand fish which were our last two juvenile releases so these numbers should continue to shoot up over the next couple of years and I just want to really acknowledge everybody who sits on our subcommittee meeting not only that but the hatchery staff and our drinks crew that really it's a it's a team effort when it comes to this program and that's it any questions let's yeah let's take bad first few minutes for questions and then we're going to take our breaks oh okay see a bunch of hands up that thank you Dan that it's really good um I have a lot of questions webs can ask one okay thank you when you plant the fingerlings and you if you have communication like with the landowner or the water manager so that where you're planting them you know that there's gonna be water there for a few months yeah so for our spring releases we've released we've really only focused those releases on streams that tend to stay wet year round and have minimal sort of withdrawals and human impact on them so our spring releases are really now only dedicated to streams that do have flow year-round and any stream that has a tendency to dry up over the summer Willie we'll just put all of our efforts into a fall release for that stream in your efforts of quarterly honored to meet with type of an aesthetic do you use what tech of intelligent race do you have of your captive roots we use ms triple 24 anesthetic and pre-spawn mortality is probably around ten percent maybe there's really only two two periods of high mortality with our brood stock and it's it's at about a year of age when we pit tag them and we transfer them from the starter tanks to the large circular tanks we get a little pulse of mortality there some fish just don't acclimate to those larger tanks and those higher flows and then the other sort of pulse of mortality is the couple months right before spawning when their bodies are going through all the gonadal development and a lot of pressure on the internal organs we get what we call it's a swim ladder swing syndrome where we get this overinflated swim bladder real constricted swim ladder anteriorly and the fish really it loses its sense of buoyancy it can't keep itself upright something that we really don't know the complete reason behind but it's right before spawning and it's about two to three months right before spawning and those are kind of the two pulses of a mortality pre-spawn the question in event dawn me amber I have the question about the returns he talked about moving the the juveniles up into the tributaries but back him up there he found that the fish are returning into those trip attention do you do you have problems with them returning back to Warm Springs hatchery yes and yes we now after the last couple years we're starting to see adults coming back and we're finally starting to see wild juveniles throughout the watershed we're seeing them not only in our release dreams so they are returning to the streams we're putting them in but we're actually starting to see fish in streams that we never even put any effort into so there is a certain level of straying going on the fish returning to the hatchery we our release dreams are tributaries to dry creek which is the creek the hatchery is on so we get a lot of fish returning to that system and whether flows aren't right or they just take a wrong turn a lot of them do end up at the hatch video and when I say a lot I mean in the order of a 20 or 30 a year so we're not seeing significant numbers coming back to the hatchery but we do get a fair a small number every year Caitlyn has a question and then Rick and then I think we're going to take our lunch break can you talk a little bit about what the limiting factors are in Russian River watershed and whether or not i think there's evidence that any of them have been being addressed in the last ten years and more specifically in the last two years yeah i would say the biggest limiting factor is water and the lack of water and if there is water it's it's low quality it's high in temperature this is an area with not only a lot of people but a lot of agriculture a lot of vineyards and wineries and the coho reliant on these small tributaries there's a lot of people sucking water out of those creeks whether it be for personal use or for agriculture and that seems to be the biggest limiting factor for coho in the watershed and they are starting to address that I mean it's just coming to the light over the last couple years in terms of wineries and vineyards drawing water for frost protection and stuff which just coincides with out migration period for coho salmon so I don't know exactly what they're doing to remedy that but they are addressing that's that issue okay Rick told me his question was was addressed so Morgan gets the last question and i'll tell you at lunch thanks hey yeah that was an excellent presentation thank you for sharing that and you know i guess one of the things that work is with around here if the supplementation program was to before is you know what what happens when the screw gets turned back off in terms of the supplementation effort and so I'm wondering if you guys have recovery targets that you're looking for or if there's any any of the multiple watersheds that you guys are planning fishing that you plan to turn the screw off sooner and evaluate it that's a good question our target goals I correct me if I'm wrong Michael or Carlos but I think they're up to maybe 10,000 for the russian river now so we haven't quite a long way to go but uh as we mean a whole the ultimate goal is that we can kind of back off what we're doing at some point Michael alluded to this and is a presentation this morning is that this isn't a long-term answer eventually we would like to fish to take over and start to you know reestablish there's a little self sustaining runs and we can kind of back off what we're doing and we've already started to see that last year where we're getting adults coming back and we're starting to see wild juveniles and we don't want to just stick a bunch of program fish right on top of these wild fish so I think over the next few years as the numbers start to increase we are definitely going to have to rethink our release strategies and whether it's avoiding certain parts of creeks or just avoiding creaks all together that have wild origin fish in them and maybe start putting our efforts into other creeks in the watershed or other watersheds completely I think that's definitely on the table and that's probably definitely going to happen in the next couple of years thanks much let's thank Ben and let's talk", "cDNiINLxViA": "live in the garden [Music] oh yeah what's up everyone whoo it's 20 20 february 11th we're starting the how to grow volume

could hear me I have another dispensary cart and it is bright labs look at that guys this is from California and it is Mendel breath it is an indica and it comes with five hundred milligrams which is zero point zero 18 ounces total and 325 milligrams of total THC which is 65 percent zero zero five milligrams of CBD which is zero one percent and if you look at it guys they come in a really nice cardboard packaging really thick and there's a doobie tube inside I just finished dosey dose of bright labs right here guys I'll tell you right now the oil on these cartridges it is a little bit dark but it's it's on fire you ain't got to worry about these being dark though because this is a dispensary career so it like supposedly said whole plant cannabis extract so whatever they get off the plants what they put in the cartridge no additives no nothing and see if I could still get a little here has a little bit left shout-out to vo-tech for this battery very amazing if you haven't got a battery yet or you're looking for a better one I definitely recommend um the vo-tech Osiris I think or siren song like that buzzy Cheers very smart it but it's some fire guys like bright lads I still got two more steep odds right here so these will be next but these for some reason I just like them really like a lot so I wanted to do another review on the next one but on the bad guys it tells you manufactured by bright labs you can find them on Instagram as bright labs and then wwr labs calm you can go there as well and the back it says clean natural whole plant cannabis extracts lovingly crafted with botanical inputs from top farms across Northern California ingredients a hundred percent kind of a soil that's it that's all that's in there and then it tells you the government warnings about you know being 21 or older eating older breastfeeding when pregnant or whatever your all that stuff driving under well vaping this isn't good I might as well do it at home or whatever and the warning of cancer and reproductive harm for vaporizing use only do not ingest orally or apply topically there it is this white seal right here is the sticker that's holding the top together and then there's one here with I'll tell you right now with the dis tested lab results and everything if the batch number is l10 866 date manufactured was eleven nine twenty eighteen package on twelve twelve twenty eighteen it was tested by CW analytics the test date was eleven twenty eight of 2018 and this cartridge will expire on 11:28 of 2019 so when you buy one of these cartridge guys you still have a four years so if you don't get so here you lose it go find it somewhere between a year you'll still be good and then the California license numbers CD pH - zero zero zero zero zero four three five right there at the bottom is this purple sticker because well holds this with a barcode look at that and then it holds this together so you either gotta rip it or you got to open the seals from here but me I'll rip it cuz it looks just like a book which is pretty nice cuz everybody tell you some inside see look at it comes like a little book and it says our whole plant cannabis extracts preserve the full spectrum of terpenes and other compounds are found in each strain for an effect that's closest to smoking flower Oh got that flower right here guys look at that so they're vapes are meant to taste just like the regular flour no additive flavors like all those Dinks or anything like that it's just straight to the point seeing it says right there no additives or fillers or you at the bottom comes in the white do we do with the California's symbol right here with the weed sign I hate my voice right now guys I'll tell you right now thank you guys so much y'all made me hit those 2000 subscribers the giveaway is coming soon I just got it CBD chief sent me something I don't know if you I've seen them they're on Instagram they're a new company they sent me the starter kit that they made for CBD right here I will I will be reviewing this soon is just is meant for like you know the sticky paws are the jewel bars I think because look at that guy's two empty ones at the top charger in the battery we'll be reviewing this soon if you know I don't need it I won't be using it as a giveaway as well they only sent me one but you know hopefully if I get in talk with them again I do have a discount code so after the review of you I want to go by one you could just put go to their website and put that no just put hyper anything for twenty and I think you get like ten percent off so if you want one just use it guys cuz you know ten percent off is something but back to the review do be to the cartridge inside all you got to do is just squeeze it pop it open card your slides out I'm gonna make sure there was no leaks you had no leaks inside and look at this guys this is a point five coaches look at this oil compared to even have any other cartridges but compared to like excuse me compared to like any other cartridge that you would think of look at this oil but look they're all you don't move look at any moving at all guys this is what they say right here no additives no nothing just whatever they got this is the older they probably got and look at it there is no leaks on the little kind hole so I know that this is the color of the overlay put in here the only thing that sucks look how much I'm missing I'm missing a pretty damn good amount right there and I haven't even tried it with this one the other one that I had word I put in here I think it just loved it yeah well with this one guys the bubble on this one was so big that I was pretty pissed cuz it felt like I lost like a point two or 0.3 no maybe like a point too but if I like I lost a lot of it cuz it was really low when I opened it and I was pretty sure he leaked but didn't have no leakage signs so look at this one it's missing a little bit as well I hope they can just you know if there if they're telling you're buying 0.5 I I expect 0.5 not like a point 4.3 does the only didn't need to work on but otherwise right labs the cartridges of fire guys if you're in the local or you're in California and you haven't tried them definitely recommend them but let's see seal at the bottom take it off these have a ceramic white tip and the RC so at the bottom it says Jupiter with the symbol C cell and then it's a L four five eight but does it at the bottom and it has a little white you know a little seat through grommet right inside here just like the thing cartridges they got should be looking for it is the same thing except these are jupiter-c cells I'll just pop in my little magnet on the cartridge for the vo-tech battery and look look at this battery boom cartridges in you can even as well unscrew this off but the cartridge is viz you screw it back on either way and then you just Cheers whoa ooh buddy that was a good hit I was a pretty good that was a pretty big draw with this veal battery whoa look at my eyes is of the first hit it made me kind of tear up a little bit but really smooth and I'll tell you right now really strong really potent oil bright labs most likely they're doing the thing they're really good I also like the cities' but some reason these just do the job better let's go for the second hit but the taste right now it just tastes like weed like regular weed like if yours just smoking flower and you don't really taste any other thing which to me is my favorite which is tell me is my favorite flavor let's go for another here guys Cheers - bug definitely tell you right now the hi I have to give it a 10 out of 10 it made me tear up twice and I'm really big I'll tell you right now I got me really relaxed kind of sleepy again it's kind of early over here but I got me kind of sleepy as well and made my eyes feel really low like a barely keep them open they look open to me but I could barely give a woman they got me high as [ __ ] guys so now high cannot attend the flavor guys to me because I like the flower flavor I got to give it a 10 out of 10 they're spot on the only thing bright labs needs to work on is just please you know just give me my 0.5 does it does all I want you know I've seen like gram cartridges like the dr. zodiac moon rock which I have the empty carts right here this is slap for this pure 100 was almost left for had a small bubble but that that's a pretty big gap so that's all I want just you know brave labs all you got to do is just just give people their point five oil don't don't shorten them a little bit cuz this one really sucked but I was missing a lot and then to be missing a good amount on here that doesn't make it any better so 38 guys just to get a little bit more baked but to tell the truth right Labs mendel breath it gets the four 10 out of 10 on everything so 20 points gotta do this for the the clipboard whoo but right here Bray Labs 20 points really good third hit just to get more baked cheers guys hope you have been smoking with me thank you for everything I've done for this channel and for us so they just keep going with this boom let's keep doing this I got more dispensary cards coming anyway so stay tuned man some really good oil hmm every hit I'll tell you right now the name of this train Mendel breath sounds mean as hell so how it's hitting it just goes with the name I'm so big so play right now guys thank you so much don't forget to like subscribe comment down below any suggestions I'll try to get the dispensary card you told me it's just you know it takes me a little bit of time to find where I can get them from and you know just you know just keep sharing this video if anybody has a found out about me let them know and you know I still do think videos is

bought this gram of concentrate from maniac sesh a cool little event that happens every Saturday in Los Angeles this company was there they had a booth and I thought it was pretty cheap so I decided to try some out I'm gonna open it smell it okay so what it looks like [Music] they put the little peepee on the bottom side the purple punch and you get like a berry smell a sweet smell a little bit of a purple smell the strain is purple punch or punch is a sweet and sedating in the cut dominant hybrid the genetics are Larry og and granddaddy purple and it's known for smelling like grape candy or kool-aid the healthy dab from this with that pretty big guy very huge all right here's to sampling it if you're under 18 years old please click out of this video this video is only intended for viewers who are 18 plus years old I live in a legal medical state so I'm a lot to do this I do not condone illegal activities don't do anything illegal Cheers I'm gonna taste this [Music] guys an ant happened to stumbled and landed on the tip of my dapper and somehow he was able to ruin my giant as that another dad no ants Cheers pristiq purple punch you're gonna be trying this let's see what it tastes like [Music] [Music] some of the berry flavor comes through I also get a lot of pine flavors overall flavor-wise I'll probably give this a 3 out of 5 the price is five out of five being at $15 [Music] the cool thing about the strain is it gives you a two punch effect both to the cerebral and to the body this is a perfect strain paired with desserts or as a dessert the effects may help with nausea stress body aches sleeplessness the main flavors that I smell from this is the berry and the sweet I get hence maybe Hensel flickery but doesn't come through very well on this batch and that's

boys it's very very awesome to be in here I can't believe it's actually happening I gotta say you know whenever we were posting smoke box trailers on Instagram you know we always get suggestions on on who to have right like or who people want to see and and you know requests and whatnot right and always always always in my comments section where you're gonna have men don't and finally we got shot lovely it's here you know we got we aim to please baby it's real cool you know cuz we grew up listening to your guys's music you know so long ago before we got into music and you know to be doing this for so long now and having our fans reaching out you know and tagging trying to get us in here we want to thank everyone for helping out that's love man it's lovely you know you got a fanbase when you know every time somebody's you know trying to champion the cause and when we started the smoke box you know a lot of names popped up you know real quick as they would you know like snoop well that's even worse one consistent name that always came up was your guys in my in my [ __ ] IG comments with shorts a salute to your fans yes on that and that has to go to like your work ethic and and the love you put into it as cultivators obviously but also as artists exactly yeah you know cuz you guys do both yes we do both and it's been you know it's been a it's independent grinder since the very beginning when we first got into it you know we got into music it was back in like 2007 with reek daddy that was he was out of Vallejo the crest side right he was one of the og is at least Mac Dre up you know they were sitting on each other way back in the day yeah sig tapes yeah so when we got into it with reek with an a YB records you know that was super underground real independent and he laced our boots on on music on just how to keep it real and just be ourselves and you know do what we want do what we want to do you know and just really push this take it to the next level yeah who were some of the the inspirations for you to like to get you actually into the music well of course Cypress Hill it was yeah we were listening to you guys like probably like before a lot of people you know it was you guys were listening to Kottonmouth Kings was another big influence for us yeah you know we grew up to that back in high school we were bumping that kind of music and started to really get into all the cannabis music cuz we are out in mindo you know living in the culture deep the deep in the deep in the culture in the hills so you don't know about Mendocino it's like one of the deep cannabis culture cities in California yes that's for sure oh yeah they don't have to begin when we got into music we're kind of hesitant on going full out representing the cannabis culture because we were raised to keep it tight keep it secret you're supposed to tell people about what we were doing and especially with freaked out he was in Hawaii that's none of your business records right so that's how we kept it right but as time started going by we really found ourself and wanted to really you know just like you know you guys are doing reppin this cannabis we wanted to find a new route and take it to the next page like how can we continue on this cannabis brought your music and maybe get into more they grow inside of teaching people how to do this and bringing them right on the forefront of it I think that's that you know that's a part of why people [ __ ] with y'all because you you actually take the time to do that you guys actually you know in the culture by way of cultivation and [ __ ] like that like making your own product and all that stuff but you're also as an artist like talking about the lifestyle exactly as well it's probably the product like we all do and you know trying to build our brands of [ __ ] like that but like you guys are also teaching people with with all that preservative me and it's not like you just taking advantage of it like a like you see a lot of heads do these days Downers there's not really love for the culture and like passing on the information and you guys definitely are one of the few to do that [ __ ] that's what's up we've had friends over time to be like man you're giving up too much game and stuff and over time we realize like the people that listen to our stuff are from around the world and people that are learning and benefiting the most from what we're talking about aren't taking up cells from us you know what it means - yeah people in our same block is watching our [ __ ] the same as people from around the world are that's got so many messages from around the world or just like how much we help people like we're growing for their family and different people that are sick in their family and I have to buy we kind of maximizing their yields and stuff like that so it's super cool and that's and that's you know that's a bigger deal right there when you're affecting other people in that aspect especially in a positive aspect like that you know so I mean that's it's yeah you know you might want it to be like the biggest brand out there but sometimes you know not the biggest brand out there are affecting people ya realize for sure in that way man and I think that's definitely some cool [ __ ] man it is yeah it's been it's been a fun ride and it's crazy to see - all the changes that's been going on now you know with legalization and yeah you know how do you feel about like the way that people are more accepting of it now like they're embracing it and wanting to learn about I love it for sure I love that people are starting to finally open up to it and be you know more comfortable you know random other people that you know used to want to keep it hidden all the time now they're actually not scared to show their face show that they're growing their own personal medication and that's what it's all about that's what we wanted to teach people for so long because a lot of people out there that grow do stuff aren't necessarily growing it really clean or organically and when someone could go out there and buy something that's really not too good for you know cannabis is supposed to heal you so you're not supposed to be mixing chemicals in the mix with it so when people are able to grow their own personal stuff and know exactly what they did to it how they grew it it's like so cool to see that reaction from you know us being able to teach people and then sending us messages and stuff back Oh like you know check it out look at the the plants I grew out and like newsela in there you know how in France like we're growing these plants and caging them up like you guys and that's what it's been about you know as much as we reprimand us you know in California it's a worldwide movement it is you know and here's the thing no matter how good anyone is because there are very talented you know cultivators out there right now you know no matter how much house no matter how good you are and how much you grow this is like one of the number one consumer markets you could never grow enough there's room for so many you could pass the knowledge you can yes exactly even just having plants with your family you know I mean it's always been a risk for you to have your kids there yeah on the farm instead so just that being gone is huge yeah that's what having the freedom without is crazy yeah the freedom that it now gives you to do something like that is awesome there is cultivating other stuff yes yeah and it's spreading because now throughout the country there are other states that are now legal and they're exploring legalization in California was at the head of that yeah you know even though we weren't the first legal state we've been pioneering the move me exactly oh yeah for so long people you know and there's other people from other states and around the world that would be like that [ __ ] that California but realistically in this new industry definitely California was the pioneer yes man I mean even on the cultivation front from North Central to south from the indoor growing to the outdoor yes and you know in the greenhouse with the light depth all that [ __ ] you know all the best you know growers are here and I get you know I get negative comments sometimes for saying that from the people in different places you know like you know Canada and Colorado which have you know yes formidable [ __ ] cannabis you can't grow outdoors like every other state can grow indoor good you can set up a room that's just like a room and Alaska could be the same as a room no but you gotta have the knowledge knowledge that is where everyone I'm here to learn because it's the this is the spot that it kind of got real real deep into the culture into learning about the plant more yeah on the legal side to pretty much yeah and you guys are working on a new album right now right yeah we actually have the album done oh yeah we're getting ready to release it on 4/20 this year right you know of course as being cannabis cultures so deep we'd love to release albums on 4/20 right just seems like what about seven ten seven ten you know we definitely it's a new release it is it's an early stage I like extra celebration days an extra holidays for stoners for sure the next one we got to make that one officials right a beast yeah you know what what I'm I don't know is is is how you know you have the the puff coke peaks and stuff like that so you don't have to have the [ __ ] torch you know you know you just it's like Senate said oh go easier yeah and you know portable you could take that [ __ ] anywhere you know I mean and it's not like a [ __ ] spectacle people don't think like you're cracking now the torches make people crazy thing and then when you're using it you're like [ __ ] people are thinking crazy things right so there's this [ __ ] subconscious thing about it but yeah I like how they're they're doing the [ __ ] like yeah you know it's a nice way to smoke spleen is the cleanest way vaporizing it like a low temp dabs like that the taste is off the charts these days people are making amazing delicious even we've never tasted smoking flowers you know forever yeah the Terps oh they could pull out of our flowers now oh oh yeah crazy yeah so this is the the new album about the culture the new album is definitely deep into the culture and what's cool about this album is this is actually season 3 of our live in the garden series nice and we live in the garden we actually record the whole album all the instruments all the vocals outside in our garden so will will grow a plant into a vocal booth we'll be training it through the year opening up a space we'll set the microphone up in there the mic stand and we'll go out there bring all the studio equipment we got you know our whole band the middle dope band these days it's been real cool working with all these live instruments our boy mr. BLAP he does the drums Trevelyan does the bass guitar and Johnny Johnny Fingaz does the electric guitar nice and also working with some oh jeez like Bravo and Scott bone horn players they were all with Pat Taub Anson OG reggae legend how does it feel having like a new live element on stage which it's so fun like I love performing all the time you know rocking DJ sets is a blast but when he comes to the band and really interacting and being able to take the music to a new dimension almost you know whole different strength to exactly like you're saying with like the new album the elephant so I said like you guys try to get that like Pink Floyd in a way sound that trippy stuff and with the live band and live instruments you're able to I feel like go so deeper into tweaking the music and and bending things and making it just different yeah you could definitely explore more into you know creating a trippy sound for sure you know on the spot with all the programs they have these days like I just have a MIDI controller keyboard and I can have any instrument at any time you know any trades the instrument and he eats live sound and you just psychedelic sound it's so cool to have that on the table like that yeah and please you know he makes all the beats for for us like since back in the day right and he's been always into trippy noises and just a different style it doesn't sound the same as much other stuff and you know as much as we are influenced by you guys by Mac Dre by the Tupac's and all this kind of stuff and reggae especially likes Isla Damian Marley we just kind of take a little bit from everything and just try to make our own thing but we like to touch on all those aspects and especially give respect to you guys you know and like all these pioneers that have paved the way for for us to do this now and just kind of just continue on this culture that's what the whole goal is I mean it you know we all got inspired from somewhere for sure you know with us it was like Public Enemy and yeah and the Beastie Boys and groups like that and you know host of others you know but so many yeah and it did always passes down yeah we learn from you guys and after we got hooked on everything that we liked of our style of music then we went back track and listen to when you guys with all this and see what stuff like that and they've always talked about who he's been listening to back in the day and Slick Rick the chaos one like all that kind of stuff it's like such classic for our [ __ ] right music has changed so much on the time you know like when week four I feel like when we first got into music everything was making that drastic change like from what what the music used to be and now there's like so much of this new style and I mumble rap and all this like I just can't get into it it's not it's for some it's for some people yeah sure yeah and it's just I'd like to take it back to the roots you know we could go back and listen to all the old albums for life the class still stand up they stand up for the test of time for sure so you got any collabs on this album or is it just you guys sure we ought to get you in the garden that's been one of our altar calls that's a definite goal is relaxed and loved to be in that garden I'm just chilling with these it's a guard in this stage these days - we got the permanent set up it's a real fun recording out in the garden and like we first had the idea because because weird that's dope you know we're just trying to take it to that like do something else like what can we do and we're out in the garden working so much you know cuz we're really farming out there yeah so we're out in the garden cuz we always come up with musical ideas we're just doing whatever and like let's make a single out here for fun see how it goes and that's [ __ ] it sounded so good it was like wow like I can't believe we're able to achieve this kind of sound with with no big expensive studio you know we're basically growing the studio we have some equipment not a lot either you know it's like basic stuff but we just got there and have fun and just do what we like to do and it's like our perfect environment out in the garden we're able to make music and then do a little work on the side exactly oh [ __ ] gives me more time than we're in the garden in the studio do you play your garden any specific type of music all the trimmers that come up have different stuff they show us to like always here on different songs we never heard of all so yeah we're definitely keep an open mind about music besides I don't know some of the newer weird stuff that they're doing but you know reggae rock and roll all types of stuff you know not just not just hip hop you know yeah country music you know our our mom listened to country music life throws some classical [ __ ] in there some like I can't remember without the dude's name one of her favorites there's some classics though you know we're definitely down with all kind of music and people McIntyre on the radio as cultivators like what's what's uh what's what's the strains you guys are working on right now well there's a there's a lot of strains in the mix right now laya riot is one that we thought you got to see today though fire homemade two years ago he won the highest chirps with it at the end World Cup two years ago with it also yeah that's a mark green shock farms yeah he's our new partner we've teamed up with this year and did the full legal permit to grow so uh he's got some killer genetics you know he's been growing for a you know over twenty years like breeding his own genetics and stuff that's really not released yet either so he's got some hidden gems and the Nature's bunch of new [ __ ] about today yeah some new just tasty flavors he's really into the fruity kind of stuff and we've been into that a lot too but not you know we love our gases of course fuels but we love our fruity strains also strain started two years ago strain after ourselves it's the locomotion across the core cold which is one substrate he's had forever we made the strain with him and then the fires two years ago took his whole house out to all of this genetics out nearly we lost all that whole strain and the whole project we're doing this work though is definitely crazy last year we restarted the project again got a new male picked out from the core coal so we could just keep that going to bring it back so right now we're gonna be testing a lot of that this year and we even crossed we grew a couple at the farm this last year so we crossed it to tropical sleigh right also we're gonna have something right Dana wants to call it it's exciting though there's a lot of strains definitely in the works and some cool stuff about to come out outside of your guys's brand what are the other brands eating that you guys are feeling right now like flower or flower wise well like skittle stuff a lot people sconces fire yeah his own field for a long time even in high school he went to high school field so yeah got some fire for sure they got some fire for sure I always curious on jungle boy stuff because we're up north that we always see it we always look so special and so fire you have yet to try it we got to see a lot of it but we haven't got to got our hands supple people brought on to own that much of the way it's to us and stuff and it was yeah they got some fire down there it's been a minute my favorite from there their menu was always like the wedding cake and and what was the other one [ __ ] it was another cake that they had so many you have so many we actually got hands on the wedding cake Scott - we did it indoors one of our last rooms to be able personally normal no these guys like to smoke the end or to a lot they got a lot of fire over there like that strain yeah it's cool to see you know so many people are getting so deep into it and it was just like some off-the-charts weed coming out these days it's got to a whole new level oh yeah there's flavors all over the place and you know it's now in different countries which is cool - yes so like if you you know traveling about you know I'm saying like if you're a traveler you go into a lot of places now and find some good flavors it's crazy you know didn't it wasn't like that before you know and and now you know the world has opened up or it's opened it up I should suggest really brought everyone together everyone's not the - scared and put stuff on the internet about weed it's changing fast like you said for sure yeah I

[ __ ] is Nik Girl Scout cookies that boji cushions the different poison makes the other that's what I thought so I'm assuming this is probably [ __ ] pretty odd reminiscent of some kind of a girl cook Girl Scout cookie strain because the og cush breath is the doji cush costed bitter poison cross-listing Girl Scout cookie so I'm assuming this is gonna be really cook you reminiscent and I'm excited about that because the cookies always [ __ ] been a real [ __ ] hate changer for me fast and that's exactly what I need right now so let's check it out on a few minutes oh here this is called

real solid like rock-hard tight sauce which is nice because they break up a lot and all that good stuff inside it is just good stuff basically good way to put it maybe all the good stuff is gets to that side sounds good right that's nice really taught us a lot of trifling colors obviously it's just freaking off there like that this is the og cush breath I've had scrubs and I mean issues

honest reject they ejected how do you feel myself getting instantly better Hey instantly that earlier there here comes Gregory and so on hey [ __ ] I love medical marijuana I think after this system huh I instantly feel better I feel a lot more obviously like see I shrugged off a lot of the issues I was just dealing with kind of stuck on the back burner there and almost got me back to you know normality so what something I was down here now I'm here hopefully sneaking in here I'm be good to go um I can't really tell you about how help it will do during like your daytime nighttime effected honestly outside we have a simple adder which was just relieving so now I may be with the snacks while I'm really calm because it's kind of the fact if you don't want to whom the shit's hit me real hard on my part my issues just the medication alone just can't just take the edge off more or less space who watches what just happened I feel a lot better now I do feel out it's mighty it's good have you hey man my head like real ivy you know a head like you might as well spoke about the game changing nothing I heard he's just be a great day time strain just a midday all around term strain but even most change he's gonna get his symptoms wiped out I could really feel like anybody sometimes no lag no lethargic Ness you need be able to keep it moving keep it going which is nice so this is candy be more of one of those things that neither you relief this great relief especially for a you know anxiety type symptoms and [ __ ] like that I do it um let me get you back to where you had to go and keep it moving hi guys hope everybody gets a I'm a better one now Thank You CJ might be thank you it's like being in the corner and thank you Mark and everybody wears gloves hey guys hey TC doing peace", "pJh6fvPitPI": "[Music] look what I've got here this is a bud of something called Mendo crumble and it's from a cultivator I've never tried before called G kueh and it's my understanding that this brand is being supported by little Wayne so today we're gonna try the Mendo crumble out of a perk up and you can see this bud is just beautiful you see if there's a little bit extra the Shamir now it's part of the bud but you can see it's got all kinds of stems going on it's all grown in different directions so you can see it comes in a box that has all the information on it and this flower has 24 percent THC and it also comes in a jar but the one bad thing about this jar is that it doesn't have the kind of flower on the jar because if these get separated you don't know what it is but anyway it's all good hopefully look correct that over time everyone seems to do that today we're going to try it out of a per cup you can say I've got paper cup to set to 3:30 so let's see if Mendo crumbles got the game we are looking for the best and it is G cool Mendel crumble the best let's check it out so this learner has a weeding earthy taste and one thing I noticed about this flower is that most of the times with vapor Cup smooth flowers stay really smooth and this flowers actually smooth at the beginning but it gets rougher real quick more than other flowers so I'm guessing I don't know if there's flowers hydroponic I'm only guessing because a lot of times you can taste the dirt out of a per cup that something is hydroponic it is so smooth so sweet you can't imagine how good this item is but when it's grown in dirt you can really tell so this is one of those flowers that maybe it smokes different than in a joint that would taste out of a per cup or even be out of a per cup we always try and get these reviews right I realize there's someone's work I'm very much in the know and alls we're doing is cherry picking the best strains so to be the best you have to be better than thousands of strange right so what do we think of Mendo crumble I just thought this flower was okay I'm giving this flower an eight for me it wasn't the smoothest it was kind of a creeper I felt kind of hazy you know it just came on kind of slowly it's just okay for me there is better flowers than this and we're gonna continue looking for the best if you want to try Mendel crumble go right ahead this is not a bad flower it's Nate which is a average flower this is the doctor for weed entertainment if you like the videos please subscribe if you want to see the top flowers list you can see it on weed entertainment calm those flowers up there you're guaranteed to get an unbelievable experience if you want to see paper cup you can see the vapor cup calm this is really some game changing changing technology excuse me technology you can see the a little bit of flower goes a long way and if you get this item you're gonna save a lot of weed this is the doctor thanks for joining in the nonsense party on my friends [Music]", "4cEMdrsPRsw": "[Music] we've seen a lot of large-scale grows throughout the years do so much damage to the land here at Mendocino grasslands we tried to take a spot that was already open that the field was already here and so we didn't have to cut down any trees literally we plopped down right on top of it and started building our beds when we harvest these we'll be able to go right back into these same beds with the same soil we have rain collection so we're not taking from the local water source if we create an environment and we're we're giving back to the land and not constantly taking we're doing a good justice for everyone in our community I have a lot of pride being able to participate in something that has been so underground for so long to be able to do this on this level with this quality it's it's a blessing", "TuCk31pY7UM": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] me and Trevor I enroll in the Greek alright let's check out these routes bring it on over yeah just getting there nicely so we like to transplant as soon as the first one it's the ground on the first couple of pots once they get to this size we want to build a little bit of a root ball look at the sign over here so now when we transplant these that actually has some grip to the pot stead of this whole thing falling apart then we'll transplant it in and it'll just open up all these will just go everything's ready all those happy roots we don't like to do this this much but it's always fun and you got to see what it looks like so you know when to transplant the next time it's always a little bit rough for them but they're plants well they got to get used to the rough life together so we got our 10 gallon pots coming from Sookie got to transplant these probably a couple days huh yep maybe maybe two days tomorrow maybe I was walking on transplanted transplanted will probably also help them steps a little bit that little shock that they get now that we're also on sixteen and a half hour veg it's like just barely hanging on by a thread so yeah what's up everybody March 24th now we are checking out our seedlings please you want you to go through and show them what we're working with so right here we got our Dairy Queen's this is our 10 year old pack original Dairy Queen how did the ten we got these four and are doing good this one's a little funky I almost want to kill her but they're kill it I don't think so just because it's very it's very specially we probably would kill it just to get our numbers down again this one is my favorite this one right here is definitely I think gonna be if this one turns female it's the one for sure it looks so beautiful look at the side branches on it or starting super-nice all the way down to the little purple leaf sex yet but we have a new microscope camera thing that we can show you guys exactly what we're talking about cuz I know it's hard self if you've never done it it's hard to Steve super freaking small stuff these special Dairy Queen's let's see what we got next Polly oh jeez prostitute the North Star collab and so far I mean they are all looking quite Oh G form yeah they take these little sticks not so much the leaves but the structure of how it's stretching yeah I'm kind of how small they are it's like really just got that Nepali dominator that's where it's just okay slow nepali OG but we'll see what happens strains for our pot so we have to weed down some stuff we're still figuring out what we're not gonna keep yep right here sour banana sherbert they all look pretty uniform most of all not to really similar yeah started a 10 pack one of them was a super runt and the other one didn't start I believe I think we had a 12 pack when we started we started luck all right next up the conspiracy push the night here is when we've been looking at for a bit looking he's going crazy he's dead alright pushy too like this one it's like that hands rage Cheerios at the farm looking like some real nice one of these will be going and they're short - they're quite short and stocky right now yeah which is not the best for us here outdoors just gonna be proms at the end of the year or to water your plants we got over here is that Brian Barry cough extra strawberries to me for some reason laughs - sub which Pinot we're gonna want to keep yep well you know these Brian berries are looking real happy and healthy what else we got next up 24 karat gold 24 karat got a little ripped up with something [ __ ] nudged into it maybe a frog life out here I don't know if we're even gonna run this outside now these ones probably just gonna be testers I might just give them to someone let them run them inside and Fino hunt yeah testing testing they just sounded really cool people look at how stretchy all these are I mean there are towers already wicked one stay sex it's like we could snap it down here and do the main line if foul this is where it starts to show you this one could be a male this one's kind of fun it's pretty thick it's pretty thin stretchy too thick to this hollow part drinking a lot of water pretty much well we got one two three four five sets of branches now on the sixth set I think is not the time when they start showing six or seven stat almost always don't worry about one set away one week away from things to start you're getting real close right here these are these straight from a home in Australia gotta look up and see who it was again yeah brother we'll find you before the end of the DVD god we wanted to do one of these at the mic stand but I think we're kind of mistaken on the these are like the short stock is ones out of everything with our sticker wrapped around it little holes drilled where the seeds were so champ something special different new over here we got them crazy trains now crazy train was so far the biggest planet we've ever grown although we didn't get to harvest it cuz we got ya raided that year but it was in a 400 gallon pot huge huge huge I mean huge plant the pot I mean we have thousand gallon pot that's supposedly gonna go in if one of these ends up being the best of the best you only got three of those pots so you gotta make them count crazy train is a murderer out here in mindo Northern California this train outside will kill it major weight rosti run it last step grease monkeys monkeys migraines I like these two a lot yeah I'm down to do one of these outside for shirts do they all look kind of dissimilar different this one's got whatever this one has mixed in it with these ones those thick look at the roundness to the leaves those have a lot of that [ __ ] cookies in it huh nope yeah that's a cookie so it'll be interesting to see what happens this year and hook and you know we got a lot of seeds right now but we're about to be weeding through and [Music] it's got two tops we're about to eat up real soon we're about to kill registered our clones everything's rude in we're going to be doing three clones outside locomotion vanilla Kush and herb man's special MC one cut yep those root they'll be set out here put under this light sixteen and a

peeps uh the hair is looking real bummy we don't get that fixed up though anyway real reason why y'all are here today we're going to be checking out some cold cure premium tier 1 hash rosin from punch extracts this is the white tahoe cookies review here is you know just the product itself we got right here percentage-wise we're going with uh 80 chc for those who are curious i don't really see too many uh other um you know things on the ten or ten the percentages but you know here's what we're working with and of course you know i will always include them lovely lovely close-ups and yeah so normally when we're you know dabbing out here i try to get different angles and things like that but we don't really have the other camera and the attachments i have for this camera are kind of on the wonky side today so you know that's just that's just how it goes but today we're going to be dabbing out of two things i got the little ursa rig and for those yes i know it's a dirty banger i just took a whole gram dab out of that last time around um and i don't feel i ain't gonna lie i don't feel like cleaning it just yet i want to take at least like a few more dabs out of it before i clean it because it's literally only seen one or two dabs so you know what i'm saying oh yeah and the we got the b4 with the sit cup for our other hit there but yeah i'm just going to go ahead and get this thing started up heat up this dab and yeah let's go we'll take our first rib i think that should be good there on the heat here we go for our first dab nice little slab like this hope that focuses in all right i think it's hot enough at least it's been i don't really dab too uh hot too often so cheers guys we got nice flavor off that but of course that is not that hot we're gonna fix that so yeah still getting used to the new banger um it's got an opaque bottom so i can't really see when it gets red oh yeah that's nice see we got most of the flavor in that first um rip the flavor here is definitely a little bit more toasted of course that's all that's on me but we're gonna get a really really deep deep flavor off the v4 so all right so i think yep that's all of it we got all of it out of that so okay so of course is cold here um so it's a lot smoother and of course it kind of has that you know really really cool uh taste to it because of that cold cure of course you know i'm just repeating myself now but yeah it's probably one of the smoothest things i've ever dabbed smoked whatever like even really really good indoor doesn't really get this smooth honestly and i've had a lot of good stuff before so yeah i think cold cure is definitely the wave if you're looking for what is the best you know most smooth most potent kind of uh concentrate to smoke or at least thc thing to smoke you're looking at it right here it's definitely some cold cure live frozen and uh yeah i'm not i'm not gonna say you know all other life rosin is bad or other rosin is all bad and all this stuff you know only smoke cold cure i'm definitely not like that uh you know smoke what you like and continue to smoke what you like type things but just saying you know for those who you know have this is expensive i will say that guys so if you don't this is not you're not gonna find this for anything less than like maybe 80 uh 80 if you're lucky honestly because this is normally like 90 dollars a gram so um you know what i mean it's definitely not really for the bargain shopper uh so you know only i would say only buy this if it's a special occasion or you know you can afford it or if this is just within your means type thing or uh you know i'm saying like for example you only smoke one gram and you'd like it to be the best gram you can get then you know you can go look for some cold cure live rosin you know i'd highly suggest but other than that you know what i'm saying this is definitely something that uh if you're looking to save money this is not really for you but it is really really good that flavor is super super deep like i was saying before um i don't think i touched on too many of those notes so let's touch on them a little bit shall we what else first you know it's a little sweet um not too too much though we got a lot of that gassy kind of taste there and yeah we should be able to get a little bit more of that figure profile down now that i've got that hit packed up um but yeah this is maybe my third live rosin premium or premium whatever it is uh their whole thing is premium live rosin or tier one sorry live rosin so that's the whole thing they like to say for it but i think it is really good it is really really really [ __ ] good all three of the grams i've had i think are definitely worth the price although i wouldn't really buy them weekly type thing you know i'm saying i bought them for review purposes i don't know when i'd buy another one maybe to celebrate something but uh we'll see yeah i'm gonna get this hit cooked up so i hope you guys can join me this once again out of the divine tribe v4 um and i got a little stick up attachment on there and we will be doing a video on the v4 soon i know i promised that a really long time ago and i've been really slacking on it but that video will be coming yeah opponency wise guys this is great even after just one dab i'm toasted this might even be the last dab of the video guys so i hope you guys can join me and if you've been watching up to this point please don't forget to leave that like drop a comment and subscribe you know help the homie out cheers everybody oh wow you guys like a garlicky taste to [Music] it not too garlicky though yeah let's show some cookies we got that the nice signature cookies taste in there yeah i'm pretty sure everyone knows what some good cookies taste like um strain wise i'm just cleaning this out a little bit but try to think of any other notes i can think of well you know you got y'all got me here um and honestly i can't really think of anything else right now to say because it's hitting me tough guys this thing rips once again if you're looking for something really really really smooth i would and you haven't tried cold cured live rosin not resin rosin then you should definitely give this a go bruh once again this is the punch extracts white tahoe cookies cold cured batter you know second coal gear we've had here on the channel and yeah cold here and at least in the rosin world this is definitely the future of you know everything i hope one day this becomes the standard and we get these for like you know 30 25 40 you know whatever whatever the price may be just lower than 90 that'd be great in the future um but for now you know i guess i i i guess it's worth the price you know uh i haven't had too many super expensive grams you know i've only i've only had uh you know i concentrate grams over like eighty dollars like on five occasions now so i wouldn't really be able to call myself a an expert in that kind of field where flower is concerned that i think i'm a little bit better off in knowing uh in terms of those kind of price points but this one yeah so if you guys know any other better live rosin than this you guys like you got to let me know so i can give that a go otherwise though this is super super satisfying loving the high it is i believe this is a indica dominant hybrid um so you know that's kind of my alley i kind of normally buy things like that and i kind of like being slumped like that kind of relaxed feel super kit laid back type thing i'm getting that here but i'm also feeling a little social i ain't gonna lie you know maybe it's a little a little bit of the tiny little bit of sativa that lies within the cookies you know cookies don't really have too much sativa in them but you know what i'm saying like they do kind of make you a little talkative sometimes like i mean maybe that's just me but hey um that's all i got for today's video guys i'm super baked so i probably won't get another rip in just yet you know what i'm saying i got a little i got some other things to do today so you know you guys can though catch a bunch of rips on stream if you want and i'll be streaming on youtube tuesdays fridays and then on the weekends it's just kind of whatever whenever saturday sunday whenever like that but yeah tune in for those we do twitch streams as well throughout the week you know find the links to all that down below including merchandise and all that stuff and hey if you guys haven't noticed the new banner that was made by uh through commission i'll you know if you guys are interested in any art commissions maybe i can slide uh the artist's uh you know info over to you guys you know i don't know if he's still doing open commission so i'm not gonna put it out right now but if he is then you know just contact me you can contact me if you're interested in uh i'll i'll give him a little mask or i'll ask him or you know give him your info and all that stuff but yeah

but anyways that's all i have thanks for watching guys and i'll see you on the next one man peace out peace", "iQhIXGxfKgk": "hey guys welcome back this is sub LBC here doing another video episode of growing from freedom and as promised we are now hanging out inside of the epic 6000 watt indoor cannabis garden featuring the mend of' coop and actually we are running a little bit hotter than that super lumen mode is about 6 to 600 watts so we are really throwing down a lot of light into this garden and it's pretty obvious from the size of some of these buds I mean seriously guys these things are just bulbous and huge I mean these things are just amazing you know really really excited guys about the upcoming harvest that we're gonna have out of this garden and we're going to be going out with a bang obviously this is going to be the last grow that we have in this room I'm gonna be converting this back over to regular living space and obviously I'm gonna be really excited to start on the LED mothering tent which is just gonna be exciting I think you know hopefully where you get some really excellent results out of that but until we do obviously we start to finish up this window after grow and honestly guys there hasn't been too much going on and really not too much else to report just been focusing on keeping fresh water going into the plants you know obviously pa-ching it we're to about 5.9 and introducing fresh water about once every 48 hours you know essentially the plants will go just about to complete days before they get fairly dry and I want to consider watering them again and I am giving a little giving them a little bit more water than usual obviously because you know we are getting going through the flushed period but I think as we get closer to harvest are probably and let the plants go for two days before we harvest so I'm probably to give them one more you know massive fresh water and then wait about two or three days after that get the plants time to dry off and then I will go ahead and harvest them and I want to do that just to make sure the plants are not to water fat12 being in their absolute Primus condition and also want to make sure that the the cocoa that's left over it doesn't weigh like a million pounds because that stuff is really difficult to dispose of when it gets really water heavy and that was somewhat of an issue with the the most recent sfv og harvest over at site B but I can tell that the the constant flushing fresh water it's starting to show a little bit of yellowing of the leaves you guys can probably see here in the video also getting a little bit of cannibalization effect on some fan leaves over in some areas back over there but really nothing to write home about you can see that a lot of the leaves over on these plants are still fairly green so obviously continuing to push the the fresh water initiative but other than that guys really not much else to report other than maybe a little bit of branch collapsing that I've had over in here trying to pull that stuff up probably to reach in there just try to you know temporarily tie it a lot of those buds are fairly mature already but obviously with their excessive weight game they've been having a little bit of difficulty supporting their own weight and even though the cages do a pretty good job of supporting the Mendel Africa you know I think a trellis would be still perfect you know but not necessarily you know you can obviously hold a canopy fairly well together with just cages but you do want to expect to take a few losses here and then but we'll go in there to try to time up and then I'd say probably at this point guys were about five to seven days away from harvest at max you know there's no way we're gonna have to push these plants over seven days probably could do them as soon as five days from today if not sooner if I really wanted to press the issue but you know again it's not really a factor here there are no plants waiting on deck to populate this garden once we harvest so we're gonna run them all the way until they're absolutely done perfect and primed and then I chop them down and have just a beautiful harvest and obviously when we are completed we will talk about the final guild results and quality although I really know quality is going to be an issue guys with this growth these men don't have food plants are just looking phenomenal so that's pretty much it guys I want to keep this video short there's really not much else to go into next video update probably gonna be heading back out to site B again be honest and check in on how those plants are doing as we prepare to introduce the heavy fire in our little attitude opportunity vents nutrients and heavy 16 and then I'm probably shortly thereafter and we'll be laying down the the second lair trellis and I will get to observe how that grow compares to the existing one that we have in the moneymakers so that is pretty much it for this video

captain Chris beer with today's strain of the day just getting some last-minute inspection of the beard so last night I took a pair of clippers and a pair of scissors to it and tried to clean it up and I think it looks a little more presentable I look a little more human so now that I realized where my mistake was time to move the [ __ ] forward right all right anyway so today's training today is going to be from honey gold capital I've got some lovely THC ade diamonds coming up here some Mendo breath so I'm gonna go ahead and get you a good look at that that is just lovely crystals look at all that glitters is not gold my friends so I'm gonna go ahead and assuming my dab tool decides to cooperate I am going to go ahead and crush a good hefty sized love that time for liftoff holy tastier [ __ ] let's hope to god if that clears out of here my god there's board there what the [ __ ] how'd your good my arms are going numb boom that's a pretty good [ __ ] oh my arms are going numb holy crap it's still going Mendo breath should be like called the hip that never ends the topi keeps on giving the dipping tree alright I'm done I had a q-tip marijuana's fixin memory and motor skills Feynman not really he dropped it on purpose kidding anyway so that was Mendo breath holy tasty I did not see that coming Goethe that's what she said I know anyway um Wow that is tasty so instantly when I'm feeling is relaxed I just spent six and a half hours at the Washington DC VA hospital I had a lot of appointments today had a new CT scan discovered a thankfully like totally benign cyst in my left nasal passage which could be contributing to my difficulty of breathing at night when I lay down so that could be contributing to my sleep apnea so there are new things every day right but they don't think it is so what they think it's contributing to is my dry sinus so since coming back from the desert apparently this giant brown nose likes to get dry so the amount of times I've been in dry climate you know go figure so if you have very dry sinuses and they feel like that could be contributing to some of the eye pressure then I get um so having that said there's my medical history for the day that Mendo Bret is very relaxing a lot of anxiety going to the VA today it was a busy day a lot of people there I mean lines for everything it was it took forever to get in you know I was left early for my appointment traffic was horrendous is everything that could go not wrong but everything that could kind of cause your anxiety to flare up when you're still kind of learning the new system sort of did hurt me a little bit this morning you know anytime you meet a new provider you've got to be able to open up and go through all of your hang-ups or whatever you want to call them again so you know I had to discuss with my TBI doctors so I had to discuss my past brain injuries and where I feel diminished still let's say in my cognitive ability so that's kind of what I'm dealing with today but I'll tell you what the Mendo breath makes me not give a [ __ ] like I'm I'm really enjoying that that is like instant [ __ ] it all like it doesn't matter like it is what it is you've got to do what you got to do right you know like just like meeting new people and having to open up in the friendship situation this is very similar having to build that rapport again with your care provider can be an unnerving process so far I've had two excellent doctors at the new DC VA I'm not gonna mention the names but I've had two excellent doctors so far and they've been very forthcoming with the information and how they're putting together my care plan and they're being overly open with me from what I've seen so far and how they're willing to community that's something that I am rather enjoying I feel like keeping open open lines of communication and great when it comes to the situation so you know I'm getting my areas addressed I've already got the necessary consult Saul the medical care I had in Tampa I'm gonna now have in DC so I've got acupuncture chiropractic I'm looking at Tai Chi you know they have a really balanced integrative medicine program here at the DC VA so if you happen to be a veteran in DC and you haven't checked it out honestly ask them about the integrative medicine program and where and where your care provider feels like it can help you not that I'm getting anything from the VA system you know they haven't done me a lot of favors but what I will say is in the integrative medicine department they are starting to close some of the gaps I'll say when it comes to modern medicine and things like exercise more of a holistic whole body approach as opposed to just medicating in it right so having that said I'm definitely very relaxed I don't even feel like I can't detect oh so you guys enjoy the rest of your day one love man and honestly like yo honey gold capital like that's tastiest thing in DC bro seriously for real keep it legal y'all take care", "WgJN23rfcvE": "[Music] you hey what's up guys simplistic here back with another video this is going to be another wax review and I'm gonna be honest with you I actually tried to do this yesterday by his left the lens zoom din so you basically just see like no none of my eyes just my nose down and I don't know it was a good video - off speaking on some [ __ ] [ __ ] since topics and stuff but before I start this video it is December 8th and I'd like to say rest in peace the juice world I wasn't the biggest fan of him by like some of his music and 21 is still very young to go especially with like seizures and [ __ ] so yeah man rest in peace other than that we're gonna start this review video if you couldn't tell from the title it is peanut butter breath and it is from Ursa and I like to mention that the only reason I picked this up is because I have a friend Stevie who's very much into this strange so I've basically got it to make him jealous and to also let him know that there is the selection there that if he chooses to go and get it if he knows I believe there was $24.00 out the door for a gram and it's running at about 74 percent THC I also like to mention that RJ is also his voice is coming through the TV so you might hear like an echo of me or him and also we're gonna be blogging today in SF so it should be a good one and RJ's gonna be vlogging it with this new camera so it's gonna be dope other than that let's start with this video Oh before we start and you just get some tea no I'm going yeah opening this show you what it looks like yeah very very good stuff and you know I've already tried this next scenario in the video but once you open this you can smell it like some waxes you can't really like once you open it doesn't smell like it's like a like a jar of wheat what's your opening you smell it's crazy [Music] let's say anything to the peoples RJ not today we're not uploading it today it's happening today we're filming it today well doesn't mean I'm uploading it today what the hell that mean I have to come home early start editing once I get home which I'm not trying to do right here good stuff and I will be hitting it out of the utili 5 I know some of you expressed some distaste for me always using the utility you got to realize this is the only thing I could hit it out and if I am not using what you like then just click off the video because like there's other we tubers that smoke out of rigs and bonds and stuff you know and if I don't have that kind of content for you don't click it and if it upsets you don't watch you know people seem to get upset when they watch my videos but there's an option to always not watch you know a Smith like I don't know it's up to you and for the most of you guys you don't really care what I'm smoking up you just care about the video in general and what what's being said in it you know I'm saying and you know if I don't have those type of videos for you I mean there's plenty of other we tubers you know when you hit hockey no just mean yourself so he's gonna play a song and mute himself I'm still gonna be continuing on on this review the tastes very similar to that of the og types of raw garden I'm very very much loving the consistency of the wax very proportionate amount of diamonds to sauce which makes it all the more pleasant you know sometimes raw guards and be having like a fat diamond in there and just like some sauce but this is more like evenly proportioned you can tell right here you got some toss toss you got some sauce mixed in with some of that diamonds you just call it boss now huh da sauce but yeah hopefully it's been a alright video so far and uh you know I I'd hate to start it on it on it down no you know like juice world passing away but uh man that sucks rest in peace man let me take it out hit another get fully charged pen for today so and I got two batteries for my camera now so like I have more but like I'm only gonna bring two that's enough so we're definitely gonna have a lot of footage for you guys and honestly the most exciting part is probably using Randy's new camera I want to see what it looks like you know I'm glad I want to say that for those of you who are interested in what camera he is actually using it as a cam it Canon m50 and it was cost a pretty penny I'll tell you that Cheers mother and that the taste is there very very good I would recommend it very very very similar price to that wall garden so if you're tired of raw garden and you want to try another brand check out Ursa definitely another good substitute if raw garden isn't there or any other brands of wax that you haven't sure that you like it but it isn't there try it it's not bad other than that hopefully you guys enjoyed the video [Music] [Music] you", "qV126RYdFDI": "yo how is that we do it to a time and I'm here back with another video in this video we're gonna be doing a two in one type of video I'm gonna be reviewing the new Mendo but that I just got picked up couple days ago dang here's a nugget in nice and dance nice orange fluffs on the on the weed it smells beautiful so I'm gonna be using that in there blunt I'll be smoking the blunt but if you read the boy telling you guys what it tastes like all that good stuff and we finished our living homes let me know down below in the comments what you were smoking on yeah and I don't know if I showed but these rocks these are the rafts I'm using canna raps there hemp props they are a tobacco and nicotine free yeah I got their mother shopping a goodie bag for free but the shot that I got this weed [Music] Feliz like the way ghosts like wine owls just about it why does I do like Swisher's do a lot of people don't like solutions but I don't care I like sometimes they can be a bit stool but other times when they roll nice they're really good they burn good so yeah so here we go you get your cannabis pot all up in there these are big drops like this is kind of too much of a skimmer platform there we go so first the first thing you want to do just get the shape of your weed into the block I just like reading of the bullet so you want it in like a oval type shape just patch it down get that up and over the weed tighten it I'll show you guys in a second a little warm ocean a little warm ocean see like that so once you have it like that you're gonna just roll your bunt up give it a little neck roll make sure it's nice and tight tuck it up under there these bones have natural sugars so pretty much something like a joint that's what they do these are some weird weird blogs man usually this would probably be easier with more weed there we go this is my first time like I said is my first time ever bolognese I guess this is how you do it you know liner stray up this saliva don't burn yourself let go nice and dry so it sticks to be honest I probably would never ever get these power-ups again these are [ __ ] you're nice and dry then what you want to do is get the remainder of what you have Python your bar I'm using a clipper ladder so these common Packers got for three dollars at my local smoke shop just pack it down with anything nice and easy nice and easy come on this side already has some weed falling out I said definitely new somewhat weed so what we do go over bender like I said I'm gonna smoke this pump for you guys right after I roll it and they're gonna give you guys a little review on the wraps and on the weed meadow breath maybe you you know you know you're tired of the tobacco blunts but you like blunts in general maybe and watching this review video don't let you know by rolling it it is kind of hard to roll you're gonna need at least probably two 2.5 grams of wheat to get a nice Jesus sided part only thing about Graham if that one more time okay good is this your blunt head that hard to rule we go I'm gonna go outside right now I'm smoking for you guys so I'll see you guys in a second alright guys so we're back I'm lining up the block right now we're having a nighttime smoke we're smoking along with me cheers get your ladders ready yeah I hope I don't get copyrighted yeah all right for this this was really good this is a Russian cream Oh gives you a great taste get that fighters taste the Russian Queen it's good lotta smoke after running it it's a little hard but they seem to burn good they taste really good definitely if you wanna cheaper if you don't want to do nicotine definitely get these can erupts thank you for the taste the bend over

riches at the tree [Music] what up everyone happy September back in the garden under the conspiracy push this time take you guys on update of everything that's happened we've got a lot of stuff that went down this last month it's been a crazy month so take a peek welcome Widodo family farms Mike Mike check coming again back in do reporting getting ready for the guns you recording yo what's up just checking the vibes on in LA right now greasemonkey canopy I'll tell you what it swallowed the 600 gallon pot like it was nothing I wish it was in a thousand yeah this one would have loved a thousand started yeah it's a little behind yeah it seems like TV days crystals are just automatic this exhaustion etics is just killing it though I got the 40 foot cages to do these triple cages for a couple of them then what else how's this thing looking so it got switched up from the last update the Brian Barry was just after that stunt that happened with those we had some bugs in the soil actually yeah we had a little bit of problems and we'll show you that on a couple of other plants but we were able to keep it managed and control of it and not spread so this is the result things are looking great yeah and if you can come take a closer look at this one crazy train getting across this so oh and oh my it smells like like candy it's it's not definitely lemon yeah it's definitely lemony definitely lemony but it's a it's just delicious yeah this is that TGA if you're looking for that crazy good [ __ ] plant that's just gonna kill it kill it outside super crystal you can tell these pots are the [ __ ] you just have to really have a great start of a great be killing it we got the trellis put over the whole side [Music] the Sun is so much better on this other side the planners monster 320 in this plant two of the biggest ones in the garden but since we're over here let's look at this mc1 mmm thousand gallon pot in the middle of that thing right in the middle and we got to get on the ladder for this thing too mc1 back we're back dance to firmly oh my gosh crystals are just start to come out just barely getting that smell that purples that salt water Thank You herb man thank you so cool thank you MC the legacy lives on this train will never be forgotten ooh and then we have our specialists most out of control fires oh my gosh the whole time we knew this one was gonna kill it it's the one that we found last year if you watch the videos you can see the little runt that we had the whole time and oh my god it's just grown to be such a beautiful girl so big and as it starts to bloom you guys have a locomotion Fino that's this [ __ ] crazy I advise you to keep it forever and it is a monster it's got some chop tops yeah this thing stacks really good too it's got nice easy to trim heavy bugs the dust turned part hopefully the hole will see some real good purp out here it gets cold enough or if it goes long enough without getting the weather ooh hello it's hot out here alright okay so a bug problem but we showed you before now we saved half of the plant we saved like you thought half but none of it does look terrible okay there's a quarter on this side and a quarter plant on the other side ugly but we were able to at least save some of the plants and that's all that matters if you could catch it in time you can still get something so we had those bugs in the soil that were the what are they again a larva themed fungus gnat larvae so the fungus and that larvas were going crazy the fungus gnats are eating our roots you never really you have to pay attention to everything when your plant starts to get yellow or droopy because it a lot of different things will show the same yeah affect a lot of people messenger there could be bugs over watering stock rot you know any any kind of thing so you have to pay attention to everything yeah yellowing is going to happen with any problems so it's hard to just say my plants yellow what's happening very hard and we're going super organic this year there's no chemicals in the soil so the bugs kind of take off if they're actually there so we have the very very ugly on this side but the stuff that was saved it's so pure that's what's so good it's delicious I mean and even this the good side is stacking nice so we have you know it's still not a bad plant but it's a lot of baloney there's gonna be a lot of stuff straight to the hash you can't complain about it it is what it is it's not we're not worried about getting the massive weight we're just trying to get some fire and plants grow big out here yeah let's look at this one that we started with oh my gosh conspiracy cush I think this one is the farthest so far so conspiracy cush everything's been getting the same amount of bloom though we're gonna start to give a little bit more we're giving molasses to them for last couple weeks we're doing the bounty b3 the extreme gardening tea we brew that we do the popcorn still every week or so we give them popcorn tea we got the sea the sea bird guano right the powder eyes that black stuff that is a soluble seaweed extract so I will seaweed extract we're giving them for the high number of organic powder but they don't give them too much stuff we don't do no hardeners we don't do anything crazy and this year especially we're going really really simple and we're gonna show you what you can get with just water and Sun and some sugar and some enzymes and some tea and some compost tea [Music] all right if you have t's you get Dairy Queen packs look for this look for this traits right here man let me but look out see what it does this bud is just falling on top of this but in this bud and there's just branches on top of branches on top of branches the cheese also has the traits where it pops off the stem like this instead of being like branches like the crazy train was it does its own tips everybody tries to come off and be its own thing which really makes more way up and everything looks prettier because there's so much more tips with the space and the cheese or with the purple and the cheese like our cheese quake Pino it just makes the cheese look better a lot of cheese looks funny in the bag kind of stemmy not after sub crossing there so bomb you just find the cheese one still so yeah tell mother so this is the disaster that happened the whole getting used to this no-till style trying to keep them moist with the mulch and all this stuff we were over watering this one for a while we didn't really realize it it does not need a lot of water we were just on the schedule with everything else and we just overlooked it sloppy we tried the doctors I'm it angry time I mean it helps the top of it a little bit it did it harder than the whole top that you could feel but underneath the soil on the main base of the stock where all those roots are coming out it was just softy locks yeah so after a couple of days the branch would wilt like it's drying and it just sad and then it yellows out and then it's will tea again and then they just dry up so it just ended up having to take the whole thing out this stock is just so out of control there's so much cracks and herbs in it it was just something was going on with it we should have done some other we should have done some kind of a stock stuff like Mean Gene or some tango we don't water in the inside like you know so it's the first time we've ever had this happen and this these two branches that are left we just left them for fun to see if they'd survived yeah it's just a kind of an experiment we don't care about them anymore it's just to see what will happen if they get weird in the next couple days we'll take them out but it's been like this for a week now and these have been cool it's I don't get it do not understand but it was our bad I know other people have had problems before it'll just be careful really check your soil really let them dry out a lot you know there's a very fine line of letting them be moist especially with this no-till and you want to keep your enzymes and your bugs and all the micro life happy but guys I'm dry out still you got it and the final plant our dairy queen the other Dairy Queen Fino as you can see this thing is sativa out as it kept stretching it's just fun [ __ ] tripping a little bit it's kind of just a trippy plant it's got a lot of yellow in and we probably should've gave it more I think it's kind of it was such a just ride all the new top of it but it's starting it's gonna be a later one for sure it still looks really good takes a lot of work but they look so badass so I don't know what else we can tell you for pointers just don't over nutrient that's for sure stay very close attention to the bugs you have only you know you're pretty much done spraying this week most strains you probably shouldn't spray no more I would not want to spray this no more for sure yep keep the bottoms cleaned yep yep start cleaning the bottoms one more time we'd pretty much do it three times I do it once when they get the you know nice chunk to them and then when they get the real chunk and then now we're gonna have to do with the one last little cleaning like this crazy train over here make sure they're supported really good even right now if you if you should any supported drop a trellis on that we only put this trellis on a week ago it's gonna make a huge difference yeah it's been there it's gonna save all the buzz from following when it starts to rain its way out the cage it just over drew that thing so maybe we'll just take you guys in on a close look at some resin yep play a little tunes get some herb ready and have some herb yeah fire up roll up whatever you do dab up I just get some close angles on this stuff I hope you guys enjoyed the update Polizzi says peace [Music] [Music] [Music] I'm feeling so good I am a growing connoisseur and I love HC but I like strange

you don't mind going to watch that one if you enjoy these videos just [ __ ] cold out today house how blonde leaves whoa [ __ ] freezing so I'm still in my work gear but so 45 of G got the mother's milk and got this mother's milk previous video blah blah blah blah blah so this one I don't have my other phone with me much kids on it right now but the the stuff that I can remember that I looked up is that it is peppery citrus hoppy flavor it is cross between Girl Scout cookie and tan G so I've had to Angie before and I've had Girl Scout cookie I've liked both so we're just gonna jump right into this we're gonna be rocking it off of my sci-fi glass piece so anyone new to this channel sci-fi glass shout out to these guys I like a lot of their [ __ ] so far like off-the-wall and cool-looking start heating up the Bangor and get this damn and after work did that I busted my ass in the freezing weather kind of dead you know well hopefully everyone else had a fantastic and warm day I froze my dick off pretty much any time they took my hand and my gloves off and my hands were exposed to the air from the moment I pumped up a tire this morning time I got to work time I got home just cold it's going to be like 17 degrees tonight here in Michigan maybe even less I forget it might be 10 degrees I don't remember get my days mixed up a little bit yeah what's that hopefully you guys had a great day sad I just worked came home my girls about to leave for work so I'm gonna take this and then go inside and spend the rest of set time with my son I'm supposed to pick up my mother car today it didn't start been sitting for months so we're certain it's gonna be the battery we tried to jump it that didn't work we changed the battery out that ended up not working come to find out that on Lexuses there's like if you do something a certain way the security system won't let the car start or recognize that the key fobs inside the car I don't know it's pushed the start though this shit's all new to me it'll be the newest car is over owned 2010 which happens to be almost 10 years old the last war I had was a 92 Toyota for sale before that was a 99 stable 99 contour prior to that the newest car I owned was a 2002 or what if there was a 2002 that I got in O five it was a Saturn SC 2 coupe and I loved it that car so from my other video I'm gonna let this cool down just a little bit longer than I did last night because that [ __ ] must have still been too hot because it's just instant and I was baked but you know I didn't I didn't taste as much of the chirps and stuff as I wanted especially coming from something like this quality ooh Oh fat daddy tasty damn there's that peppery / hoppy taste the citrusy part is almost like bitter you know like it hits hard yeah very tasty well as I said I'll find out what this bow these are from and I'll put it in the description below in case anyone wants to try to get their hands on it I understand it was 45 a gram from the kid I get it from I'm not sure what deals they're running for you know it says five g's on it so so I know the guy picked up 10 grams of live batter five in this one five in the other I got a gram of each very very tasty strong strong high and pretty sure this is a hybrid I don't know I'll put it in the description below I'll copy the ship from Leafly and just I will put it right in there and any other information that I need to put in so yeah strongly recommend it Tropicana cookies if you can get your hands on it it's probably pretty good in just normal wax but if you can afford to spend the extra money and get the you know the live batter I'd recommend it the quality is better taste is better and the potency definitely seems higher just seems like a better product all the way around compared to say a lot of these you know FPR ones that I've been getting from healing tree Wellness Center that's not talking [ __ ] about healing tree Wellness Center that's just saying that the quality of this is better than that and the proofs didn't pudding you know that's like a dark almost goldish color almost like a like an amber type color almost and this [ __ ] like crystal white almost not quite egg yellow but man that smell I wish you guys could smell this [ __ ] you guys wouldn't be like a throw me add a beam right now and uh you know for some of you some of you live close enough to where we could arrange [ __ ] like that you know stop in at the shed and come being a video just chitchat [ __ ] [ __ ] take a DAB and we can you know have like guest spots like hey that is specifically towards you Jim Becker obviously and anybody else we can figure some [ __ ] out like a little meet-and-greet kind of thing little smoke sesh but chances are I'm gonna do it on camera so that it's me interacting with subscribers and in you guys high office and [ __ ] that uh you might not usually buy but other than that you guys are all awesome not just one of my subs a lot more people at commenting from here on out and yeah I appreciate you guys thanks for watching sub like comment enjoy the rest of your day and as I said I will put everything in the description below and comment let's chitchat let's talk Tropicana delicious peace out guys", "zUQjszYXjDk": "hey welcome to the build a soil family farms greenhouse this is episode eight we're going to be transplanting today after we check on the vegetables okay so take a look down in this area this is the same lettuce that we're growing in that 30 gallon container in quadrant four in the 10 by 10 tenth and we're about to do the same thing in there you see how it's all thinned out i actually used a greens harvester in here it's a way to use a drill and a small blade and it mechanically harvests this with one person but they also went back in and thinned it out i'm going to show you how ours is a little overgrown we're going to harvest it all and make sure that it continues to grow back [Music] okay welcome to episode eight this is the 10 by 10 and we're about to do some transplanting so today is really going to be the big kickoff where we have identified our females and so i'd like to update you on that and tell you a little bit about each section right now before we make some major changes so let's start here section one we've got the vegetable seeds that are about to get taken out to the greenhouse we're not quite quite ready for them yet and so i'm going to maximize the time here because we've got some space i'm going to build an earth box in this area because if you remember quadrant quadrant one is going to be two earth boxes one of them is a no-till earth box we've already grown in it before it was the max stomper we harvested that and now we've got that same box in here all we did is run some cover crop and i showed you that and we already took it down it's turned into soil the worms have worked it i've showed you in almost every video what that looks like so we're going to plant in that and today we're going to set up a new earth box so that we can plant into that and when we're done setting up the new earth box i've got to plant the plants in here we're going to put four and i got to put one plant in each one of our recipes over there i also need to take a soil sample from the taken bait kit send it to the lab so i can show you what the soil tests look like on your take and bake kit so you can understand how it compares to our other recipes and give you a quick rundown so there's basically there's a lot to cover today quadrant four is the last one you can see we've been harvesting this lettuce out of here i harvested some more for a customer this morning just to send them home with and we've not been keeping up with it and so in the greenhouse earlier i showed you how we normally harvest it all at one time we thin it out so you don't get any of this kind of decayed growth if you look in here if you don't do it then this can happen in the deepest parts because of the moisture and that just makes it harder to wash and eat on a daily basis which means that you're less likely to do it because we're all pretty busy so we're going to clean this out today and then it's going to completely grow back i'm going to show you how we do that also wanted to show you the kale we've been eating off of this and it just keeps throwing down stacking and so if you like kale if you make kale chips if you eat it in your smoothies i don't know why you wouldn't just have a plant going that's quadrant four a little more to talk about later in the video today we're going to be doing the transplanting as discussed to make sure that we give it our best shot i come up with like a transplant solution i like to use and this is just our build a soil wetting agent the sapinaria this one's new we've also always used the thermax 70. you can also use anything that is a wetting agent if you already own one the goal is to make sure that the moisture spreads from side to side i'm going to put this in first and then i'm going to add two root wise products that i really like to use at transplant and a couple of other times but right now we're transplanting this stuff's really potent it's a sapidin extract i'm gonna put less than less than a quarter teaspoon per gallon there's like three or so three and a half gallons in here so i'm gonna put just under one teaspoon and that's way more than enough that'll get it really foamy and so i'm gonna go ahead and mix that in right now and that foam will allow me to mix in the microbes and everything else slightly easier you can see how foamy it is that's the benefit of the wedging agent and that's all natural saponins if you google saponin as a plant growth promotant on google scholar you're going to find a lot of information about some benefits to natural plant saponins in the garden now that we've got that whipped up i'm going to go ahead and add some rootwise microbe complete this is my absolute favorite it's the best on the market worked with kevin for a long time and i'm pretty loyal to this product it just works really well for us we use it on the on the vegetable farm as well and so in here i could add about a tablespoon i've already used some in here so i'm just going to do like a maintenance dose right now and i'm going to do a half tablespoon let's find that one there we go that'll be more than enough sprinkle that in the foam here and then i'll mix it in in a second the carrier used in there is a diatomaceous earth and it's got a very diverse array of microbes and so what we're trying to do is get those to associate with the cover crop get everything firing on all cylinders because we're going to want to flip the flower very soon to make sure these 10 gallons don't get overgrown the enzymes we've not discussed this on camera yet at least in the youtube this is one of my absolute favorite products i don't use it all the time but i kind of use it like lighter fluid for the fire when i want it to kick start like if i've top dressed or if i'm about to transplant these are the same enzymes that would be created by the bacteria and microbes in root wise microbe complete they're fed on organic non-gmo substrate until they produce their enzymes which is a time consuming process and then they bottle it with a scoby in here and you keep it in the refrigerator although it's not a must i like to keep in the fridge so mine's cold i'm going to get it all active in here while we go build the earth box and do some other stuff it's going to come to temperature and get alive so in here i'll just pop it off i believe it says 5 to 10 ml three to five milliliters per gallon so i'm going to put in 15 milliliters in here there we go clear just dumps right in if you were to look in the bottle there's actually a little scoby kind of like kombucha and it grows in here don't let that scare you that's that's keeping it active kind of like anything that you've bought before that has a scoby like vinegar or kombucha that's all i want to do i'm going to mix this up and now that this is in warm water one of the secrets here to the fast growth is that we're using microbes and enzymes and so i don't use ice cold tap water we use filtered water and i make sure that on the filter that we offer it connects to the to the sink so i can actually turn the hot water on just a little bit balance it to a nice warm temperature of like 80 degrees or so so it feels good and then i'll put that in the bucket and when i water with that it keeps the microbes at their peak activation level where they can do their job enzymes are temperature dependent that's one of the reasons why corn will jump like two feet in july very enzyme based process so i hope that makes sense next up we've got to prepare to do all the transplanting i've got nine females clearly identified last week on friday when i did the most recent youtube video we discussed how when determining whether it's a male or female early on under regular lighting sometimes they can trick you a little bit and a couple plants might lag behind if you've got extra plants that may not be a big deal you can click uh select the clear winners the way this has worked out is i need ten plants to be in here two one for each earth box four here and four there well i've got nine clear-cut females that have already showed with a hair i've got three that are maybes i'm pretty sure there's a hair on one they're not showing male which typically all the males have really shown right now so that's likely to be female because those are a maybe we're gonna plant all nine and i'm gonna leave one maybe spot for here because i just need to get going i don't want to hold it back anymore and i'll keep you up to date we'll be transparent about what happens and hopefully my maybe is a female if it turns out to be male or any others we will definitely highlight that and show you what we have to do to get ready but that's how it's going to go today earth box transplanting choosing one maybe and then showing you the entire process as we go what i'm going to do now is show you the new earth box take some of the kit out so the wheels are an extra but i really like them and the earth box is already prepared to hook up it comes with an insert that the soil is going to sit on top of and the roots are actually going to go through to the water that's contained below and the water is going to be in this system inside here and you can tell that it holds that tray up here but in the in these two areas there's corners you're going to pack with soil and they're going to act as your wick they're going to actually come in contact that soil area those two spots with the moisture and wick the moisture up into the system as well as your plant roots are going to wick some of that moisture as well when you're filling it it actually has an overflow area here so if you put too much water in it's going to dump out the bottom which is really handy because you only want to have the right amount of water in here and then when it starts to drink from there it creates an air pocket in here and allows it to breathe underneath when you go to the earthbox website or if you follow this production style they say to keep the reservoir full they also mention not really to use compost so what we've done with living soil is the one rule we break with earthbox is we don't keep the reservoir full in fact when i build this today the number one thing i want you to take home is we're not gonna bottom water until after we've transplanted we've top watered and the plant starts to grow like any other container once it starts to visibly grow and the roots are spreading the first thing it does is send roots to all parts of the container at that point it's safe to start bottom watering because now it's going to start drinking and it goes really fast after that so be prepared for that let's get started i'm just going to jump into it first thing i'm going to do is hook in the wheels so i'm just going to flip it dump my wheels out now you can see they're ready to put in right here sometimes because of the angle they're a little hard to put in with your hand and you're just going to push it in until it sinks all the way in there that's it uh two of them do have a locking caster so if you're concerned if you're going to be using that you might want to line them both up on the same side i just put them wherever i never use the locker not a big deal okay there we go make sure it's in next we put the screen on and then this just lines up so that the cut out squares are where your soil wick is going to go and they match the corners on the inside and it just sets right in there it's very simple next you can see there's a hole here and so all i'm going to do is take this and it comes with it and this is the tube that they're going to have you use and this is the shower cap or the mulch cover that we use you don't have to use that in fact when i first started using earth boxes i thought it's plastic it's got plastic mulch i don't want anything to do with it it's food grade plastic and i've had mine for years outside the intense colorado sun at altitude with that uv and they looked just like they were brand new so they really really really hold up to a beating in the sun and it's food grade plastic which is important to me and these mulch layers you can reuse again and again but you don't have to use them the reason why we use them is it allows you to mound compost and nutrients really high on here and and hack this system supercharge it with nutrients at the same time you have clean water all the way down below which means that you're not going to be overloading the plant with nutrients it'll use feeder roots on top and it'll have water roots down below and it's kind of a nature trick so that's why we use this and watch i think you'll see the benefit later on right now the most important thing is we're going to put this tube in first it just goes in there and sits in the bottom and it's got a design in there so that it can breathe a little bit you don't have to cut it at an angle or anything it just goes straight in and it does its job now we're going to put the soil in the first thing that i do is i pack the corners and some people have asked me are you worried about soil falling down into the reservoir i'm not worried about it at all the plant roots will probably just eat it later on very minimal actually falls through so it doesn't really clog the reservoir i've heard of some people putting a little landscape fabric down here i don't like doing that i just do it as is and it's never caused a problem for me so here's the buildus oil 3.0 that's what we've decided to use this time we're going to compare this one that's new with our 3.0 recipe against a recycled earth box that we grew cover crop in added craft blend kashi blend too so it's like alive and ready to go and this is fresh and new so it'll be a fun comparison for us on our bags you grab the corner and pull and that releases throw this away and instead of just dumping this in i'm actually going to scoop into the corners right now i'll show you what it looks like you can see there's the woody part is from the oldie mountain fish compost there's malibu compost and there's worm castings in here for aeration we use pumice and rice holes which is really different than the industry standard if you're interested in interested in this we teach how to build soil and we teach about every single ingredient and we'd be happy to share that info with you all right i'm packing that in the corner you can see now i'm going to actually use my hand and compress it in there and make sure that it's tight the reason why is this is the wick area water is going to pour through the bottom like three gallons worth and if that pours through the bottom and it hits that wick zone and it just completely washes it out it's going to stop your wicking action and it's going to leave soil in your reservoir so i'm going to pack it tight and then what i'm going to do is water it just a little bit which you don't have to do but i'm going to make sure that at least has the beginnings of some moisture in there so later on when i go to wick it or go to water from the bottom it doesn't just completely fall apart that's it okay a little bit of moisture that's fine pack the other corner in here you can dump in here and just pack the corners with the soil that's in here but i like to make sure that i'm setting that corner up for success see how i'm pushing pretty firmly i really want to make sure that it sets up a wick okay that's it i'm gonna dump the rest of the soil in and we're almost done because i'm using the 3.0 i pretty much don't have to do anything after this all i'm going to do is dump the whole bag in these earth boxes they say they hold two cubic feet you can see this is a one cubic foot bag and it's basically full enough to get going if i'm going to add any more later on now i'm just moving the soil around this plastic tube so that it's supported in here evenly and then i'm going to pack it down just a little bit around there later on i can top dress in here i told you that's some of the benefits so i like actually leaving a little bit of room in here in the beginning so one cubic foot is really all you need to get this thing going and that's another benefit of the earthbox a lot of horsepower for the size container another thing you might notice that i'd like to address right now is it's a rectangular shape and a lot of times people will run and try and grab a different shape because it it's easier to work with something that's round or square rather than a rectangle i think part of the horsepower is that this is fairly shallow and the reservoir sits below the deeper it gets the more hydraulic pressure is required to wick it up and it breaks the system at some point when you get a deeper bigger system the other thing that i've noticed is that the round to hold the same amount of soil have to go taller and they're sold that way they have a square one for roots they have a city picker this is my favorite the food grade plastic the rectangular shape you can plant at one side plant two plants plant three plants or just one and something about this shape is part of the magic with the earth box so i know that early on when you see this it's kind of easy to pick apart like plastic mulch rectangle shape but there's something magic here and i urge you to try it so there we go i'm gonna i'm gonna just even this out now i've got to put a whole gallon transplant in here there's plenty of room for me to dig that soil out but for right now i'm going to pre-moisten it just a little bit and i already have the root wise in here and the wetting agent and the moisture out of the bag was pretty nice so i'm not going to go too crazy the rule of thumb here the most i would want to add in is about five percent and so five percent in a one cubic foot bag that's seven and a half gallons of soil about um three quarters of a gallon of water would be ten percent so i want to do about half that so that gives you a rule of thumb i'm not going to measure it exactly i'm just going to try and get this wet similar to when i built that taken bake it's going to look like i'm adding a lot of water but if you were to dig down an inch or two it's going to take probably 20 minutes for this to soak in and actually move to the bottom worst case i've got a reservoir underneath there it'll catch the water and i can just tip it and drain it out but i'm going to avoid that i'm going to put the right water right amount of water in here right now for those of you that have been asking about the earth boxes we do carry them at our website at buildasoil.com we have a few different colors and we have an affordable package where you don't have to get like the trellis kit and all of the extra fertilizer you can just get just the earth box and set it up exactly as we do one last thing to consider is the weight once you've added it might be a good idea to feel what the weight is without any water in the reservoir and that gives you kind of a memory factor on hey if the reservoir is dry but it's still super heavy you kind of know how much moisture is in the soil and i like to take that into consideration it'll help you in the future i grab some akashi blend and i'm i'm going to use this and this is the only thing i'm going to use right now this is our build a soil 3.0 it's pretty loaded but after i transplant i'm going to get this mulch layer started with a little bit of extra food and i'm also going to make sure that i get it started with all of the beneficial life that's in here there's a little root wise there's some lactic acid and it's all fermented locally so when i sprinkle this in the top that gets this mulch layer started i'm going to be feeding through that mulch layer as we really slam this into a large yield for this small container to do that i want to get it kicked off right away and so that'll be the last thing i do here now that this is done and i'm ready to transplant i'd like to show you the females and what i'm gonna do to do that is stage them so i need to have two in section one four in section two four and section three and i'd like to get those all staged pull these males out of here so we're not confused anymore and get this show started oh i've got a certain mix in here you can see the yellow or the halitosis and i've labeled them as like this is halitosis number one and it's a female and i wrote that on there as we were sexing them main thing i want you to get from this is last week i showed you how we had a couple of maybes well i've got enough females to get this going i've got three maybes and i'm like 99 sure about one of them i'm pretty sure it has a white hair it's just very hard to tell instead of waiting i'm gonna plant them all and gamble on just one of them and we'll update you with what happens i think i have three halitosis and so i might i'm not sure if i want to split them up and have i think in here i want to have two different genetics but over there just one so more than likely i'm going to pick my plants according to that so i have some sort of similarity here but you can see when i just set these here i'm like oh it's almost full already we're not going to be able to veg very long in here we're going to fire this off quick one of the things i like about growing in this style is it can grow really fast and if you have enough plants you just don't have to have a long veg time just flip it cool all right i'm gonna get started transplanting we did a little cleaning up which you see i removed the table and now it already looks better in here i'm just going to jump into this section 2 area and transplant these first next after that i'm going to transplant these it's basically the same thing the main difference is we're digging out a little more soil and adding in a gallon in these smaller containers so it's kind of like low till once you get going you still have to dig it out first thing is is when i do this first transplant i'm going to put some of this in a bag and i'm going to label it and send this off to the lab so i can show you compared to other recipes what the taken bake actually looks like at a soil lab so i'm going to write take and bake i'm going to start with the front corner here and this is the maybe that i just picked out that i'm 99 sure is female all the others we've identified as female and if you need help with that check out our last video where we go through what that actually looks like when you zoom in on the plant to get started you don't have to overthink this a lot of the soil and mulch will mix together i'm going to be as clean as possible but i'm just going to dig right in there set some soil to the side directly on the mulch transplant in and then just kind of crowd it back together to do that i'm going to pull this one off and i'm just going to get in here and i'm going to put some of the soil in here for a sample this is the only time i'm going to do that the rest i will just dig out and leave in here i'd like to put it you could put it really anywhere you want i'd like to have them even space for the roots so i'm going to go right here in this quadrant i'm going to clear out the mulch layer around the area i'd like to dig you can see the cover crop coming through i'm just kind of picking it out and that's about the size space you can eyeball it you can line it up whatever you want to do and now i'm going to dig in here now i don't want this mulch in my soil test so i'm going to clear just a little bit of this out set it to the side when i'm planting i use my bare hands so i'm going to dig in here for a soil sample you need a couple of cups the saturated paste test they use like a cup but for the regular soil test they take the tiniest scoop ever it's kind of silly and that's part of why we use the saturated paste test that's the soil i'm going to send off to the lab and we'll see what it looks like i'll set this to the side over here and leave it open to breathe i probably need a little bit more room in here to transplant my one gallon and right away you can see that the moisture all the way down is really nice in here and so i'm just packing that to the side it's nice and dark in color and i don't want to make this too tight i want to make it wide enough where it's really easy to drop that one gallon in there and then after this this will pretty much be a no-till bed so i shouldn't have to dig this deep again unless i'm doing another seed run sometimes when i do a seed run i'll actually only take the clones off those seeds so they don't have to dig so much in my no-till bed totally up to you how you do this all right that should be enough let's see what these roots look like you can see the white dutch clover that we have growing in here with the straw i've also got the plant tag and it's on the plant this is the brr the branson's royal revenge number nine and so i'm gonna go ahead and pop that one right now i rotated the bed so this isn't the maybe that's what i was thinking about on camera a second ago i just spun this bed and so i labeled this as a female the maybe is going to be that black the back corner and so i'm going to make sure i note that so we can track that later right now that's pretty good you can see the roots that are on here i waited just a little bit of extra time because i was waiting for these to sex and so normally i would go a little bit earlier but that's good i like to see healthy root system i'm going to drop this whole thing in i don't rip it apart i drop it right in i don't want it to go too deep because i don't want it to be buried up the stock where i can get some root rot so this one was right at the surface i feel like i did a pretty good job on the first go one thing i am going to do in here is i'm going to clean these lower leaves off they're just a little bit too low i want it to breathe down here oh wow this one this one's reeks already that's a really good sign so branson's royal number nine already pretty loud stem rub oh no be gentle i just ripped a lower branch off these one gallons when they're freshly watered sometimes you can be a little crazy especially when you're on video trying to talk at the same time that's okay a lot of times i'll pull the lowers off i don't have my scissors on me they're outside but one of the things i'm going to do is clean up the lowers just a little bit and so i'll probably show you in a second as i go through a lot of times i'll do it as i'm going but really it doesn't matter i'm just going to at least get these couple leaves off so they're not sitting right here in the soil and then if this happens what i do in a bed like this is i just rip these up these are going to feed the worms and it's going to break down in the mulch layer and so it's no problem man that smells really good already that's impressive pretty excited about those all kid genetics uh this soil that i have back here from digging out in the hole i'm just going to back fill all the way around and make sure that i get it in between the gap there so it's not just you know sitting there halfway transplanted so i'm going to clear this mulch layer off here and then pack the soil in and you don't need to overthink it i'm just going to press down a little bit make sure it seals that's it i'll move some of the straw back in so that it's mulched and that's the first one you'll notice i've not really cleaned these up other than that lower defoliation when i grow seeds i like to see their natural structure as we go through all mentioned i'll mention a little bit about plant training there's a lot of information we could cover there so i'm just going to keep it simple you can do any training that you want right now because i've got four in here it's a small bed i'm not gonna have to train much to fill this canopy up so we're just gonna stick with a low maintenance style and now that you've seen me do that the last step is for me to water it in i'm gonna do that at the very end so i can water the whole bed in i'm just going to get after that and plant all these right now but every leaf on here is healthy all the way down to the bottom okay this is the maybe halitosis number two does not say female and so we'll wait to write female on there until we're positive so right here again i'm just clearing out the straw and then i kind of clear out the cover crop but then when i dig in here what i like to do is pull it to one side instead of throwing it all over the soil there i pull it out and just stack it next to the side and pull it out the back stack it that way it's easy to push it right back in okay it's not under here you don't have to do this part but these branches are a little bit low anyway so i'm going to get scissors and cut off some of the lowest parts so i don't waste effort coming from so low it's never going to make it up top and i don't want them dragging in the moisture down there and so i'm pre-pruning a little bit but i'm going to take some scissors and come through these are so branchy i really like that i hope this is a female look at how branched out it is beautiful okay put my fingers in there again to support it a little tap that one's okay drop now i pull it in from the areas and i fill in around and push down that's it don't overthink it just get it in there all right they look great so i've i've got this scissors now and i'm going to go ahead and just prune these up a little bit the other thing that i'll sometimes do is i'll chop these i'll just roll them and chop them up so that it turns into plant food a little bit faster in here now even if you drop a lot of leaves they dry pretty quick and it turns into very little actual weight of plant material so don't don't worry about it let's get in there some of these lower ones i'm just too low they're just way low they're not gonna really do the job you can wait a little while to see but i'm gonna be focusing on getting these going to flowers as soon as possible so i might as well do a little bit of this right now as you get more experience this will be a lot easier for you to pick which ones pretty soon you realize they grow back so quick it almost doesn't matter so don't overthink it here's the one that i broke i'm just going to cut that off okay that's enough i just got it so it's cleared out underneath so it can breathe and then later we'll decide what we're actually going to prune see how these are touching the soil go ahead and just remove it one of the benefits of a living soil system is you have constant decay if you look up a lady by the name of ruth stout she has a book called no work gardening she teaches the benefits of deep mulch she no longer needs fertilizer manure i think she uses like a soy meal and her mulch and the mulch is constantly decaying and it's adding fertility to the soil so are the cannabis leaves that we use as mulch if you're brand new to this and putting the actual leaves in there scares you a little you don't have to do that part it's just that you get so comfortable with this whole ecosystem you start to know how it works and you start to leverage that so you don't have to do extra work for no reason so i've got this recipe that we made earlier it's the rootwise microbe complete rootwise elixir the enzymes and a little bit of our sapenaria to make sure that it moistens evenly in here and i'm just wetting it all now i'm going to water around each plant zone to make sure that those roots come into contact with the soil it all kind of glues together right around that transplant and it's also going to get these enzymes and microbes and everything right in the root zone which is what i want because that's where these probiotics actually work with the plant is when they're attached to the roots this will keep the straw nice and moist keep humidity extra high right around the plants it'll get the cover crop re-irrigated so it gets some vigor but this canopy is really going to block out that cover crop so quickly i bet you the cover crop's not even going to stand a chance and that's fine it's more of a living mulch now anyways now when i was digging around in there the moisture wasn't super wet so i'm not scared to add another five percent if i wanted to today i'm just going to water this in tomorrow i'm probably going to get its first really good watering quadrant three and if you can if you notice down here you can see this is the branson's royal revenge all of them so this is the number 12. we've got a number eight we've got the number five and we've got the number two now you could label them one two three four sometimes i wait to label them and sometimes i've counted the first seed to pop and that's number one the second one's number two and you can kind of track that the whole grill do whatever you want do you have fun with this each one of these recipes is different and i've gone over that in previous videos but that doesn't change what i'm doing i'm going to copy the exact same thing i did over there right in here the only difference is in the smaller containers i might be top dressing and feeding a little more if these plants get too big so that i don't rely just on the soil because the soil biology can only go so fast and if these rage in seven and a half gallons of soil it might not be enough so here we go i'm gonna do the first one and i'm just gonna set it to the side in a smaller container i just move everything to the side and then i will put it back so i'm just gonna dig this out a little bit to the edges so i don't bury the cover crop and then same way i'm just gonna slop it to the side here so that it's easy for me to put back in the hole once i've transplanted this is the build a soil light our most balanced recipe all right pretty good drop it in put the soil in push down i'm gonna bring some of this mulch back over the top of that soil i kicked out bring it in from the edges at this point if you wanted you could put more cover crop in but i'm just gonna let it ride out this canopy is going to block it pretty quick see how these leaves are touching the soil and just pick them off it's not going to get very much light deep underneath here this branch is so small this one's fine it comes up to the top but this one is so small i'm going to take my scissors and just cut that off so we don't have any wasted energy down there you can pinch it but sometimes what will happen is you get in a hurry and you rip the whole plant and i'd hate to see you do that so just grab some scissors i'll chop this up and put it in the mulch layer here i'm gonna do that to all four plants and that's it when i'm done i'll water it in with the transplant recipe with the root wise and the wetting agent um and then i'm not going to do much else they're going to get used to their home and um once they hook up in a few days in less than a week we're going to be ready to go to flower i think most 10 days because i really want to flip before this plant gets too big so we can ride out the rest of this horsepower through flour make our job really easy okay i'm going to get after it do the rest of these now this is the los malibu so you can grow amazing plants in any recipe this is kind of like health food in the sense that we have all good ingredients in every recipe these two recipes have the most compost and that's fine but all of our recipes will have very similar results and are very easy to work with and that's why making your own from scratch once you understand the principles it's pretty easy to get right however it's pretty easy to get wrong if you just have no clue what you're doing and that's why we have these videos los olly see it's a little bit darker in color that's from the fish and the hard wood makes it more humic rich right away takes two years to make this compost this is the 3.0 so you guys asked us to do uh the same genetics in all four containers so we're gonna go ahead and do that now mind you these are from seed so there's gonna be some genotypic differences and um although we use a lot of words really all we need to know is that we're discussing differences between the seed type that come from the parents and so a lot of people say that that's looking for the pheno a phenohunt that comes from the phenotype well phenotype is the genotype plus the environment and so the genotype is the actual genetic difference where the phenotype is more that plus the environment so if i were to grow this outdoor indoor cold hot it might express differences so we're going to do a geno run here pheno run whatever you want to call it and normally if we want to do a really good side by side we do a lot more plants and we do exact identical clones so this is more anecdotal but the main point is i want to prove to you all four of our recipes work really well and i also want to show show you how they might act a little different if they do so we're just going to document and share it they were at the right moisture where they could use a little five percent a seven half gallon is half of three quarters of a gallon so i'm going to put less than a half gallon in each container right now i'm just kind of making sure some moisture got into those roots and i'm spraying the mulch layer down again and then i'm going to move on when you get a little further along these plants are big and there's actually roots in there the roots hold the soil from washing away so at that point when the roots are holding it you can unscrew this nozzle and you can actually water with it a little bit faster like a hose and that works really well and then from there you can actually use a garden hose or a watering can all right well it's time to do the earth box i'm going to grab one plant for each earth box and remember the difference is one is brand new with 3.0 soil one has already had a round of cannabis grown and it harvested then we grew cover crop then we broke it down let me show you that one i'm going to plant into it first and so part of the strategy here is how do we get the plant into the plastic mulch i'm going to take this one off i'm going to cut a hole in it and i'll show you how i do that so i'll do it one second let me just show you underneath here there was a lot i mean the cover crop was at least 12 inches tall above here we broke it down and now it's mostly worm castings and decay and so that's a really good sign it's all going to be plant fertilizer here and so i had some craft blend and some kosher blend in here that's already been broken down so i'm not going to do anything other than transplant right into here on the other one i'm going to put some fresh kashi blend to start the mulch layer because it's brand new it doesn't have anything breaking down and decaying in the mulch layer that's part of what you want to happen so let me just string this out or tighten it up show you how you decide so it comes with a hole and there's one on each side it doesn't matter which one but it's only on one side of the left or right so depending on how you oriented it it would fit either way i put it over the tube lock it down no i have to decide where do i want to put my plant a lot of times i'll put one at the end sometimes i'll put it in the middle i kind of like doing it opposite the tube and i don't have a real reason for that other than i water down here the roots pull from here it should kind of create this spin cycle doesn't matter a lot of times i'll put two plants in here so that's totally up to you the only challenge i'm gonna have is i don't like to cut a hole in here and then transplant through it i like to pull the plastic up around the stalk and with a little use of tape it almost doesn't matter i can cut a big hole in here put it over the top and kind of bunch my plant up and pull it through and then i can push the plastic up next to it and maybe tape it around i'm probably just going to flap it in there and let it ride so i'll show you what i'm about to do i want to put it here on this side it'll make it easier to access the water hole for a little bit longer so i'm going to set that down and i'm going to cut an x right here where i'd like the plant to go like that and i'm going to cut the slit down a little bit and that x is going to allow me to open up these triangle flaps without ripping a huge hole now when you just rip in there it stretches the plastic so when i cut like this it allows me to pull the plant through and then i can flap these flaps closed so that it's mostly closed around the stalk instead of planting through it i'm now going to pull that to the side now that i know it's in the right spot if you just try and cut a hole and then you stretch it it might be in a different spot because of the bungee on here so i'll pull it to the side and now that i've got lots of space in here i'm just going to dig out and get ready to transplant my plant so oh look at there's worms in here too so i'm going to be putting new worms in the fresh 3.0 earth box in fact i might as well just put one in there now okay they need at least two right so i'll put two in there and i'm going to put a few more in but i wanted to show you this one's been going for a while so it already has worms and they're part of this ecosystem that we've got going oh look at this here's the stock from last time i didn't really want to dig that out but you can see it's like decaying in here it's breaking up easy and the worms really like it look at that they're all up in it that's pretty cool and so you can just leave this in here if you want underneath the earth box i'm not sure what i'm going to do i'll probably just put it to the side here and i'll keep digging this out a little bit in the earth box you can leave them out a little because we're going to mound later so it doesn't have to be all the way to the bottom i'm going to go ahead and flip this that looks great so one of the things is i don't like to get it this full in here i like to transplant a little sooner but we were trying to make sure that we identified whether male or female and the reason why we like large containers in a soil system is that the root tip is where it picks up the calcium and the nutrients the most easily and the root color don't be too worried if it's not bright white sometimes right after you water they're not as vivid and furry sometimes when you get it just right they look really good and so those snapshots you see on instagram sometimes it's just timing but you definitely want to make sure that you see healthy roots not dead roots and really like small amounts of them so some people break this up i just like to leave it intact drop that in now i'm okay with this being a little high right here because i mentioned we're going to be mounding eventually anyways i'm going to put this soil all in contact with the roots all the way around and that's it got worms all over that's really cool okay there it is now i have to put this cover on and that's going to be the hard part the other thing that i'm going to do is i'm going to use a little kashi i said i already put craft flynn and kashi in here which means it's got enough fertility but seeing all the worms and seeing how they've basically broken all that cover crop down and turned it into plant food i'm going to kind of feed them a little more and i'm just going to sprinkle this on like one handful all the way around in here nothing more i feel like it's a little better when it's sprinkled in there and it's not completely caked as long as you're gentle you can kind of do part of the plants at a time and this part's just a pain there's almost no way around it in fact i'm going to do this i'm going to pull it completely off and then work it through and once it's on you're done and if you break a branch or something it's not the end of the world these grow so fast it's really going to be hard to slow it down once it hooks up into that reservoir one of the problems with these things is they grow so fast people aren't used to it and they over veg and they really overshoot the size and they have just a huge plant and a little tiny earth box and so if this is your first time you might want to flip the flower just a little bit sooner than normal okay that looks good i've got it around with no branches in there pull it all away there we go we did it what little bit is uh uncovered by the earth box plastic will be covered by our straw mulch and you could tape it up a little bit in here but i'm not concerned with it as long as it's blocking the light it's doing its job just like regular cover crop or living mulch keeps the soil protected same thing here i'm not going to bottom water and there was plenty of moisture in here so i don't think i have to water at all today there was a lot of moisture in here tomorrow i'll take a peek i'll feel the weight it feels pretty heavy and i'll add a little bit moisture next let's do the last plant that's this earth box okay same thing i'm going to put this opposite the tube so that i can access the water hole for a little bit longer and then right now when i dig in this is going to give me a chance to assess the moisture level in here looks like the moisture that i added didn't go all the way down it's got moisture in there but it's not like i over watered at all so knowing that this one is drier than the other earth box i'm definitely going to add some moisture in here after i transplant before i put the lid on okay i don't want to go all the way to the tray there flip it looks pretty good bam like i mentioned you can have these slightly higher otherwise you can dig too far down to that grate and also we're going to be really mounding up in here with worm castings and craft blend and everything later on so it's not a big deal i'm going to go ahead and put the kashi blend on here and then i'm going to water quite a bit to make sure that we raise the moisture in here to the optimal level with seven and a half gallons like i mentioned the most i'd want to put in here is like just under a half gallon i've already put maybe a quarter gallon so i'm just gonna do the same thing i did the first time make sure there's enough water for these roots to start to spread in here just kind of go through make sure i don't break any branches pull them all through [Music] okay we're gonna go over to quadrant four now that we've done our transplanting i've got a few things to move out of here in the next few days and i'll update you as i go but right now i wanted to address the lettuce situation in quadrant four um these kale leaves are pretty obvious you can just take some of these big big leaves and cut them off and they don't really overcrowd in here it's kind of blocking out the claytonia but it's not a big deal because that's more like a living mulch right now anyways but over here i did mention that it's getting a little bit overgrown in here and if you notice in the greenhouse there's a lot cleaner than this and so i'm going to grab a bag so i can harvest this to eat i'm going to collect all the stuff that's edible and then i'm going to clean it up in here so that it's ready to produce another harvest all right now if you don't tend to your harvest then it can get overgrown and it's going to be harder to repeat the cycle it's already getting decayed in here and i want to clear it all out but i also want to eat this so i'm going to go through and i'm just going to harvest everything just a little bit higher than i probably would like so that i don't get much of the decay it's going to make it easier for me to wash drop that in there go all the way around kind of like i'm cutting hair watch your fingers it's easy to cut your fingers sometimes people will bunch and use a very sharp knife i don't want to cut into my grow bag and i've got plenty of time this isn't like a farm just for myself so i'm going to go through with scissors all right i've got plenty of salad for myself now you can see it looks really good but in here if i was to start to pick through it'd be more time consuming i've got enough for me to eat so i'm going to just start cleaning this out in a separate bucket so that it's not hard for me to wash and i'm going to pull some of this out of here and thin it out so it's ready to grow back so i'm going to grab another bucket now the main goal is not to cut so low that there's no new growth tip so on here if i were to just pull one out so you don't want to cut it below here or won't grow back maybe from there it would but i'm going to cut it like here okay and so about that level is what you're focused on or you can kind of overdo it if i cut it too close to the soil so let's just go ahead and do that i'm going to go in here cut it a little bit lower get some of this stuff out it's so dense in here it'll kind of fill in no matter what but i don't want to make it too hard where it takes too much extra time in the greenhouse every four harvests we go ahead and turn the bed over sometimes the flavor is affected sometimes the temperature and the number of cuts just a little bit of stress it wants to bolt bolting is when the lettuce decides to put out seed and it stays instead of nice lettuce leaf it grows a stem starts to produce flowers and that really adjusts the flavor and that means it's like hey i'm not going to make it i'm going to die i need to bolt and produce seeds and i was reading this book called sulviva and they talked about this on the east coast this year-round greenhouse and it was like permaculture tech and they had lettuce that would just harvest for years without bolting so i'd imagine that's possible but i don't have that much experience from doing lettuce for years back to back from the same container they had like animals in the greenhouse producing warmth and co2 i mean it's really cool and this isn't you know perfect i could be a little more precise but i just don't have all the time and it's going to grow back and getting some of this out here will make a difference i'm just going to leave this like this and we can learn from experience so if this wasn't enough next time i can do more but i think that's enough it's going to give it an even haircut and i think it's going to grow back really thick in here so we will keep track of that as we go and now i'm gonna grab my harvest bucket and we're gonna take some kale out of here and then uh in the coming videos we're gonna be trellising this up if you look up here i've already got a roller in place we're gonna do the same technique as we do in the greenhouse where we ride this up to the roof just full of tomatoes it's going to be pretty cool to show you so look for that in the future right now i've got the lettuce and i'm going to go ahead and grab some of these kale leaves so that it it continues to put out big leaves man these are great gorgeous now that we trimmed this back you watch how quickly it grows back it's going to be crazy well thanks a lot for following along this entire process watching this long video we put a ton of content into this one because that's how the garden works when it's time to get after it it's time to get after it we did a whole bunch of transplanting today the nice thing is with all this work being done it's like cruise control now the soil is going to take care of most of the work if anything i'm probably going to show you how to brew a tea or two over here but i just wanted to get to the point of thanks for watching if you like this content subscribe tell your friends comment on here it really helps the youtube algorithm when we get everybody interacting and that keeps it so that we want to do tons of these videos we love seeing the boost on the numbers and all the interaction it's really something to look forward to for us and then of course we're going to document every step along the way so if you have questions about something maybe i didn't cover as i was doing this it's a lot to remember what it was like in the beginning so just post your comments post the questions i'll do my best to actually answer them on camera if we get a lot of the same question and if not we'll at least jump in the comments and answer them for you to the best of our ability we get a lot of them thanks for watching we'll see you on the next one", "Veb_BjSb2IM": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] what's bubbling blaze about to go do some dippin a

seven foot two inches right now so fat colas but look at that purple crazy all right peace out", "cDwgUU27NwA": "okay guys i just want to um do a quick disclaimer um before this video first um if you're not a medical patient or live in a legal country or state et cetera um leave bye i'm sorry but like you're not welcome here um anyways so if you're not supposed to be here leave and then the other thing is i my scale wasn't working properly for some reason and um i couldn't probably measure how much i was putting in the soup and um it turned out really badly like it turned out good but i consumed way too much way too much so like you can almost take this as an educational um a video on the effects of being dumb me i'm the dumb one because i'm like yolo um who cares i can tolerate it i could not tolerate it i could not bad bad bad bad okay anyways sorry for this long intro but i really want to stress you guys make sure you're not putting too much in there make sure you know your dosing okay i'm going to put a video below that can explain how to figure out how much you're consuming um but there's so many different ways to figure it out you don't have to watch my video my video is very long it explains it in a lot of detail but um yes please um be careful don't end up like me so i don't know how to explain this because i'm like pretty high right now but the after effects of the soup very dramatic okay if somebody had a low tolerance this would like destroy that like so there's a lot of video i'm just trying there's a lot of video so i just decided to make a separate video so this video is just about how to make soup and then the next video that i like stop stop what am i saying stop where was i oh my god my eyes are they red i don't get red eyes no they're not red anyways i'm checking i ended up like literally stuck in one spot and i couldn't move and it was the worst ever so i regretted my decisions literally every minute here we go what's up guys welcome back today i'm going to show you guys how to make infused noodle soup instant noodle soup to be precise but you could use any type soup that you like because really what we're making is an infused water and fat solution and with that infused water and fat solution you can make anything you like what i happen to be having is the soup like i said but you could use it for tea you could use it for um you could add like um um flavor like a flavor packet to it like um you got iced tea powder to it and they a infused iced tea you could drink it straight um so let's get started because it's going to be sitting on here for a while so i'll talk a little bit more about it once we have it cooking so we're gonna start by turning our stovetop on and i have two cups of water here and i'm gonna pour it in now i'm using two cups of water because that's what my instant meal packages call for um but this water is going to evaporate over time and you can add more water to your liking it's not really going to affect um how the product turns out so use one or two cups and add more water as you like but it's better to have less water than too much um because you can literally add more water any point so i'm just gonna put this aside while it's heating up and what we need to infuse our soup is um some decart cannabis now this is just a bag from before it was the carbs but i'm just keeping it in there and i need fats okay so you can't extract the thc from the flour in the water on its own you need fat for it to bind to so you could use coconut oil you could use sesame oil which is what i'm going to use because i like to taste sesame oil with my um uh instant noodles um and if you didn't want to use this for soup like i said because you can use this for tea you can use this for anything i would recommend something more like coconut oil because it has a more mild flavor um taste whatever but yeah so you could use this and make an iced tea with it right like that would be good actually that would be really good i think i might do that i am going to be using peanut butter and soybean oil for it's not soybean sesame oil for my um fats for my soup because when i make my instant noodle and i might accidentally call it mr noodle because in canada it's kind of just like the the go-to brand and i in my head i call this noodle but um i add peanut butter and um sesame oil to it anyway and they're both fat so this is like the perfect solution um i add a bunch of couple things that make it taste like so good um and i'll add it after but uh you don't need to you just need a fact okay any kind of fat coconut butter soy bean sesame olive peanut butter doesn't matter butter okay so we don't need this coconut oil because i was just showing that uh for demonstration purpose says options and then you're going to need um instant noodle packages package singular um or you know mr noodle not my stranger that's what this uh chicken noodle soup or chicken noodle soup mix or any type of soup mix or anything you want to add to your cannabis water so while we have this heating up here i am going to add in my fats so i'm going to start in by adding about a tablespoon of my sesame oil and i'm not measuring it because it doesn't really matter that much because i'm going to be adding probably more fat than i need anyway um but i think i'm gonna add about a tablespoon of peach so we have our tablespoon of i'm gonna keep calling the wrong thing sesame oil which smells and tastes so good and i'm gonna add a tablespoon ish of um peanut butter actually more than a tablespoon because i really like peanut buttery taste in my um soup so this is more than a tablespoon but this is how much i'm adding and the water's not warmed up yet so that peanut butter is not going to fall off just yet so i'm just going to leave my spoon in there so it can melt off until it warms up okay so we got our fats in there and now we need to add our cannabis in so i am going to be a little bit extra here and um oh well you'll see what i'm doing but um you can put your canvas in there one you can put it all straight in there and um not strain it out and eat the cannabis flower left over whatever but like i don't want that i'd rather strain it and there shouldn't be much thc left in it by the time you're done with it so there's really um that's not necessary so you're gonna at the end a lot of people um will run it through a strainer or they will um put it through cheesecloth or et cetera et cetera but i it just seems like i feel like we could do this an easier way right um so i went to the dollar store and tried to find something that would work um like a deep sitting mesh whatever this is called but i couldn't find any so i bought this one and i'm going to cut it and you could use like a big tea thing like this and the reason why i'm doing they do make smaller ones that would have fit in here but i wanted to have like as much uh i wanted it to like be able to like float freely right i didn't want to have the cannabis all like stuck in one spot if i feel like it's gonna extract better when the liquid and the fat is able to like fully get on all um sides of all the cannabis so i bought this and i have my uh wire cutters i think they're called and i'm going to cut the mesh out like obviously you can cut your fingers doing this so be careful okay our water is um starting to simmer and heat up and we don't want this to be boiling we want it to be simmering so i'm going to turn the heat down now to a low-ish heat hello-ish medium so it's simmering but not boiling okay no matter how hard i try like no matter how hard i try i cannot cut it with the wire cutters um maybe they were just not good enough so i got these like plier things and i'm like just pulling it out of the like just completely taking it out this is like just maybe do this like outside or somewhere because there's little pieces of uh metal or mesh coming off so i'm just gonna finish this outside the easiest way to do this would have been to do it um in the pot when there was no liquid in it but i wanted to do it on camera but yeah that way then you could kind of like shape it uh you could shape it to the pot and now we can put our weed in so i will post the link um below for both how to de-carb your weed and how to figure out how much thc is in it so you guys can figure out how much you want to put um if you're completely like unsure of how much to put you could put like about the same amount as you put for um the fat right so i have put like two tablespoons of fat maybe a little bit more and i'm probably going to add i'm going to add a little bit less than that but maybe like one tablespoon i'm going to do one brown so i had just decarb some weed yesterday i just did it in my leftover and then i just put it in here to keep it fresh so i'm just going to weigh this out my scale male functions and that was definitely more than one gram it's probably like two grams but um i have high tolerance if you don't have high tolerance start low and be more careful with it but if you do have a high tolerance you're probably fine like me to just take your chances i'm not recommending you do that i'm just saying i'm just saying let's get all the rest of that and again we're not having our water boiling or having it simmering i'm just gonna put my crumbs does anybody else do that like take their crumbs and like put it in it's like kinda okay now all i have to do is let this simmer for 20 minutes to like a half an hour um and like i said and i'm gonna keep saying don't have it um boiling just keep it simmering and you can stir it around occasionally but you don't should be fine without it um but yeah just keep an eye on it and we're gonna cook this cook it for um about 20 to 30 minutes so here's how it looks we just have it on um what is it on it's on like three and a half there it's a little bit too high to be honest i'm gonna lower that a bit because this is that's actually like on the verge of boiling there so we'll turn that down and make sure all of the flour is submerged because it's my mesh thing um it's kind of getting stuck on the side so maybe i honestly don't know how good of an idea this mesh thing was sometimes i i think i have like really good ideas and then i try and execute them and like and like trying to see it from like outside perspective and i'm like they're probably thinking this girl's dumb but um we're on crack i i've definitely been told that people call me crackhead all the time on my youtube videos i can't help that actually yeah i can okay um i don't know i still like it and i wasn't gonna waste my four dollars i spent on that mesh since i already started taking it apart you know also why do i always say no okay we've been cooking for about 20 minutes and i think i'm going to do another 10 minutes why you ask i don't know just because i'd rather get more than less you know oh my god if i say you know one more time i swear okay i'm gonna try and see how it tastes to see if we can see how it's going oh my god the embarrassment this mesh thing is i don't know what i was expecting it tastes like that's literally oil and peanut butter yeah ten more minutes okay i'm gonna prepare my other ingredients for it to make it extra delicious also i don't really smell it but at the same time i'm used to it so so since it's almost done i'm going to add in my other ingredients um this isn't necessary for anything other than flavor right so like skip if you want but if you want something tasty and you like like peanut based and like spicy and like yummy add these wow english okay but yeah you don't have to add these things this is just because this is how i like my stupid taste you could add oregano you could add parsley you could add onion you could add you could make a whole soup you could add carrots you know um but then you have to strain them out so that's a whole issue i would wait till after so i do some honey okay a little bit more i know you like honey ew but i love my sweet and sour i mean you can barely taste honey then we have rice vinegar a little splash of rice vinegar and then i'm gonna do some soy sauce and some chili flakes too after we'll grab those flakes i love flakes so we're almost done we're at about 30 minutes or just about 30 minutes and it's looking really good it's smelling good and shortly we're just gonna take it off of the strainer so i believe it's safe to say that this strainer thing was the dumbest idea i've ever had because i could have just put the strainer over the bowl and poured it embarrassing okay so it's been on here for like a little bit over 30 minutes taking it off simmering the whole time not boiling i stirred it around in my bowl i have frozen broccoli because i'm not eating very many vegetables these days because i'm lazy and i figured out frozen broccoli is a great addition to the noodles but not when noodles are by themselves but when you add those ingredients i said mm-hmm like so good so so so good i'm gonna be using my mr noodle spicy chicken mr noodle is like a popular instant ramen i used to say raymond until one day i figured out it wasn't raymond it was ramen like how embarrassing how many times you think i said that out loud everybody loves raymond you know okay so i'm going to take this out i'm honestly embarrassed about how stupid this idea was so dumb and i'm good i'm going to put it back in the bowl which i could have done this the whole time and i'm going to pour my um soup and i'm just uh oh my god i forgot to add the noodles and the seasonings so at this point this is when you add your stuff i'm going to turn the heat back on because we gotta cook these noodles a little bit um and if you weren't making noodles and you're making a tea or whatever you could um you could put this coconut oil and water combination in like a jar put it in the fridge and then you could pull it out and warm it up and make some tea with it or add some water enhancers whatever so just add my noodle how am i gonna strain the noodles out okay maybe this wasn't that bad an idea after all so put my noodles in this video is definitely like i could have been like a three minute video instead of whatever this is going to end up being um please tell me what you guys think would you have liked if i when i realized how stupid of an idea this mesh thing was if i would have like just completely took it out of the video and like pretended this never happened or do you guys enjoy watching me mess everything up i don't know let me know because i don't know okay so i'm just cooking my noodles in the water the juice um and there's actually less liquid than i wanted because um it evaporates pretty quickly if you're letting it simmer for like over half an hour so i'm just going to add some more water and i'm going to turn the heat up more let me show you guys what we're working with here watch me spill it noodles fat and liquid and you want to make sure when you're straining everything out like not that the fat would get stuck in here but the fat is what is containing most of the the thc right so you want the fat that's the good part so i'm just gonna cook my noodles and i'm gonna pour it into my um see you can even see some of like the fat stuck to the bottom of this so i'm just gonna try and press as much of that out as i can use my fingers here oh yeah yeah can you guys see that get all the good stuff i can't believe to waste that also you don't have to strain the flour out because um you could eat it i don't want to though just because i just don't want to and um i'm not serving this to anybody obviously otherwise like gross um i can't believe i almost forgot to strain that out just ignore me i'm so sorry i hope you guys don't hate this video okay for me my noodles gonna go wash my paws and then we're gonna eat and then i'm gonna show you guys how it's like when i'm done and it's kicked in a few hours later i just need to show you guys like look at all that fat that's like the peanut butter and come on there we go like the peanut butter and fat mixture that i like squeezed out of um that remaining amount oh yeah look at those colors the green the pink that looks good okay our noodles are almost cooked and we are almost ready to eat oh boy do you ever look tasty let me just let me try a little bit of that oh i hate human okay our noodles are cooked i'm gonna pour my soup here i am i'm gonna pour my soup into my bowl splashy splash i feel like we should scrape some of that up here i mean there's not really much to scrape i feel like that might be kind of like the the fat sitting on the edges but i don't like wasting things so i'm like i feel like i will just like i'll literally lick it after because i'm just like any bit that i can not waste better i'm very frugal i don't like wasting not like actually never mind okay yeah see there we go yay snack time i mean lunch bone apple tea i wonder if it's a good enough temperature because um the broccoli cooled it down a bit since it was frozen sorry so there's something in my teeth okay oh my god i forgot the seasoning mat so like this doesn't taste as good as usual what is going on what is wrong with me one second okay i got the mix you guys i'm sweating and dying your feet but i have to keep my clothes on usually i would like to take them off well like i'd wear like a smaller top because it's so hot and the windows closed so it's not so loud and noisy for you guys but then everybody's gonna complain about how i'm not wearing enough clothes like does it really bother you that much although it's interesting because it's usually only women who complain about what i'm wearing hmm oh my gosh i've never tried this sauce mix on its own but that reminds me when i was younger and i'd like really want to um uh i'd really want to you guys i haven't even ate this soup yet why am i acting like i have uh i used to love like eating them in the package when you like broke them up um and like put the seasoning eggs my mom didn't let me because i wasn't healthy you know i was like i wish i was allowed to eat that but it wasn't okay it smells like herbal soup let's give it a try temperature is pro oh yeah that's good very very good i never used to really like mr noodle or instant noodles but um can skip over me eating this if you like because i'm not gonna probably say anything that it's like information you need to know to make it this is more just for my peeps who my peeps for my friends my my best buds for my people who like are like i'm not functioning properly today i honestly could use some salt um and this looks like all the msg it already has i'm a salt addict i can't help it i honestly do want to add some more salt or maybe some soy sauce it would have been better with more peanut butter and honey but they're very high calorie and the soup is ready oh soy sauce is good by itself too yum but yeah i never used to like mr noodle because or instant noodles because i'm just like they're just not that good until i added like lots of peanut butter and it's just like game-changing peanut butter and then some acidity from the rice vinegar and the sweetness from the honey honestly it tastes better without the weed in it because like you can still taste it but um it does taste a little better than we but it's still good if you serve this to somebody they wouldn't be like is there weed in this they'd be like what's the unique herb you have in there i'm putting the broccoli for the broccoli like the perfect temperature to eat right away if you do i have the same things that i add add more peanut butter because um there's nothing like peanut butter and like spicy chicken spicy chicken was the flavor i chose of my soup um uh oh my god i'm so hot and the soup is hot i'm gonna open my window the temperature why is it so hot what temperature is it in here it's only 22 degrees what's going on oh yeah that's a look okay i'm gonna finish this off camera because and then i'm gonna report back once i feel like it has hit me i'm gonna let you guys know how it goes okay okay i'll see you guys anywhere between well i mean it's gonna be immediately after for you but it's gonna be like two hours probably for me depending on how fast it hits me actually i should have added some muscle than into this but since i didn't i'm gonna take a less than capsule to help the absorption absorption okay see you guys soon in a couple seconds now bye because of all the fat in here has been making me full a lot faster than usual but you know the fat is necessary for what we're looking for thank you guys so much for watching this video i hope you enjoyed it if you are at the end please tell me um um thank you for staying with me to the end even through my um my struggling through the video am i struggling with words my struggling with ideas am i struggling with

whole evening like i am checking out for the day for this i like i'm like i'm fairly able to like i'm like one step at a time i ended up like literally stuck in one spot and i couldn't move and it was the worst ever so eventually i fell asleep eventually i regretted my decisions literally every minute", "0yIorQZb6ug": "those of everybody to stay on the 1014 that with my second video second a day

you show you about that Buffalo something so first this is the UM this is the one I said it's coming or did already came out with the one we doing there jewel mater this is from thier plant that's called the uh what I called the Pandi bread the Pandi Brady the Pandi bird is called the time traveler it's a hybrid I'm not exactly sure but the time travel is it's a brand new strange into G so it's exciting and we'll find out what what this is about and hits that in a couple days so that that's kind of nice also this is actually like really important to me I've gotten this before and uh I'm gonna actually get in it a little bit more more often I'm putting myself on a regimen I'm putting myself on a regimen see this this right here it's the Thera plant 360 Rx actually [ __ ] that y'all just open it up for you I'm not doing a review on it this is that the Rick Simpson oil it's basically the arm the whole [ __ ] plant material knife one month okay sorry about that okay so now we go ahead let me show what this is this is the UM the Rick Simpson oil it's like a syringe this is um very important to me because like I said I'll put myself on a regiment okay obviously I've had this before see right here this is the Rick Simpson oil syringe and as you can see right there there's like 360 rx or something like that anyways what this is this is a syringe and it's got basically I think it's like you have 495 milligrams of THC and this one little syringes into 0.75 millimeters so basically every one milliliter is basically 49 almost 50 milliliters of THC and I'm recommending myself basically what I'm gonna do is here to put this down now and talk for a second I'm not I'm gonna regiment myself because I have obviously PTSD and I have these issues in the morning with with like just morning issues are bad for me like I wake up and [ __ ] I mean I'm sure a lot of your exact from talking about I can't instantly get like the medicated by by by smoking because I got work [ __ ] to do in the morning just I've got to kind of stay I just not not super medicated that way but I got to get some kind of like teaching me all the time I found so I'm gonna be doing is I'm going to be taking point one out of the points points I'm gonna take point is you got point one a day just writing on my tongue every single day when I wake up and I give me about 50 milligrams of THC in my body I've had these for it works wonders niacin was on set it keeps you medicated but it keeps leak basically keeps you in a haze I guess more or less constantly you have you're doing this every day because you know it's gonna help my symptoms our babies I found in the morning isn't like some of the rough at times for me so I got to do that so that's what I'm going to be doing to get myself basically regulated and have a good amount each seeing me all the time so that's the other cell that's that's my new thing that I'll be doing good anybody ever cheat game [ __ ] ever so here it is after all the [ __ ] Greg hold up all our time here we go this is the indie call X it's clocking at twenty six point seven five percent THC and it's gonna be some straight fire they uh they said it

this prank this product contains federally compliant that means it's legal be delta 8 t8c syrup now before i did the review um i had the grape i've already tried the grape and i like it a lot i like it a lot i like it a lot but let's get into this review and show you what's up as i said this is coming from a company called active eight let me let you spell it activate i like that play on words right there you tell me no what you're gonna want to do is get you one of them sprites or drink of your choice but if you've ever listened to hip-hop music within the last three years they gonna let you know they got that sprite it's in fact lil wayne says and i like my sprite easter peak so now what i like to do is i like to put the sprite in first put a sprite in that double cup now pull it down the sides because i already got my icing and it's less fizz you're gonna want the ice trust your boy just your boy i trust your boy i trust you boy i trust your boy why does mine has that chicken because i poked a hole in my damn cup and i had to fix it with tape but anyway so you got that sprite in there and now let me shake this a little bit i just took the top off this thing i am what some people would call an idiot okay there it is now 50 milligrams which is basically this cap twice but here's the thing i said basically and my wife was like no that's not that cap twice because it actually goes to 30. so i'm going to stop right here at 25. put this up twice now if you've never had delta a thc or you're not sure how you're going to go about this i would start off with one cat four because two of these is 50 milligrams and one is just the 25 of course now as you can see it pours out thick right look at that look at that see if i can let you see without spilling it it pours out thick now what i like to do is i like to take the rest of my little cap and i use my sprite to clear it out you know why waste any of it why waste it i'm just i'm not a big waster i'm not a big waster still get a little bit of fizz right there you see that double cup activate man shout out to y'all for sending the double cup with it shout out to y'all for sending the double cup with it y'all know now if i put it in the bottle i would just shake it up a little bit you feel me this is the cherry but since i didn't pour straight in the bottle i had to stir it a little bit oh so look i tried the cherry i mean i tried the grape let me try this cherry salute to health wealth and self self love is the best love activate oh oh oh oh oh hey hey that's what i'm talking about that's it right there hood that what i'm talking about right now you know i'm talking about that right there it's delicious it tastes good the grape the grape was good the grape was good um it was not nasty at all the grape was good grape isn't my go-to drink though i'm going to be honest with you if i'm going to the store grape is not my drink now if i'm going to pick up a flavored drink before i get that i'm going to get what we call red i don't care what flavor it is it's red i'm gonna pick up the red before i pick up the purple this is good the grape is good the cherry it's amazing this tastes like candy excuse me this does it really tastes like a it tastes like a cherry icy like from a mamco it tastes like it looks good no syrupy taste at all no syrupy taste at all let me see here there is this is two fluid ounces so this is since they tell you put two caps it says it's two of those so it's four caps per serving per bottle i'm gonna be honest with you after doing the two cap fulls in the first one i think one will do you i don't think you have to have both cap fools in the one drink i think you can do the one and enjoy that sprite and let it kick in and then do another one because i put two in my first one and i waited about that was about an hour and a half two hours ago because i wanted to have the effects i wanted to be feeling the effects while i did the review and the effects are good i want to go root root root for the home team at the old ball game i want to go to the ball game i want to shout profanities at referees if you you saw that there was a strike that was a strike get get his ass out of here i wanna i wanna i wanna go to comedy shows and help with comedians with jokes like oh y'all got jokes i got jokes too big you need real good big foe head

dance floor and cut a rug get it oh as good i promise you this tastes almost identical to a red cherry icee that you get from your local gas station if you like those you'll love this activate i like that i like to play on words i like the active and then the eight so active eight activate a delta eight company that's focusing on the syrup you got something two thumbs up now let me tell you if you've never experienced uh delta atac if you're not a fan of thc stay away from it if your reason for switching to cbd is because thc was just too much stay away from it but if you've tried delta a and you like it you are gonna love this it gives you a euphoric feeling a happy feeling uh i can't call it uh delta a lean because lean makes you sleepy and tired and oh this is not giving me that feeling this is giving me that let's go play basketball shirts and skins now i know i can't who but i want to do it like well let's not play basketball let's play nba 2k yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i got you i got you let's do that this is good activate you gotta look now at the bottom towards the bottom it gets a little syrupy it gets a little bit thicker so what i do is the remainder of that sprite
