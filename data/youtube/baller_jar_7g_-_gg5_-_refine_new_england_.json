rhythm and stuff but i'm very pleased so let's go in for another happy dab shall we another happy dab little moxie 710 hooking it up like i'm oh i'm i'm just so happy with this purchase i don't like i said i don't buy their products often and it's not because of the quality it's strictly because of the price and i'm a boy on a budget so it is what it is but when you can get it for the right price hundred percent worth it at all cost every time i get their sand whenever i can usually however this time i did pass up the sand because i bought this that's how much i wanted to try this stuff and as good as it is i'm so glad i got three and a half great jar oh yeah it's not very often i can truly stock up so i'm grateful it's so smooth it's truly a unique flavor i don't even know how to really describe it to be honest with you i just really like it it's sweet without being overpowering it's not so mildest to be unnoticeable but not so strong is to be just crazy in your face nice happy medium for flavor very smooth no throat burn not really any tickle i do enjoy that i'm already getting a nice buzz going to dab in and i'm i'm happy now to be fair i did vape a bowl of flour before i did this but that's it that doesn't really affect me like dabs do i don't do flour that often so it's definitely the jesus og kicking in which is sweet i'm glad i did it worth every penny so with that

so later tonight after I get the kids down spend some time with the wife I'm gonna come back out here and knock out that bubble hash run uninterrupted probably gonna do somewhere between six to eight runs on it depending on how it looks and how everything is coming out [Music] anyways let's go ahead and get a - go in here I hope you guys are having a good day [Music] that was not clickbait by the way for those of you this joint this is a 104 grant or 100 Ford's a hundred grams now mixed strain hash frothing some cookies some sweet cream some zukie and what else sweet cream cookie sweet cream zoo keys and orange cookies that's what it is [Music] sorry I had someone from work pop-up I don't look out real quick [Music] all right cool [Music] anyways let's go ahead oh it's so good yeah I need to go ahead and fill up a little bit char with that [Music] this was some 60 micron parabola for edibles [Music] this one still has a cush cake in it and this one has on a fish cake so those that's my head - cooks cake in a jar [Music] earth is [ __ ] cold and her alright so I would like you yet in my day did you imagine dabbing that whole thing just like here we feel [ __ ] half the Banger ease and the easily I wouldn't even try it it'd be a waste and a half that's good enough for me enjoy that for the week [Music] the 160 press was man very little in there so that's what that looks like when I end up putting it in the jar and then a lot of people would ask me how did you get that [ __ ] rossington to stick to the bottom of the jar look so neat [Music] here's I take the glove and you're just going to push it down around the edges towards the center you're doing a cold room that's good rosin a clean glove and just like that now it looks like that [Music] with that's hard to see but yeah that's how that comes out when you end up doing that push it down it comes out real nice and clean looking perfect for grams or so it's upload a bird [Music] all right so I gotta move my dad station over now I'm not pressing it back over here well I like it Kiyo is : grab yeah you can do with parchment - I have a little bit more control with the glove I feel like and it rarely gets sticky but parchment works to a more sticky stuff I will use parchment I'm gonna go grab a hoodie real quick [Music] [Music] whoa [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] whoo my tears my eyes [Music] Oh [Music] oh man the big dads always get my nose my eyes [Music] Oh [Music] about three days away from the harvest yeah we're on day 54 honestly I think I could pull them down tomorrow or the next day I want it probably gonna go ahead and harvest them on Monday [Music] today's Thursday tomorrow's Friday yep I'm go ahead and harvest them on Monday [Music] five six out of the gate 58 [Music] [Music] I got some pictures of the plants I haven't even posted to Instagram yet pausing to share them with you guys real quick [Music] [Music] turn down the lights already this whole side is just [ __ ] Mileena should be up here these ones dried back a little bit too much almost too much but not too two months still prosti of [ __ ] 12 cars black out there my Spade going over there [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so that's the current status in the Guardian you know just like oh my flesh for usually you're about seven days it's that but you know [Music] I had issues this run just like Ross Leafs his issues because he's in cocoa they're harder to detect early and so he faced the consequences of the buffering that cal-mag provides in coma cocoa I wasn't in at nursery iam so I was able to turn my issues around a little bit faster but you know basically what I'm saying is you know I had issues this run and the crop is still coming out pretty good so next run you know those issues will be corrected I'll make a video covering the issues that I ran into this grow and how I plan to correct them and I'll throw it up on the patreon hopefully you guys can learn from some of my mistakes you know I talked about on the show doing your own research and shape one of the things I researched if I should have used top-down broward rivers and when I talked to mango tech Abadi he told me to use two gallons per hours to avoid clog and that's what each use is but then I ended up getting water channeling that is too fast on the float and I cost a lot of issues I never really fed high enough of an ECE to have the easy build up nor did I ever push the plants that hard to cause them to have any lockouts it was all because my irrigation was wrong from the get-go with the water swim [Music] are you taking off right now that's one of the changes I'm implementing is not only am I going to get rid of the 2 gallon per hour but I'm going to go all the way down to like a point 3 gallon per hour dripper that could eat drawstring and stuff up here so yeah that'll fix a lot of issues right off to that that I believe uh Charles and pastor [Music] that Daffy got me hired balls rolling in on me now [Music] oh my bad I look here looking up and showers my phone [Music] there's no broad my issues going on in here all it is is either a they were different cuts or they were microclimates right he talked about the water channeling so you know phosphorus deficiency can learn to purpling stems and the plants that express themselves differently also has purple stems where I was the ones that didn't have the red bugs didn't have purple stems so I think it was more of a microclimate issue water channeling issue causing different uptake different nutrients and it just got exacerbated due to the lockout because of the water channeling so next one I'm doing is with wedding cake and I should be getting those clones in about two weeks so I have about two weeks to prep get the plants chopped harvested and everything I'll flip them right in the room that they're in right now I'm basically going to push the tables to one side of the room and then I'll go in and use a light rail for this up against the wall and I'll cut down on the one plant out of time and hang it on a trellis hanging from the ceiling and then I'll just hang all the plants from one light all right [Music] when my moustache hairs on the know it wouldn't happen I got trim my mustache geez so yeah basically just go one light at a time right down hole lights worth of plants hang them go to the next one cut those down hang out on a different trailer that's there the next one so I'll have three trellis nets hanging on the side of the room I'll have to retry this netting on that side of the room so after I cut down the whole left side of the room and those plants are hanging up there on that left side I'm going to disassemble the tables and walk them out of the room and then I can push that whole other table completely over to the middle of the room hang up all those buttons on the back side of the room or wherever in the room right and then basically I'll be good to go I'll get everything hung I'll turn off the shaker fan I'll just keep one of them on probably maybe turn it down to low or something and I'll just have to DEET you and AC going in there I'll be able to scrub down the you the four by twelve that's in there now scrub it down and get it reset and start making my adjustments to the room while I wait on my new 4 by 12 American Girl products they're probably they told me it was going to be issued early June like June 8th or 6 but they might be able to get it in sooner so I mean worst case scenario the room will be down for about three weeks while I wait on the new table but I'll just match all the plants on one table while I'm doing that perfect and then when I get my new table in I'll be able to go ahead and transition the plants over throw up my trellis mats and pretty much switch so you know that's the plan and like I said I'll document all the changes to the room it said of everything that I'd be like want to document the changes and yeah my keeper fee no cuts from honest genetics should be here in the next two to three weeks and solved a whole room full of wedding cake in there veg and flour that while I have a child my keeper he knows from our genetics and my new keeper you know caked up cherries wedding cake crossed with cherry something f3 I'm going to do the three-tiered setup but I'm waiting on him to send me the updated invoice for the new poles and as soon as I get those I'll be able to set it up and I'll have pretty much what I was thinking of doing them what happened to rekey poofy nose and I could basically put all of them on their own tier if I wanted and then have clones next to it or I could just put all the moms on one and then since I'm doing two tables at a time I'll just pick you know I'll have two tiers for clothes you know cherry cookies have three thank you thank you thank you I never remember like my keeper he knows from honest I don't remember what I was are either blue hurricane 27 crossed with white sunrise for the blue lion keeper and then scarlet sure is chocolate frosting crossed with something I think [Music] I trust my man on his genetics he tells me yo this is a [ __ ] you should run for a hash let's fire fire fire legs all right now you got it [Music] like I remembered it enough to purchase it and you know that's all that matters now that's all that matters now I need to show up in the garden [Music] so stoked I have I'll have the blue Hawaiian which is gonna have exotic super crazy unique blue Terps it's gonna be highly sativa dominant as far as the high goes and then the truck not the truck cherry but the cakes of cherries that's gonna be my cherry Fino right there so I'll have a blue of a cherry and then I have the gassy out of scarlet shirt so it's gonna be dope [Music] this is real the kind of light that I use for clowns are right behind either the raging raging kales and I actually got sponsored by science LED yeah so I will be getting now raging candle LEDs probably twice a year during two biggest ways that I do and it couldn't be [ __ ] dope it can really know and then every other month or so I'll be giving away a bunch of science LED swag hats ashtrays shirts things like that all be put on there grower spotlight on their homepage pretty shortly here I have some pictures that I have to take for them and type up some some information and what else asked me to leave to help them do research spectrum tuning and hash production so I'll be doing that so and then also the big thing I'll be an authorized reseller for their lights on my webpage as soon as it's up in a few days so as soon as the page is up I'm going to try and get them on there and I'll be able to resell a life through my page so that way you know they don't do they don't do coupon codes like people in the industry you got to use to coupon codes because of for flex and all that but what that does is it makes it so that you can't sell that product in brick-and-mortar stores anymore and in the hydro industry almost need brick-and-mortar stores still surprisingly to you know expand and survive because still a big commercial facilities go through these hydro stores and you know direct to these manufacturers a lot so they don't do coupon codes they're like let's say they offer a 10% discount code here in California right and somebody purchases a light from you know from me and using my promo code but they're in Oregon or something and or somewhere else where they maybe don't charge sales tax and now not only are they getting the 10% off but they're also getting like seven or eight maybe taking even up to 10% off of that because of no sales tax right whereas if they were to purchase it in the store you know the store would be able to make a profit but in order to compete with that price that they would get you know from using the coupon code the brick-and-mortar store would basically have to not turn a profit so it doesn't work out for them to be able to give people who coupon codes stacked as representatives of the brand so instead I'll be able to be a reseller and then just a very very small portion of the profit that they would make from that light will go towards me instead so I'll be an authorized reseller and then basically helping do research and you know passing that information you guys like I have been this whole time so anyways this is what we're working with they bought this is delicious delicious it's called cookie dough and it's amazing [Music] I don't suspect this is gonna last long you won't need a code to let them know who sent you because you're gonna go through my website to purchase they're working on other programs like referral codes and things like that but [Music] yeah I guess I should keep this on camera so people don't think that I'm like lying and I say I got a grandfather drive here we did well today it's real I wouldn't had a couple more but honestly you guys want to get jars of the grape Cosby and literally all I have left of this [Music] that's it but in this drawer it's maybe maybe seven grams six seven grams of the grape Cosby I think the other jars been scraped empty already yeah scraped empty great cause be gone on that one and then the hell a Koosh cake [Music] there's like maybe two to three grams to scrape out of here [Music] and this one I think is scraped completely empty yeah there's maybe like point two in here it's empty so there was 70 72 grams of the La Push cake and 60 grams of the Cosby [Music] but every time you come in here you [ __ ] promotin be real oh no no no who was it last time it wasn't beaver oh it was your boy the other one that's not good Bernhard that's who it was last time [Music] about your ass sorry yo for real alright here's the funny story that's how you guys are quick so the reason this one got called rape Cosby because [Music] my wife and I dabbed it and she got so [ __ ] high off of it it was like she got roofied like straight roofie I could have done anything I wanted to so I was like mother kali shake great cosby it tastes like grapes and knocks you the [ __ ] out like you did this it was between grape Cosby and roofie colada you know think of work 12 but you guys got to make sure you do it right [Music] it's great cause be like that lowercase G Capital are [Music] all right let's get [Music] a little credit given

a you write for [Music] oh here it is [Music] [Music] that's not it either I have like a lot of different files in here that I have to go through [Music] that's three lighting maybe this is the right here number four [Music] okay yeah here it is and as this little my everybody [Music] alright I'll go ahead and get this uploaded to YouTube right you know [Music] I'm kind of done editing these I'm just gonna start uploading the RAW files and if people don't like it they can kiss my ass I don't have time to edit them together anymore that's why I put the PowerPoint how I did you know if I do the PowerPoint I don't have to worry about putting an intro and all that into the video it's just boom okay boss [Music] alright crap dude my science for plant nutrition are a cool description I'll edit that later now don't care playlist crafted science done no it's not made for kids don't have to restrict [Music] monetization please do [Music] public [Music] boom what is instant premiere oh [ __ ] we could watch it together at the same [ __ ] time let's [ __ ] do that right now I did not know we could do that that is really cool we can watch the video together yeah three minutes five all right

Greenjeans was sooo Oberto 11 seconds 8 seconds that's called your video will premiere what's uploading and processing finished as well as the hundred percent uploaded is 95 percent process I have no idea how this is going to look for you guys I don't know how this works I've never done this before it is [ __ ] top-down so we're gonna check it out oh my god dollars people my DM right now [Music] all right you guys let me know what happens on your end when this is done hopefully I mean it doesn't take forever right now it's an remember you two processes videos one definition at a time so the low definition stuff is going to process and then like for whatever and then 720 and 1080 [Music] my phone right now it's just doing the load F [ __ ] the standard definition version we'll see whatever the [ __ ] back [Music] I'm really curious to see what this does though man that was such a good [ __ ] good [ __ ] episode and then episode 5 I'm glad we took a break because we were really [ __ ] burned out both of us and we needed a skip a week we came back and we didn't even have a PowerPoint or anything but it was still an amazing discussion Garrett jumped online from science at levy and he just [ __ ] to talk about what we wanted to talk about which was great just you know [Music] we just talked about troubleshooting it was [ __ ] awesome you know he get his perspective on things like walking into like a huge commercial facility and how you would troubleshoot their [ __ ] to figure out what's going on why certain part of the crop might not be doing its good versus another part things like that so it was really cool to get his perspective because you know as far as lost leaf goes he's a commercial facility but he's a one-man army and it's a small commercial facility it's the size of a house basically a one-story house and so and that's that's no diss whatsoever [ __ ] it's amazing what he's doing I wish I could be at his level but in the realm of commercial grows it's relatively small so you know his perspective is one and then Maya the home grower is another and then Gary brings a whole different perspective being that he's kind of more on the large large scale commercial and so it was really cool you know and go with it so unfortunately during this whole Cove 8:19 thing all of the HD recordings for webinars are being limited and only being allowed standard definition so this is not going to be best of qualities for the uploads that are going on right now from the webinars and there's nothing that we can do about that so you know [Music] check it on the patreon real quick make sure you guys got your post real quick [Music] are you guys waiting on me to take another dab is that what's going on [Music] I guess [Music] it's not what you guys I feel like a little [ __ ] a dab [ __ ] for you guys it's all you guys wanna take your dad show me his plan it's never hey SB Andy how's your day go what'd you do today need some help no I'm just [ __ ] one shot I already forgot what this one is again that's the coach tasted positive and he's more paper towels real quick cuz my house got so high I forgot to clean the [ __ ] banger after the last job that's [ __ ] I I guess I Cosby myself whoever said don't cause be yourself I can't be myself go clean it out real easy paper towels to clean [Laughter] [Music] yeah all of the rapidly science episodes go on patreon pretty much the same day or minimum a week earlier than YouTube a minimum and Matt doesn't post on lost leaf as a poster or anything like that out of respect for my patreon supporters he knows he waits again he's a week two to three weeks even suppose I mean it's not that I don't want the information out there for everybody but I wanted to I want to give some [ __ ] love to the people on patreon and economic access all that and they can pick my brain talk about it on live sessions or whatever brain different [ __ ] you know [Music] all right the tip of my II now is 395 and I need to grab another roll of paper towels real quick [Music] [Music] damn [ __ ] oh yeah [Music] oh [ __ ] [Music] in the filter [Music] oh Jesus son 525 that is a very very high [ __ ] gasps Jesus [Music] [Music] so the reclaim catcher works by basically a when you draw on the dab it gets stuck down here because all that reclaimed can't travel back up pretty much so what you end up with really is just tiny tiny pieces of the vapor that condensed back to rosin in here versus a shit-ton of replaying and if you have a really good deep-dish banger and you do low temp doubts your your reclaim actually can look really nice how well that looks but [Music] seeing us a thing FPV not everybody's email setup is the same not all coils are created equal so you got to get you know a good coil setup with this I can go three eighty and still get clouds [Music] you need some sort of cloud [Music] all right [Music] my emails from 7-10 coils and you have promo codes with them but up go my man go in the

not the popcorn we've been used to seeing from a lot of dispensaries lately uh now granted they sometimes sell it cheaper but you know what nothing presses as well as these nice juicy buds they've been rehydrated with hydra stones for two hours so they are ready to go um the smell of this stuff is absolutely intoxicated just by itself uh gg4 is a strain everybody seems to know and love i don't know too many people that have told me hey man i really hate gg4 so this is gonna be fun to press oh okay let's get this nice and put in here make sure you can kind of see what's going on all right we're going to cut the excess off the bag grab some parchment [Music] oh yeah super it might be it might be i did find out with this newer press that you really have to [Music] uh have to put a lot of layers in here because this stuff will seep through at the kind of tonnage you're putting on it now it's got to make kind of a directional pouch here to make sure everything stays inside where you want it to be all right get this in here fold up our bag and put it in the middle of our little pouch right here that summer's right there thing is it isn't going to look real pretty on video because when these plates really close down we're going to lose everything on the video but wait do you see what it looks like when it comes apart again it should be super cool i'm going to move the camera a

[Music] let's get this camera adjusted here for you a little tighter [Music] there we go [Music] i like that heat soaked in there as i bring up that pressure gently i'm looking for that seepage to start really quick because this is a really nice strain a lot of people are pressed gg4 pressing this at last time i pressed gg4 i pressed it at 200. let's see what it does this time i think it's gonna be [Music] beautiful oh yeah out of love gotta love that smell okay okay relax everything [Music] i like using the phone as a monitor because i can get it real closely until i hit a certain point this is right around the point where you're gonna stop seeing a lot of stuff on the video watch this [Music] just keep bringing the pressure nice and slow and nothing will start to move oh god yeah let's see anything [Music] so [Music] so here that is the sweet spot this might not be the most exciting part of this video but you're really going to love what you see coming off of this thing in a minute i can guarantee you that sure all right big shout out to my friends over at rise of monroeville my family up there hope you guys see this video this is the fire that was purchased at your

[Music] okay oh [Music] what happened all right i'm gonna pull this camera out like ouch back over here all right like opening up a present on christmas day look at that isn't that beautiful [Music] oh look at that looks beautiful yeah it's a happy plant there was no overpressure no blowout came out perfect nice and different so if you want to see it okay do this in two stages i'm gonna grab a slick and deposit it all on here so i can squish it out and show everybody how pretty it is and then we'll put it into a jar we'll weigh it up for you to see what the yield is good nice brand new slick [Music] and make sure there's no cap air which is a hazard in this place all right skip tool my brand of choice when it comes to this type of thing i really like the way they work okay here we go oh look at that look at that consistency so glad i did this at 180. at 200 i think this is shattered up i really do oh [Music] beautiful day this fills the room that beautiful stuff yes sir high quality thc tell me you seen the water boy oh yeah [Music] [Music] just [Music] dude colors color is awesome color is completely what you want to be seeing that beautiful pastel [Music] well you're dealing with a variable plant you know it's different every every batch is a little different every pheno is definitely different you know so you can automate things to a certain degree but it still really takes somebody who knows what they're doing watching what's going on you know if i dress that stuff on there another minute and a half it would have probably shattered up you know that's what i mean it's just a matter of doing it doing it doing it until you kind of do it by instinct on this you know i i don't really like using gauges and stuff like that but uh do you find that maybe indicators produce a little more than sativa they do they do they do yeah as a general rule now the exception to that rule african tie i knew it and and malawi memory loss also for the crime those those are two straight indica or straight sativas that produce and behave like indicas on a press i've never seen anything else like um banana kush from from rhythm is another one that's really really nice and oppressed brownie scalp birthday cake great divide all of those excellent yeah you should check out my database i got a link to it that you know you can it changes as i add new data like when i add this it'll update right now so everybody who has a link can view it you can't change anything on it you can look at it it's only like my fifth dispensary flower press this year well the thing is dude you bring what you need for you you know this is about you i mean i love making it for you but this is about what strain works for you right i think i'm a little snobbish when it comes to me only because this is what i do all the time i don't try to press a lot of stuff under 25 percent for me but for patients hey that's your medicine man i'm going to try to get you the very best of what it will give but when you get below you know 25 the yields start to drop significantly so but this this is really really nice just came up very very nice and here missina is not happy to be excluded from the festivities she is a she wants that hey she wants what she wants when she wants it and that's just how it is with the caliper no she does she's she likes she likes to smelly sticks her nose in my raws and every time every time she gets the chance she gets man oh absolutely well here's the other thing too okay you know look i know you're not supposed to smoke it but most people who who who do flower they they smoke right so you take an eighth home that you just spent 65 bucks on or 60 and you're gonna get if you're lucky three joints or maybe two once out of that eighth okay that to me is half a day's worth of medication at most at most you take that same eight you press it the rosin press and get anywhere near a grammar rosin from it and grandma rosin medicates me to the same level three solid days that's why i do this because you save money and get better medicine because this is nug run not trim this is solventless in its purest form right off right off the plant right into rosin no intermediate work needs to be done single stage to medicine so let's get this kind of gathered up okay i'm gonna try to get this all together there we go now it's gripping oh it's broken now there this is mighty fine medicine okay what i'm gonna do is backlight it so you can really see how nice this really is look at that look how clean that is that is beautiful gg4 gti let's find out what our yield is now shall we because that's what a lot of people are waiting to see what did we get so started off 10.5 let's see what 10.5 turned into okay zeroed out get her in the jar oh 1.573 i'll take it any day thanks for joining me for this video stay safe stay medicated and be good to each other asher's finest on the case", "GKsAskKo3Hc": "Everybody, how's it going?

comment share subscribe See you guys in the next one", "UNWHow4VH3k": "well we are back we are back and we are pressing a quarter of moxie viper cookies okay uh this is i haven't i haven't pressed a lot of moxie uh in a while so this will be fun this stuff is ringing in at uh 26.9 percent combined thc thca we've got a 121 micron bag here and the crd 30 ton triptech rosin press is set to 180 degrees fahrenheit i don't use timers i don't use the gauge that's on this pump so please don't ask me how long i leave it on just watch the video and you'll see how long i leave it on for okay so this has been rehydrated with hydra stones and we're going to load this bag up hope everybody is staying safe staying medicated and being good to each other out there just a reminder if you are a medical marijuana patient in the pittsburgh area and you have dispensary flour and you would like to have it turned into gold please come and see me in penn hills here at the studio i do that for patients i press form for free that is a patient's helping patients initiative that i've been doing since 2018 never charge a patient to press their medicine for it it is important that patients get good quality medicine at a price that they can afford and i am trying to help in that respect so here is our quarter get this thing all put into a nice little package and move these lights up here and get this placed right where i want it to be there we go that paper of course anytime you're doing live stuff okay all right so let's get that out of the way and get this centered up where i want it to be get the light in there on it real good so you can see it get real close and put it right there all right here we go let's get this valve closed on the pump let's make some medicine there's nothing i enjoy more right now than just getting the best that this flower can offer and as long as you treat this plant with respect she will give herself to give you the best medicine that you can have much better quality than anything you will get in the dispensary as a concentrate solidness is definitely the way to go and rosin whether it be hash rosin or flower rosin is a step way bigger than any of the commercially available chemically extracted concentrates so let's just remember where the quality is and the flavor because this is a full spectrum extract and take terpenes and winterize it do all kinds of crazy stuff they just you just get the buds and the essence of them their soul that's the way i like to approach it so as you can see it's going to get harder and harder to see so i'm going to let this go now and start concentrating on this press i'm going to let that heat soak in for about 30 seconds before i finish get the full pressure i don't know if there's any big drops tomorrow for the weekend but i would be watching the healing center my tree rise all of those guys because you know how that goes friday if you get a big drop and if you're not ready to grab it online you can lose out real easy all right almost at pressure there we go that's where i want to be with it let it sit there for a minute i'm going to pull this shot back out oh yeah this should be fun so again moxie doesn't come out with a lot of flour they've been coming out with more lately and i don't get a chance to press much of it because it's usually at the high end of the price spectrum not a lot of patients bring it to me so i figured i'd grab some and we'll see what see what it does you know and there isn't a whole lot else you can do except uh try it and it goes into my database you find out how it stacks up against the other grower processors and the other strains that they're putting out so i'm just getting the scale ready i already have a jar make sure i get the tear on that first seventeen yep that's great okay are you ready you ready to see it here we go okay viper cookies what'd you give us oh oh yes oh yeah i'll tell you what take a look at that that looks mighty mighty fine to me so let us get that paper off of here turn off the i am done pressing unless unless there's a patient that comes over with something for me let me get the shot out and redirected all right a small blowout no big deal take my tools here clean a little bit of clean rosin off the end of that but like i said blowouts happen no matter whose bag you're using luckily they don't happen all the time so let's get this fired up tara and philip she looks like a happy plant this thing was coming off looking like it was made from washed flour uh and that it didn't just come from straight flour some of this consistency is very reminiscent of a lot of hash rosin i see being shown on ig gas rosin's fantastic it's just not practical for medical patients in pennsylvania because of our prices you know so pennsylvania and the medical marijuana program flower rosin is king of solidness because you can't get the good stuff good ash rosin at the dispensers they don't sell it they don't make it people who do make it aren't making it for the legal market so best you're gonna get medicine wise from somebody who can craft it immediately for you somebody like me who's doing flower rosin just like this gotta love this plant with all your heart to be good at doing this consistently you got to be having access to flour that is of amazing quality to get this kind of result oh this stuff came out so beautiful oh yeah oh moxie my good friend dave perlow gabe pirlo who is the ceo of moxie he and i have had a very nice relationship as far as his business ideas about doing solventless believe me when the feds lift the the lid off this whole thing and deschedule this plant you're gonna start seeing a lot more solventless on the market because it will be on the recreational side probably but you will see it moxie has always been a concentrate centric company it started off they didn't have the canopy enough to to sell flowers so all they sold were their really nice concentrates and their cartridges i love their cartridges liquid moxies melon wreck is awesome ellerange is fantastic a big fan of their distillate cartridges but their flowers always been kind of rare you know now they're stepping up their their production ability and now they're coming out with more flour which is really cool so let's see what we got for a yield and wow 0.61 well when you take away the 17 grams for the jar that is well that is not what i would consider an acceptable yield okay again my bare minimum acceptable yield is half half a gram per eight this comes out to be point three per eighth which i mean here's the thing though the quality is amazing okay and in terms of the look of it it smells incredible you know but there it is maybe i can get it you can see the better light i mean look at the quality of that there's no disputing the fact that moxie makes really good flour the problem is the flour that they make or that they grow doesn't have the wax and lipid profiles to make them a good candidate for solventless extraction via rosin press so always bear in mind that when you're going to buy flour you need to pick strains that work for you and you have to be willing to accept that you may get a strain like this like this viper cookies which looks to be amazing probably going to taste incredible uh but the yield is not sufficient for for me from for me personally it may be for you as a patient you may be a baller and can afford to buy enough eights to get enough of this pressed to make it worth medicating with it i tend to look for the higher producing strains i think this is an excellent strain i bet it's a great strain for the other uses dry vaping quote unquote um but for rosin it's one i would probably take a pass on personally but if you're seeing this and you're liking what you see grab yourself some dispensary flower and get on over here to penn hills and come and see me and i will do this for you too stay safe stay medicated be good to each other everybody have a good day", "a6BMDjoAf_0": "[Music] Peggy's going on YouTube it's your boy sub eg backhanded with another banger video for the eyes man for today's video guys as you

into this man I have to give a big shout-out to today's sponsor man gothic comm where they sell bracelets pendants and rings super sick ass rings man well you can go buy some for your friends girlfriend whatever the case is man and you could use my own personal code savvy G to get a discount percentage of well I'll put everything down in the description below man go show them some support because a support of today's video guys alright honestly we're like I said I was ready to be smoking on both of these guys they both cost me around this one right here was $80 this one right here with $70 so a total of 150 it is a pretty hefty price to paint but you know if you want to smoke it you got to pay the price so we're gonna save this for the second part of the video we're gonna roll up a nice joint with that but first since I do have my rig right here MJ Arsenal and my torch all the goodies right here I think the only thing we can do is take it out all right so I'm already have been dabbing it so I'm bushed shut you guys in there it might be missing some so this right here guys is what I have currently right now and it's honestly some of the turkeys like 710 miles has to be some of the turkeys but I mean wax that I have ever smelled man like the the Terps in this thing is just so amazing and I kid you not man stabbing on Psalm endless like wax is just so freakin good man thinking about doing is heating this up for 30 about 30 to 35 seconds and then waiting about 45 seconds to 50 seconds I feel like that gives it the best the taste and it's not very harsh smoke yet you get very very milky clouds so let's go ahead and torch this thing up boys cheers i heated it up to 35 seconds I'm gonna go ahead and let it go till 45 just because I had you have the window open man and I'm gonna go ahead and meanwhile though let's go ahead and choose a nice little chunky one just to start things off boys because honestly I have I've only dabbed it once today and I feel like man this one's gonna catch me because I'm telling you the hatch frozen is so smooth that you only really feel it when it starts building up in your chest man so we're about during your second day and still got another ten and yeah let me know in the comments below if you've ever tried 7-10 labs man if you have make sure to hit that like button on this video and if you haven't we'll hit that like button anyways cheers boys oh dude that tastes so freakin good I already look at the depths what's already coming in that was the perfect dab I kid you not watch this I love waiting all right the reason I love waiting that much time it's because you just get the smoothest hits the milk is hits and then the Terps now I'm tick I'm talking about I can taste everything in this I can taste everything man it's phenomenal and after you're done your your nail should look like this man you should still see oil in there and man there's seven ten laps definitely definitely worth that's the $80 that I paid man I would I want to buy the Percy that one right there is $100 I believe or $90 so if you guys want to see a video on the percy live rosin let me know in the comments below like this video and subscribe so auntie dad dad got me super high and I just remember that we also have to smoke another joint so I'm probably gonna step aside from the dabbing and we're gonna go ahead and crack this open man this oh gee Kb your see you guys see how fresh it is man I have not opened it brand new look well you can see the seal right there man this is gonna be the first time guys that I have ever seen this flower in person and I'm kind of excited already it's like a little glimpse right there so let me go ahead and pop this sucker out oh dude oh now just follow my computer oh dude it's as beautiful as the oh oh my goodness dude yo I know my camera is not gonna you know pick up every single watch I'm gonna have to use my phone for this guy's but this but right here you guys know the phone camera picks up every single trichome everything that's why we use the phone and look look at this guy's just look at this you guys are gonna be in all all right so this is the og KB right here look at this dude the beautiful orange hairs I'm talking about look at the trichomes look at the purple little stems think you know oh my gosh the curation on this dude is just so phenomenal I haven't even smelt it what does it smell like I have never saw anything like this smells like me but it's just a different type of legal officer dude this is like literally one of the most aya peeling pieces of bud that I have ever seen and now it's just a fact so what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna roll this up I don't know how much help I roll it up but dude this thing is just so phenomenal looking I don't even know if I want to break it apart but I just want to just put this in a casing and just put it in a corner of my room do you never touch it so this thing looks so phenomenal I'm gonna like I said I'm a roll up a joint and I'll see you guys in a little bit right here we got the joint right here man it's honestly I rolled there I've been getting so much better at rolling these freaking joints so all we got to do now man is pretty much just burn off the paperboys and basically here you go here you have it your perfect little or joint now I want to say there's like 1.5 in here man but does it really matter though because I just want to know how good this is man I want to know if it's worth the money because this this 8 was more expensive than a cookie so he hasn't gonna be the first one to find out boys choose only through the age of 18 or 21 whatever it is in your legal statement choose wood hmm after that personation I did get a little bit of some a little bit of paper tape so [Music] whoo it's actually pretty freakin smooth man so far so far I do i I did roll these in some raw hemp papers organic hemp so there might be another reason why but honestly so far it's burning a really really smooth I am getting a lot of earthiness from this plant itself and it's giving off a little bit of a sweet tone but honestly it tastes very very very good like it's something like I know we did we'd look I know we do sweet guys but you can tell the difference from something that is properly cultivated to some [ __ ] that you know that that is make that is being made in mass amounts and things like that like these guys they take so much pride because it's small batch all the time they never they never overdo the batches man because they want to make sure that every single planet that they grow is growing to a hundred percent perfection on their own terms you know but so far man I haven't I'll any clips of this this it's burning very very smooth like I'm telling you let me give you guys a little close-up of pilots burning right I rolled it really really good it's burning even all the way through you got the little tip right there if you ask them to see that and it's an enjoyable smoke man it's currently 10 o'clock in the morning and usually whenever this is the first time I'm smoking also unusually whenever I smoke first my eye like I started coffee or [ __ ] to him whenever it's the first work of a bit but this is smooth like I was saying and it tastes very piney earthy but it's enjoyable as heck I don't taste any really fruitiness flavors of it no I taste a little bit of sweetness but it's not overpowering this thing is chiefing though it's obviously getting me super super baby I ended up waiting a little bit after taking the dabs and then just I mean I rolled out the joint while I was high a [ __ ] and then I roll I waited a little bit more that way I could get the full effects because I didn't want to go from being a super stone because that was a super fat that that I just took I don't want to go from being super stoned to you know getting even more stunning I even being able to differentiate the type of high that I'm getting in the flavor because my mouth was dry as heck I kid you not that dad got me so tight but I was brick and faded for it for a minute I'm not gonna lie I have not been that faded in such a long time and it's such a good feeling now and then they finished chugging milk for sure all boys that looks like we're at had a lighter fluid on our centers [Music] this thing is McEnroe I hope you guys like the new location I mean I'm just in my garage and I hope you guys not like the current location man I was gonna do it in my car but I was like man for a special day like this my mind let's just do it somewhere where you know you guys can see all the smoke around me not the same setting give you guys some a little something different I just in used to Macanese well I'm about to finish this whole joint to the face but not on camera because that would literally turn my videos so freakin long all right guys so my review for this ogk be it's about its max I'm high right now like super faded and it's such a different height such a soothing high but usually with wheat it's either I don't get high or I get like you know too high to the point where I don't even enjoy the high because my head's hurting but this right here yeah but this one right here is honestly just hitting like every single aspect bro like I'm sure I know I know for a fact after I'm done with this I'm probably I'm probably gonna have a better good morning you know I'm already have me good morning gonna go better and EMA like like I would say though I would definitely would not mind dropping another 150 hundred 60 on some 17 laps again like because there I'm telling you they're rosin smack nice it was just the perfect gap the turf through there the taste is there that I was there everything about it was so good and I feel like usually I don't get that feeling with other concentrates you know with other flower so yeah man I would definitely purchase this again time though I do want to try the Persie rosin you know want to try I'm not even sure what kind of strain this was it was like an indica or sativa guessing it's either hinder guard hybrid so next time I want to try just a straight-up indica and see how much that smacks me because I feel like if this give this is smack at me right now I can only imagine what a straight up in meter with you so yeah guys I'm gonna go ahead and hand out the video here because I'm high as a hack right now I just want to enjoy the rest of this man hopefully you guys enjoyed today's video and you know and if you did go ahead and

will go the bebo Baggins 110 million so I guess I use the matching carve cap I guess as you can see I'm all shiny sweated Abdo like I said I love the clear you see that [ __ ] fill up and then you watch you just need to watch yourself empty it that's what and I got this Bebo Baggins as a traveller piece I haven't took it nowhere but I got another traveler piece but while I was waiting for it in the mail I picked up this local leave and that's why I carry this when I land so I'm supposed to carry that woman but I got to be here and bought this one so this should be my new traveler piece because if I break it I won't be I said if I break the mat robbed not that this isn't a top-quality piece because it is it's just more and if I break it I won't be you know how will be a sad that's that's the main reason why I got to travel around with it well yeah I don't think that showed my [ __ ] my Ewok handbook dispenser pretty sick it's an Ewok but I can get a teddy bear and a hoodie so you guys can watch along but this is a teddy bear and I [ __ ] hated mmm I got that from a glass P AV I believe on Instagram that's pretty sick that auctions all time let's hope it's not you man along

this in welding class in high school it's pretty [ __ ] sick it just chunks the metal screwed together and he sent me a snap of him getting this etched on I put some type of machine they have at their school and in the video in the video of the snap he showed me there's a cop there's a cop right there while he's doing it and I was like oh [ __ ] did you get in trouble and he said no the cop was helping him with the software of the the of the laser the laser machine that put my name that put my name on there he was showing my do it or whatever so I thought that's pretty funny a cop is up so a

down from that last dad man all right here we go time to get hot again whoo these dads make it hot um should I use this Clark Kent I think i'ma go with the directional guys all the right here she got to look at it but he didn't go with the direction this one this is rebel rebels glass good lookin out rebel good it's right on there so this kind of swinging sweeney blacks he gets his inspiration from his own bulldog and follow me on snapchat you guys not got a bulldog soon so i had to [ __ ] to pick this [ __ ] up man and I got a bulldog tattoo on my leg and it's just it's just badass I love my dog I love this piece it's pretty sick so whenever you hear hear that [ __ ] tapping town walking around on the that's just my dog's a nail about hardwood that's all that is are you hearing [ __ ] breathing on a premie he's asleep right now he's a lazy [ __ ] but I loved him yeah his birthday is April 1st so it's coming up he's about to be 5 he's about to be 5 for 5 year he's my first dog I never had a dog so it's pretty and he's pretty amazing he's such a character that's why he's tattooed on my leg he's my first dog and I'll never forget him he might come walking out here just because I'm talking about him he's funny like that here we go laughs Cheers you know caught them up with a [ __ ] cheers guys I wonder what I'm dealing with throwing over my phone there's a Dave & Buster's ashtray behind it aren't you guys I'm gonna get out here drink some water maybe do a DAB after I recover but I'm out of here see you guys next time please", "A_kxN5PQQls": "don't you hate it when you can't scrape all the hash out of your little stupid container there's a dab left in here but I can't even scoop it out not with this thing anyways but I'm about to show you a super easy way to get every last bit of hash out of every one of your containers this is gonna save you so many doubts right now on the stream answers to all the questions you've ever had about weed what's up i'm matt welcome back to the strange show this is a channel for adults and patients where i answer all the questions you've ever had about weeds you don't know how many of these little containers like this or maybe even worse the even smaller ones like this that i've thrown away that still have some hash inside of them a long time ago i never knew how to get the last dab or two out of these things and it would drive me crazy until i learned how to make a turn to tell me Tyler showed me this so shout out to Tyler thank you buddy this saved my life all three of these containers are pretty much empty I can't get any more on my stick but after we make our Terp tube we're gonna have a few dabs of these guys so super easy you really don't need a couple things first get all your containers that you have that still have just a little bit of hash in them then we're gonna need a drinking straw a pair of scissors and you probably already have your torch handy but we might not even need this first just cut off a few inches of your straw just make sure the piece you cut off is at least a few inches long now we're gonna take the piece that we cut off we're gonna cut a really steep angle on one side of the straw like this now that we've cut at this really steep angle we're gonna cut the pointy side off right there so it's nice and flat on the front and it looks like a little shovel now we have a very flexible tool to scrape our container with and it's hollow and you're gonna see why that's important in just a second but look how good it scrapes this out I mean it gets every drop there's nothing left in this that looks brand-new now and I can do that to all of these I could go around the house and find any of these I might have and try this and it even works in these little tiny ones because the Turk tube is so flexible that it just bends to any shape you smush it to so if your hash isn't as wet is these are if it's too hard to scrape with your turkey that's when your torch is gonna come in now if you have a hairdryer laying around I'd probably use the hairdryer first but you're probably like me and you're sitting here it's all your dabbing stuff in front of you and I don't have a hairdryer in front of me - dad what so I'm gonna use a torch so just take your torch and just barely wand it over your hash container and just gently heat it up just ever so slightly then it should be a little more runny and wet and pliable and you can do that with your torch or a blow-dryer or whatever you could probably just put in your pocket for now or anything to make it warm now all our containers are clean and our Terk tube is full of past but it's way down in the tube how are we supposed to give to this out this is why it's good for it to be held just take your scissors and cut right up the middle of your straw now you can get your dab tool and to scoop it right out of it and now we got a big bat dam out of an otherwise empty container now that's tight that's the success Terp - yo buddy don't forget to subscribe for good vibes and I got nuggets of knowledge cuz when you watch the stream show it's like going to weed College [Music]", "vlO1jMDzCKg": "yeah it's gonna be a long video all right today we have six courts inserts here all loaded up with different strains some are live resin some are rosin I got one giant diamond here and I even got some sugar wax here and I think that's what I'm gonna start out with this is some Blood Diamond from Agra kind this [ __ ] looks nuts and honestly it has the consistency of like a sponge has an amazing terpene profile it tastes straight-up like grapefruit it feels like it's like a charcuterie board of dads I'm about to have a very good time here I'm sure not everyone knows what quartz inserts are and how they're used but I have an entire youtube video where I break it down super in-depth so if you want to learn more about quartz inserts you can go into the description of this video and watch that first but from here on out in the video I'm going to assume that you know what quartz inserts are and how they're used it's gonna bang your nice and hot alright now that our banger is going down let's get a quick little close up if we can bounce away boys this might overflow not gonna lie one piece breast oh he's so good my god [Music] Piper hush sorry you guys got my dog with me she's away from all the deaths not bad I got a little doggie gate set up here that's oh my god man this should taste so good I'm not kidding my girlfriend even like hates the smell of weed and she smoked this [ __ ] and she was like damn you should get more of that that [ __ ] smells good that definitely raised the temperature in here holy [ __ ] those nice big shout out the cop products for making these courts inserts that fit their bangers perfectly not to mention the tweezers they make so handling them when they're super hot is really like a stress free hassle all right that was a nice way to start the session I like legit sweating a little bit yep that's what what's nice about that inserts is honestly there's not a lot of residue that gets on the banger you even want to overflows it's so much less than one actually gets an insert so it really does provide your banger from getting that like Chaz dusty look to it all right that was nice but next I'm gonna dab some rosin this strain is strong wah but number two from olio this one really impressed me even from olio it smells and tastes amazing the look on it's great honestly even when it smells it's almost [ __ ] clear let me show you all right I have number two get it nice and close time a little bit the smaller Deb but I still think it's a beige decent size with a desert no wait till it really starts to smoke up in here and then I go for it this one's a little hot oh my god Oh oh my god it's like one hit left boom Wow that [ __ ] is nice definitely burnt up though with that on that one oh my god there is nobody left in there even even when it was that hot it tasted [ __ ] good man these inserts really make the dabs last longer I sort of got I mean this time I went a little hot but even if you get a nice low time they [ __ ] Rock here alright threw down four to go [ __ ] alright next I'm dabbing on some good goog live president from Moxie I really like this drain it's a sativa hybrid but honestly it's just a straight sativa in my opinion it gets me so [ __ ] high in that like cracked-out sativa way or you're super chatty and like just want to go out and go do something like this is definitely a constraint for on-the-go I'm not gonna do a close-up on this one [ __ ] it let's see the whole function of the Ring all right let's drop it already Melton Oh Lord dude I'm already so [ __ ] big this is gonna be a long video yep it's gonna be a long video oh my god [ __ ] give me that little nose tickle oh my god I gotta hear at the chit still going Jesus Christ this is what I was talking about [ __ ] oh my god all right tap it out there I swear it man that is a straight sativa it's not considered one but like that rosin that killed me and that one's brought me back to life halfway there only three left alright next I'm gonna dive is a little scary it is like a straight THC a rock but it's actually just like lab rats and diamonds without the live presentation it it's one giant rock so this should be interesting this [ __ ] has no flavor obviously because there's no turfs but it just has this like weird chemi taste like I'm honestly just not a fan I'm kind of dreading this stab out of all of them because this is a giant [ __ ] rock of it but wish me luck this I do want to go in a little bit hopped out because since it's just straight THC a really all it needs is heat to get the full effect alright let's watch this [ __ ] melt so weird has just no flavor [Applause] a little bit left it holy [ __ ] alright it's done it's [ __ ] done oh my god dude I'm not even gonna lie there's so much replaying in here you know what that means cheers [ __ ] [ __ ] me oh this is all hot [ __ ] no bueno just has no flavor so weird the highs crazy on this stuff but it's just so weird now there's no Terps I need the Turks terms all right give me some turps next to reindeer the strong Nana I'd add this a bunch on my last video has like a super great banana terpene profile I love anything that tastes like banana I don't know why it's hard to come by and it always is just like such a nice experience when I get it and this is live rosin by the way so definitely gonna have a good Turkey in profile all right as well doing a close-up let me know if you guys are enjoying these little close-up insert drops actually really enjoy the inserts so I'll keep doing videos like this if you like it so let me know swinging a little hot on that gotta take a little breather there [ __ ] [Applause] [ __ ] me oh my god dude Robin just hit you different really does who love it great experience I'd love rosin rosin for life all

breath to the number really never matters to me when people are like Oh what watermelon skittles is is the 16 or the 48 I don't care to that exact i honestly should but my memory is just not strong

10:30 we are gonna be going over to Highland provisions and that is where Casey an unknown Terp and Tobiah Minzy Bobby both are producing cash so we're gonna get to tour their facility which is something I'm really really hyped on I think the only other hash facility move toward is Bo's down in Southern Oregon always such an awesome thing to see where they produce the hash because it's so different from pho where you have all these big cylinders and you can't really see what's going on no the hash you can just pop your head right on into those rosin presses and see what the [ __ ] being squirted out there I gotta get up I took the coldest shower ever this morning so I'm nice and awake but also very cold which is why I'm still in bed plans after that include going to Portland

high so what those monsters are does I think that hels belles Wow to be a big boy jeez got cowboy Wow how far in of these these are about 25 days Wow so just start [Music] the flower really plants are you know sometimes doubling in size so that's really when we lay the trellis on you know pretty much right at the beginning and by the time that we breathe we're training them and through the trellis system to you know really try to form a uniform canopy this isn't probably the best example of the uniform canopy but this is more like what we go to fill you know and pretty much on the top and each one of these little squares and have as many jobs as possible you know periods are really uniform you've been holy [ __ ] it smells insane in here people these are huge yeah yeah yeah let me see your

can see what it left here in the ground check this i oh my gosh it is a freaking hey what's up guys welcome back to another video in today's video dad and i are going to be going to a couple old home sites where we find some cool relics in the dirt be sure to stay till the end of the video guys because dad finds this humongous silver coin which he ends up returning to the owner that's kind of like a thank you so we didn't get any close-ups of it but the coin itself is awesome so if you guys do enjoy this video please be sure to like and subscribe because it does help our channel grow and it's free we'll catch you guys in the hunt enjoy all right this is this old house we're hunting today like i said very tradition around it but still pretty cool place check this chimney out i just love that chimney just rocked together i don't even see mortar joints in it or anything that is so cool we're guessing this house was late late 1800s early 1900s but that chimney work is unbelievable wish i had their craftsmanship they had back in them days just to lay these rocks out the way they did pretty awesome all right guys check this out i've moved this out of the hole i was like that's got to be a route and i kept looking and kept looking well come back to it oh look at it i don't know what it is it come up like a coin not broke but anyways i think it's a piece of uh looks like a piece of a clock watch um pocket watch but it was embedded into that root so hard to tell how how long it was in the ground to be embedded inside that root guys wow i just found a us button this please tell me that's what that is no way that's civil war let's go baby i would think wow oh my gosh that's a nice neighbor now oh really oh that's nice wow guys we are in such a trashy area and i just dug this us button right out of it it's so heavy dad i i said the other day i wanted to find one of these actually i wanted to find like a belt buckle but this button is awesome man let's go man i wish you guys could have caught my reaction so right here is where i dug it it was probably about um i'd say six inches down in the ground and it came up screaming if you guys want to know the signal on it i'll put it back down on the ground and let you let you hear the signal well i guess let you look at the signal i got my headphones in so i'll put it right there and check out what it's reading guys that's a solid 32-34 wow that is awesome guys i'll go over my settings in uh in a little bit great find i was super bummed out guys we put this on our facebook page aqualand relics and somebody actually pointed us in the right direction of what it was turns out it wasn't like a button i believe it was like a rosette or something either way it wasn't civil war but it was world war ii error still a cool find in my book but i still am searching for that us buckle hey guys for my settings i was running field two i had my recovery speed on two i had my f2 on two and my fe on zero i also did my noise cancel and ground balance i'm using 50 tones and my sensitivity is on 21. all right guys we're starting to burn daylight david and jordan's down there that's where jordan found out a horse rose at so they're over there tearing it up down there but anyways i've done three wins wheat since here i didn't put them on video but here looks like possible silver but it's coming up as a nickel tone so this is gonna be silver i'm thinking it's probably gonna be like a war nickel because the war nickels had so much silver in them and that's what it's going to be but i can tell you right now it's definitely silver and the easiest way to tell if it's a war nickel if you have requesting yourself right above the i think that's called the monticello but it will have a large letter you know for where it was minted at this one here happens to be a p so it was philadelphia so it is silver i think it's like somebody can correct me if i'm wrong 35 silver something like that let's go over the at pro settings here i've had a couple people ask me how i run my at pro when i'm out hunting for anything like coins or civil war or anything like that i always have mine set up in pro zero mode i love to hear that high tune that an item gives to you when you uh use the pro zero when you go to the the custom mode then you get that ding dong sound like a doorbell and i just don't like that but anyways i can run it here today i'm running a full blast i got it sensitivities all the way up to the max and i'm running 25 iron to screw i'm just trying to get rid of some of the nails and stuff like that but that's how i run my at pro when i can i i love running full sensitivity if possible but we're burning daylight here let me see if i can find another coin here before it's all said and done all right let's try a live dig here you can hear that how that detector's screaming that's what i was telling you i like pro zero mode it's ringing up about at 81.82 and it says about six inches deep and that's where i've been digging almost all my coins at today like i said i've gotten four coins so far turned out to be a decent day especially with jordan digging that rosette that was a pretty cool i've never even dug one of them so he's ahead of me on rosettes but let's see what we can find with what's in this hole oh okay that's a decent little fine uh this is probably what they call an organ read you know the instrument if you clean them up you can actually see the note that that was for for that that read usually down here on this end somewhere down on one of these ends right here should have a note that's what that is that's an organ read or some kind of a reed i found a lot of these in old home sites and we're burning daylight really quick here i just wanted to show you this fine it seems like a pretty cool find i think it's actually some kind of knife blade just by how pointy it is i don't think it would be an axe or anything that small i think it was some kind of knife at one point in time it had a pretty nice edge on it don't know just thought was pretty cool it'll find here guys what do you guys think this is right here i seriously don't have any idea at first i thought it was a shotgun casing but with the edges around it i don't think it's that pretty cool though hey guys so i bought my recovery speed up to three only reason being is because it's so trashy in here and this is why i did it i had a big old trash lid right there but i also had this wheat cent right by it both showing that it was the same tone however one was deeper than the other the trash can lid was on top and the penny was about six inches down in the ground so that's why i dug it and that's why i put my recovery speed on the three this is one of the spots i've been wanting to detect for a while i've seen it for years always slobbered over it was one of our local icons that owned the place but anyways i'm struggling today already uh you can hear a lot of we got an interstate right over here and we got a main avenue right here so we got a lot of outside traffic i got my earphones on today which i don't normally use i don't know if anybody else experienced this with the simplex but i think this is to me is a big weakness of the simplex and when you use headsets it actually changes the tone sound and i'm so used to hearing the certain tunes and then you go to a tune that's completely different it's tough so we're going to see jordan said he guaranteed fine silver today let's see what happens see if he can find silver or not but we'll see all right i got my first decent dig of the day oh it's coming up by the 70 71 on the simplex and i hope this background noise ain't too much i got a some kind of a heater behind me but anyways first coin of the day and let's see what it is see if we can see it together here well it's got abe's bust on the front let's get over here in the sun it's got abe's bust on the front i think it's gonna be another wheat cent yes it's gonna be a wheat cent so that's a good first dig of the day i'll take that wheat cent if it's a good date i'll let you see a close-up i was on the other side of the house and wasn't doing the greatest i come over on this side because i'm thinking this was the sunny side of the house and people would be more out on this side during you know just because it's the sunny side i got an 86 87 on the at pro that i'm using right now and i think it might be something good let's look at it together i just went over and got jordan i said you got to come see this look right here oh it might have fell out now that that's it right there i don't know what this is going to be oh it did fall out it's down here lying but you can see what it left here in the ground check this i oh my gosh it is a freaking half nice i see in god we see it down here let me get the juice out oh my this could be my best silver ever you already found a half though yeah but not this might be an older one yet let's check this out oh that's a ben franklin awesome it's silver though 1956. that's my first ben franklin right there half a dollar all right i'm back again i just wanted to see if you guys maybe somebody out there could verify this for me i find these a lot i don't know five or six per year someone was telling me they was for the end of sausages that clamp down like to keep your bags shut does anybody have any idea i mean they come up screaming on the metal detectors uh if you do know give us a comment down there and let us know what you think about it got an old coin here i don't know what it is maybe we can check it out together i see some really nice green tint to it but it almost looks like a dime if it's a dime it ain't going to be probably that old no i think it's bigger than a dime yeah it's just a memorial a green memorial oh well maybe next hole guys check out this this is actually my first marbur marble ever found check this out i've heard about people digging these all the time but i've never found one they don't come up on the detector but they're still really cool i was about seven inches down [Music] you", "1jFtPFQ8z9g": "to the people that are new to dabbing and see all these consistencies and get confused and just don't know which one to try i just say try them all today i'm going to be dabbing on some garlic cookie sauce from grassroots let's crack the seal on this as you can tell it's super [ __ ] goopy i'm gonna try to keep it as level as i possibly can jesus christ dude the whole room just reeks of garlic trying to do this without spilling any there's literally just like a straight up layer of turp juice on top of it we're gonna mix this up a little bit make sure all those diamonds and terps get mixed together nicely just look how gloopy it is you guys this stuff's so hard to handle on a dabber bloop but it's fire i love the function of this recycler that's the perfect little drain let's get our dab ready i'm not kidding when i say this stuff's running you guys you really want to make sure you have a dabber that has some sort of scoop on it so you can make sure you get a decently sized dab all right let's go you guys [Music] this [ __ ] is crazy you guys i know i talk about garlic cookies a lot on my channel but the aroma and the flavor that you get from this is [ __ ] nuts like that aftertaste just stays for so long the dab is gone i've already taken it but i can still just taste that insane garlicky feeling and these are some great effects too i swear to god that one dab does the job but this is some live resin sauce most people just call it sauce though it's a pretty popular form of concentrate there's a lot of different terms to describe extracts like shatter butter batter crumble sauce diamond sugar the list goes on and on these names are used to describe the consistency and the malleability of the concentrate not the quality everyone has a preference on their favorite consistency but none are just bad off of the consistency so just don't overthink it when it comes to quality of an extract it really just comes to what the quality of the product is going into it and the knowledge and experience of the person who's actually doing the extraction process it's not like chatter means bad sugar means good but sauce is a pretty popular form of concentrate if you've been to a few dispensaries you've probably seen it or if you know a few plugs they probably got it it looks like a million tiny rocks swimming in a pool of like yellowy ambery liquid diamonds are their own form of concentrate typically they're on the bigger side and much less terpy where sauce is usually super tiny diamonds sometimes there's a couple big rocks in there but usually it's so small where you really can't even see them mixed with a crazy amount of terpenes but those little tiny diamonds are where the cannabinoids are so that's where majority of the thc is stored and the liquid portion is live resin terpenes so there's a super high percentage of terpenes in there and a super low percentage of cannabinoids which is why it's perfect to mix the two so the sauce might not get you very high alone but when you mix it with those diamonds it just packs a punch you get pretty [ __ ] lit and the terpenes add an additional entourage effect so it really does add an additional kick to the thc but i say it's time to take another dab [Music] uh oh [ __ ] this drink feels so awkward to hold i'm not gonna lie oh my god that train is [ __ ] crazy oh [ __ ] those terpenes are always super [ __ ] heavy on sauce so i usually try to make sure i get the strains i like when i pick it up i know i said that they're all pretty much the same thing but the main difference between sauce and every other strain is that it has like the most intense terpene profile plenty of other concentrates of high terpene profiles but the most overwhelmingly high is typically sauce and the terpene profile on this one is [ __ ] insane it's five point seven percent mercy and almost five percent carry off i mean four point five percent limiting and that's just the top three it's total terpenes is 18.4 if i did my math right like that's a lot of terps sugar also has a high terpene profile but it's a little bit more easy to work with let me open this jar real quick and show you what it looks like for those who don't know all right this is a fresh gram of bubba kush sugar as you can see it's still terpy but there's more of like a solid consistency to it there's still some sauce in there but there's much bigger diamonds that are a little bit easier to handle and work with these two are made of exactly the same stuff but have a completely different consistency but the main downsides the sauce in my opinion or how liquidy it is like i just said you really can't keep it in a hot environment you can't put it on its side for a long period of time and it's hard to work with on a dabber at least if you like big dabs like using a little needle like this would be so hard even using a scooper like this you really can't get too fat of a dab but looks are deceiving with sauce and sugar in my opinion if you're used to just only dab and shatter and you really haven't experienced sauce or sugar like you really don't realize how fat of a dab you're taking if you just scoop up a giant bit of it but again not all sauce looks exactly like this sometimes sauce looks like a mixture between the two concentrates that just showed you where they have a couple big rocks in there but it's majority that like super small diamond but a lot of companies really aren't that great labeling this stuff i bought some sauce before that was just straight up sugar i've bought some butter before that was sauce there's a little bit of like subjectiveness that comes to it where they're like i mean it's sugar but it's super terpy so let's just call it sauce they do try to label it as accurately as they can so that you can get a good idea for what you're going to consume nobody likes pissed off customers so they try to make it as accurate as they can but i'd be lying if i said i've never had it be a little off but to the people that are new to dabbing and see all these consistencies and get confused and just don't know which one to try i just say try them all it's the best way to find out which one you like and which one you don't and it's like none of these are bad technically so you can try shatter you can try sauce you can try butter and you can see which one you like the best but i say we take one more dab before we head out of here this time i'm not gonna use the diver though personally this is my favorite way to dab sauce hey that's fire now that's the right way to dab sauce a lot of people message me and ask me to like clarify what consistency of concentrate they have it's mostly people that get it from the black market because it's not labeled but i feel like i might start a series where i go from concentrate to concentrate and just kind of show them off let me know if that's something you'd like to see in the comments below but click like if you enjoyed this video if you made it this far you probably did and leave a comment let me know if you want me to make this a series and if so what concentrate should i do next don't say live rosin i already have a whole [ __ ]

this is $75 and you're getting a big scoop of it I'm thinking to myself and that's like eight bucks right there [ __ ] it this video is for mature audience if you're not a mature audience this video is not for you what's up everybody Cubans here and today we are going to get into some rather expensive concentrates I picked up a gram of some hash rosin today that was priced at $75 and it is one of the most expensive grams of concentrate I have ever purchased so let's take a close look at what we got I've had a gram of Summit connoisseurs genetic and concentrates Tiger's milk and this stuff looks like a nice little slab of peanut butter I'm pretty excited pretty excited abot both so you can get a look at the packaging here this is that Tiger's milk and it's testing at about seventy nine percent THC and then it does have a little bit of CBD a in there but you know what I am so excited for this let's just take it down where are my clothes at let's get a nice nice little scoop here out of the email all fresh and clean and I'm gonna see how it does does [Music] um yeah that was really good I'm gonna actually throw that on a courts now I'm gonna throw that around on a few nails and see if we like it but just to compare I picked up some cheap dabs this cost 75 a gram for some hash rasen 75 bucks for this it's pretty expensive most most of my concentrates I usually find deals and get a lot of good looking stuff like this this is some live batter I got for about 15 bucks a gram one-fifth of the price now sometimes I find live sugars live diamonds of batters around that 15 to 20 dollar price if I'm getting it on a deal it's not the everyday price so begin the deal you can get this stuff cheap so it's really interesting to pay five times as much for a single gram of concentrate I can't I can't believe I did it it's still interesting to me that this costs five times as much as this other gram of some delicious looking stuff but some hash rods and it's hard to come by especially here in Colorado Springs it's not super common to find rosin hash rosin so I guess you got to pay that top dollar because it's so rare but let's get some more dabs of this cone I'm not done with this yet let's see what I'm gonna do some cold starts when you know that this is $75 and you get in a big school but I'm thinking to myself and that's like eight bucks right there okay [Music] it's throwing out a couple bucks in that [ __ ] it [ __ ] it and get a little bit more I need about three-fitty oh we got it okay okay just pricey tab right here damn it all right let's get a nice cold start here and see if it's super delicious on the court oh damn well damn okay okay that's good stuff so I just stabbed it a couple of times here and it's pretty good stuff but is it is it worth it is it worth paying five times as much as I do for some good live banner is it worth is it worth paying five times as much to get some solvent once that's basically the major difference is the fact that it's solvent list most concentrates are made with a solvent it's the easier method it's the most common method but with rosin they use heat and pressure to make it so they just basically squish the THC or they squish the extract out of the nugs or out of hash most of the time they'll make a hash and then they'll press the hash and that's what this is this is a this is hash rosin so it's a little bit more expensive and my understanding is the yield is a little bit lower it's it's a process to make the hash and then when you press the hash you wouldn't get the same type of yield as if you were doing like a butane or propane extraction so I think part of the process is it's a little bit harder to get high-quality product and you're typically going to get less with whatever amount of plant material you go into the process with so I think that affects the price it is pretty rare out here in Colorado Springs not a lot of people are pressing - I can find it in a few places some places have rosin and half chosen but it's not as common as BHO and pho and there's so many dispensaries that grow their own bud and they do their own in-house extractions so something like this I can I can pretty much get really cheap any day of the week if I'm looking around so for me to pay five times as much for this it's a little little far-fetched I honestly I'd rather have five grams of this and haven't done but yet and it's just I like volume I like to do a lot of dub so I'm gonna go back and forth on these we're gonna compare I just want to shave this I got this the same day I kick it costs literally one-fifth the price I'm just gonna see if it's if it's it if it's 20% it's good like it doesn't make oh god I just paid so much money but anyway anyway anyway yeah that's that's solid for the price that's sell it for $15 grand look um I I think it's good I think that that the rosin is good I'm gonna dab the rod let me have a bucket that was that was the I don't even know of the other strain is [Music] [Music] I mean it's definitely better [Music] the Robins better smoother and tastes a little better you can't really compare the highs because I'm better than both back for it but it's all about the taste for me and it is smoother is it pay five times the price smoother [Music] I don't think so because it's not it's not five times as good yeah I don't even know how you would get five times as give it something like this this isn't the best this isn't the best cheap batter that I've got but for something to be five times as good as this would be pretty impressive so this is not five times as good probably not worth five times the price if I see it on deals I may get it but I don't think it's worth anything that's worth three times the price two times the price even thirty forty five bucks I get why it costs so much it's a it's a little bit less common not as many people are making it and you get lower yields with it I get why it it costs more but it's not currently it's not at the price point where it's super worth it for me to only buy rosin maybe if I had a press and I could get amazing yields myself but I don't grow and I don't have any interest in growing so it's like I don't have to buy all my nugs anyway to smash it so kind of interesting I like finding deals so maybe I'll get excited about finding a deal in the future but yeah this isn't actually the most expensive gram of concentrate I've ever purchased a few years ago I remember purchasing a I purchased several grams actually a full melt bubble hash that I got remember the dispensary but I got some full melt bubble I think it was about eighty eight bucks a gram I think I remember paying just under ninety a gram it was really really good stuff it was like some of the craziest stuff I ever spent I I gotta go back and look for some pictures of it cuz it was a few years ago those full mount bubble hash grams I got were like pretty good but after I got a mouse this isn't worth eighty eight bucks a gram what the [ __ ] did I just do so I kind of feel that way here what the [ __ ] that I just do but we made a video that's what the [ __ ] we just did so let's do a few more dabs of this [ __ ] might as well I've only taken out several dollars off of it I don't see if we can take several more I'm interested in the cold start here so let's do that [Music] here's a few dollars [Music] yeah this is good stuff still I wish I could afford you dabs well this was actually pretty fun and I'm pretty blessed after all those naps and I'm glad I finally

I say that is because there's a bunch of ways you can do quote-unquote jar tech but the way I like it is to make the material really buttery and really hard so what I do to get that material pretty much all I've done so far is I squish seven grams of flour I put it it got it from the parchment and with my tool and I've put it on to a jar with no lid in between plates and it's out 1:29 and sitting at that for about 10 minutes so I'll come back to you guys and probably about half an hour to an hour once that's a little bit more buttered up so I can whip it and I'll let you guys know what I mean by whipping it then because you can see that's already kinda starting to butter up and that's what we want but we're gonna let it go for about another half hour to an hour so see you guys yep so what I have done here is I've pretty much just taken a little dab tours you can see right there there's now a little bit dirty and I've just stirred this rosin around I noticed that one part was getting really buttery but the rest was staying really runny I actually even noticed that it's trying to build like some sort of I mean try to zoom in there some sort of like little diamonds or like some hard pieces of rosin super-dope but um as you can see it's been whipped now and I'm just gonna put it right back in here this was about half a minute back this was about half an hour in that we whipped it so once again it's just insane out 1:29 it's been in there for about half an hour we just whipped it pretty much stuck a the blossom stick in there and stirred it around mixed it up for about 30 seconds to a minute and then put it right back on the plates and now we're going to sit there for maybe another hour maybe another 30 minutes I'll be back to you guys when that's 1020 minutes from the last video maybe I don't know 30 minutes in - after the whip as you can see we're having very nice crystallization you can see him some big diamonds starting to form we're gonna let this keep going let it keep buttering up and so they could keep doing its thing beautiful we're probably about an hour in since the last video and what I have here pretty much is a very stable a little bit buttery you can see the Terps popping up on top but it's pretty much starting to harden up and as you can see this is that consistently and see I said I wanted from the beginning although I'm still gonna let it go for probably about another half hour or so everyone and how's it going this is pretty much all finished up I started at 11:53 it's now 147 so probably took like a little over two hours I don't know but this is pretty much then the results as I like it this is very hard all of this pretty much puffed up and became very solid like it's all butter and that's how I like my rosin so if you guys don't like it like that you could have left it at the point where it's diamonds or whatever but once again this is just a little tutorial on how I like to do my rosin tag and the kind of results I like to go for kind of things I do and how I do it but yeah guys this is an official tutorial if you guys want any of things I used pretty much all I used was unlocks master unit two heaped up to press the rosin and to heat it up and if you guys want you can use this kind of code yeah I'm stoned and I'll save you guys a bunch of money on these presses or on DeYoung the mini that I used because this is where I made the rosin so I'm yeah if you guys more a mini or alex master you in there like that just discount code yeah I'm stoned one word you guys will be able to save some money at Knox Master Lock yeah guys it's the finished product I hope you enjoyed and thanks for watching", "c9p8j4tiK0Q": "[Music] hey everyone eric here from peer pressure it has been a while since we've gotten a chance to do solventless review really excited to sit down with pyramid today and review their pineapple chunk live rosin pax pod it is great as a quick disclaimer as a part of our protocols we check everyone's temperature and do contact tracing so this interview was conducted without masks just wanted to explain that we're trying to keep everything above board so it's nice and safe for these interviews all right watch on thanks for joining us today i had the pleasure of reviewing pyramids pineapple chunk hybrid solventless rosin pod these pods are 100 hash rosin which makes the flavor profile and effect vastly superior to other ones out there that i've gotten to try the pineapple chunk is a really nice hybrid very middle of the road effect wise and you would expect it to be pretty fruity but in this case we found that it was really hashy when i was smoking it it really reminded me of some old-school bubble hash that we used to put on bolt hoppers so one of the coolest things about these pyramid pods is that they're actually taking advantage of paxpod's smartpod technology which means that when you connect it with the app on your phone it's going to tell you all kinds of cool things about the strain but that it's also got pre-loaded temperature settings right onto it so if you take a small rip it's going to run at a very low temperature preserving your terpenes or if you really want to go for it it can also ramp the temperature up so you can blow a huge cloud overall this technology is really really cool so the color is really nice the effect is not going to put you to sleep it's not going to get you up and excited it's a nice mid-time day high that you can kind of just ride out wherever you're going and like i said before the pineapple notes are pretty minimal what you're really getting in this card or at least what i found was a lovely hashy kind of sweet flavor that came through and just boosted my day it's a nice break from whatever's going on in your day at that moment and it's really easy to consume with these packs of vaporizers eric here with peer pressure really excited to have pyramid on the show we're going to do some intros and then start talking about hash canvas processing everything and then we'll start talking about these products so let's start off with jake tell us a little bit about yourself hey eric thanks for having us today um yeah my name is jake berry i started pyramid with my business partner coley walsh about six years ago now um i moved out here originally from texas after graduating from college and i um started off as a button in the industry um that was my first gig here and i quickly realized that you know what i really want to move into the extraction side of things and we i really saw a niche there that i feel i felt like we could kind of build a brand around now um at that point vape pens were really just getting started and it quickly became one of my favorite ways to smoke as a blood tender and i just saw the growth happening and you know coley was actually my boss at the dispensary and you know talking to him i was like hey why don't we why don't we look into this why don't we why don't we do this you know i feel like i can find the funding for us to do this and get this up and going yeah and um so we did we started looking around for different licenses and back then i mean it was nightmarish to find a new thing um you know to get into the industry was very difficult and [Music] just googling and going through different municipalities web pages i found the city of we ridge it was the second city i called um and asked them about it and it turns out they were having a lottery within 30 days so um it had just been announced and like happenstance it happened to stumble upon it started applying for and doing the application i had never done something like this in my life um and kind of had to quickly figure things out at that point cole and i were both still working at the dispensary while trying to do all this on our days off finished the app got it in and happened to win the lottery and here you are and here we are now that's incredible uh and matt tell us a little bit about yourself uh what got you in the industry and what do you do at pyramid i'm matt cease i'm the lab manager at pyramid i've been there for about a year and a half now i got my start out in the garage my cousin was growing and he just needed somebody to do some extractions unfortunately butane none of that was like an option so it was all just bubble hash and rosin started with a hair straightener and five gallon bubble bags and it's just grown from there wow cool so in your role as the lab manager at pyramid what kinds of extraction and processes do you oversee now supercritical co2 okay all the ethanol post extraction the winterization distillation we run white film and also overseeing all the solvents cool okay and you guys are mainly focused on bubble hash and rosin you guys do any sift we don't do any sift unfortunately we tried to do sift in the beginning but all of our product just kind of came out dark okay so not the way you guys wanted the route we wanted to go okay cool so jake you started as a bud tender now you're running your own company with coley does it look like being the ceo of pyramid put us in your shoes running a cannabis company what does that look like um you know i think a lot of people think it's this super glamorous job and you know it's actually a lot of work um you know i would say both of us um you know we're five years in now and we're both probably averaging 60 to 70 hours a week typically um you know i wake up at 6 00 a.m i am at work no later than 8 30 and i stay till you know six seven sometimes and so it's a very busy um job and uh but it's super rewarding and that's the great part like i go to work every day and i love my job and so i feel like i hit the lottery like the hours don't matter you know it's super enjoyable um but it's just it's also just exciting like everything like my feeling and my favorite part personally is launching these new products you know getting into uh the solventless side of the thing like of the industry was something very interesting for for me to do in launch this is just my favorite like parts of being the ceo is saying you know giving the company a vision and saying look this is where i see us going this is something that i think we want to do and launch you know and not everything works out you know you can definitely have those you know stinkers happen but um the rising line is going well you know it was something that we really wanted to get into and it's going great and similarly to us going into michigan yeah you know so no that's awesome and you know for a follow-up to that you know what are some of the pieces of advice that you would give to someone who wants to be a cannabis business owner you know what what would you offer to someone who's either trying to get into it or is at the very beginning stage you know now you're five years deep you know um don't get intimidated it's a very very intimidating um experience you know i was 23 when i got into the so you're very young yeah i'm 29 now um and it's very intimidating especially if you don't have a lot of that you know experience and background but just be confident and and continue to stay humble throughout the process because you're going to get hit honestly like along the way so just kind of like keep persevering and working hard and you know don't focus on the little things you know there's a lot bigger fish to fry in the day and like if you get caught up on every everything along the way you know it's you're never going to get there so just focus on what on your goal and and keep working towards it and eventually it'll happen well it sounds like you've built a good team around you you know are there any aspects of team building or like you know bringing on the right lab manager to do the work is there anything that's worth mentioning there definitely um the industry is an interesting place to work in um you know there's a lot of bosses out there that you know might not connect with their employees i think um and so it kind of goes back to that being humble part that i was mentioning yeah you know start this and and work hard towards it but build that relationship with the people you work with you know i'm no i'm nobody in this in the grand scheme of things you know like i i'm more showing up to work every day and working and you know i want to hire people that want to come to work every day that are happy and excited and can feel like that they can connect with me more you know they see me working every day yeah so hopefully that inspires them to also come here and work and show up and so hiring the right people is super key yeah but keep that family mentality um and that's something that i learned from my parents you know and like my culture of just keeping that cohesive bond between everybody and so you know i try to say hello to everybody whenever i come to work every day and um and um i would say people should do that you know if they're looking to start something yeah so word of the y's for everyone who's listening uh pay attention to your company culture obviously that can make all the difference honestly it'll make it break you your company culture is so so important um you know like our christmas parties are like my favorite thing to do every single year it's like we play good yeah we play um white elephant and it's just fun it's it's a good time to let loose everybody to just kind of poke from each other and that's the other thing don't take yourself too seriously i really don't take myself too seriously i mean look at my you know joke around with people you know have those experiences and and be be relatable once you think you're better than anybody else you're gonna very easily no longer be able to succeed especially in this industry yeah so no that that's great advice matt you know to shift gears a little bit tell me about what a day in the life looks like of you the lab manager managing all these different processes all these extraction methods and then you know solvent lists at the end of the day being perhaps your top shelf product you know what what is what does a day look like for you it is extremely busy i'll start off by saying that that's true everything has to be done very very particularly like very peculiar with everything that's done cleanliness i mean just that alone takes up a huge part of the day a lot of people don't focus a lot on that but anything that your product touches it gets on your product it's in the end product people are smoking it it's just not good for anybody but the lab starts off you know you turn the lights on you fire up all the machines and it's just making sure that nothing's broken first so like a lot a lot of our equipment's running overnight with a super critical co2 extraction you know matt is constantly like reloading the equipment setting it up for running it and then he has to set up a run for overnight so you know in order to kind of reach our goals and and keep up with the production of all of our sales you know he's got to be on point all day long you know a lot of people think that it's just kind of come to work and get high and hang out and no and that's like ass buster yeah yeah it's unbelievable yeah that's not the industry you know and so um if that's what you think is happening here you know that that's not the case you know everybody who works for a pyramid works incredibly hard and um you know and and we try to keep that environment going for them so we get in the lab turn on the lights make sure everything's still functioning properly and following that it's redoing the process that you did the day before all of it's the most labor-intensive job i think i've ever had i really i have a hard time even describing like where i start and where i end but it's always changing too it's like and there's always a new fire there's a new problem every single day that you have to solve it's like being a detective a mechanic and then a scientist you're definitely not a scientist right away you're not a chemist you come in and it's okay what's broken all right let me pull out the wrenches let me pull out the tools let's fix this machine and then as you're fixing that machine chances are something somewhere else is just not going perfectly so you bounce around the lab constantly it's like a ping pong ball and then introducing solvent list to our line actually kind of let me slow down a lot the process is much more much more connected i would say like actually getting to wash you know you're in touch with everything in tune with everything and then when you get to the rosin press it takes finesse throughout the press isn't something you go up to and go and pull the handle and get beautiful rosin it's actually a lot of finesse a lot a lot of finesse well that's really interesting and you know talking about connecting with the plant connecting with solvent lists you know why did you guys bring solvent lists on in the first place and i i'd love to get both of your perspectives on this i mean i'm sure you were advocating for it as someone who started off doing ice water hash absolutely no it was mainly the quality you can't you can't reach the uh the terpene profile on anything else in my opinion than you can with live rosin it tastes so true to the plant and it brings me back to kind of like the original days when i first started smoking weed it has that real true wheat taste when i smoke some concentrates they almost all taste the same to me a little bit like vho co2 extractions there's slight differences but each strain has the same particular taste to them with live rosin i've noticed it brings out way more of the flavors that you don't originally notice yeah and i would have to agree with him completely there you know i remember when i first started smoking you know a long time time ago now um it was so exciting to like experience the next the next bag the next pickup you know and um and just try something new and fill a different experience yeah and i i i kind of agree with what matt's saying is concentrates you can definitely notice the self differences but i think a lot of it's harder for people to with certain things that you just with rosin especially with live rosin um it's extremely pronounced exactly essentially and i'm immediately pronounced um and you know everything every wash is different and you know and kind of going back to original question you know yeah you know matt was pushing for something you know and coley and i at the same time we're looking for kind of that we wanted that high-end option as part of our portfolio of different things that we offer and um with our relationship with pax and just like our vape experiences we felt like we could really kind of bring something new um and you know we wanted that that option so it was kind of a mixture of you know matt's experience with bubble hash prior to and saying you know this is something that's becoming a thing me kind of realizing that it's on the come up as well and uh saying you know what let's produce this new high-end product um for our consumers so that's awesome and you know when you're thinking about making a solvent-less product as the lab manager what are you trying to look at is it you know intense strain selection are you guys sourcing specific things from your own garden you know walk me through a little bit how you select the strains that you do that you decide to wash and process mostly it's trial and error unfortunately we do small test washes on things if we need to find out what the yields will be and stuff like that from our grow you know we had some really good things like cherry cake wedding cake uh we've been running this pineapple chunk that we were just playing here today was something that that yielded on the really low side unfortunately but the quality of it is just so good that yeah you can't had to go for it you have to yeah and uh yeah and and i guess you know i i do a lot of the sourcing in the material okay you know um and we've attended some of y'all's classes actually and um and and heard advice from you all you know you guys are the experts honestly at the end of the day you guys have been doing this for a long time and that kind of moves our strength selection um to a certain degree and but finding those relationships of those quality growers is difficult you know and so we have a very small grow um and uh our product typically that comes out of there washes really well i think a lot of that's attributed to the growing style and the lights that we use we use three fifteen watt leds we've got flour under them and the turkey profile comes you know at the end of flowers really really good and so um yeah the yields are very low but transferring that flower into rosin um it tends to come through exceptionally without it rises brings the quality up that much higher yeah that's why i personally believe i mean i noticed it on our other extraction methods as well is that um the lights matter so much um you know from outdoor to greenhouse to you know uh hbs lights to um lec's um there's such a unique difference that you kind of noticed from being in the industry for so long um and but otherwise yeah you know i mean we can only provide a little bit amount of what we produce so we've got to go to outside sources and find and make those relationships with different grow facilities that can provide us that high quality material so and when you get some high quality material that jake has said you know hey man we're getting the strain in you know let's go for it how do you guys decide which solidless products you're going to turn it into for example you know we've got pax pods with us we've got some grams of some live rosin you know do you make a determination beforehand of where you want that material to go we just started doing the grams so it's not even we haven't released it to the market yet all right everyone exclusive coming out in the next couple weeks realistically so we're actually going to start running and pressing a lot more than we have been um to release these these grams okay so it's been pods first and now we're getting into grams yes sir cool and how what what does that look like are you guys thinking about pretty much just doing live rosin uh what what does that release look like it'll just just be live rosin um the big thing is we haven't really gotten to do too much testing on making sauces or batters and what we're going to do yet whether it's going to be just a crumble uh it's going to come fresh off the press so we still have to work out some kinks there i'm guessing it probably some r d that went into getting these pens right um yeah absolutely yeah that was a huge struggle i mean figuring all that out and pins are not easy like yeah hey no we can be honest about that and you know i think everyone who's tuned in and watching now you know we're not here to tell everyone that making a rosin pen is something that you can just pick up and do on day one so for the rosin pens specifically what were some of the hurdles that you guys went through to now come out with what is an award-winning product getting everything off the press and out of the bags like washing is super easy doing the rosin press was super easy getting the actual oil into the carts and the pods and getting them to flow correctly and hit correctly was by far the most part like the most difficult part that we had and that's just the viscosity getting you know getting the viscosity i mean as you know when your first comes off the press most of it's still thca so it's going to crystallize it's going to butter up and in order to flow in a cart you need it to be liquid so it has to be de-carbed back into thc and when you're doing that there's just there's a lot of problems that can arise so it took you guys definitely some trial and error uh some missteps but now we're at a point where you guys have a product that it looks like you're super proud of absolutely yeah you know and i i think you know some of the to expound on what matt was saying is the terpene retention you know what do people want out of rosin they want it to taste it's amazing the best product they've ever had closest to the plant yeah getting that right on that post process after the press is so integral to like what we do to make a quality product and i mean that took him long long time to figure it out uh just to keep that terpene retention and then beyond that yeah filling is is a whole different thing this isn't like this you know i can't crank the heat up and pump it in a cart yeah and have it flow well you know and so um there's still trial and error in that you know it's like you gotta it takes a while to really dial it in and um we feel like we've gotten into a pretty good spot right now obviously we release the product but there's always ways we can improve upon our process so i'd love to hear from you matt you know you said that this was one of the first pens that you guys made and it won an award tell us a little bit about the trophy we've got on the table here and what the story is behind that one yeah so this was a face-off og it was actually our very first wash in our new wash machine it was our very first time on the rosin press first time trying to de-carve things into a cart so there was there was a lot of lost face-off og grams yeah i apologize to them but um yeah it's it you know it's a really difficult process but we're here today you know we got everything dialed in yeah that's that's a cool story yeah considering it's our first watch we're i mean we were surprised when it came through you know it was it was something where we were i mean i i think i was pushing that we were in the middle of developing this product and release and we wanted to get it in before um this competition and you know i was you know on the back of matt saying get this going let's go let's go let's let's be let's enter this you know hopefully we'll something good will come out of it and it happened to and it happened to be his first wash which is ridiculous in itself but super happy no that's awesome to see you guys hitting a home run like that tell me a little bit about your relationship with pax you know we've got some products here you guys are putting your rosin pens in pax pods uh walk me through that sure um so we've been a pax partner for i think going on two years now two and a half years um and we launched with obviously our other products and pax you know provides the hardware provides the battery you know the actual pod system but you know everything that's inside of that you're smoking is is directly from us or any of the other partners that are on the platform um we there was no rosin on that platform at all and that's where we really saw like a good way to to get in and you know we wanted to launch this so this is actually the first rosin pod packs anything um in in the market in colorado no just in nature nationwide yeah this is the first rosin pax pod that you can consume very cool um and so we saw that kind of that lane that we wanted to get into that we kind of went along with our goal of you know having a really high end product that we could sell and we figured pairing it with like our packs you know distributorship was a really good move and so that's kind of how we got there um but yeah you know these things aren't the same either you know like a 510 cart is much different than a pack spot and we have different feeling techniques for each of those options um and so there's a lot of r d on that back end too that like our production manager aaron really had to play around with to figure out how to make these work well you know you don't want someone to get a product to try it and not work and so figuring that out was was difficult yeah so you and aaron were working hard to bring these products here today all right so we've got pineapple chunk rosin on deck both in live rosin pax pod form as well as grams uh how did this strain fall into your hands it starts off in house with our grow and then i hand select the nugs that we're going to use to wash we hand wash i don't advise anybody to use a drill in a paddle it's just just don't do it it's not worth it it's going to waste your time following that we throw them in a two and a half well actually we from there we select which trichomes are going to be the best to press you don't want to just i mean you can mix all of your all of your bubble hash selections together but you're not going to get the greatest quality that you could by selecting which trichomes are better which in this case was the 90 to 120 micron range following that selection they go in the freeze dryer we freeze dry them yeah and then we load them up in two and a half by nine pure pressure bags set them on the peer pressure pike's peak version yeah and we press it around 180 185 degrees i like to press until the oil will start to darken up or pretty much you can tell by as you're adding pressure you'll see possibly the oil darkening up a little bit i like to stop right around that point yeah and that's a lot of trial and error though i mean yeah it varies honestly not even from strange terrain each press will vary like i said it's a lot of finesse when you're working the press it's not something you just pull the handle and you get your perfect oil but so there's some trial and error there you know as far as the grow since you know we talk so much about growing and how important that obviously is for all forms of extraction but especially solventless tell me a little bit about your grow and you know how you guys got a product this good yeah so um all the genetics we've gotten have been from growers around uh colorado um we fl we we grow in a deep water culture system so we use a current culture system um and then we fly under 351 lec's we really feel like the end product while you might not get as big of yields like you know bigger buds we definitely get a higher quality product like in our wash specifically or in our extracts because we don't really sell any weight um all of it goes right into our process um so we either process it into our you know distillates or we process it into our co2 oil or now a lot of it's going right to fresh frozen so um you know the harvest is very very important really knowing what you're doing there is it is key to making the wash go well um you want to harvest right away you know a lot of people think that oh it's okay to you know buck these buds and let them sit here while i finish this harvest no you want to go very very quickly and go um on a plant my plant basis almost um you know you really don't want them to be sitting around for any more than 20 30 minutes so wow so it's a quick d fan um you know all right in the stock and then you buck the buds very quickly um everything we cure is in turkey bags typically and that's kind of what we do for our fresh resin as well so you know pluck buck bag and throw it in the freezer immediately it's very important um to not get too much water cotton content because it definitely will affect the wash on the back end oh so you guys have it nailed down that was almost like a little limerick i i like that so we've got pineapple chunk with us what are some strains that you guys like to smoke start with you matt i've got a weird palette personally one of my favorites right now is mandarin dreams i absolutely love that strange i mean it just sounds nice i also love bananas anything with banana in it is always a go-to for me and then cheese bio cheese any kind of cheese uk cheese i love cheese cheese okay cheesy terms i can't get enough cheese that's awesome what about you uh you know i'm big on the cheese game too um cheese quake is like one of my favorite strains ever um i haven't seen her around in a long time um i don't know how little washes we haven't gotten a chance to watch something like that but i also really like a lot of sub cool genetics personally um so like space queen is amazing crossed with anything jelly bean nine pound hammer jelly beans my favorites hands down yeah and um that's one strain that i really want to wash um and so that'll be coming in the pipeline too awesome so that's kind of yeah that's my favorite strain we're gonna do it at some point okay okay that's right i think you get a decision in there you know i would also love to learn you know before we right before we get into the review here you know let's wrap this up with tell me a little bit about what does pyramid stand for like what are your guys's philosophies um you know it's a very difficult question especially put into words um you know when coley and i started out we you know we were just trying to to get get things going and you know it was really hard to to kind of figure out what we wanted to stand for as a company and you know i think the biggest thing that kind of we look for and and that we want like our message to be is we just want to be a good place to work you know i feel like a lot of people are very unsatisfied in their life and and we want people to enjoy coming to work with us you know not for us but with us on this and so you know beyond that um you know personally like i really like um kind of able to you know expand upon my heritage and and show that you know minorities can be successful in this space um and uh and so i think that's something that we really have going for us there is um anybody can can get into this you know it doesn't have to be one person the other so you know we really are interested in in working with communities of color yeah um and you know that's kind of one of the big things we're doing in michigan specifically we're working in a um kind of a lower income area and bring jobs bring jobs to those areas you know bring business back into these areas that have you know over time have have gotten the shorten the stick here um and so you know i i wouldn't say we have a you know i'm not the marketing guy who's gonna tell you this is our philosophy this is our mantra sure i think it's more of just like inside of us yeah this is kind of who we are as people and we want this to come through on our business side as well so yeah that i mean that's a great explanation jake walk me through what do we have on the table here uh and what are we gonna review so today we are going to review our um pineapple chunk live rosin pods um we don't have a rate today so we'll kind of just let you guys look at bigger hams um and then we're also going to kind of show you guys the newest tech coming out of packs that a lot of people have not experienced or seen yet cool um and so i'll kind of review through that real quick okay yeah please show me break it out um all right so you know pax right now um just released this product it is the pax era pro they've added a lot of really cool tech into this product that is is very new uh i love the packaging to start off with yeah and then honestly the feel of it is is it's it's really premium you know i think pax really wants to be that apple of um of uh vaporizers and i think magnetic lid yeah all right they've put uh they've put some thought into this okay and even there you know yeah shows yeah very well thought out packaging um i really like the new finish on the actual product um and they've done a lot of different things with it now so you actually get some color options which didn't exist before okay um so we've got silver we've got a red a jade and a traditional black i like the silver a lot nice um very clean yep so they've added usbc um charging to so they've kind of upgraded the charging it's fast charged so um throw it in your car you know or you take it out to a hike and it's not ready it's gonna be ready weight is almost nothing which is very cool very cool um and some of the features they've added to it are really nice um they have the traditional child proof usage on here you know you connect it to your phone yeah and it's going to be child proof so your kid can't can't mess with it which i think is a really awesome feature for a lot of people totally um and then some of the what i really like though is that so if you look at all of our pods you really wouldn't really notice it let's crack one of these up real quick please i was hoping we might um okay so yeah so this is our packaging so we really wanted to go with a more um hash head feel to it yeah if you you know we want it to be we really like our packaging to look fun yeah and that's kind of the direction we're going with a lot of things and so we wanted to kind of give you that rosin feel to it that that fresh press and that's kind of how we came up with this yeah with the director this it's very different for us um and so inside the child proof packaging you'll find a a pot obviously pull it out check it out all right and now you are saying child proof often i want to make sure just pop this baby right in there oh it's vibrating and lighting up so no it knows yeah that's another cool feature is the haptic feedback um so you know you plug it into your new era pro and it will vibrate you know like hey this is this is so is this primed and ready to go is there anything else i need to do here uh no go for it okay cool these are very childhood yeah good you guys you guys got your packaging down and you know as a marketing person i'm i'm very appreciative of aesthetics and uh this this got some to spare so you can definitely take a hit um there's three different settings that we load on these pods so these pods are actually smart pods now so tell me what does that mean smart pod okay so in-house so we what we do is you know we fill the pod and then we tag them okay so whenever you buy a new pod it'll have this red band around it when you pull it into your air pro and you have your app on your phone it'll literally show you like this is a pyramid pod so it'll have our logo okay we'll get the description of the strain it'll tell you the potencies so you know that's one thing that i hate about you know our 510 carts is like you forget what you're smoking a lot of the time so you know we have it engraved on the pod but also when you plug it in it's going to give you description of the strain um and then beyond that um we have an expert temp that we set it to and then you also have a load temp automatically set in a high temp so if you really want that high vapor production with you don't care too much about the turbine preservation yeah you can bump it'll bump up automatically or you can set to like our typical temperature so where am i at right now um you know i think you're probably right in the middle okay realistically because voltage obviously very important part of getting a good grip with a solventless pen specifically and usually lower voltage lower temperature you know if i'm going to spend the money to really get a premium vape i'm not just trying to cook all my terps well i think that's a huge benefit to the pax platform is that you know if you're you know if you're that hashtag and you're looking for that really high quality product using a 510 card is usually not gonna get you there um unless you're using a very expensive battery to get there yeah where this really allows you to dial in your high um and dial in the experience you want to get you know we can take it really low and you're going to get that really good flavor almost like a dry vape yeah um but you're not going to get that that that big cloud so typically i like to pump it up a little bit okay um to get that experience right away well i've sat and heard so much about this strain let's [Music] hmm that's really good i mean it it's interesting because with a vape sometimes you never kind of know what you're gonna get and there's a lot of information there's a lot of education and you know especially with the vape crisis that was you know in full swing last year like having a real nice solvent-less vape like this i i really like the experience especially the rosin experience um out of this i mean it's really hard to replicate a true dab in vape form i think that's what what people criticize vape a lot for yeah people want the convenience especially the purists the purest yeah you know they kind of hate on vape a lot and we're really trying to get these p get those individuals who want that high quality product yeah onto a vaporizing platform and that's what our raw our live rosin pods do especially on the pax platform yeah you know just kind of taking this experience in you know it's it's fruity but it's also got something else behind it like it's very smooth and sometimes some of the really high terpene fruit strains that they're not quite as smooth as what i'm getting in this and you know kind of as it's starting to settle in a little bit and i know you know i didn't blow some monster cloud for everyone on the camera but just you know really enjoying you know having a fine vape it you know for me when i consume it it's not always just about flexing on our video it's about really just having an experience with the products itself um yeah it's great i mean honestly this is the closest you're gonna get to a dab in a vape form um no [ __ ] um i don't know if they can say that but no [ __ ] it's um we could square on our youtube channel this is for adults uh and um it's really good and i i this is pretty much all i smoke now honestly on our platform is our rosin line yeah um just because i think the flavor profile is unmatched among vaporizers and um it's always interesting to try something new yeah so well if i could describe you know after taking a couple hits some real small ones some bigger ones i mean it's fruity i get a little taste of pineapple in there there's almost something in there that is a little more savory and i'm having a hard time putting my finger on it but there's there it it's a strain that's got some depth and i like that um and as far as like the actual experience goes of using this it's it's very seamless um i'm a big fan pineapple trunk great choice on this one you guys uh i just want to smoke this all day this is a tough one well i'm glad you like it you know um we'll definitely get you some samples of some other strains to enjoy and um yeah i'm really glad you're experiencing having a good experience this is a great product thank you guys so much for coming in uh you know the review today obviously the

little savory it has this quality to it that's a little hard to put my finger on but it's a strain that just has these hash overtones mixed with that pineapple that fruit and that's a stray that's a type that i really like uh just that hashy flavor on the exhale it's a good smoke it's a smooth smooth rip the pax is sweet i hadn't seen that pen before all in all great product and they're 50 in

to get all of our new videos solventless education and more see you later guys [Music] you", "ZLzvApa7uOI": "hi guys welcome back to my channel so today we're going to be talking about the baker's dozen this is the frozen this is the frozen I should say that most of the violin is professional violinist are you know looking to buy it and honestly you guys it's it's impossible nearly impossible to get it especially these days so yeah let me talk you through this I have two kinds of the baker's resin I'll give you possibly all the information I have and yeah let's start it alright so I was able to get this resin after waiting for nearly two or three years on the waiting list I was able to get it to roughly a year ago so I have been using it for yeah for pretty much like a year or so as I can really give you my honest opinion I do have two kinds he makes two kinds Rosen's this is the original which has like a purple kind of a brownish stamp and then the green stamp this is the the French version so this is more Italian I'll say he described it as a original Cremonese recipe and this is more after French which is the V own he call it V own sea trout or something like that so there by the way they are made in England and this is a very bakers is a very small company that it's owned by you know it's a family-owned company and basically they make this resin once a year they described on their website during the hottest months on it assume it's during the summer this is where they can get the best fresh sucks you know from the trees and they basically cook it right away the port or fresh so this is like probably the only one in the world that makes a company that makes resin - fresh from like a fresh liquid SAP so the resins Kames beautifully packaged you know they also included like like a little piece of paper which looks like a very kind of old paper with the information about each rosin and I thought it was really really cute looking obviously they were all sealed nicely so the first resin that comes with this kind of a brownish a little stamp and so take a wax stamp would be you know on the top four bakers so the first one is the original and obviously on those Scrolls you have a little information about the rosin so I'm just gonna quickly read a couple of info because I think it's quite helpful to know so the Baker's original is a hundred percent a handmade based on an authentic Ramona recipe dating back to the time of Paganini so you know he claims this is the original recipe recipe and unlike many products this rosin is made from a fresh liquid SAP so if you're not familiar with the resins like usually resins you know that whoever makes the resin the resin makers they buy a SAP which is comes in the solid and then they kind of melt and you know two older magic and they make the resin so baker's resin is made of the liquid SAP so he's basically doing right away so you know the this obviously is resulting in a superior resin and fresh or product so it's a hundred percent natural and the highest quiet quality you can imagine so the reason this resin you guys is so difficult to to get and so hard to get is basically it's because it's a seasonal product and they can just only make so many of that resin and I believe they put you once you get it they put you on the list and I believe you can buy it every two years they send you email you know here's your fresh frozen would you like to buy it as far as I know you guys I'm gonna leave his website down below anyway but as far as I know the list the website is like closed for a new customer I know it's not gonna be really helpful but you know you can you know look into it for the future and see you know maybe they won't reopen the new customer list and you know hopefully you can get on it but ya expect to wait a couple of years because you know like I said I waited a few years for this rosin so anyway so this is the original rosin and it's beautiful you guys I mean look at this eye you can obviously tell that I use it quite a bit during this past year so this has this original Rosa has like a little like kind of like an ember you know outside color so it's a little bit darker than the young rosin so this is the original the second recipe comes with the same packaging but it has a little bit like a green kind of a wax stamp again with the letter B on top this resin in accordance to his information this is the Baker's young Citroen is created but hint from a traditional French recipe which was popular a wonder Lyon was alive so again it's made of the fresh liquid SAP and yep in this result this resin is highly reactive to players input and capable of a broad range of tonal variations so this rosin is lighter in color as you can see from the original one so this is the French recipe and the other one is what Paganini was Italian so Cremona I guess it's Italian recipe so this is this is basically the only two resins you can get from him this is what he specialized in so before I will tell you what I think about those resins I did record a little sound sample and just I'm gonna insert it now so you can go ahead and listen and just think about it like can you hear the difference alright so you can see both of them and just tell me if you can hear the difference [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] so could you hear a difference because I couldn't if I listen to this recording to me it sounds exactly the same I did use two different bells they were all clean so I had a fresh you know rosin on on each of the bows now I even when I play it you guys I couldn't tell much of the difference between one and the other formula maybe I like the original a little bit better than the French recipe but there is really very little difference and honestly it all is gonna come down to your personal preference okay now let me talk about the price a little bit because knowing that this is so hard to find you would think that this resin is gonna cost a fortune because if you're familiar with the curent resins they're on the market some of them can be extremely extremely expensive and to my surprise a year ago I paid about $25 for each US dollars for each resins that cost me $50 or something like that $50 for two Rosen's I think it's extremely inexpensive considering how much work you know he put into it so the price point of this rosin is just there it's perfect like I mentioned my personal preference if I will have to choose for life just one I probably would go with the original and then this would be my second choice but honestly you guys those two are equally equally very very good resins I would agree with the claims that has a very low low dust you know which is good especially for those who are allergic those people who are allergic you know even when you rosin about you know there's very little rosin dust coming out and also very little rosin dust is accumulating on top of the violin which is good these are super smooth you know very but they can be quite crispy if you need to you know it's it's obviously depend of your technical abilities of your you know obviously your right hand has a lot to do you know with that articulation but I found this roses to be really really good I have no any complaints whatsoever the question is is this resin the best rosin in the world considering the fact how difficult is to get and you know although obviously all the claims I don't know if this is the best or is this as the only one because I own quite a few resins you guys and I compare this resin to my other resins and honestly I think they are all beautiful you know and I'm talking about you know more expensive resins you know let's say the leather bespoke rosin from Australia that cost twice as much probably as this or even more and yeah I feel like that rosin is equally as amazing as this so it's very hard to tell you guys I'm just being completely honest with you so if I'll have to you know just choose one rosin for life I don't have extremely hard time because and I'm by the way I'm gonna do the video if you want me to do it give it a thumbs up on my top top five favorite resins let me know if you wanna hear that video so um yeah I think at the end of the day all of it comes to your personal preference what do you like there even you guys I'm getting so kind of picky because for certain pieces for certain about I'll use it different resins so I'm talking about like I'm going to the next level this is not necessary because I feel like one one of those rosin would be perfect for you know playing any piece yeah is this the only one is this the best yes and no I mean it's your personal preference it's exactly what you like exactly what you believe in exactly what it sounds good to you how much a good sound you can take out of this you know how much the rosin is really helping you with creating a beautiful sound articulation and all of it so I think it's a really personal preference at the end of the day and I would highly recommend to get it if you can if you can be lucky enough to get this yes go for it try it for yourself especially that it's not you know that expensive and you're not gonna be disappointed for sure but at the same time I don't want you to feel that you must have this rosin because this is the only resin that you're gonna be happy and satisfied with so there we go yeah I'm pretty sure you can buy you know different resins and be equally happy and satisfied you know using this so there we go guys so this is exactly what I think about this no complaints whatsoever it's a beautiful resin I will leave mr. Baker's website down below although I read just recently he's not taking any new customer so I'm sorry for that you guys but if you do get a chance to get you know this resin just try it it doesn't hurt it's a great resin and I'm sure you're gonna be very happy alright guys thank you so much for watching if you're new to my channel don't forget to subscribe give it a thumbs up if you like this video and also give me a thumbs up if you want me to do my top four top five you know favorite rosen's so yeah let me know if you have any questions and I'll duck take some bite", "enz-OhEF6lA": "[Applause] [Music] uh [Music] i just picked up randy uh he's going to get a new bong because he's self-conscious about his dirty ass i'll just show you guys what i am embarrassed to like actually put this on but uh he said he wants to get a bong so i'm gonna take him to get a bung but the point of this video is this dollar dab i bought this a week ago still haven't done a video on it and uh hopefully i could split this in two depending on the size so i want to give him one as well but in my opinion to get the full effect you should do the whole thing that's what i was thinking yeah we'll see we'll see because it kind of it feels like it has some weight so we'll see we'll see we got rj we got rj subscribe to him if you haven't already he just got done doing a video yesterday with his cousin so it should be a good one whenever he does decide to pick it up he brought the forbidden fruit as well you know you've probably seen the video where we uh went and picked it up already fire stuff but yeah whatever i just gotta say man i hope you guys are enjoying your week um i have not been releasing as many videos as you guys do see uh but man there's a lot of reasons i don't want to digress into that right now but i hope you guys are patient with me and i am 25 so plenty of time yep so let's do it baby all right boys we are back showing what you got you know i'm saying a little a little uh what is it detachable one oh damn that noise oh dangerous let me put up here yeah you could switch it so you can go here oh it's in there oh whoa okay so it's a switchable beaker bung so you could hit it like a normal beaker bong or you could switch it off put that here put that there i think i like it this way it's like a science project right here so it's like you know homie's got to put some water in that yeah we got a new ball yep let's go baby yeah and also uh the homie picked up another one of these from that video uh the night the dispensary run the jetties yes the jetties uh legend legendary sky og sky og take a hit of this so yeah man i was about to get this rick and morty mom i'm not even a fan of rick and morty but i just saw the design on it it was for 35 bucks luckily i had the second greatest person here with me you know i'm saying no i'm just joking now but luckily andrew was there and he pointed out some other bombs you know for better price and not even that better design like on the bong itself so like i said this is only one dab so if it's not enough for me and randy to take we're gonna be taking other dabs alongside you know this video as well or in this video but the whole point of this video is to showcase this one dollar dab that i got from finos exactly a dollar out the door so oh nice let's see the functionality i'm gonna need more water so definitely gonna have a good time getting hot tonight as i play video games right here hold this all right how do you let me do this i'm uh i'm gonna showcase it hold up open it all right go so the strain is sour sandia uh the brand is bloom or something what is that boom or is it say here right there it's on the text bloom oil here boom something whatever i think it's the papers got it all messed up it's cool yeah i don't really care bloomfy bloomfire something bloomfire boom fire bloomfire something okay let's loom field you think yeah you're right okay yeah all right open it let's see what this looks like i'm excited to see what this looks like guys [ __ ] little dollar dad okay so i had this plastic i don't even know just twist that [ __ ] up feels like a fat rocks in there push down and turn oh there you go put pour on your hand the [ __ ] is that so we got one dollar dab you guys [Laughter] that's literally a one dollar debt okay this is for people who uh don't smoke as much i assume put the thing in there so i could prefer a thumbnail do you want to get better lighting what do you think this [ __ ] sun's [ __ ] is good here we go the [ __ ] is this there you go baby

this is for more it's glass huh is this glass i think you just toss the whole thing in there yeah really i think so i'm just joking i don't know you don't burn all that that's [ __ ] plastic honey it's plastic that little rubber thing no not that or is there a read me i wonder if it's fire it's batter so you think you just put it in there you just i don't think you put all this in there no no

light this for me yeah here i'm gonna put this back on so yeah it's not over i know i know so uh randy's gonna heat that up for me i'm gonna take this hit but yeah it pretty much looks like just one hit that's kind of lame to be honest you know you can't just grab it like that yeah here we go yeah my [ __ ] finger slime so uh i am gonna drop this in here but it is [ __ ] hot as [ __ ] so let's just cool it off a little bit you know if you want me to hold it for the camera for you or just leave it oh yeah yeah hold the hole hopefully it's the lighting i'll find out right now oh yeah i have to put it back yeah all right just this one yeah turn up the iso it's not bad let me see i already should not touch screen right so [ __ ] i'm scared all right ready [Music] it is you just drop it in there but uh we don't have a carb cap guys so we couldn't enjoy it as much but i definitely got a good hit man as you can see right here oh i wish i had a carb cap though but yeah that's really really cool that they did this yeah i feel like we should do that again with the car cab it's better at the end of the day batter can only go so far and when it cramps to like taste and stuff it probably wasn't going to get me too high but the idea of a one dab uh one dollar dab how are we going to get this out this is 12. that's cool dropping it yeah i can see that's becoming a thing i really can probably for people who are like just really interested in dabbing and don't know it's like if you have if you're if you have like a dollar at laying around why not right it's a it's a weird experience but it's cool yeah can you blow it out there hella higher because this is what i'm gonna do oh check this off watch out for the water though hold this here thank you for saying that boom oh crap it wasn't gonna go out today you know what i'm saying we're turning to the ground and i'm saying just like the sand it was before time i was gonna clean this this is mine it's cool so uh burn

but dummy no i'm saying we're gonna take some dabs here and then we're probably gonna end the video here just uh a quick one i just wanted to showcase the dollar dab that was just the main focus of this video and honestly it was uh not bad at the end of the day it was only a dollar you know and if you don't want to tip your butt tender because he or she was an ass or not giving you the good [ __ ] spending on that instead of giving it a dollar to them you know i'm saying i don't know just some stuff to try out but look at all that remaining it was definitely a lot for a dollar with that you can see that's a all the excess stuff burning yeah we don't have a car kit huh huh we don't have a car kit we're [ __ ] what if we use this just kind of like oh yeah you can yeah right yeah i don't

so we're going to be squashing there's like three different strains in here this nice keef nice pile of that we'll be squashing this at 170 degrees you want to wind strong said five times [Music] is should be a nice gusher of course you want to go low and slow on this too we'll double bag it awesome get a little bit of extra peg protection we got it all loaded up there double bagged all right as i said 170 on the press there [Music] and now we're gonna lower it down just to let it let the plates hit and of course we'll let it sit there for about about 25 seconds a little longer just to let it let it working cause that bag is kind of full it's been 25 seconds we're gonna add a little bit more pressure to it you don't want to over press this you don't want to press it real fast and heavy because you will have blowouts a lot of times if you do that so you want to nice and slow just you know feel it as you uh apply pressure if it's easy once it starts get a lot more rough pressure to it let it sit there and let that heat loosen it up a little more so it's kind of low and slow all right so we're starting to get it coming out on this this side right here so it should be coming out here a little bit more pressure all right so now we have it coming out right here down both right there and there all over there strictly i grade [Music] all the time all right we're gonna go ahead and pull this one because you know what if there's still rosin left in there we can still squash that bag again new strain news flash got the best grass got to take two and pass by no means average good god i got to have it babies are perfect and like the way you dream less smoke with friends uncle stone i like the way you dream it's yo dabbity we're gonna dab it dab it up we like the way you trim it this is a nice shield nice squash here yo dabbity we gonna dab it and of course you see there's still some stuff left in that bag so we will definitely squash that one more time all right this is uncle stone many blessings peace out my two favorite parts after squashing and making some beautiful rosin first one is gathering it so so [Applause] so as i said this was a nice yield of three different kinds of teeth no this i know there's definitely vanilla cush is one of the strains that was in this all right it's getting close to my second favorite part of this process that's nice all right now the fun part the sampling of it we like the way you trim it yo dabbity [Music] uncle love the way you dab so freak what they heard monster kong marketing", "4WqaQPE_M9c": "Wister the YouTube chef voice I'd like coming through with another quick video for today man today I'm gonna be giving you guys a little bit of info on the 710 labs list so makes you guys we're coming if he knew hit that subscribe button for your boy and make sure you dab what's the deal boys y'all already know what's happening man I'm coming back with another quick video me give you a little bit of information about what's going on here so as you guys can see I got my delivery from the list this right here came from 7-10 labs personally they hand-delivered me this package full of bomb ass extracts and whatever else I ordered that you guys are must take a look up right now what is the list how do you get on the list where is the list man it sucked because actually the list is currently only available in California now the list was made for only friends family and true OGS of the 710 community you can go to 710 labs.com and find out how you can apply for the list sometimes it's open sometimes it's closed with 710 labs actually does is put some of their best production of every month to the side for people who are on the list if you're on that list then you pretty much get dibs before any dispensary in California that's supposed to get their supply for the month or whatever so once you get on that list you have first dibs on all the stuff that 710 labs made for that month on a certain day of every month 710 labs is gonna email you a link and the password you use that password to sign in on the website that they sing you and then there goes the whole list of everything for that month you have to be careful because whatever you pick and you purchase you cannot change you have to spend the minimum of $300 and the maximum is whatever your tolerances for recreational use the max that can deliver is 8 grams of concentrates so you can only get 8 grams of rosin or you know dabs or whatever if you're a medical user that you can actually get up to 50 grams and the same goes for the flower if your recreational user that you can only pick up one ounce of flower twenty eight point five grams and if you're a medical users you can actually pick up eight ounces of flour so that's pretty fired they actually delivering a lot of cities up in Northern California and here in Southern Californians they deliver in a couple cities as well so that's gonna do the basics of the list let's get right into the package as you can see they delivered it in this nice sick ass bag labeled 7/10 Labs has 710 labs on both sides and you can actually take the bag apart if you would like to or you can just keep it together and you know rock it like a little duffel bag and on the side right here has the perfect note that this got a 710 labs booklet and you actually got this handwritten note so it's gonna be a handwritten note with your name on it big old paragraph talking about yeah you get it what's the dilly it's very dope you told me I'll [ __ ] with that how they just write you a note and [ __ ] with your order that's pretty sick that's like a lot of love so as you can see you got two zippers right here we're just gonna zip them fangs openness in this inside you might want to check all the compartments cuz you know how smokers get man they end up putting joints all in the cutting [ __ ] but uh yes so here you got ice packs this is gonna be a 710 labs ice pack which is pretty [ __ ] sick yes and then you have all your rosin or whatever that's you ordered you have your whole order in here if you got flour that I'm pretty sure the flour being here to anchor no flour on this order and sometimes they give you goodies and [ __ ] so sometimes you might have like a pair of socks or a t-shirt or whatever they're giving out for the month you might have something special you might have some couple of joints like you never know so just check the whole compartment and as you can see man I put in a pretty nice order because the prices are ridiculous I mean wholesale you're paying forty-five fifty dollars for a gram I mean you can't get this quality anywhere for this price usually I go half with my homie he'll get like two hundred dollars worth of things I got like $100 worth of things argue like 150 he'll get 150 or whatever the cases and then you film it'll be easier on both of us and get some high quality [ __ ] for the good price and we can still be on the list because if you actually don't order if you start like skipping your orders and like not ordering anything because the minimum is too high or whatever or whatever your case is like you're on vacation or whatever the cases if you keep missing out on making the orders and they're gonna cancel you from the list so you guys got to keep placing the orders I mean they do it at a very good time I would say it's pretty convenient like monthly it's not like every week or every two weeks you gotta put in $300 so um it's really like right around the time you got a smoke if you just save all your money and then make the order then that order should last you for like the whole month or until next time you have to order you'll probably even have some [ __ ] left over so I think it's really convenient especially if you have a buddy that's really interested in these products or whatever just interested in high quality [ __ ] and I want some new [ __ ] they can put it in the order they got all type of [ __ ] as you can see from [ __ ] dabs rosin bunting BHO they got joints they got dad pins like they got the high quality spires if they got the high [ __ ] bomb-diggity flour they got everything but um I only got Rosalyn because right now they didn't have anything on the list that spiked flour and they have any flour on the list all they had was rosin and dabs and joints but uh yeah maybe next time I'll get some flour this is what I picked up man I picked up some Munson number 58 I picked up some [ __ ] called the loot it's gonna be a Percy live rosin another Percy live Rosalind called greasemonkey number 15 times bootylicious number 1 I picked up a regular live rosin another month's in 58 some of these are gonna be doubles because where they're like 45 bucks each so it was like why not I got the live rosin and sour tangi times bootylicious whoo that was like another what $45 one sour tangi bootylicious again I'm telling you the Lemonheads number four so you get a good make sure you get a chain you get to change it up and [ __ ] and then you get to you know pay a really good price so the booklet man you got a couple of Snickers I believe up in here oh they give you your receipt as well and then they just show you how to smoke this [ __ ] the right way so you got the weed instructions you got all the rosin and dad and live Persis and different types of [ __ ] that they make these got the instructions behind them and stuff so I really respect that they put a lot of love and hard work into the [ __ ] versus people who just give you a box of weed or whatever like yes that's what that is like they actually care what they're doing with their [ __ ] so that's pretty tight you know I'm pretty happy I made the list so that's pretty much it man you film you got your [ __ ] you got on the list you got your [ __ ] you pay cash and then that's it they come they pull up they text you they're like yo you want us to come at this time or this time and you blow yeah come at this time they'd like alright then and actually come right on time too and they keep this [ __ ] in good condition though it's cold it's frozen it's ready to go in the freezer or in the fridge or whatever it's ready to get smoked I really [ __ ] with that so man that delivery service is a [ __ ] one anybody on the list make sure you hop on that damn list boy I know y'all enjoying that [ __ ] because this shouldve sick as hell you got the bag you got the ice packs there's nothing I can really say man but if you guys mention his video I appreciate y'all for watching guys we're coming if you knew hey that subscribe button for ya boy it makes you get to an incident excellency [Music]", "HjVnvEy-IkA": "what is going on welcome back to the I smoke Channel and another cannabis inspired video with me your host Tyler Greene today we're going to be covering diamonds and sauce versus shatter two forms of cannabis extract but what is the difference and how in fact are they similar those are the questions that we are going to be answering in today's video remember to hit that like and subscribe button if you are feeling these videos that helps us grow rich even more people and get our message out there so without further adieu let's talk diamonds and shatter I've got my Chuck B glass piece originating in the USA for today's video it's getting out of the Pelle case so I can show you what it looks like oh yes and we are gonna fill it with water you ready and here we go we are ready to kick off the video let's put this pillowcase away the old one 120 Pelle case what you need if you're traveling with your glass let's talk about the difference between shatter and diamonds and sauce we're gonna start with the most familiar form of extract that you've probably come across for ready it is shatter and this has been on the market since at least a few years ago but all the way people have been extracting cannabis going back to the last century recently shatter has become a much bigger thing lead partially due to the advent of medical legalization and recreational legalization in the States that is where this was first super popular and now extracts come in this form so what does she look like shatter can have different coloration but is generally gonna look a bit more stable than other forms of cannabis extract when you get shatter you will know it is shatter because it will literally shatter when you break it you can see from the way that it breaks although some of it may potentially be a little bit more sticky but basically shatter looks like this this is some lovely mimosa shatter we got beer 710 this is what shatter should look like if it is clean it might come in a different color look at the consistency look at the sort of golden hue and just just look at it guys you can see that that is some nice-looking chatter if it's tiny or if it has got too much chlorophyll or aged plant material eg trimming it it might be darker and you might see shatter that's like really dark almost black looking I wouldn't really want to dab that anymore but have done in the past how does it differ to diamonds and sauce well let's take you through what diamonds and silks of Diamonds themselves are almost pure THC a crystals basically 99 point something percent tetrahydrocannabinol where is the source is a mixture of Turks some cannabinoids and the flavonoids giving it this lovely rich flavor profile not being an extractor I don't know too much about the process of creating diamonds in source but the source is a really Turkey volatile cannabis extract that is on the other side of the spectrum to something like shatter shatter has a really nice stability to it although it may degrade into a more waxy like substance over time particularly when not refrigerated as those turps cannabinoids flavonoids begin to break down into a delicious extract soup that's when you'll see shatter waxing up diamonds and sauce basically is like honey sort of looking liquid the diamonds are the crystallization of that so that could happen when the extract has been left in a pressurized compartment over time it begins to crystallize and over the last few years the process has been honed and developed until we start seeing big thca crystals that look like rocks basically and that is diamonds and source I really like the flavor profile you get on this I think it's very hard to replicate the diamonds and sauce flavor profile in shatter or even in fact in other forms of cannabis extracts the more stable something is the less in my experience is the flavor some exploded in my mouth you know a lot whether it's with the Diamonds and sauces so volatile goes turps something which is unparalleled so this is some lemon skittles diamonds and sauce you might be familiar with the skittles strain skittles with that is a really popular Cali import strain lemon skills in their skills cross and this is the diamonds and source of that straight away I can tell you that out the to extract this one smells really nice this one smells about ten times nicer you get a little bit of the aroma with the shatter but with the diamonds and sauce it is really really stinky in a really lovely way for the lemon citrus the skills sweetness you know that fruity pebbles types or a sweetness I've got both of them in front of me I can smell this one and I can't smell this one diamonds and sauce is going to smell a bit stronger because of the volatile nature of the extract you know it's lighter pea sauce shatters a little bit more stable than that stability means that you can pick it up with your hand as you see with this shutter I can just pick it up and hold it and that is because it is nice and stable allowing me to do that without it breaking down I couldn't pick this up and hold it I'd get it sauce all over my hands and that would be a waste we need Abdul for that so that's a comparison between shatter and diamonds and source hopefully I haven't missed much out do feel free to add your input your insights in the comments section I think that people will be wondering what the difference is between the different forms of cannabis extract and Shatter versus diamonds and sauce is an interesting comparison should we dab some first of all we're gonna start with these shatter this is mimosa another really popular cannabis strain that I'm sure some of you would have heard of so you can say this is Shattuck is as I'm digging my dad's hole into it it's literally splintering off into little portions you need to be careful with shatter particularly when cold that you don't accidentally flick it off of your your parchment paper and onto the floor sometimes it can be harder to pick up with a dab tool than than with your fingers as this is proving because it's just not sticky we are ready to go live with this dab of mimosa shatter and I'll see you guys on the other side wow that mimosa flavor is delicious but I do find with shatter he's sort of got a very slight chattery taste to it so you sort of can taste the form of cannabis extract it is now a wonder whether that is actually the lack of volatile Terps meaning that it's not as flavorsome as other forms now there is also something to say about open-loop blasting versus closed-loop distilled butane both of these forms of extract are extracted using a solvent it looks like this it is called butane and it is the same gas as goes into your blow torches your clipper lighters etc obviously handling this stuff in an enclosed environment is dangerous it is extremely flammable that is why it is recommended that if you don't know what you're doing do not try this at home I've spoke to more than one extractor that has told me that they've had an accident in the past and it's not really a little accident when it involves things like explosions and fire so stay safe people there are safer ways to make your own extracts at home just look at rosin all right should we do a dab of the diamonds and sauce and see how it compares to that in the motor shaft that we just tried I think we should it isn't the best shape to dad till family in diamonds and source actually but I think we're gonna be able to to get your nights tab allows a these looks great guys we're about to do this tab right now and I'll see you on the other side tears folks [Music] wowsa oh man all the flavor got me that dad makes your eyes forward sometimes that was intense that was expansive that actually gave me the sweats guys been a long time since I got the sweats doing a DAB the flavor of the lemon skills diamonds and sauce is absolutely incredible through the coffin I was able to get that delicious sweetness you know just as it smells it tastes and I've been dabbing that all yesterday I'm really loving that flavor so which is my favorite out of diamonds and sauce and shatter it has gotta be the diamonds and source guys and girls it is a delicious form of cannabis extracts able to give me the sweat after all this dabbing that's pretty impressive and it is certainly particularly that version of it a winning flavor and dabbing experience shutter is nice but it's got that shattering flavor but I think with the Diamonds and sauce you get this like magical level of flavor that you don't really experience anywhere else saying that though with diamonds and sauce you definitely don't need a big dab those crystals of THC a are expansive and very very strong and I just experienced that from a normal-sized dad got me quite a bit high up and giving me the sweats which I don't mind it's been a while since a DAB has done that to me but what do you think of this video folks what is your favorite form of extract have you tried dabbing it they leave your comments below this has run on to 24 minutes of filming supposed to be in a three minute video that has been the video comparing the diamonds and sauce and the shutter that's it for the moment as always thanks for watching and keep token stepping on here rollercoaster going down but I never felt this high biggest right how the century [Music]", "UfFOHfZCKkE": "what up this is chip from the real dirt podcast man today we get to talk about one of my favorite subjects of all time that is solventless extracts that's right water-based extracts today i'm talking with my good buddy chris from solely solventless out of denver and man he's been really like pushing the bounds of uh um extraction water extraction rosin extraction in the colorado area so if you're around if you're around denver or come to denver definitely uh check it all out man hey guys and if you haven't joined already please join us at therealdirtpodcast.com subscribe on itunes and hey man check out our new youtube channel you know we're just working on it but uh should be all of our episodes loaded up there real soon and uh i believe that is the real dirt podcast on youtube so thanks again for joining us today and as always sit back and fire the largest joint you can and enjoy this episode of the real dirt and this is chip from the real dirt good morning hello one and all another episode of the real dirt podcast this is 2021 and today we're gonna talk about extracts concentrates how they're kind of made and what they are the first time i ever heard of a concentrate of course it was it was called hash and we didn't quite know what it was and this guy kevin price i believe he was he he was like hey i got some hash she you know and we looked at it and we were like man this looks like rabbit [ __ ] are you sure this is hash and to this day i'm pretty sure he sold me rabbit [ __ ] as hash and we didn't know any better so we smoked it but it's come a long ways and as soon as i got real extract which was jamaican hash oil back in way long time ago i realized the potential of extracting the trichome and extracting the molecule from cannabis and have really been fascinated with it since then in all its forms from traditional hand rolled hash to sheaved and pressed hash to bubble hash to sub critical co2 butane propane solventless like i'm really fascinated and interested in it all and today we have chris from solely solvent list chris a good friend of mine say hey chris how you guys doing out there thanks for having me chip you know chris is an unsung hero he has some of the finest extracts on the market they're boutique and rare to find and if you ever see them absolutely scoop them up they may be a little bit more expensive than the ones sitting next to it but you know what it is absolutely worth it hitting it chris i appreciate all those nice words there chip yeah man just paying attention to detail man and you know really having a love and appreciation for this plant and all that's all its power that it entails you know so you know we're small small batch but uh you know we're just starting out if you do happen to catch us on the show like chip is saying yeah man you definitely gotta give us a shot you won't be disappointed we like to take our time like i said that attention to detail is important when it comes to solving this extracts there's a few things you definitely have to uh pay attention to as far as the input or the material you're using to get that output that we all desire are what you know the customers are desiring these days one of the biggest things about xtract is the quality material in gets exceptional quality out and many people just use the trash you know to make it and and you can't absolutely do that but to me you guys can best gear possible you use the best buds possible that's right my friend yeah a lot of credit goes to the action you know the cultivators first the flower has to be top-notch the flower's banging and it's on point and usually you know the hash on the other end comes out what you would like as far as like you know quality numbers you know that can all vary from a few different things different genetics and yield different numbers in those areas you know it's it's all interesting it's all you know experimental it's just great to learn and you know every day you know whether it's something that really throws down a lot of hash you know and you know it's in the family of the gmos or the cakes or something like that or something that doesn't really throw down as much it's more you know on the terp side i mean that's all important you know it depends on what you're looking for what are you starting off the day with man you you you smoke weed in the minute at the beginning of the day are you one of those people i mean probably like three or four times at the beginning of the day three or four times at the beginning uh i mean what did i have this morning i had a little bit of the uh some some live rosin made by myself it was some uh i call it the gumbo mix or you know my term that's right because chris is from actually from louisiana yeah you're right you're right um he's also our resident go-to of anything southern cooking food as well he holds the gumbo and shrimp and grits title at cultivate colorado currently right nobody compared yeah i mean i i i take that pretty probably anybody wants to step up at all i'll take it you know but oh man when we made shrimp and when you made shrimp and grits down here in oak okc my crew here never had it and literally the other day they were like man that time you guys made shrimp and grits he actually said chip you made tripping crap right uh i didn't take credit i mean it was a team effort man come on we watched you do it extracting hash is just like cooking you can be a cook or you can be a chef right you got all the right ingredients you got all your temperatures together you prepare everything properly you prep everything properly then wow you got something then right yeah 100 yeah like uh you know a lot of people you know may not go along with the the mix material washes but i particularly like those because as you were saying with i like cooking and flavor profiles and things like that you know you take two different you know hatches and mix those together you never know what you're gonna get man like you can be in a mood this day take a hit of that you know the same hash you know that you hit two days ago and get different flavor profiles because you might be in a different mood or something you know it just really depends like today a mix of tropicana banana and monkey berries and i really like that that's my gumbo mix for this morning chocolate chip did pretty well those did about i think that was at four percent together so not bad numbers so you're mixing these you're mixing these flavors in the bag yes i like to actually mix material together and wash it together in the bag you can do it separate if you like and then mix the resin at the end and press it like that if you want you know that's a preference thing man everybody got their own way to do it yeah way i like to do it you know so it works out well for me i don't have any issues with it taste fire love the taste so we've been babbling a little bit here i realized like there's a lot of people that listen to these podcasts or we'll see this podcast that don't really understand what hash or extract or rosin or resin or solvent list or bubble or co2 or any of this stuff is man let's just let me get your opinion of it let's let's let's start at the beginning let's have like a 101 basic extract course from chris i would tell you this i honestly um you know definitely knowledgeable in the extracts but as far as an extract connoisseur or someone who is going to go to a store and buy an extract over flour that was not me three or four years ago i would say the hydrocarbon extractions or co2 whatever you want to call it those extractions you know just we're not really that interested in them as far as like dabbing them but definitely using them for edibles and things like that which they would come up really well in edibles so you know never really you know downplayed it or anything like that but starting just like let's let me let me pause you right there and ask you and let's make some ex explain to people what's going on so most of the extract you see on the shelf at a dispensary say in colorado or california it's some mostly some sort of wax or goo or oil or shatter and most of that is made with butane or protein propane some type of hydrocarbon mixture right right right right they're literally just combining all of the the plant material they're mixing it with the hydrocarbon and then they're separating out the plant material the hydrocarbon they're recollecting the solvent the hydrocarbon yep and what's left is the extract right right right right and that's what mostly is on the shelf so when you're when you have a pen what's what's in most pens chris you get a mix of a few things these days i've seen uh you know you get your distillate pins mixed with terps i would say uh you get your sauce pins i've seen you know lately you're starting to see some live rosin pins kind of new on the market but mostly mostly just through it and terps i would say which you know distillate would be you know just your pure thc no flavor profile and then able being able to take different tariff profiles and then add that to the distillate you know um it was some sort of solvent these those are all mostly solvent yes correct yes right right but but you mentioned rosin tell me what the difference is between solvent lists and and the the non-solvents oh well you know as you mentioned uh earlier with the uh actual process of collecting the trichomes using hydrocarbon uh with a non-solvent uh extraction or a solvent extraction as you want to call it you're actually going to be using water as the solvent or as the carrier or the lubricant whatever you want to call it but like super cold water so you want to use a combination of ice and water to actually collect those trichomes opposed to the hydrocarbon so a healthier way or a healthier method i would say as far as like uh approaching the extraction process but uh you know each process equally has benefits for whatever end product or whatever way you want to do with it but i just if you're asking me water and ice seems pretty safe and clean to me so using that path to actually strike trichomes uh you know solving this just you know really stuck with me when that started coming around i think nicotine probably is the guy to give respect to that starting that term from what i understand you know and he's been around for a minute pushing out some great product just learning and discovering that really got me really interested in that and these days you're starting to see it they're starting to be rising carter just popping up you know rising and batter live jam you know uh sauce and diamonds even like people starting to even make diamonds and solvents which is crazy because that's like mechanical separation and things like that it costs more for a reason though you have to put more raw material you have to take more care in the solventless extract than just a hydrocarbon extract the material 100 matters you can do it from trim and things like that well taken care of trim will deal some great results but decide it'll actually use you know your prized buds you know and something that a cultivator or you know cultivar that does really well you know you're gonna you gotta wash it you gotta collect it run it through the bags you know then take it from the bags goes to the freeze dryer you know that's in there for 24 hours comes out of the freeze dryer then you have to see that then you have to you know collect it again into your screen bags and then now you have to press it so you know you press it then you collect it and then now it has to cure whether you want to you know heat cure it cold care room temp cure whatever it may be there's all these different ways you can approach it there's no wrong or right way in my opinion it's all great technique yeah it's all technique and preference you know some people swear by full spectrum you know or like some people swear that oh it's got to be the 9120 or only 90 you know and that's like man that's cool you know that's great that's your preference you can like that but like you know it's it's it's all out there man it's everybody likes something a little bit different and it's great that you have the options with verizon you can do that also when you you use different material you get different results and it's really hard on the commercial market to have the same exact material over and over and over and over again and and so that's the importance of like what we're talking about you got to watch it see what's going on because what might collect what even one strain grown by one guy might collect differently than the same strain grown by someone else right and you you've you've seen this over and over again like wow man those crystals are really small those crystals are really fat like this is nothing but glands this is nothing but stocks you know yeah man i've seen two two different growers two same exact stream like almost one and a half percent difference you know which is crazy you know like that's a decent amount of difference you know but still great outcomes on that on that particular stream but uh yeah you're right uh environment that's actually grown in um you know maybe i'm starting to notice has a play in into that too and maybe appearance of the actual riser you know whether it's going to be a little bit lighter things like that whether those whether that person maybe pulled that product a little bit early harvested a little bit early things like that and you know kind of go into it too you kind of never really know so like having a good relationship with your suppliers where you're getting your material from really helps you know and like consistently consistently knowing that you know you're dealing with these guys it's going to be this every time you know you know that it's going to put out you know these guys grow it perfectly and boom you know everyone does good yeah well it takes a different mentality well slightly different mentality to grow for for high quality extracts i mean many people grow for extract but they're just literally trying to grow biomass they're just trying to grow like weight man the highest quality stuff though it comes from when you really take care just like you would ganja right all the way to the end and you finish it the same way and you know you dry it and store it and package it all the same way like you know maybe i mean you don't have to trim it necessarily right but like you definitely have to like you know there's a little bit of processing going on yeah you definitely like to prep it i mean you know you know you don't want to put any you know leaves that doesn't have any any sugar in there you definitely don't want that sure in there you know so you got to prep it a little bit but definitely as far as like taking care of it and growing it with the utmost attention attention to detail you know as far as like i know you don't have to do your ipm's but you have to minimize those things like that you know that really like carries over into your end product you know later in your flower cycle when you come up with an issue you know that's love matters you know so you got to be on it from the beginning man and take care of the growing environment you know many people are familiar with with this term bubble hash or water hash but let's talk about why what this solvent list how it's different from from just like a crude extract with water yeah so with bubble hash you know in the cycle route to get rosin you pretty much get bubble hash first but like you said most people are used to seeing you know the bubble hatch in the form of you know looks like sand i guess almost keith rather people familiar with the grinders you know and you have to keep catchers but like typically you know whenever you're washing the material and collecting it in the bubble bags you know before the whole freeze dryer thing at this point you take it out of the bubble bags you gotta pretty much dry it at the perfect condition to get it to not mold or anything to be able to go from like you know you know the bubble hash process like that that we're all use that's a pretty intricate process too to get that right to get that correct for freeze dryers like i mean i guarantee you i would have failed plenty of times you know what i'm saying i mean i i mean i maybe tried it a few times when i first moved here from louisiana trying to do some bubble hatch before rosin was even a thing you know and you know it came out well but that whole drawing process is tricky and lucky out here it's dry the standardized you know so it was pretty you know relatively easy to learning curve is you know easy out here with that lack of humidity but i don't know if that would happen in louisiana i end up with some moldy hash man you know a few times i'm sure yeah yeah you got to control your dry environment yeah but you know now but now with with free drives it's a different story yes free drive is definitely a different story pull it out of the bag wet press it out water out a little bit put it in the freeze dryer yeah right yeah and even with you know i mean still with freezer i mean you know you're using freeze dryers i mean people don't tell me you could press it in horizon a lot of people keep it as melt too you know you you know you separate use your bags and use that 90 bag get some full melt people really love that nice full melt these days it seems like you know different strains are going to give you different meltability of the heads but like usually that that 90 through 119 seems to be that that one that people love for that good bubble hash melt you know super clean heads you know barely any specs of anything you know but you know it's got to be clean that's got to be taken care of properly to get to that point you know and using the freezer man just freeze-dried bubble like can be incredible oh yeah right a few times i've had it it's been ridiculously good right but it's to get that high quality dabbable bubble at that point like it's really really strain specific that you hardly get any yield you know out of your your your batch when you do it that way right compared to kind of like what you're doing and you're making you're extracting as much quality material out of the the leaf as you can with water you're taking it freeze drying it right and then what happens well from that point once it comes from the freeze dryer we take it and we put it between these nice plates by these low temp plates i like to use those plates but they're great heated plates low temp heat and pressure um the bubble hatch goes into filter bag and then between the two plates and that presses out the rosin so you go from the bubble hash and then those two plates creates almost like a you know like an environment of where pretty much that that protective layer on the resin heads or you know that the bubble hash bursts from the heat and the pressure and it oozes out all that good oil rosin and you collect it into the jar or into your banger or whatever i've seen people do some crazy stuff on instagram but so basically it goes to a jar we're using water yeah and then we're freeze-drying it and then we're using a press with some heat on it that's right right and this is this is all just water and heat right natural man that's it water heat a little bit of pressure you know and boom you got some rosin you have some beautiful extract that you can then take from that state and cure it how you'd like or you can keep it in a fresh press state you know take it into cartridges take it into edibles which oh man make some beautiful edibles tastes so good i love that that you know some people complain about that weed taste or whatever i like a nice rosin taste and an edible in my opinion that tastes good me too yeah i prefer all the edibles with more basic extracts uh keef water rosin oh yeah right i i prefer those as extracts for sure hey all of you uh uh edible companies out there man don't just use distillate make some with keef make some with rosie yeah your clientele will love it too i'm sure they'll start learning you know when to experiment with different inputs is you know the education of all this stuff will definitely keep growing with more states becoming legal here you know as we keep seeing it almost weekly and it seems like i see another state is passing some you know medical cannabis or recreational loss which is great man so you know hawaii yesterday alabama tennessee like people in texas new york new jersey like it's going everywhere right it's happening man it's happening and that's great you know and you know that people people are going to want they're going to want to learn about it you know that's how it is man you know the thing about private market cannabis and that industry is is we always try to squeeze as many dollars as many cents out of a square foot or out of a plant as possible because you know it was gray market or it was totally illegal and and now that we have these legal markets it allows to us to do research and experiment with with cannabis on a different scale and you know even though like solventless you know might be twice as much on the shelf it might be 65 80 a gram on the shelf you know the the the manufacturer still is he's not really like making a ton of money at that price it's literally you know he's making less money that way than he would if he was doing butane or propane or co2 right he's making less money that way than he would if he was actually probably selling the buds for flour too right like it it really gives is solventless extract it really defines to some degree a different segment of cannabis production right because it's not just like this like the biggest bang for the buck right get the most money out of the square foot it's like hey i want to make this product and this is how we make it and then the market bears the price 200 100 yeah it's definitely a it's a it's a special product that like you're saying it's there's multiple steps to it man you know so so complex i mean it should be worth 120 a gram i mean i was just out in california and that's what it was about yeah it's 120 a gram there though because all the taxes that go on yeah and that's and that's what i was yeah it was attacked right right but yeah it's uh i don't like to say it's not for everybody but like you know if you want to get into it man it's definitely something that like it takes a little bit of you know diving into you know there's a few steps to it a few things that you definitely gotta you know you gotta pay attention to detail that's what this is man you know it's more like a food or a laboratory-like environment all right not to say not i mean that's what you know other extraction techniques as well not to say that's not how you would treat it with that one but like you know just particularly with the solvents man like like you said you grow all your flour you could take this flour and sell it as flour or you would take it and you know throw it in this water with this ice swishing around and hopefully some trichomes come out i mean you know that sounds crazy yeah crazy it does you know the research and you know the groundwork that a lot of people have done you know in the past few years i would say have definitely like built that confidence and i would say you know definitely curious minds like me for sure because it was definitely tough for me to dive into it too i remember thinking about this more than a few years back i'm like man that's crazy just take the flower and throw it in there and like like really okay but now you learn and you get educated and you're like okay now it makes sense you know now okay cool i'm definitely gonna go take my flower and throw it in there and do that you know because this browsing thing just tastes really good makes my edibles taste really good too so sorry i just had to break for a second you guys over at the uh i just do yeah right yes yeah i know you gotta have security up in the studio man all kinds of [ __ ] roll up here i mean tupac learned it the most i know dude that's right that's right i just was watching a couple episodes on hip hop evolution about that sad story man sad story sad story sad story yeah you know greatness often is is snuffed out too early man that that's you know i lost a couple friends this year uh danny smallwood and rob cox and man like you know it's always sad when uh flame goes out too quick man yeah that's right yeah man my condolences i'm sorry to hear that man hey both those guys danny and rob loved extract love bubble rob love bubble i was making it with both of those guys in literally 2002 and nice we we got super high you know on more than one occasion on a a handmade bubble that we just made with literally pantyhose and silk screen and man you're taking it back man you're taking it back [Laughter] right but it can it you know you don't have to have all the equipment you can do it at home you can do simple extractions at home and people should try if you're a home grower definitely try to do that go to the store go to the dispensary buy some see what theirs is like and then try to mimic it right yeah 100 there's a lot of information out there on the web these days uh you can follow an array of guys on instagram too um that are really interested it seems like in letting people know how to do this i gather a lot of information just from perusing instagram man following people that i look up to that i know we're doing big things out here in the industry and you know if you're familiar with colorado's or rosin scene you know who i'm talking about but you can find some information out there don't be scared of it man you can get the equipment relatively easy and it's relatively easy to use and you know learning curve with anything i mean don't expect you know just get it and then all of a sudden you know you got what you but it takes a little bit but you curiosity man you got to want to do it you know you got to be about it that's all i'm going to say you know like yeah you know if like if you like extractions and you like smoking extractions and you have access to flour and you know you have opportunity to do it you're in a state that allows you to do it i say do it absolutely i believe that state can be a state of well-being 100 so uh yeah get out there grow some weed man make some extract of it roll some joints with it yeah pass it along to your friends and your family and then grow some more do it yeah keep it going man keep it down great chat with you man likewise man i really appreciate you having me it's uh you know really an honor being on this show and i you know sharing the information that i possess here which you know take it for what you want but uh yeah man you know what i love about you man is next year you're gonna be on a totally different plane with this we should do another one next year and see where you're coming out with it you just learned so much you're like a sponge man i'll come out there i'll i'll come see you in okc next year we'll do it out there oh yeah hey absolutely we'll we'll uh yeah man we'll make some we meant to make some this year but it didn't work out just yeah that's what that makes yeah we'll get it going man no worries come you know do some fishing as well oh well i don't know man you tear it up a little bit too much [Laughter] i need my fish in my pond you're catching them all come on man i look forward to it chris man i miss you guys likewise man it was good chatting with you this morning thanks again this is uh chris with solely solvent list how can how can people look you up chris oh you can find us on instagram uh we're a solely dot solving lesson that's s-o-u-l-y dot solventless pretty easy to find yeah man so we not solving this um check us out we got some you know good things happening here very soon and uh yeah be on the lookout for us thanks again chris man appreciate it thank you and have a good one too oh man i tell you after that episode i want to sit back and uh vape up some some good solventless extractor maybe even go back and get myself some bubble hash and sprinkle some on a nice large joint you know i think i might have ruined myself that extract years ago by making uh trainwreck keefe joints and and train wreck bubble hash joints i probably lost a couple years smoking dust and i hope you guys learned a lot about extracts and solventless extracts today you know they're they're they're not dangerous they're safe it's just water um not that like hydrocarbon products are dangerous either but but many people have an aversion to them but hey you shouldn't if you're interested in you know uh solventless extracts or bubble hash man you should try something if you can make it at home you can buy a lot of the materials online you can always check us out at cultivate colorado.com cultivateokc.com hey if you haven't already subscribed to our podcast please do that's the real dirt podcast with chip baker and check out our youtube channel man we're going to put all of our episodes on there from the past we're going to have all our new episodes on there so you'll be able to listen to all 70 80 90 episodes on youtube at your will so thanks a lot for joining us again today yeah man the next time you're out there in the world the next time you're at a dispensary ask the dispensary about solventless extracts ask them their opinion um ask them to show you some this has been chip with real dirt thanks again", "HXSZ-JrRpLQ": "all right all right we're back sorry about that we're gonna go ahead and get this popping off again [Music] uh [Music] so cool [Music] as soon as we get a few people in here i'll go ahead and explain what i got going on in the other room for this flush that i'm going to do today because my back's killing me i'm not trying to go through and manually hand water everything i know how much water it takes to flush these out now so basically i'm just going to set the irrigation and flush them from the the secondary reservoir [Music] [Music] so now that um we checked all the poor water you see in the room stats just a few minutes ago we're gonna go ahead and flush the medium normally i would do this by hand with the hose and give each plant about a thousand to two thousand mls high volume really fast to make sure that it flushes everything out we're using a mixture of botanicaire clear x and neutral life sm 90. and uh 10 ml per gallon of the clear x 2 ml per gallon of sm-90 we added that to 100 gallons here mixed it all up and uh now we're gonna go ahead and feed it through the drippers i know that to give these plants 150 ml that's my two minute mark okay so i need to pretty much almost go 10 times that amount and run the system for about 20 minutes right now and so what i'm going to do is i'm going to go back and i'm going to trick the system to thinking it's the first watering of the day so i'm going to change the time [Music] to eight [Music] and it starts at 8 30 so i'll put it to 8 27 and then i'm going to go up and i'm going to change my solenoid so at 8 30 20 minutes table two 20 minutes [Music] and uh we'll go ahead and close our bypass valve so that we're not putting any of the um flushing agent back into this nutrient reservoir right here and then i'm going to make sure that this one is open for flushing that one is closed we're good to go we're going to take our measuring cup here and this should easily get full okay now i'm going to make sure that we're monitoring one of our cubes so that way when this starts we can see as the volumetric water content goes up and the poor water you see should go down and we're gonna watch during that 20 minutes well not continuously um but after that 20 minutes this poor water ec should be all the way down damn near zero if not we're gonna run it some more so it's at 8 29 now it's gonna kick off any second now no in like 45 seconds not fast enough i want you to go now boom pump is kicking pulling from that reservoir right now it's feeding hope it doesn't turn off from too much pressure here 45 should hold that's why i use my bypass valve because if it gets up to like 50 60 it's gonna auto shut off if i need to i'll just um run my bypass here or my pressure regulator over to that one so i can control which way it goes i should have done that i need to re-plumb all this eventually so see here we're at 44.8 4.7 [Music] so [Music] we're getting right off already on mostly everything because we are at full saturation for the day already so this should start going down [Music] i want to imagine within the next five minutes we'll see some changes on this so we'll let this run okay i just saved it it looks like we're going to hold good on our pressure and not cut off it would have done it by now so we've got enough flow to keep this [ __ ] going [Music] still flowing and we're just passing about 200 ml and you can see the grip coming off of the bottom of the cubes [Music] let it go do its thing [Music] and this is why i normally hand flush because usually by the time it takes me to hand flush everything which is about 20 minutes 30 minutes at most um i've got to run the irrigation for that long so i might as well do it by hand because then i know each one's getting a high volume really fast which really flushes it out i wash my whole harvest yep how do i flush at the end of the cycle it's usually um clear x you know it's usually clear x and uh drip clean which we should go back in the room real quick while that's uh doing that we're gonna do something we're gonna go ahead and open up the floodgates on this bad boy we're going to start popping this off i want to go ahead and fill this up today top it off with all fresh nutrients and um we're going to go in at 1 ec you guys are probably like what the [ __ ] yeah doggie we're gonna go in at 1ec i've been hitting them at like two they're getting build up and i don't want that build up don't wanna don't want it don't want it we're gonna go in at one ec on them for a couple of days and see how they like it because right now they all got that little bit of tip burn a little bit of leaf pearl you know i don't want that downward leaf curl you want that nice and shiny [ __ ] [Music] you know and i'm driving the uptake really really hard right now pushing about a thousand ppfd across the canopy so i i should be going in at a slightly lower ec make sure that they're not throwing their their balance off give them slightly more feedings throughout the day right now they're gonna go crazy we're gonna adjust the irrigation schedule here in a minute i'm not gonna do it right now because obviously i'm in the middle of feeding but one of the things i need to do is i need to go in there and adjust the afternoon feedings today is going to be uh thrown off by the flush but um going forward since today's a fresh res they'll get flushed today they'll dry back like normal overnight almost and then tomorrow they'll go into normal irrigations with the new feed tomorrow night will be their first you know normal dry back um and then we'll be able to watch from there if the poor water you see start stacking up on me again we know that something's off so one of the things i adjusted is i went from a six percent shot which is 150 ml roughly um up to triple that um right to an 18 shot in the morning um trying to spike the volumetric water content higher and flush the poor water ec earlier in the day and then continue on with smaller um three percent shots throughout the rest of the afternoon um typically you see people do multiple six percent shots earlier in the morning but you know in doing that it becomes very difficult to get your volumetric water content up to full saturation while still allowing the 10 to 20 minutes in between irrigation events um so for me i find you might as well just flush them all out at once you know there's there's dissolved oxygen in the nutrients and in the medium and as you're pushing out the old stale oxygen and you bring in fresh uh o2 you're putting in fresh nutrients the plants are going to suck all of that up first thing in the morning and you get these crazy spikes and growth and then you just go back to a vegetative crop steering technique for the remainder of the afternoon and and you're good so right now what i'm doing is i'm dialing in all right my morning shot is six minutes it's 450 ml does that get me up to full saturation or do i need a little bit more do i need to go for eight minutes maybe right or do i need to break it into two five minute waterings that are like 20 minutes apart first thing in the morning right there's options but i need to analyze the the graph as well as look at how the plants respond and see which one works best and then from there i need to determine all right how long after that do i get a five to ten percent dry back right from full saturation and then that's when i'm going to go ahead and water again and i'm going to go in at a three percent shot right about 70 to 80 ml and that should get me back up to full saturation again right and then it's just playing that game of how long does it take you to drive back this amount and then this is how much you water to get back to full and then you stop when you're supposed to stop at the end of the day so you could target your dryback percentage overnight right so my lights go off at 5 30 right my legs come on at 6 30 i'm running 11 13 cycle so at 5 30 my lights go off 3 30 is my last feeding of the day two hours before the lights go off and i'm getting a pretty significant dryback i'm getting my 40 sometimes even 45 percent you know that i'm targeting so it's it's just really knowing what drive back you're targeting and then using your time that you have available to irrigate to your advantage so you can either push a smaller dryback or a larger drive back depending on what type of growth you're promoting for generative growth you want that 40 that's your money maker right there you can get 40 drybacks overnight um you're gonna you're gonna do good you're gonna see some really good stacking um you're gonna see some really really good development and you'll be happy if you're in veg you're gonna push probably for about a 20 to 25 percent dryback at most overnight okay and uh smaller waterings a little bit more frequent keep the ec low right so people think automatically you have to just when you're in flower you run a higher ec but you don't have to do anything you could still keep feeding at the same ec that you were in veg but because you're allowing a larger dryback overnight the salt buildup is going to accumulate and you're going to run a naturally higher ec in the medium because of the dry bags so that's crop steering you know so over the next two days i'm going to be re-dialing in all of those factors to try and promote a different type of growth so during flower all transition to on day one to generative style crop steering right which is pushing larger drybacks overnight larger volumes of irrigation larger shot sizes right and um then after week three after i'm done with the stretch and the bud sites are fully developed and i want to promote more growth out of the bud sites i'll start switching over back from the generative file back to a vegetative style which is going to give me smaller dry backs overnight right with smaller more frequent waterings back at a lower ec and not stacking the ec as high after the buds have developed and the stretch is completed the plants don't really want that really high ec anymore so that's why myself included and a lot of other growers get that mint flour tip burn because we have to push that high ec and we have to stack the ec in the medium during the transition to power the plants into flowering production but then if we're not careful to transition them back out of that when they no longer need all of that energy and they're just going through their normal pace of production right then we're going to burn them and we're going to burn so if you don't start backing off you know after like week three then yeah you're definitely going to get some tip burn especially if you're not you know clear exiting or flushing the medium once a week for hydro grows i recommend once a week so now that we've got that really good bud development we're really trying to push the expansion of the bud outward we're going to be going back to that vegetative style of feeding so we're going to go generative in the morning first thing it's going to promote that crazy explosive growth that they're going to get from a fresh feed knocking down the ec and all of that uptake and then after that straight vegetative and you watch what happens in that room it's going to go bananas here's um a graph i showed earlier i wanted to show you guys [Music] so here's the uh temperature data graph for 24 hours okay here's ph why is this way back there hold on [Music] yeah there we go it doesn't look like we're at one o'clock already so there's the temperature you can see it came down overnight from the coils chilling the res and then now midday it's starting to warm back up a little bit it won't get over 75 in the res though ph you can see it's a steady incline power si and the res i guess easy stable those are just watering events usually and then here's the moisture data so last night's dry back and then this morning's watering and then since then it's been pretty much at saturation the entire day and then we're going to fall back off now this should normally have a much larger dry back but i've been messing with the irrigation today so this is what a week looks like and you can see how we constantly have a dry back overnight and then it feeds gets up to full saturation throughout the day last watering and then it goes back down and then goes back up and back down and that was a big dry back right there pretty significant one and then back up and down and up and down and up and hey look that dry back wasn't as big why is that switching back into vegetative mode we don't need that super big ass dryback anymore right we look at one month [Music] you can see we started off after i let them soak they're at a lower water content and then boom they get put on the [ __ ] program they start coming down and then they're in their paces up and down ph hopefully that helps that was like a very long rant but i'm tired of the the crop steering question so i figured i might as well cover all of that [Music] so what's up mystic god damn you're pushing 46 dli son you're gonna get a huge yield [ __ ] that's high let's go see where we're at with this flush should be almost there yep we just passed over that thousand mile mark let's see where we're at [Music] it got us down to 1.6 but it's still going i don't like 1.6 it means there's still build up in there and it just ended so we're gonna keep this [ __ ] going i'm gonna trick it guess what [ __ ] it's 8 30 again keep [ __ ] going you're not done this is still filling up and we only went through about 20 gallons we've got plenty keep going you ore look at this [ __ ] crowning out oh wait backing off that ec oh no you don't get your [ __ ] ass back up here get in the cup now here's a crate i don't care if you're in a cup that's fine here's a crazy thing if i were to take this and dump it in that plant all at once it would drop the ec all the way down it's because it's being trickled in so slow that it takes a long ass time and it may or may not actually flush it all the way down we're at 1.4 let's go i'll give each plant 2 000 ml that's fine each plant can have half a gallon [Music] i'm waiting on these to go just buff nutty and i can tell these are gonna get [ __ ] gnarly 1.3 yep it's gonna keep going down then we're gonna let it [Music] let that [ __ ] go and we'll let the nutrient reservoir keep filling up and then we'll mix in some more newts to top it off and uh [Music] yeah then we'll be good to go we'll let that [ __ ] ride back jesus you just got here and you can repeat all of that that's funny it's out of control happy valley man let's see the farm bro post a link post a link let's see it show us your tits i mean plants oh that was my back popping oh my god it's just so saucy sugary wet [Music] cheers guys so uh so um yep i washed it all three last gram so um i've been meeting with my boss in 15 [Music] minutes minutes this means i need to see if i have any emails from him we're good i just have one thing to do who know what do you guys want to talk about i'm here to help you guys today i feel like i've been m.i.a because my back's been [ __ ] out of commission so i haven't been wanting to be in here at all i've been laying on the floor so i haven't really been doing the daily dabs and uh no not no whoops i don't i don't do a whole plant fresh frozen i don't make cards that would ruin it no these are i make good quality dabs you know what belongs in carts when people try to make like jar tech and it fails that deserves to go into carts but that's it nothing else that comes out of this garden should ever go into a car and i wouldn't even put it in the cart i would make edibles out of it before i put it into a cart it's on your page happy all right let's see damn it how do i get to your page can you post a link to it they won't let me go to your page just from clicking on the sword from um from 710 coils i got the sword and the katana they're dirty right now i need to clean them i like set it down on the table when you hit the [ __ ] paper towels and got some paper towel on it so now i gotta torch it and alcohol what's up david i gotta create a fishing campaign right now don't mind me i'm stretching while we talk i'm not gonna sit down anymore in here i'm gonna stand up and talk and dab and that's it no more sitting all this sitting down and hanging out with you guys is what's ruining my back even more how much led light do i have on how much square foot in watts so my flower room is a 10 by 15. i've got two 4x12 trays i'm running six 690 watt leds and um that's weird my camera freeze six uh 690 watt leds and then i have 250 watt side lights so i've got about 4 400 watts total in that room it's not a lot how much do you guys think people pull off of like 4 000 watt um lights what would you think is like for those of you guys that do run 1000 watt lights how much would you pull off of four lights i can tell you my my thing is i know a lot of guys that say two and a half per light and they're they're happy like super [ __ ] happy like they're killing it if they're getting two and a half per light right most people if they get super light they're like cool i'm good with that we're good right so you know they're getting you said 0.8 grams per watt what does that work out to be so seven pounds see like hpf i think that sounds about right like between anywhere between seven to ten pounds right not important on your gabita leds 11.50 to 13.50 that's per light that's that's killing man you're doing good yeah 670 watts right you're on leds so that's my point is like an hid fixture out of this room if they had the equivalent wattage and hids in this room you know how much they would pull where i would pool i guess you could say if i was the average grower or whatever i don't know how to work that to be honest if there was equivalent wattage hivs in here getting the average yield that people are good with two to two and a half per light that's four thousand watt lights give it two per light eight pounds give it two and a half you're getting what an extra two pounds you're getting 10 out of the room i'm about to hit probably 14 and i'm only running half the amount of ac that those would need you know it's crazy and i'm getting way closer to the plants with a better spectrum i don't know how people run hid still ocean i hit i hit a pound on the 315s yep i hit a pound on the 315 watt cmhs so i know you could do it with the leds i know four times you could all right let me knock this this workout right quick you guys sit right here i gotta knock this out real fast drive by real quick research [Music] so i have a few things i could choose from today if you do a fake fall sale if you do a fake trump rally email [Music] yeah i like this halloween sale let's see what this looks like it probably won't work because it's gonna get stripped by our server this one's funny i'm gonna use this one [Music] this is hilarious i think i'm going to create a custom one too that says free pumpkin spice latte how many [ __ ] karen's at my company you're gonna click on that [ __ ] [Music] so let me check and make sure i got these emails and then i gotta hop on this meeting with my boss [Music] it's like rolling up a window you guys can hang out it's nothing confidential i just gotta show them some [ __ ] real quick everything just get his feedback [Music] meanwhile i can hang out and answer your [Music] questions [Music] auto flowers i agree auto flowers if you have some outdoor space where you could just stick them to get constant weed that's pretty decent you know like if you have a small greenhouse dude i wouldn't even [ __ ] worry about it i would throw otto's in that [ __ ] all day long if i had a good auto breeder and i could trust his [ __ ] i throw autos in there all day long do you think shelby do you think okay we gotta be quiet now shut up and i gotta disconnect from the bluetooth oh [Music] looks like there might be a problem with my connection [Music] well [ __ ] wow [Music] maybe you guys won't be heading hanging out with me i don't know i might have to go upstairs and manually plug in because it's just tripping so tired of this [ __ ] air here [Music] mephisto genetics are good all these companies are having like halloween sales right now you guys better get in on them sales what other sales are coming up veterans day sales what else black friday cyber monday [Music] no [Music] so [Music] no internet hey talking hear me all right hey todd can you hear me all right [Music] hello it always does this [ __ ] muted from hello [Music] oh that's fine he was like i was going to let you know we could cancel that works for me [Music] [Music] cool easy peasy breezy that meeting is over gotta love it well you guys are about to get disconnected in a minute [Music] my back is [ __ ] right now i'm getting ready to go to a massage in like two hours i took the lights off real quick ocean because i realized after i said that that i don't think that the taxes are set up properly on them yet to where it'll add your state sales tax to the order so i don't want people checking out and then i have to bill them for the sales tax or anything like that so i took them off real quick so i could get that sorted out so that way as people add them to their cart and they type in their address and [ __ ] it'll add the appropriate tax but anyways you guys i'm gonna go ahead and run in and grub and uh get this day popping and i will catch you guys later i gotta go finish the rest of this uh flush and all of that stuff get it back on nutrients but i'll shoot you guys an update video later today and", "uWELXO1__xI": "what's good guys um good to see you again sorry to take a little break i was going pretty hard need a week to just chill but anyways i got a special review today we're going to be going over a 10 cartridge versus a 50 cartridge i know a lot of people they just want to they just want to get high they just want to get high really quick discreetly um and for cheap which is understandable that's why these 10 cards used to be really popular back in the day i was even hooked on these 10 cards for a while just because it's it's it's cheap it's cheap cheap to get high but that has changed now i don't cheaply intoxicate myself i smoke the very [ __ ] best best that i can find so first off let's give it a look it has this um kind of like iron type titanium look to it some ridges um looks cool distal it's flat not moving let's get a little puffer nothing to really complain about i mean ooh this is something to complain about cannabis extracted with butane so i don't know how many uh ppms is in here i don't know how many parts per million uh is left over of butane in this in this cartridge but that would turn me away and that's probably one of the reasons i don't buy these i didn't actually know it was extracted with butane but now i do but yeah now we got uh some dab logic um that tasted okay there wasn't really too many complaints about it it's not like i full on tasted butane dab logic nice little uh laser laser print around this um it looks like it's natives or aztecs or something has dab logic written across the bottom take this off and snap this on now right off the bat i can it can automatically taste a more it's a more natural taste uh you're not gonna be really be able to tell maybe if you're like you know not used to knowing what quality tastes like if i were just a noob coming in here these would both taste very very similar it's not like you can taste heavy butane in that or anything it's just me knowing that this was processed with butane what turns me away but that's you know it's ten dollars worth of butane now what makes these so different why is this ten dollars why is this fifty dollars a big part of this is gonna be extraction these guys oil they're in the market for wholesale they make most of their money off distributing large quantities to dispensaries they're targeting the market that you know is wanting to and toxic intoxicate themselves for a lot cheaper now these guys these guys are marketing more towards the connoisseurs uh this extraction this was not extracted with butane uh there's a process i'm not too sure how it goes down or how they get it into cartridges but i know there's lots of ways to uh extract and get solventless you can do a fresh chop wash that in a bucket of ice water extract those tricoms in a ice hash then press that and then here comes your rosin i don't know how they liquefy it or what consistency and uh temperatures they do to get it to this consistency in this cartridge but they do and it works so what you're mainly paying for right here and why this is so so much more expensive is that is that when people are washing this and uh when they're extracting uh from this method you yield also a lot less from just blasting a can of butane through a whole bunch of weed this process you actually your yield is a lot smaller um but you have a higher quality so that's where the 50 dollar price mark come from but you know a lot of people really don't care but a lot of people do care and this is this is the main differences sorry you can't see the table the camera's up a little too high uh but yeah anyways uh i hope you like this video i hope i covered everything um and there's like a lot more there's like a lot more there's a lot more labeled on this solvent-less solvent-less vape and for those of you that don't know solventless i had a friend ask me i've explained rosin to them but sometimes people don't remember solventless is processed without solvents like butane co2 what else do they use um that's all i can think of out of my head those are the main ways that people use to extract those are solvents this is solvent less solvent less is the way to go your lungs are going to be a lot happier your high is going to be a lot better and you might say well [ __ ] i don't want to spend 50 on a cart i'm going to stick to 10 that's ok but also you have to keep in mind this is going to pack a harder punch because it's way more purity in this than that other cartridge i didn't mean to be a dick i shouldn't do that i'll [ __ ] it uh but anyways i don't even know where it went it wasn't too far anyways it doesn't matter but yeah those are the main differences a 50 card versus a 10 card i know a lot of people see it in dispensaries and they're like why the [ __ ] is that cart fifty dollars well now you know uh glad i got to do this video a lot about to see you guys uh subscribe uh i'm gonna be doing some merch drop soon so you know stay tuned turn on those notifications uh and i'll see you guys soon uh probably my next video i'm gonna be comparing some of the weed i grew and some of the weed my friend grew and we're gonna put it up against some dispensary weed and show you why potentially home growing could be better than commercial growing that's not always the case but for 99 of industry it is um peace out guys take care let me know in the comments what other videos you want i love uh i love getting suggested new ideas because sometimes i don't know what are good ideas and i just go off top but thanks guys for watching peace out", "a_Y8loBehR4": "[Music] [Music] guys welcome the CCC I'm Shane I'm Danny and we are back for another concentrate review today we are checking out some rosin from 7-10 lives 710 labs they reformed their Colorado company and now they came out to California here we go got a shovel a because it's hard to get on the Denver yeah we actually took the close-ups for this stuff yesterday when we left it in the fridge it was a little cakey but still have a little bit still have a little bit of you know greasiness to it gooeyness left it out overnight after you know basically destroying it [Music] Turkey I'm not usually a huge rosin pin mm-hmm I was just gonna say is it flavorful for rosin or is it flavorful for just an extract in general honestly it's flavorful just for extract in general I guess we should talk about what it is we're smoking we are smoking on some z-cube today now Z cubed is apparently a I guess there's a little bit of a debate on it it's either a three-way crowd like basically skittles back crosses itself a couple times or it's skittles across with OG then cross the skills again either way some skittles taste the rainbow type [ __ ] it is very flavorful and ethylene packs a little bit of a punch it's a little sativa T definitely made me feel a little more like alert who's this barking this is by a dying breed seeds yeah originally third-gen fam [ __ ] i mean i think they probably won 40 50 cups buy this [ __ ] at this one how much every cup this is placed at some point or another multiple times the thing about the skittles is it doesn't look that good when you look at the flowers of it it has about zero bag PB on it does not look good in flower form but goddamn does it taste good I mean I can still taste it on my palate it definitely gave me that opening vibe you know what I'm saying one of those strings that has a super-high terpene content and a relatively low THC content right everybody gets so hung up on the THC numbers and they forget that like without the terpenes and the cannabinoids the THC does out basically nothing for it it all acts together people it all packed together so you know as a result this is one of those strings in my opinion now we're talking about the skittles this is our first time smoking thank you but just the regular old skittles not really my favorite strange smoke if you're talking about flour no not at all but it does make some good concentrates it is a very short flowering plant which on the production side is great you know seven weeks right seven weeks our times so and that's that's amazing I mean eight weeks she's fully done yeah right right so I would love to throw that in my garden strictly for concentrates because you know the flowers trash yeah it is one of those streams though that you know can kind of surprise you as far as when you look at you like oh this right this you look sweet this is some [ __ ] meds but when you smoke it it's one of those sleepers that kind of does pack more of a pleasant you would think right right especially you know it's not the strongest when you talk about dabs but it's right up there with some of the most flavorful [ __ ] the lemon geez a lot of those like orange lemon Terps that just like come through really well on oil for some reason this kind of falls in that same class of church yeah I mean honestly the flour it smokes really good and like a joint or a backward - like I'm not gonna lie but it just doesn't look good you know I'm saying but that concentrates great alright I'm gonna go in and see what to do with the taste you see were to do it with the taste it is hard to get on the batter though that's the one downfall got it the one downfall hard to get on the diver that's the most rosin though we forgot to keep it in the fridge and then you know boom it just waxed out you know I've got the little pocket on it's not a pocket purge because it's not a little but they you know it kicked up in the pocket and that was that now you gotta use shovel to break cover on this stuff I'm gonna discover super blonde yeah how's it taste [ __ ] yeah that was a dabba doo honestly though on the flavor I wasn't very scary to me really no here's the thing about rosin for me especially bubble hash for us and I'm like 95% sure this is Posche rosin is a lot of the stuff you see that looks like this now right yes you know it always kind of just tastes like bubble hash and I don't mean that in a bad way you guys know obviously we used to do it's one of the full-mouth Friday videos like we will have good water to Michael but I like good bubble hash more than I like good rosin that tastes like bubble hash you can bubble there's only those few strings that are really good for you know making bubble hash like sours and all the really greasy strains like that that really make like a bubble hash that actually tastes as true as possible to the natural product one good thing there's GDP in it no there's great babe I got you guys so I wish there was GDP a really original skittles right is wasn't like a grapefruit and a great finish great free really it's a grapefruit and a great page supposedly River and great buddy it should have an eagle everybody knows great babe it's got some peanuts the effect of the shooters pigment it's definitely more of like a head for head as far as the body feeling goes yeah it's pretty much immediate too we had already taken a few dabs or some oil today and feeling it a little bit but this stuff I do Efes is hitting me harder this stuff grab me hot I'm not gonna lie like I think you can tell the baby packaging I'm just gonna say what you think about this packaging this packaging pretty sweet it's pretty slick I do like it I'm not gonna hate on looks like it's got all the regulatory standards on there open up the top here and these flaps right here have a couple little sayings on it this one says oh jeez make better oh gee that's cool I like that and then this one says preserve your Terps keep refrigerated yeah that's one over here to quality drives every decision we make from the garden to the lab to the jar that holds your cash happy beautiful that's beautiful beautiful words from 7-10 labs I'm diggin it packaging 907 as far as overall concentrator I think we shall give this ready yeah I mean this is really good Rosen its fire like I said I just haven't we're not about the rosin yet that gets me to fully commit right you know we're not rousing people we're just gonna wear em I'd rather say that rosin is not the first thing I picked out of the lineup to smoke to some of y'all that might be the first thing you picked out and that's fine by me I'll pick some here BHS it's almost like it's sort of like you know if you looked at it on a spectrum it's like that spot right in between bubble hush you know full mouth and boy right you know right it's just he has never really been a friend to the extracting process when it goes like keeping your terpenes intact and everything and yeah I think the best rosin that I've smoked are at least the turbo is another smoke doesn't in Flour mm-hmm every time I smoked some rosin that's made from bubble like this it kind of just always tastes like a slightly different version of just right so back to the rating I think what your regular right yeah that's great okay overall concentrate rating I think I'm gonna probably have to give the effect on this like a fart like a heat you know I'm not too loaded up but I definitely did get a head change as far as smell targeted in a Tazewell and looks looks our popular tonight because it's really really really Blanc got great looks so I'm gonna go eat 58.5 for Rossum I'm gonna go higher on the effect right now the effect of this is like a nine or ten for me well like from one day yeah I'm taking one dab of that the heck change is really nice cool so I'm gonna go with the night on that smell it was pretty good I'll probably go with a seven their appearance I'm gonna give them a plus one for the packaging so I'm gonna go probably eight so somewhere flavor that's why where I go lower probably six and a half seven something like that yeah so overall I'd say probably a seven or an eight whatever that method is some probably seven or eight eight five I'm being generous today I like it it's a great concentrate 7/10 labs skittles cubed thanks for watching I'm Danny I'm Shane these [Music] you", "KVFRkBbZ9-E": "everybody how you doing I stopped at the healing center today and picked up some grass roots they

supposed to be $18.00 we're at THC 65 th CA is 71 total of 76 14% terpenes which is why this stuff tastes so good I'll tell you right now it's looking like that is the most expensive thing other than

saying totally ignore that we changed all the smoke detectors batteries and there's still one that's going like beeping and we don't know which one and we've changed all of them so who knows okay just ignore it period hi guys welcome back to my channel if you're new here go ahead and smash the like button comment down below subscribe turn on those post notifications to be not quite every single time we post a new video today as you can see I do have the Eric the aircon piece that I will be heating out of and I'm finally trying some live rosin purrs you like rosin from 7-10 laughs and this is 7:10 Kim times or delicious alright here's our label gives us our THC percentage and all the info or whatever and I just noticed the way this packaging do you open it which is so cool it's like a little proposing like a there's like a ring in here I feel like I'll be proposed to right now again it says Oh juice make better oh geez okay Anna says davit low temperatures for ultimate experience okay I see you sometimes packaging this specific live rosin ranges from $80 to 105 dollars let's go ahead and open it up now this is my time so what you guys are seeing and what I'm seeing is the very first time so we're both looking at this packaging for the first time together whoa I really just open it and I can smell it whoa I look sick I've never smoked rosin before and I've never seen how rosin looks in my life look in person I mean say hello [ __ ] with diamonds from wrong garden but live rosin is like the period purest sauce and dab like you can go to rather than you know it's much purer than shadow sugar and all this so we gonna see what the real game is about today also the texture of this isn't something like I've never had before it just feels kind of like I'm looking at it slightly and it's pretty cool I can tell that's much harder and it's gonna be easier to pick up most likely you won't be falling I hope this is a good size and not too much because like I have said before I have never tried rosin I have never tried rosin and I'm barely starting to get into dabbing and all this stuff you know tears guys that was really good it was very smooth so she could sizes the size of it because I feel like that was a pretty good size for me maybe more but it's wrong Tiffani smooth not much residue I can see that there is a little bit of oil left over maybe I should we keep that Hey I think this has so far been one of the best flavors that I have tried like its energy enjoyable flavor the taste that you get once you're smelling it and exhaling it like you can really get the flavor of it Connell I want to see like the light on the lemony side probably taste good I think we need another guys who do you think and the dad were you guys having it with me hope you guys are enjoying your day wherever and whatever you guys are doing and whatever time it is I hope they they're blazing up with me another day of cosmas you know celebrating fortunately every day this one he's filming it like I said and yeah honestly the only reason why I got this one was because of the name bootylicious like that's what attracted me bootylicious that's how I usually pick up products by the names of it like or if it looks really nice the product like the weed or so or the name that it sound like like something I've never heard and it's crazy how I know this is out of a lot of topic but it's crazy how there's so many means to so many different things like bootylicious amnesia cream crack they come out with like the home just cannabis indices mind-blowing and like I always say this it's just it's more than just smoking it it's more than you're just getting tired it's a process to everything like rolling a joint there's a process to it you have to grind it up you have to roll to packing a cone you have to grind a you have to get your stuff for you have to stuff it you have to know when to stuff a because if not it'll be to lose a bong rip you know it's just a process I don't know it's enjoyable I just I enjoy it at first when I excited to dab I didn't really like it I didn't really [ __ ] with him because the whole process thing it was just like a hassle it was just like it's too much it's too much work so I'm not gonna do it and I rather just stick to something quick like a cartridge that's on the go you know I wasn't appreciating the process but now I just I really appreciate and I really like I just love having it I don't wanna put that out there I love that me now even though I'm not the biggest ever but let's go ahead and take a mother dad this is my second Dabba this is the size of it cheers guys are you rate someone to attend mm-hmm a 7/10 hell yeah hell yeah they're fired damn and I can like taste like the pureness like he's so even though it was like having me coughing it is I didn't give me like an after I know when I'm gonna take a big hit and sometimes after they hate your it all feels like very raspy I'm not feeling that like I'm just thirsty cuz I haven't drank water but the hit smooth mm-hmm I feel like in every dab you always say so smooth but by far this one has to be the smoothest I would definitely go ahead and buy this product again even if it's it ranges up to a hundred five dollars I I [ __ ] with it I [ __ ] with it this definitely convinced me you guys have been I haven't seen some comments back a few months ago I reviewed their courts and I actually like did not get the best review out of it I'm guessing I had a falsie battery or I don't know what happened but I did see a few of you mentioning that well it's like 7/10 has like the best cards or whatever like they're fire you know the fire you're like this definitely has made me want to try their products again like hurt and battery because I feel like I they could have done better but the rosin sauce definitely I would purchase again on with a heartbeat like yeah cuz this is hard to find as well and they stopped quit I wasn't even gonna end up getting this when I went to this one three whenever I went to the dispensary didn't have it and right when we were about to leave they actually stopped a permit so your likes back and we've had to get it well I hope you guys enjoyed this video and I hope you guys were getting high with me and I will see you guys until the next day of Christmas don't forget to sure knowledge for sonification see you guys can be notified every single time I post a new video which will be tomorrow so peace", "ejefY8Je5S0": "hi this is a video we're gonna be using MZ 12 the new organic product I've been using butane for a while and I find that this is a way cleaner way safer way to do an extraction of essential oils or for your cannabis so we're gonna go ahead and start and tell you how to use this today what you want to do is take a screen ground up your stuff your your product you're using whatever your product you're using is going to matter in the quality of the product that you get this is some good trim we broke it down you want to take most of stems out of it most of the ones you can see what you're gonna do then is take a glass tube or if you have a circular loop machine you can use this this solvent in a circular loop machine so what we're gonna do now is start like lightly putting this in here you want to fill up too much you want to give it a light pack not too hard but give it a nice little little firmness in there keep filling up the tube and I recommend using about a 1 foot tube for two cans to get your biggest extraction possible go ahead and fill this off you pack this with your fingers the rest of the way and you're going to take two coffee filters wrap it use a hose clamp make sure you set your drill to a low torque so you don't break the glass clean off any of debris that's left on because you don't want that falling into your area and then we're gonna take the pyrex dish and two cans of solvent outside now remember this product is flammable but not combustible like butane butane will actually combust this is more of a methane it will not you can light it on fire but it's not gonna sit to where it'll actually explode all right hold on a second gotta grab a glove make sure you put a glove on this stuff is really really cold all right make sure we have no more debris take your can with a little shake go ahead begin your extraction I like to swirl it around as I'm going down just to make sure I get all the sides and here we will have beautiful yellow liquid coming out and then I normally wipe off the top nipple and blow out of it blowing it so that you can get the rest of the solvent out of it all right we're gonna run another tube we'll see you back here in a minute that's four cans total I grabbed this tray here and I'm going to put semi warm water in it and I have an oscillating fan over here to my left so that I could blow the stuff I'm going to set that right there and then warm water and let it start to evaporate hit up with a couple particles of stuff in here so I'm gonna take a tool with a point on it and pop these right out okay now after you get all these little particles out and if you're lucky you won't get any particles at all we're gonna take this inside and begin to scrape it and we'll be back to you in a second all the product out of the Pyrex and put it on the parchment paper we're going to take this parchment paper put it in a vacuum chamber I highly recommend vacuum with everything except the new product zho that will be coming out soon that we will have which does not do much in a vacuum it's almost ready to do right on the house when you pull it out all you have to do is basically whip it and it's ready to go well for this product we will put it on a vacuum all right you'll see it starts to do its movement and then it's going to blow up then I would recommend purging it from anywhere between 30 minutes to an hour we have just sent off two samples to CW testing and our product came back with zero flammable in the top metals or solvent on it at all the only thing that I had in it was a little bit of water which is easily curable you just let it sit out or put a fan on it or pull it this stuff actually is has a consistency of silly putty or Laffy Taffy it's you can pull on it it has a golden hue to it it's really easy to handle at higher temps unlike BHO products so this to me is the real deal folks purging tank then collapsed it it was a huge dome this is the product it's a little tacky it can sit out but as you can see see and it doesn't it sticks to you a little bit not bad nothing like BHO product and look how golden this is this is pure trichomes extracted look at that and that pretty folks alright enjoy this video and enjoy yourselves and we'll see you later",

place where I don't know say you got 15 other dudes living with you or sneaky sibling that you don't want touching your terp so you can lock them up in this [ __ ] right here how [ __ ] cool is that just keep going down USB 3 USB ports to charge small devices glass touch panel for easy user control I mean just all of this sounds it sounds like you're getting one of the highest quality products ever smoked glass shelves with six slots for adjustability temperature glass door with UV protected coating Jesus flip it around to the back and we can get a view of I know it says Brooke right there but this definitely looks like the back so let's go ahead we're gonna open up this box and see what we've got going on in here first thing I'm seeing as we get into this box is USB ports which is just not something you would expect just like you got the user manual right here and some keys okay so there's two keys we can walk it up with very very nice now this is a pretty large unit I mean I'm assuming it's about a foot and a half two feet tall let me get it out real quick Oh fingerprint there we go very hard date let's say it weighs about little under 10 pounds it's not insanely heavy the quality of the outside material right here that I'm touching is just very nice this doesn't it doesn't feel like plastic I don't exactly know what this is let's take a closer look just wow that is so sleek these are just little this is just a touchscreen right here guys look at that no actual buttons just touch panel buttons if we look off to the side maybe get some zoom in on it there we go you can see the screen where it is gonna be but if as you're looking at it head on it is very hard to see very very sleek lock down here at the bottom the door opens very smoothly very easily my old turb cooler had a latch on it and it was fantastic until that latch broke and then it was kind of just pointless as we move on up to the top you can see those three USB slots up there which is just [ __ ] phenomenal so you need to charge a puff go your dad pin something it's right there on top of your turf cooler I mean assuming this is gonna be right in the middle of your session area that's gonna be really cool to have three charge points now before we get to the inside I'm gonna flip around looks like we've got some cooling vents over here big old fan in the back there you go you can see that big I mean that's a big fan and then you got your power slot right there really hefty power cable that is another benefit I'm saying I do like a thick power cable all right let's bust in here and see what we got going on all right so as we open the door to the inside Wow Wow look at that oh my god these are beautiful these are absolutely beautiful so these are just pieces of glass so you can see through them you can see the lower level of turps if you guys look down through here you could see what I mean like you could see through the shelves that is [ __ ] cool and what do we have going on down here looks like goes in there I don't know what that's for maybe to catch water humidity trap I don't know so there's three shelves these are all very nice glass shelves and you're given you're given quite a bit of room to work with here guys like what's that let's go ahead and take three ounce jars I have set over here and pop them right in here three ounce jars nicely educated in there it looks like you could fit maybe another three you probably fit in nine ounce jars on each trace there is a [ __ ] load of room for your Terps let's go ahead and plug it in and see what it looks like when it's got power running through it I really really want to see what this looks like is this design so sleek first things first though I think we should rip this bowl again cheers everyone [Music] this thing is so [ __ ] stick I don't black background exhale my smoke on ooh that wedding cake is good all right so it looks like I need a knife let's try the dad tool spinning method Jam a dab tool in the zip tie and spin it till it snaps go exactly how I planned but that [ __ ] works all right guys let's plug her in and see what we're working with here oh nice little beep on startup i'ma come around front here so right off the bat I'm definitely hearing sounds from it I don't know if you guys can hear that little light coming just sounds like a refrigeration unit we're set to 25 okay there we go that's very responsive very very responsive oh my god it has a light for your Terps what okay all right I'm [ __ ] sold got a blue light looking down on the Terps there how sick is that Wow okay that's just 10 out of 10 right there I must set my set my temperature to I don't know like 55 I have no idea what what's a good storable temperature for Terps all I know is that this thing is tits I'm gonna pop my hand in here let's see if we've got actually any refrigeration going on immediately oh yeah oh yeah but back there it's really cool to aren't ready so I'm assuming given us an hour and it's gonna be an actual little refrigerator this is 10 out of 10 a great [ __ ] product here guys I know they're gonna be expensive I know it's not gonna be everybody's cup of tea but for just that one more little piece of dabbing utensil Lola dabbing just add to your station ten out of ten this thing's sick that light so [ __ ] nice let's try the lock out here see if we can keep people out of our Terps so you got two keys become with it standard-looking guys that's it I mean you that's a really you'd have to break the lid off to get in there that that's not opening up that's a lot of pressure I'm putting on that probably actually shouldn't be putting that much pressure on it but we're here review products we're not here to [ __ ] pussyfoot around boom I was wondering about this little metal piece down here was for that so it walks in there what a cool [ __ ] product guys this is just this is so sick slide-out tray for your chirps I couldn't be [ __ ] more ecstatic about this

we've really got to get to the elephant in the room and that's gonna be the price and I know the price isn't gonna be for everybody it's gonna deter a lot of people cuz 300 bucks is a lot of money but this is more so like I've been considered almost a house decoration this is more so like modernized as a room that you put it in it's it's a very very cool piece of technology in and of itself but also wherever you put this it can be used as a kind of like a piece of furniture almost kind an axe in a room somewhere this isn't something you can like restrict to add a broom you can put this in

back at you with another episode of dab talk a series we review cannabis concentrates in six different categories value packaging looks smell taste and effect we then take these six categories write them on a one through five scale add them up divide them by six which gives us our final score today we're going to be reviewing um a brand new to me brand called seattle private reserve they're decently popular they've been around for a while but i've never tried their wax before so i'm excited to try it so seattle private reserve this company has an interesting sort of history as far as i know so uh back in the day when my friends and i used well my friends would cop it and i'd go to their house and smoke it um their seattle private reserve flower i noticed just wasn't up to snuff they were charging a lot for it and every time we got it it just never seemed you know up to par with how much they were charging but as far as i wax goes i am uninformed i have no idea so i'm excited to see if their wax is different and i'm hoping that it is different because i've seen pictures of it on instagram looks quite appetizing so yeah without further ado we're going to get right into it here value so starting off with value this gram uh costed forty dollars so not too bad um at forty dollars a gram it's not cheap at all but for this type of quality at least from what i can see it looks really high quality so from this type of quality uh forty dollars is not not terrible at all um because you can pay anywhere from i'd say low of 35 all the way up to even 60 dollars per gram for something like this um so yeah i i think the value is pretty it's it's okay it's at 40 it's kind of expensive but you're not going to be breaking the bank for it moving on to the packaging here really really like this packaging so you guys can see here they got the strain name on top source cake and then got all this information here on the side all the stats all the terpene percentage everything like that and it's all in one glass jar no cardboard no plastic no extra added waste to this product really really happy about that i love this kind of packaging y'all i think the last video that had this kind of packaging got a super high packaging rating so yeah i love this kind of packaging so now for the open test here so i think you just grab it and twist or okay hold on so if you guys see these stickers right here you are probably it's your best bet to cut them so i'm grabbing myself a tool here your best bet to slice through them with something so that you can then turn it because using the torque to turn it like the torque from your wrist is probably not going to work so right now i'm going to use this tool cut a little bit of it so i guess that's my least favorite part of the packaging so like really my only part that i don't like is that you got to kind of do a little bit of finagling to get it open but once you do that you're going to get to the goodies it's because they have two like plastic stickers there's one cardboard sticker that one's not a problem at all but they got these plastic stickers make it almost impossible wow okay this is actually a lot harder than i thought not gonna lie right i think i got it okay this is actually annoying to open i'm not even gonna lie like what what is going on here what am i not doing right can't open it dude okay this is i can't open this this is ridiculous what the [ __ ] okay sweaty hands all right so this packaging sucks i can't even [ __ ] open it this is ridiculous this packaging sucks ass dude this packaging is terrible what the heck i can't okay well i can't even like what is this i can't i'm getting so upset right now i mean what is this going to take dude for me to open god damn man like [ __ ] really still not [ __ ] opening on me all right [ __ ] all right i think i almost got it okay this almost i'm so sorry y'all but for this delay but this is this is ridiculous this might be the worst packaging i've had on the channel so far okay got this [ __ ] open holy crap okay that took how long that took like okay that took like four minutes to open i'm so sorry about that y'all but i figured you needed to see it real time [ __ ] this packaging no like [ __ ] it i thought it was good this sucks ass like what is wrong with this lid there's a bunch of like plastic [ __ ] here there's like plastic notches that you gotta like push it down and [ __ ] dude that's impossible to open this packaging is terrible this just fix these notches man i just spent five minutes opening that that's ridiculous okay deep breath calm down okay we're good i'm sure there's a couple funny ass faces i made during that i'm not gonna lie because i was getting i was starting to get pissed i was like i was wondering am i gonna get this gram open for the video or am i gonna have to stop the video but that was by far the hardest gram to open on the channel so yeah that's annoying moving on to the looks well these they look really good this looks really good it's got a really kind of a moist live resiny look to it crystal crystalline it looks really good it looks really kind of battery like it's all going to come up in one scoop which is nice you know i hate that little crumble consistency where you pick one up and it goes everywhere that shit's annoying but um but yeah i like this the looks of this one a lot moving on to the smell here okay that smells bomb it smells like so sour you see sour kush cake was it yeah sour kush cake you're definitely getting some of that wedding cake profile for sure pretty you can smell like it kind of smells sour this is really good it's got a pungent smell to it i like the smell a lot for sure pungent sour wet and cakey really nice moving on to my favorite part of the video and a much needed part of the video considering the beginning took me five minutes to open the taste i need a fat dab right now that was ridiculous y'all that that was ridiculous i literally had to grab this screwdriver and like do some really weird crap to get this open but i did it i got it open so here's a present to myself for getting this gram open cheers huh all right whoa that did it okay um it tastes really good i'm not even gonna put the lid back on i'm just going to like set it on top let's [ __ ] that but it tastes really good it's got kind of a the same kind of sour wedding cakey taste that it was smelling like there i really like that really strong really really clean all the way throughout really really nice uh taste on this product on to the effect here sorry y'all dying a little bit over here moving on to the effect so i like this this effect now that i've been sitting here for a couple seconds it's a nice it's a nice hybrid like i said about the uh i'm pretty sure it was the runts i feel like i can either work out right now which i just did or i can relax and play with like play with my dogs or watch something or whatever it is that you do when you like to relax you can do that after this train it's a nice nice evenly even keel uh sort of hybrid i really like the effect on this one i like the the older i get the more i like the hybrids um moving on to the ratings portion of the video now so for value okay so at forty dollars a gram you're getting a really good quality concentrate you really are the only problem i have with it is it's incredibly hard to open so like if they fix the packaging on this one the value would be a little like higher but the fact that you're paying forty dollars a gram to spend like five minutes struggling to open it with a screwdriver that's that's annoying that's that's ridiculous so i'm gonna i'm gonna say for that the value gets a 2.5 out of five because the concentrate was really good just fix the packaging because that was enough to like almost that almost made me quit filming because i i was like dude am i going to sit here for 10 minutes because that was long enough i mean that was ridiculously long the amount of time i sat there tried to open that so i was just i had to i had to open it and luckily i got it open but yeah it's terrible 2.5 out of 5 for the value packaging okay packaging one out of five i'm literally giving that a one out of five because that that is so annoying like you guys i'm sure you guys saw i was getting like legitimately mad at that freaking container like that's ridiculous so one out of five in the packaging no wii container should make you angry none that's ridiculous moving on to the looks so really like the looks on this one it's got kind of a orangish sort of tint to it it's nice um you guys will see the high resolution photo of course but really like the looks on this one i'm gonna go ahead and give the looks a four out of five because those are really good really prime looks moving on to the smell uh that smells awesome uh it smelled really really good it smelled like uh like i said kind of a sour wedding cake profile so really good i'm going to go ahead and give the smell 3.5 out of 5. moving on to the taste the taste was just like it smelled really like the exact same sour wedding cakey taste i really like that as well giving that a 3.5 out of 5. moving on to the effect so i really like this effect definitely took me down a few notches after getting upset over that whole thing but yeah i'm liking this effect a lot it's really really really nice um [Music] yeah it's like like i said it's like a 50 50 hybrid so you're getting that sativa sort of pick me up um sun's out guns out sort of thing you know if you want to go lift some weights and you're getting that relaxation body high feeling if you want to relax and not really do much after working out or working or whatever it is you do so uh yeah i'm really a fan of this effect a lot it's one of my favorite ones on the channel so far so i'm going to give it a 3.5 out of 5 as well so yeah for that that gives us 18 divided by 6 equals 3 out of 5. that might have been one of the first even numbers we've had on this channel as far as the writing goes but yeah three out of five would i buy this again man okay so like i really like the really like everything about this the packaging i mean now that i know how to open it i'll probably buy it again but that's the the way this is the way this packaging is i don't know man they really got to fix it that was so upsetting so would i buy it again probably i don't know i think there's better options out there for 35 to 40 but if they put this wax in like an abstract container absolutely i would buy it again hope you guys are enjoying my content uh hope you guys enjoyed my little mini freak out earlier in this video i'm sure it was mildly entertaining or boring either way yeah please like and subscribe if you like this channel um i know i get kind of repetitive with the content so far but i plan on branching out soon i just don't have enough resources yet to really fully branch out like i would like to so really enjoying the support y'all peace out", "v5fOb0iqI8I": "this video will be showing the extraction process from beginning to end we have not done this yet I don't know why but we did now and the first thing when you're doing adho or bhl run is packing your tube you don't want to pack too tightly and you want the gases to be able to flow through the material this is a 12 inch - this - beholds 42 grams of a bone-dry flour and when blasting blasts outside be safe about it and this can this - would this extraction - would normally take two and a half cans of pr3 - - but this is just using one after you blast you get it in a warm water bath you just find a bowl that the pyrex dish that you've lasted in can fit in we fill the bowl with hot water when the bubbles stop it's done and then collection I still kind of like doing it with the razors I like scraping it up you can there's various ways of collection and I prefer this and when you're done you can let it air dry for a few hours but virtually after you blast you could get done as a sauce and then here we got it in the vac chamber making crumble the and this is libraries in the strawberry strawberry haze but if you

can make it work bro so I very much appreciate you accent we're gonna get that [ __ ] going for sure hey my name is Roy oh I just had to fix a bunch of [ __ ] with my car so here's a good question what car do you drive what's your dream car mine's a challenge I think then [ __ ] thing's are awesome nice I currently drive a 2 Series Beemer it's the entry-level I don't know it looks sick it's really it's literally like the cheapest BMW that you can buy but everyone kind of thinks it looks chill and it looks so for me I was thinking about upgrading my car really soon and like getting a good trade-in value for it I think the plan is now I'm just gonna keep my car because it's paid off and I don't want to put on a little payment so I'm just gonna drive my car until I graduate and then when I graduate I'm gonna buy myself a fat ass with I'm already saving for it but I want it to be an everyday driver and I want it to be under a hundred grand alright none and I got it if they came in GT four came in Porsches PDK I would definitely cop that like that's like the for sure cop if I had any amount of money I would get a GT four I know everyone's gonna be like bro but the manual transmission but like dude it's a robot it makes you go faster he's like broom broom you know what I mean you know no no no Eric Congrats on 300k yeah enemy my question is what are you most excited about in sales in 19 and for everyone watching my birthday is April 21st I'll be in New York City DME if you want to come [ __ ] party this it yeah the party's Henry I'm ready for a lot of [ __ ] man I think the main thing I'm excited for if you guys don't know I made it my new year's resolution to travel once a month so I've done it already for the first three months this month for 420 we're going to San Fran next month I already mentioned earlier we're going to Miami hi in the summer months I don't know we're trying to plan something fat trying to be something cool because I've never even been out of the country and I never really traveled before this year but now I have the mean so you not have a reason to his YouTube [ __ ] so it's gonna be cool man that's what I'm most excited for I'm just gonna travel all over the country hopefully out of the country at one point he's got to find the right deals and then it's kind of worth it so hey travelin that's what I'm most excited for the youtubes shit's gonna be cool too but like I think the YouTube comes with the traveling you know what I mean obviously I'm gonna bring my camera obviously I'm gonna be smoking where I'm going so it kind of goes inside with one another you know what I mean it was good my name is Sam I'm here in Austin Texas yeah yeah I was born there if you do anywhere in the world up and just smoke chew and Julie scenery the view you know where'd you go oh this would have been a tough question like an hour ago but I I was just thinking about that actually it's kind of weird but the aurora borealis anywhere where I can see that I know there's a lot of countries in Europe or just like northern country you can probably see it in like Sweden and there's like a whole bunch of like Greenland Iceland I don't know I want to go roll up a nice fat joint and watch the aurora borealis and trip my mind maybe drop a little tab maybe I don't know probably if we're gonna be honest if I'm over there then yeah I'm probably gonna drop down the southern lights look pretty sick to you no one talks about that underrated but I mean the Northern Lights bro they're all green and [ __ ] like come on you know you trip balls looking at that yeah so this is an easy one I forgot your name what you're saying Mitch Mitch yeah all right this is an easy one man said it before I'll say it again I just balanced my [ __ ] by smoking after I'm done with all my important stuff so usually I'll wake up I'll go to school answer emails do all that stuff pretty sober and then once like the business day ends you know like 5:00 p.m. type [ __ ] then I'm just like all right [ __ ] off and I already streamed before that I start my stream every day at 3:30 so it's just like I'm kind of clocked out by that time I make sure I have nothing else like the main thing that I make sure of is that if I were to just smoke too much and pass out I wouldn't be irresponsible you know I wouldn't miss any deadlines or oh of course I just realized it was it was in 1080 man that's the worst anyway just make sure that if you get too high it's gonna be alright you can just Joe and be high cuz that's the worst thing to like when you're high and you're getting high and you remember that you have like homework you do or have to like edit a bit or upload a vid or I do this and then it's just like dams it's kind of like a buzzkill on the hunt you know I mean like I like a stress-free just chill chill high and if I have things to worry about and it's not gonna happen yo my name is Daniel and my question is what is your favorite strain right now right now yesterday right now oh shoot right now purple punch it's green it was Green crack for a while everyone the real fans know like bro Green Craig been your favorite for a while would happen purple punch man when you get the purple punch bud if you ever had some purple punch extracts like I had some lunch time as dude almost came like I almost like came soft that wasn't even hard or anything like I just [ __ ] almost came my pants but hey it was ridiculous so far but I'm Eric - Patrick I want to know the shirtless big come on bro Stan how long can I do a keg stand bro I don't have everyday cakes in my life I got shot gonna be real nice I can beer bong it'd be real nice I've never done a cake set man I'm a [ __ ] [ __ ] for that hey we'll get a cake Sancerre don't even worry about all right now that you put it in my mind I've actually never done any kicks in so I got you bro you were what session was probably the 42 grand moon rock even though that wasn't really one session if you don't want to count that that is probably the hounds in one sitting either one of them those that's I don't mean that that's a lot bro I don't really like blow down too hard like everyone gives me this leg this [ __ ] they're like bro I smoke like Suge like maybe you do bro I spent like two grams a day like including the stream to three grams a day probably like it's not that much I mean yeah smoking every day's a lot but I am 100% sure that there is a decent amount of you that smoke more than me I'm not worried but it isn't a competition bro like I've never been like dude I've smoked way more than that guy like that's just some some little dick [ __ ] right there man that is some little deed confidence right there what's up [ __ ] yeah appreciate that chase why did I start smoking honestly all my friends started smoking before me and I didn't really want to try it because like I heard all the [ __ ] in middle school was like you don't do drugs don't smoke weed like dude not do any of these things stay away from it her different parents are teachers counselors everybody so I was like of course I'm not gonna get involved my friends want to get involved they can't I'm not gonna stop him you know what I mean but as I kept hanging out with him I was like they're not really negatively effected like all these things that I thought was gonna happen to him like none of them happened there was still just who they were and they were just hi and I was like dude if I was like they can just be high and still be functional still do good in school still work their jobs or whatever and I was like I'm down so tried it out summer going into sophomore year of high school and it was a good time than it was and I was like [ __ ] it I was like I might just have to keep on doing this you know what I mean like it's not hurting me at all it's giving me a good vibe let's smoke some weed from now on and then the rest is history bro you already know what it is you know Eric your Inlet yo what's up Eric my name is Travis and my question is would you ever give up smoking for a job and if you would what John would have to be like that answer is so much different now than it was a year ago because like this this weed tube [ __ ] in like this this whole thing is actually leading stuff like a meeting companies that meeting all these people that are willing to give me jobs and it's like I don't think I'm gonna have to man but but let's just say all of it falls through let's say [ __ ] tomorrow Trump's like [ __ ] that [ __ ] you pot heads no more weed it all makes it federal again schedule one keeps it and it's just like completely [ __ ] then in that case I would give up smoking weed for a job that's like six figures probably like above yeah yeah that's like a comfortable living you know what I mean like I don't need to be a millionaire or anything but if I'm given a weed it's gotta be worth it you know what I mean it's not gonna be hard to give up like I don't think I'm gonna smoke weed forever if we're gonna be a hundred percent real like I think I'm probably gonna stop or at least take a break when I have a kid but like until then bro do you I'm not having a kid for like another decade so until then we're smoking this [ __ ] but like I don't think I'm gonna smoke it forever I'm not gonna wanna maybe when the kids a little older then I started like I don't know man the futures trippy to think about like I genuinely don't even know what the [ __ ] gonna happen in like a year that's like a asking like what are you gonna have for dinner tomorrow night but anyway I think it's pretty much done yeah that's done um that's [ __ ] gross all right appreciate you guys for coming through you guys are the absolute best 300k I love you all so so much you're all the homies man this is our year I told you 2019 was our year and everyone was like dude I mean no one really said they didn't believe but just imagine that someone was like nowhere that's not not 2019 SRU baby alright I appreciate you guys so much man make sure to check out the sponsors in the description make sure to check out the links in description to social medias all that [ __ ] I'll see you guys in the next one when she's gonna be on Wednesday I think I'm uploading this on Tuesday we did in my bed supposed to be uploaded yesterday I usually put every Monday Freddie you know it is peace I'll see you [Music]", "A0hZd1ueLtg": "hi my name is cue Pinson is Wednesday in Colorado Springs and Wednesday is important because it is one of the days we like to Rio now before I get started I want to say follow me on twitch TV slash coupons for more awesome live content now Wednesday it's one of the days of the week we get deals on concentrate Wednesday and Saturday are two of the bigger days wax Wednesday and Saturday as they call them not everybody has those deals but a lot of places to do so we always like to look on Wednesday and I always start in the comfort of my own home on weed naps calm want the best places to look they have plenty of deals they can look up everything in my area there's bounce deals there's grand bills there's plenty options there so we're gonna get a little bit of an idea of what's out there before we get started and hopefully we get some really bang stuff today we are in the car here headed to the ATM most dispensaries are cash businesses and it's a lot easier to tip and purchase things with cash oftentimes so we're headed to the ATM to pick up some cash and I'm looking here on my phone actually and signed up at a few dispensaries for their text message alerts and they'll text me with their daily or weekly deals or if they have kind of flash or fire sales as they call them so we're gonna look through a few more deals here on the phone I already have a few ideas from weed Maps so we're gonna maybe go to a few places today once we decide but right now we're headed to get some cash and the dispensaries we are leaving the bank now we pulled out $80 we found a few good deals from a few dispensaries we're gonna go check out the first one now but we're gonna see what we can get with $80 today now I've had some good luck in the past getting a low price grams but we're gonna see what today hold so if they don't have good stuff we're gonna move on but hopefully we can get a few really bang grams for about 80 bucks here okay we are at our first stop for today one of my favorite dispensaries we are at high hopes cannabis with a cause I just started shopping here recently and I haven't been disappointed they have excellent products they always have great prices and the staff here is really friendly so we're gonna go in here and see if we can get some excellent stuff for today okay we are just leaving high hopes now it seems as though the prices are so good today that they've been cleared out so we were able to pick up a couple of different grams that concentrate as well as a pre-roll joint so we've got a gram of blackberry head band sugar and a gram of Agent Orange live sugar and we got a pre-roll joint of that lemon diesel we're gonna enjoy later so excellent prices but the selection was a little light because they must have just got raided oh man the views are sick the trees are covered in frost there's plenty of plenty of cool things to see in Colorado Springs we are outside of our second dispensary shop for today as you can see the views here are insane worse not that Apothecary farms powered by apothecary extracts one of my favorite dispensaries you can get apothecary extracts all over Colorado but they have a few of their own dispensary locations where you can pick up directly so here we are at apothecary farms in the springs looking for some more concentrates what of you over here we are just leaving apothecary Farms had to stop for a moment to check out that gorgeous view it was too good to pass up but we picked up a couple more grams from apothecary we got a gram of axilla wax and we also got a gram of their jam band lime batter which I've been hearing a lot of great things about and they were recommending it there too so we definitely picked up a couple of good ones here and I'm excited to try these right so we've spent all the money we've pulled out for dabs today we got four different grams as well as a pre-roll joint we didn't spend everything we had we've got a little leftover so I'm gonna do a little bit of foresight here a foreshadowing and then we're gonna get some munchies for later I found some coupons in the mail today so we are just going to get our munchies now and we are going to enjoy the dabs later foam pepper on the tomato black olives cucumber and the spinach oh I see this business and what also I'll just go with a little bit of that yeah we'll go at the now thank you good eat just like these chips later bad there's one thing you never expect to see him it's a trenchcoat you never expected so I realized my car is super dirty so we've pulled into a car wash here it's getting clean now my card is getting a pound and it's gonna be a while so we're gonna get up oh yeah and we are on our way home to enjoy our spoils for today more amazing views Colorado Springs is beautiful okay so we just got back home and went to two different dispensaries today high hopes and apothecary farms we got two grams of concentrate from each and we also got a pre-roll joint from my host so let's see we got a few different concentrates different grams here and a pre-roll joint we're all joint one gram of the lemon bezel good stuff nice price on this usually pick these up we got the gram of blackberry headband sugar blackberry headband sugar this is the one that is not a live and let's take a look oh this one looks very nice blackberry had been sugar wax very good stuff this one is from high hopes let's take a look at the other one this is their Agent Orange live sugar so we got a gram of the Agent Orange live this one's a little bit more expensive looks like that one got a little bit mixed up in the bag there I had it sitting upright but maybe it was upside down and that one smells very good check that out check that out this one is really saucy this one has a very very strong smell to it okay and then we also got two other grams from apothecary right and I know we got to two different two kinds here here's the axilla wax this one is 73% th if I can get a difference I'll never focus focus anyway seventy three point nine percent THC this one looks great excellent concentrate in there and one last one we got was the jam band live better and this one is very popular the employees were raving about of this one is eighty two point nine percent THC this one is a really good really good strands got a very good smell right when I open it it smelled amazing so let's take a look here oh yeah this live better okay so let's invite my girlfriend in here near there to do some Deb here is one more look at our spoils for today we got the BlackBerry headband sugar we got some gaygent orange lime sugar we got that pre-roll joint of lemon diesel from high homes we got that axle wax and we also got some jam band live batter so we've got a couple of emails plugged in here into our high five vape and we are ready to death alright we are finally back home we got the emails fired up and we're going to try a few of these out here what do you got there jam band you got that jam band from apothecary and I've got some Agent Orange live sugar from high hopes that's a really tasty the jam ban that's the last one okay we got our last couple of dabs lined up here I've got some of that axilla wax what do you have the BlackBerry headband sugar let's see how these ones taste oh that one's smooth and sweet like that so everything passed the test we got some great concentrates today and we got a couple of live options we spent a little more on the live better in the live sugar but the taste is very good we spent I think just under $80 for four grams that concentrates in the pre-roll joint so I think was around 76 for everything not a bad price for today I

other social media below for more content in the future thank you guys for hanging out today", "0EK9fDuN5JA": "hey what is up canna fam and check it out for today's video I'm gonna be trying out some of this 9 pound hammer this is the 9 pound hammer by emerald extracts I have not yet tried this company before this is a new one for me but this is the more budgeted end of the spectrum here in Oregon as far as dabs go meaning that these are $13 a gram for rec and it's like eight or nine dollars gram for medical here in the state of Oregon and so these are the more budgeted lower end and the reason I picked them up is because they have such I don't know if you can see it right now through the package but they have such good color to that I mean that's it looks good it looked really good so I was like you know what I'm gonna try it I'm gonna see if it's worth a damn because sometimes just because an item or a product or whatever is cheap doesn't make it shitty there's a lot of a lot of you know heady dabbers or whatever you want to call them that are like my gems don't cost forty to sixty dollars of gram if I'm that smoking live resin or if I'm at smokin Diamonds then [ __ ] your shitty oil then get that kind of ignorant [ __ ] thinking out of here that's [ __ ] and so anyway we're gonna try these out and we're gonna see I'm gonna let you guys know what I think okay this is just my honest opinion of these follow these guys on Instagram emerald extracts and again this is the nine pound hammer so if you're a fan of the nine pound hammer strain at all let me know in the comments section below and this is coming in at 72 percent THC which is fairly good for a lower end product so to speak so most products that are in that kind of price range usually they're like 50 higher 50s you know anywhere in the 60s per cents so if you can get a product that's 70 or or higher that it to me already is like a big plus okay so I'm just gonna point that out there we're not oh it's got 0.6 C like just a little tiny itty-bitty little bit of CBD in there uh it does not tell me terpenes or anything like that here on the back of either or so that is kind of like a whatever you want to say you know I wish I like when companies tell me the terpenes and stuff like that but nonetheless regardless 72% that is still makes me happy all right so I'm gonna go ahead and open one of these up these bad boys up see this this kind of it's not paper even though I'm like this kind of paper it works great I forget what it's named the science name behind it is the technical term but I do love this I love when they come on this kind of paper so there it is I said paper if you know what this is this material right here then let me know in the comment section below I forget somebody told me a couple times I forgot the name [ __ ] stoners right but anyway that is not bad especially for a $13 gram that is definitely not bad looking like that's why I picked this up I'm sure you can tell and see now why I was like you know what I'll try it out oh it actually has like a actually has like a little sweet smell to it it's already starting to be like okay okay not bad good test results good you know got some good color to it it's a little sappy it's a little you know I wouldn't touch it with my fingers or anything like that it you know probably get a little messy but I mean overall it looks so far so good alright let's do this for this for this product review or whatever you want to call it I'm going to be using this deep sea break here by Empire Glass Works it's one of my favorite favorite rigs just because of all the detail you got dory you can see dory in there little cameo but i mean it's just a really nice rig but then you got the drop down with the turtle and all that I really enjoy it and then uh I don't have my uh not my light on me right here but this treasure chest is actually UV reactive so that's really cool as well a little bonus to this rig but I like this if you'd like to pick one up and go to Empire smokes calm right now and get your own if you like this rig right here really nice rig and again shout out to Empire Glass Works they make some really good good petty stuff that's very affordable so I oh right oh right if you've ever had emerald extracts and you've ever tried this company before any of their products it doesn't matter doesn't have to be this nine pound hammer or not but if you've ever tried any of their products let me know your thoughts your opinions in the comment section just let me know because I'm always open to feedback man always like to hear what people have to think maybe somebody had a bad experience or maybe somebody found some kind of product that they have this you know ultra amazing you never know you never know using this OPEC OPEC quartz pinger let's split them using here got the blue bottom on it ask me about that Wham all right okay we're gonna let that cool down here and I got an all right sighs stab I'm probably gonna get a little bit more of this on this - stick there we go get a little bit more a little bit fatter of a dab some all right sighs Deb I mean look at that color that is bright look at that is that is a nice color I like that I do that that's to be honest this is the kind of color that you get with a lot more expensive you know higher end dabs so to speak you know like the 30 40 dollar range this is kind of so to be able to get that for $13 so I'm just already kind of blown away now I really hope it tastes good that's kind of the big deciding factor in all this to be honest if this tastes like [ __ ] then I'm gonna be very disappointed because you know looks can be deceiving so I have had some stuff before that has looked really good but then tasted like a burnt tire and it was just uh you know what I mean so looks can be deceiving but overall so far I mean good test results good looks it smells good so we're gonna put it to the test right now and again I hope you guys are all having a good day I love you guys thank you for watching my video let's put this to the test in let's see what we got here we might have found a gym [Music] [Music] Wow Wow look at my face hug wow that totally sweet it's super sweet like overall it tastes just like ninety pound hammer I just I'm really shocked this is awesome [Music] that's it's really good that is and it's got a really good height to it hits right away immediate it's not like a creeper or anything like that like it it's nice it's nice and definitely uh definitely tell it's in a 70% I'll Dean definitely tell [Music] that's still good even even as a reheat it's still the terpenes are still there like wow hats off to emerald extracts like you guys killed it with this one [Music] yeah no they did a great job with that I'm very impressed I'm overall very like I'm really happy I got it and I'm really happy that I got two grams and not just one something just told me that hey this stuff is gonna be pretty good that's all I just went with my gut feeling on it and it was right sounds great man like that great product I just gotta say that if emerald extracts ever actually watches this video then hats off to you guys you guys did a great job and you know the fact that you know it's a very affordable I mean that's even more amazing like oh I love it so that was a little bit worried like I said because looks can be deceiving I've gotten product before that has looked amazing like super transparent you know nice beautiful golden amber color you know what I mean like some good test results like 76 78 you know around there and then it just tasted like a burnt tire it was it was so bad that you you didn't even want to smoke the rest of it you take like one davon you bet you know what I mean so looks can be deceiving with certain products here in the cannabis industry so you know just you know forewarned you know not everything is as it is advertised or as it looks alright there is a lot of false advertisements here in the cannabis industry as well so but anyway besides all that great job - thumbs up I give it a - big thumbs up amazing job Emeril extracts again I'm happy I grabbed two of them it's a it's a nice sweet nine pound hammer terpenes are great test results great 72% I mean the overall look I mean it's like I said it's a little sappy you know it's not totally stable or anything like that but at the end of the day it's still a great product and and the price point is to be icing on the cake okay it's like the icing and sprinkles on top so to be able to get something like that good when usually that that would be like 25-30 dollars if not maybe like 36 or something like that around there that hats off to you again to big thumbs up in my opinion I loved it let me know if you guys have tried this company before let me know if you've tried the nine pound hammer strain before do you like nine pound hammer let me know in the comments section below on this video and I hope you guys have a great rest of your day I hope maybe you guys found this video somewhat informational maybe next time you're in your dispensary browsing and you guys see these on these shelves you're like hey I remember that one weird white guy who's like they're not bad you should try them come on I'm gonna get one do it alright I say do it [ __ ] it boss the wall I love you guys hope you guys have a

organic home buds we're gonna do a lot of real fast then we are going to go and do some blasting so hopefully you're dabbing along and if you ain't you roll one up smoking along you're gonna take a big ol off Cheers let's go blast what is up fam alright so we are out my garage as you can see we are about to blast two cans of pure 322 with twenty three point five grams so yes I'm outside I have plenty of air movement out here so not worried about that got a couple things just in case this gets cold keep my hands nice and warm but let's see how this turns out I pre lie in my pan with parchment paper so let's see how it goes as you can see here's the lovely tube enough it'll show close up try not nice small little nuggets in there a little bit of a small trimming I guess you would consider a shake all frost if you've seen a couple beats with pics in it where it showed on them real nice frosty nugs that's in here so let's see what this product can do organic Sullivan peer 322 let's put this to test tears fan alright fam here goes one can about to start the extraction fifty three and a half grams of some fire frost so far not too bad on the fries in the hands so probably wouldn't even needed the glove actually it is getting cold though I could feel the coldness so it's slowly about the work towards almost where the field is at now so we should be seeing something coming with a couple seconds to the next king well know few seconds yep here comes now you can see it coming and pouring out so far it's super gold looking as soon as I can get the two cans I'll bring up an up close picture city off and check it out it's a really gold yellow yeah definitely smart to use this little oven mitt just for anything that rolls down the can it stops my hand from freezing end to one can going around to win the second can definitely a nice gold yellow super gold yellow but also when you got some nice frosty nug it should hopefully be some nice gold yellow here in a second I'll let you guys check it out you guys can tell me what you think nice comes out nice definitely ain't bad I think I'm going to try this again a couple different directions see if I can make some diamonds up with this so definitely keep an eye out and keep watch out for some more videos the Blasted is the next one probably going to be with some diamonds and then after that see what else I can try definitely next time I'm a vest in the stand because it does get a little tiring holding it but it looks like I'm have a good turnout there's still coming out nice and yellow it hasn't hit clear yet now just blows extra out cuz just air going through she does definitely get a little tiring with 2k after toucans yeah you'll probably not want to say you'll do this again without getting a stand one can ain't bad two cans your arm gets a little tired try it from all the pressure as you see it does get pretty cold so there's a wise choice to use a mitt all right I think that's all she wrote so I'm gonna hold this in this hand now I'm gonna bring y'all over so you can see some of this nice beautiful golden yellow look at that golden yellow so now we're gonna sit I'll be back I'll show you how it turns out we got a Ford 24-hour wait I will be back and show you the results cheers fan later what's that fam silver back as you can see it already started you've a parade a little bit decent amount look how golden yellow that is nice can you hear it you can hear the little book the bubbles fuzz and making a little fuzz popping sound this is really sweet so far I'm liking it but like I said we'll have to come back I'll have to check this out as soon as it's done we'll test out the product see how it tastes how clean it is the effects stay tuned much love fam later what is up fam so we are back it's been I don't know within an hour and at 62 degrees outside it is forming I would say like diamonds but maybe it's just because it's a little chilly so it's a little frosty like kind of like ice cube so it's going to take a little longer to finish evaporating but yeah just figured out a let you guys get a look update resuming here there we go see I like the diamonds but like I said it might be maybe because it's cold so we're gonna come back let you see how it looks here shortly peace alright so we are back again it's been I want to say another 20 minutes you can see it's a little drier now watch this when I give it when I blow on it a little bit to move the evaporation a little bit faster watch the bubbles and watch everything move around now that's pretty cool so as it finishes I will keep coming back with some updates much love and respect fam data alright fam so after about two hours I came inside cuz I dropped down to 50 degrees and this is where we are at nice beautiful gold it's finishing off so as soon as it's completely done I will definitely be back show you we will sample it out Cheers what is up fam Organic home buds back with the final results

because in reality what's inside the little cartridge that you get as there's concentrated you can buy them you know i think in half grams grams at dispensaries and things like that is a concentrate yep i mean we've broken one early on in our and we'll get into that there's a lot of times everything from um is the most basic kind you know make sure that you're subscribed and you have notifications on um by doing that you'll get all the kind of cannabis academy updates at least i mean we've gone over almost all the basics now we'll start getting into guests guest speakers stuff on cbd i mean just all kinds of great things on it um i have to take this down just seeing a little thing on the corner of my eye yeah i'm like oh my eyes [ __ ] it's still bothering me like i could like i've been looking forward to getting into this one since we've been doing yeah academy because i i have a big huge debt so what it is is for everyone that doesn't know because we do forget sometimes it because we do this all the time and it's something we medicate on first of all we're not telling anybody to go and do drugs we're not advocating the sale illegally or anything we're talking about something that is recreational and medical legal here and we both have cards anyways prior to the legality so but we're just saying um this is wax crumble shatter dabs i mean really you can go on and on i'm just trying to associate the names that people might have heard how these things are all made the different levels of them that's that's that's weird [ __ ] man that's i go i'm way more into that one i want the one over there and like which one's strong i want that one yeah yeah how much oh that one's only thirteen yeah no no no no no go up go up higher tier diamonds not yeah you're definitely here i you're definitely a top shelf shopper i'll give you that one i like yeah yeah i like to have once you start really nailing in you know we'll get into that here in just a second the the really terpy profiles you enjoy it's really hard to avoid that and so when you want to get to those specifics you end up having to aim at that time and the terps are for like the land i'll give everyone the layman because i mean yeah i tell you what for everything everything i get into detail-wise you can just jump in with the lavender that is the flavor on the back of your tongue and the nasally like piney look there's a hundred different kinds of terpenes and it's any group of hydrocarbons that produce a certain type of flavor and different different terpenes not only deliver different flavors but different smells different effects and and so you it touches the back your nose some of the famous ones for those of you that are like well what's the term i don't even heard of terpenes before you haven't haven't you didn't even know it sometimes it's in the name of the strain you're smoking if it's lemon og it probably has a lot of the limo lean terpene in it which has that sort of lemon and a citrus flavor and smell to it and that's where you get that that terpene versus taste profile um so concentrate's been around forever yep forever so as far back as as um uh 10 000 bc in china they found um a hash keef mixture which was believed that they would take a bunch of sticky sticky wheat i had a 1990s cali they would take a bunch of sticky sticky weed and they would take a bunch of the keef and they would coat their hands and keef and then they would just rub the sticky sticky buds between their hands like this to all the trichomes would stick with the keef and get this layer of this sticky trichomes um the the trichomes are the sticky little parts and i'll get into that again in a minute too but it's the outside of the bud and that's where you're going to get a lot of the thc content and keef is usually what's in the bottom of a multiple stage grinder it's all the dried parts of that that's fallen off and it's the little crystals that have fallen off and the little hairs that have fallen off of the weed and so that keef is technically a concentrate in and of itself said grinder sorry that keep pretending to concentrate in and of itself but still i wrote it down but they would make that also there and so this this this hashish is is the first you know oldest form of the of concentrates it's been around for a while it's not a new thing but using science and technology we've really sort of perfected it and got into different options with it i actually early on in my years of smoking weed ran into concentrates something called hunting oil back in and so and they often call it co2 oil now they used to just take a normal cigarette and just roll it in this oil and then you would just and it was thc oil that's all it was uh basically they were like making butter for edibles instead using an oil like basically co2 oil is used by using co2 and pressure and and you can then squeeze basically out you can as if you're it's a reverse vacuum you know so instead of going into space where there is no air and then something explodes you're basically using pressure to squeeze out and i remember smoking being like what did he give us and he was like it's just it's just cheese he was like no i would never but but it's pure thc oil and if you're not used to that you're [ __ ] up now i was smoking flower that looked like it came over between rocks now there's too many two main kinds of concentrates and that's solvent and and solvent less or non-solvent solvent means you use you use something or usually a liquid but it can be a gas like co2 you use something to separate the the thc from the weed plant if you use something besides water pressure or heat then it's solvent-based if you use propane butane co2 alcohol like rick sampson oil rsoll super famous been around for a long time it's what they give the the little girls with cancer to give them to stop having seizures if they're epileptic you know it's rso oil we've done we have to be honest you can you can dab our soil you know it will puncture it in the face it will absolutely puncture the face now here's how they do rso oil we're not going to break down into how they do each and every one we'll save that for the more in-depth episodes but just to throw it out there how a solvent one works rso oil is a solvent-based um concentrate and this uh well what they do there usually is you'll get a large mason jar and you'll fill it full of weed an ounce or so and then you put alcohol in there and and the most common one is you do something like everclear and then you close the jar on that you give it about an hour or so and you you a little bit of agitation squeeze and strain and then you take this alcohol mixture that'll be a lot darker in color caramel in color that's dumped out it's evaporated and then what's left over is now your rso oil it's hard to judge exact concentrations amounts is it back bro not only is it back it is solely flying directly into mine just messing with you that one one fly that comes around only when we record and only so the rso oil that's an idea that's an example of solving the fly i am sorry i wanted it was mocking that's all right it was looking at my face most of your solvent-based concentrates are going to be between 60 to 80 percent thc now most of your solvent lists the ones that aren't using that process contrary to popular belief are actually usually equal to or stronger than the solvent-based extracts your solvent-less ones are just the heat water pressure those real real basic ones so like um the most common is when you just take like uh just heat and press you take a little weed put it between parchment paper two hot plates squeeze them together you squeeze hard and out comes the the product right which i want to do like immediately yeah getting that breath um so when you're also looking at these concentrates and you're hearing like the percentages because like i said i i want everyone to be safe and i have to break it down for like the moment by the way if you go and you're getting the vape pens um you're not getting the same the delivery of it isn't the same as if you're superheating it through a any kind of torch or nail or anything like that it's a predetermined electronic temperature coil so you're probably getting in the 30 to 50 range of it's stronger than flour that's why i included it in concentrates you're not getting the same don't think if you are pulling on a pen all the time and that's your way of of you're getting a you're getting a preset dope and then a friend gives you a dab rig that that is going to be the same as this because it's not it's not it's danger it's danger if you think that yeah that's the difference because it's like having a pill and being able to lick the pill every time you want to hit that's your vape pen or taking a pill and crushing it down and being able to snort that sucker all at once which would be the same which would be like would you don't condone in any way shape or form drug use or abuse telling you to smoke weed or concentrate or just given information it's a it's an over exaggeration of the the difference of of extremity between the two classes um oh you got it too so the i might have said extremity oh yeah that moment yeah i didn't i stuck with the extreme no it was good but i would have i could have i saved i might even talk about it i'm just very medicated at this moment so there's the different ways of consuming the concentrates you can either put some on your weed bowl if you're gonna have a pipe that's got flour in it a lot of people will take some of the softer ones like i like like a sugar or a crumble and you can put those down because those have a lower taste so good too does it have a lower uh temperature point tastes so good but usually often even then you won't get the full release of the terpenes in there because you're not reaching that appropriate boiling point or reaching point to release that um each one that whether it's solventless um which is just like i said the heat and water which is your bubble hash your hash your keef your rosin that means you're not using anything but the heat water pressure to get those notes now that's i'm like i need i need to have okay that's okay um um but i like this a lot of the more common ones a lot of the more common ones that are able to produce a desired texture or temperature point or the ones you usually see in the dispensaries a lot more often which is your wax your shatter um your butter your diamonds let me ask you you're gonna get those for a layman like maybe a little advanced layman why is shatter the one thing that's just lesser quality what what is that like just the most basic extract or so and i don't know actually it because it goes through less of a refining process it has more overall plant source material still in there taking up space for what would other be pure thc just the basics yeah it's a really it's a not as refined level of concentration be clear if you don't have don't dab shatter either you will get just a start small and no matter what type you're going to try start with the size of a half of a grain of rice that's that's the tip okay if it's r oil not i suggest you start with the size of half of a grain of rice that's the same that's recommended by uh other people you can check with uh potguide.com i'll put a reference there so it's not me saying it i'm referencing that you according to potguide.com half a grain of rice half a grain of rice of any concentrate type if you're charting it if it's your first time trying it you start with a half a grain of rice size yeah it'll get ripped and that way because you're gonna that's a potent amount no matter what type it is if you haven't tried it yeah us it seems like a half a gram right right because i do i'm thinking about i'm like no no i remember i remember starting off when it was just a tip it could be a little bit just on the end of the tool half a grain of rice would last you three different hitting sessions yeah in the very beginning correct because in the very beginning because we used to i the first way i did it was with um collector collector with a metal chip with a metal tip and it was silicone and so you would just kind of touch it to it yeah no half a grain of rice you're going to be ripped good luck yeah so start with that no matter which way you're doing it you know always start small start safe um start with the flour i honestly would say just from experience you do that little amount but i wouldn't start on shatter you can get pretty ripped that stuff's kind of dirty sometimes i would go like a real low end like crumble batter like get a lower i mean really shatter you can get you got to be careful with crumble because sometimes if it's a really soft crumble and it falls apart really easily huge hit you'll like something like a straw yeah or or the nectar collector is working but if you're stupid inhalation little device and you go to hit that thing like all right so this is it looks like a block let me go ahead and just take this little block and you go and do that and then all of a sudden a little chunk breaks off right up the straw and the whole thing's burning on the way out your necks are collected you can get a much smarter either i would say a scoop into a good i recommend an e-nail yeah but if you especially especially if you're a beginner then hit us up find somebody with an email learn how to use an email the reason being because you preset the temperature in a device and then it it won't burn it because you know for a fact it's going to be at that certain degree it's usually a little digital handheld corded i have one cough because you're not usually burning the dab too much and the reason he says that well not don't cough there's two main types when you're doing dabbing or using a rig which is like a a bong or a water tobacco device um if you're using one of those then you usually have the buckets on the end and you preheat them with a torch or using that e-nail which which electronically you know targets a certain temperature the two ways to do it are hot dabs and cold starts hot dabs usually use titanium nails because you can get them extra hot i mastered those without meaning to master because you just started that way i used to just not knowing everything and just dump everything in get it hot drop it put a spoon or something over the hole and try to survive longer take a second hit before it cools down bubble and lay on the ground like why do people like this like and then be higher than [ __ ] for the next while and then eat a bunch and take a nap and then wake up and do it again yes and i was like this isn't that great but it's so rough on your lungs instead you start by putting the material into the nail or the bucket on the end and then you preheat it slowly from the bottom until you start to reach that desired temperature and then you can hit it just as it starts to reach that temperature and so you're getting it right as it falls in the perfect green zone that has lasers to really to tell temperatures on his bangers i have a terp laser yeah you know how i tell my temperature okay i'll show you a couple different a couple different temperature devices yeah the laser gives you like it's like a rangefinder in golf except for heat here's that one this one right here oh that goes right in the camera i wonder if that [ __ ] with him he has more too i like this one do we have to put up an epileptic warning now at the beginning for the lights and the lasers i did it like 30 times did you i think you had i have used it you absolutely have to put a warning i don't know you have to put it yeah yes think about the other people that watch our stuff for the medication information and then some of them to treat seizures and you're like shining lasers and lights i'm just saying it looks super cool it did look very cool hurt my eyes so for all of you they got to see the warning at the beginning you're welcome uh he's an [ __ ] and that's why peace and right so the other option besides the gun epileptic warnings did you show that uh it's got a i don't know it's it's all lit up there i guess it's too bright it's a laser beam i can't but it shows a digital readout of the temperature you know of of your hand or whatever it is you're shooting uh 93 degrees apparently from here it says it's not supposed to be used on human skin because it's not accurate enough um and that's why but it goes into the plus or minus 10 degrees but you're using this to read in the hundreds and you know 560 640 320. so that's that one the other one here when it plugs in the wall this and plugs into different types of ends or bangers or nails whatever i'm using in that device and this is the email temperature controller this one this one specifically has a timer that will run up and down and then you can preset the temperature and it'll hold that exact temperature for this one particularly up to 90 minutes it'll also increase your medication budget twofold because it's on all the time and you're like oh well done i might as well just put a little bit more in there oh but oh yeah but on the reverse of that i don't think it does i don't think it does much because you waste nothing none at all you get every little bit oh no when it's both of us around you you get that almost every little bit at the exact temperature but i think we're trying to one-up each other all because you can just be like hey let me get a little a little bit more in there yeah yeah no it was it's fun though it's definitely worth the investment it's um so we definitely enjoy having all the support that we've had with the cannabis academy it's important to we always you know safely imbibe because now in the places especially that it's rec legal yeah a lot of people don't know what the [ __ ] they're doing i do want to also add just as a side bonus vaping or dabbing the dabbing vapors versus consuming flour smoke you know uh if you were to smoke a blunt say versus hitting a vape pen the the chemical makeup of of the vapor versus smoke the vapor sticks to your clothing less it it's so that the stink isn't sticky versus when you're smoking out of a bowl smoking flour and sometimes that scent will linger with you um and so you have a fleeting smell it's a very fleeting you'll walk something like cotton candy yeah what who's who had weed candy right now who had chocolate but it's gone and then it's gone yeah well sometimes you'll catch like if especially if you if you can show up right afterwards but no that's so much smelly like and the difference is that it's not a sticky um vapor so it doesn't stick to your clothes and then carry with you like the smoke from you know just no and this is just like a my side for beginners those vapes are just a different beast i don't really think they affect just be careful when judging tolerance just based off hitting those vapes i don't trust a lot of their potencies that you don't know these are hundreds of cartridges made i'm just saying i've smoked just like joints and bowls with people that rip vapes all the time and they get torched because flowers are a little different high or they are always on the vape and they think they do an edible no edibles different than everything don't ever forget that and like the concentrates outside of a vape honestly don't i just think of all the people we've gotten we have absolutely wrecked 20 at least people buy them attempting long-term smokers a lot of them too yeah not we don't ever do it maliciously but people come over we do a lot just don't i consume my normal amounts unless you're with someone that knows what's going on yeah i'm i am a seasoned concentrate user and if you have questions on it i mean if you like concentrates or the vapes obviously hit like and comment on what your strain is through the vape because i like those tasty ones like some of them that actually taste like like sugar cookies and yeah those are so good and that's gone and then we'll get into the specifics of you just sit there how do they make cookies how do they make diamonds birthdays how do they get a white cookie right here batter resin rosin um you know what's live versus not live because you'll see that sometimes it's your adverse lives you know so live is when the the weed itself is actually fresh frozen so it preserves the trichome you can hear that at some point too and one of the bud tenders trichomes are the little white kind of bulbous hair there's actually three different kinds of but think of them as as size small medium large but essentially trichome is greek for the word hair it's the little hairy um collections of thc that hang off the the plant you usually can't see them with the naked eye very much unless the plant is really potent otherwise you zoom in with a camera or something and look at them in a larger picture and some really cool stuff some really cool pictures i love the artwork you'll see out of those trichomes because it just kind of looks like a a whole different alien world when you're zoomed in on those things um they're great but so the the live process stuff is the live process is thought to preserve those trichomes a little bit better and so when you're actually turning it into the the end product you know the better off they start when they go in the more potent it's going to be on when it comes out oh whereas where you're just doing like rosin it still helps making the live rosin which is remember rosin is the one where we're just using heat and pressure to squeeze it together so if you start with the cold frozen wheat that you cured by by freeze for you know freeze drying it then you put that in between the hot plates and squeeze it out then then what you're working with is more potent than the solvent ones which broke it down a little bit to extract it whereas this one didn't get broke down you've preserved it the whole way through the process and so you're gonna get as potent as you can get based off of the flower you started with so if your plant is really potent then a live rosin will get you the most potent concentrate you can get out of processing that down into different forms like a wax which is using it to you know using a co2 or butane to separate it out and then turn that into a material i remember again some stuff years ago years ago the guy was making in his garage wax and it would be on like he drove me off into it probably on the [ __ ] whatever got me high and i would just i would just it would be wax paper you just pull it [ __ ] open and just be the stringiest well before it was garbage he was making it with like his feet or something look before there was but it was [ __ ] stony i'm glad you said that that's to bring up the fact that before they had little glass jars they were super convenient or little silicone jars some people prefer the silicone because you can hit right out of them you don't have to worry about is this glass or just dense plastic plastic one out there like oh this glass or plastic you don't want you don't want it oh no it is oh when you're here yeah i've taken a definite so chemical yeah i usually i usually real good about using glass jars and once i get a good glass jar just kind of scoop everything into that one um instead of using a plastic i don't get out of plastic you know the higher end stuff always comes into them higher stuff comes in a nice splash jars usually a ceramic jar something something nice we're bougie i'm a pain i want you to ever he has one that lights up yeah i do i have some that light up that's not i'm serious local local arizona dispensaries here yeah they have and i like their containers because they have a slightly magnifying lid on the top and then a little led light clicks on the bottom so you get a real good look in the container at the material without having to crack the lid and get a good peek at it you just okay that's looking pretty good i got about that much left you know and i like it that way and so i usually i reuse those often and just you know by the time i wipe them out i just throw another gram of something else in there um but yeah as far as store they didn't always have those so the original the original way to store your concentrate was the wax paper the parchment paper you know it's like a dirty diaper if it gets if it gets warm it'll stick both sides you know um so the benefit for that or the the way they'll say to really manage that is throw it in your little fridge i recommend highly keeping any and all concentrates you get of any form in the fridge the enemy of all concentrates is heat light and air and laying it on keep it sealed keep it dark and keep it cool and so you'll see a lot of mini fridges you can buy that are meant for like dorms that you know they fit six to ten cans of soda perfect mine so tell you it'll fit one case of beer you just well they're perfect little small fridges you know that would fit four or five of these but they're great for stacking your little containers in i have over here like a three-quarter sized actual full fridge that i can just keep like rows and of stuff in but that's because i dab a lot um that's a factual thing it is and with my with my little babies growing over here i plan to expand on my total amount of personal use i'm excited me too we always appreciate everybody jumping into the cannabis academy stuff um man there's so much to take in on all of the two if you have questions on any of the concentrate concentrate stuff definitely you can comment it hit like look forward to our concentrates 102 when we'll get more in depth to each one and beard 710 up on instagram really if you have a question or you know anything in regards to any weed content or the nooch 710 both of us i i have some depth if you want more layman's terms i'm the guy to hit up then if you want like well then you just do that you want to hear more about hydrocarbons then i'm the guy yeah i'm not um i mean no i'm not saying hydrocarbons at any point in conversation right now yeah right now yeah make sure to we'll keep the um cannabis academy stuff coming up uh when you're subscribing you have the notifications on you'll get that in your uh little annoying red thing and then and uh give us some ideas on what else because we're gonna start moving on to more advanced ones and if you think we missed some basics let us know put it in the comments we've had we've had a couple of people put them in there so if you think we missed something drop a line thank you he's been staring at me the whole time the whole time do you want anything you guys should say goodbye say goodbye to the fly everyone say goodbye", "Rh_dd_TqU30": "[Music] [Music] you", "cHz4xTYET24": "howdy howdy there beautiful people guys are all having a amazing start to your day night whatever the hell you're watching this hope it's going great for you we've got a little video here I haven't really done many of these but a lot of other cannabis content creators do these videos and I think a lot of people enjoy it we've got some strain reviews coming up today and of course we're starting with the hottest hash on the alerting rec market happy cabbage farms so happy cabbage farms they came into camp in probably about four months ago I don't know exactly when they came on to the Oregon rec market but at the time it was a pretty Minzy era in the Oregon rec market here in Benton there was just a lot of the companies have really slipped towards the end of the summer and a lot of their stuff really wasn't tasting as good as it was towards the beginning of the summer then comes heavy cabbage farms with hash robison and we don't see hot rods in a lot in the rec market because it's such an expensive and kind of niche product there's not very many people that are searching to pay a lot of money for hash rasam but when you [ __ ] try this hash frozen you're just sucked right on back in guys it is ridiculous this stuff I will tell you I have tried tons of hot rods and a lot of the times I'm going to say that's my favorite hat rosin because I don't get to try it very often happy cabbage now has been around for about four months and they are a group in our circle it's just been around I've gotten to dab it a lot and I've gotten to dab a lot of other hash rosin because I don't have to pay for it other people have it and I will tell you guys there's a couple strands that I have not liked from them but these four right here that I have are so titties I would stick my face between all of them and motorboat myself to death this is hands-down the best half rosin I have ever smoked and it's on the wreck more kit if you are over 21 you can buy this you don't have to [ __ ] buy it black market you don't have to pay the $120 for black market six star hash rosin it gets it cannot expensive for a while there guys so to see a company coming out with stuff that's between sixty and seventy five dollars and medic maybe even cheaper than that that's super impressive and just such a breath of refreshing air so this guy I've got open right here first thing when I open it this is the purple starburst og six star like just what in there is just a bad thing to say let's take a look at what we going got going on in this jar alrighty here we have the purple starburst og 6 star you guys can see it's nice and flaky there's no real huge clumps partly because I dabbed a lot of them partly because it is 6 star and it is just gorgeous look at that color sorry for the shaking I'm filming on my phone they check that out just absolutely gorgeous I am completely enthralled with the look of this rosin I'm enthralled with the look as well as the smell a second you open up this up you get hit in the face with the real ocean groan oh gee smell and it's been a long time since we've gotten that we're getting more chem more gassy oh geez out here this is real ocean groan oh gee and then on the end of it is like this almost faint hint of like purple lavender not in a floral way at all but in a very very gassy way like I can't even begin to explain this we're gonna go ahead and take it yeah we got two rigs out today we first we're gonna start out with the prophecy glass and get a little function shot and I'll shop for you guys we don't have the cleanest rigs or bangers today just kind of caught me on an off cleaning day but maybe we should still be able to see that function right we're gonna start off with the purple starburst it guys this stuff is absolutely amazing I cannot tell you how much I recommend going and trying just the strain right here all of happy cabbage farm is fantastic this strain right here hands down my favorite let's go ahead and get her heat it up and get into some freakin turf skies I am excitement for this video you can not believe how hard it is to have four jars of happy cabbage sitting in a drawer knowing you can't smoke it because you have to come with it it's literally heartbreaking I also want to give them a huge shout out for sponsoring the 420 of it at the Pacific Circle that was absolutely amazing they set up a tab bar anybody that came by could have their stuff a company that produces this high a product of this high quality of product just allow anybody to come up and smoke it no no [ __ ] questions asked is just amazing huge shout out to them for that call that good set a timer for 45 seconds alright we're gonna go ahead get in here and scoop ourselves out a nice flaky dab of this gorgeous six star here we go guys first dab of the half cab farms Cheers [Music] oh good lordy that is so delicious straight to the head immediately my whole head warm fuzzy dice feels delicious but you just know media we have strongest it because it hits you momentarily after you take it down man is a good video to be filming guys yeah I also got to say this is mind-bending how good that flavor is and how much flavor there is usually with a lot of even really good tasting dabs only a small percentage of flavor this there is a large percentage of flavor in that [ __ ] strain it is amazing how much you get out of it I love it for our first thing to have in the morning like if you got one dab to set your whole day straight that's it right there that purple starburst og alright move on to the next string I believe this one was a collab width Oh pull on a stick and throw it into my house I rip the [ __ ] alright I threw the Box away in the heavy collab on it [ __ ] oh no without gaps in garden Gadsden Gardens okay this one is a collab with Gadsden garden and this is Tropicana punch now this one has a much much different look to it let me give you guys an initial smell test it was like pomegranate and man what is that that is a good [ __ ] smell right there it was like pomegranate and fish I'm not like just weed but the actual cush like when you're exhaling a cush strain it smells like that oh man that's delicious now this one has a much different look to it way more waxy was this one what was this one called no just Tropicana punch hash rosin not six-star not their batter or their jam just hash shots but still absolutely delicious looking kind of looks like peanut butter and this was not what I do what it looked like when they gave it to me when it was cold it was much much more pretty and hadn't like waxed up into this solid state yet still [ __ ] beautiful we're gonna switch it up we've got the DBE 503 slimeball rig all ready to go over here a dab of this junk ambush I believe this is the one that gave me a job on the night of 4/20 and I was just absolutely mind blown by how good the flavor of it was so much rudiness to it but still keeping a really nice base in the OG gas cushy that kind of a chem that kind of a taste so I'm keeping it sweet waste in there but still having some food on top I'm a big fan of fruity strains but when I have to smoke all day every day it's not my favorite I really really want the Kim gasps og scum push stuff like that all right that's all set a timer 45 seconds that's not that's not the right dance isn't it there was a dude I'm just gonna stop him all right if vijaya tease this one's a lot easier to load up I'm just gonna take this a nice big chunk here boom I am gonna be so blitzed by the end of this guy's four dabs of hatch rosin and that I haven't gotten into this yet but I'm sure you guys read the title we're taking out Widowmaker at the end but yeah let's do it [ __ ] drop the dead Cheers [Music] [Music] get right with that safe before really really fruity but it keeps its [ __ ] feet planted firmly in a nice little og tastes good very clean - I mean like of course there's no solvents in it but a lot of other people's half-frozen I get a a wheezing in my lungs and that's usually the reason I stay away from hats Rossum as you guys can hear [Music] there is some coffee but there's no wheeze and that is what I love about this stuff it just seems so clean so pure you're tasting exactly what this amazing weed was meant to taste like guys we're going nips out go the [ __ ] nips out Jesus Christ two tabs of hash rosin in we've got the purple starburst and oh wait no the Tropicana punch and the purple starburst yeah okay yes yes boom so we've got punch breath up next this is their jam and this one unfortunately has slowly disintegrated in a series of very unfortunate dabs that were completely unavoidable but I think a little bit left so we have something for this video right here I'm gonna zoom the camera in so you guys can see it's really really clear and very very light in color but it is so ganbei good I can't even begin to tell you guys how many Terps they've got packed into that gorgeous little [ __ ] doing GM glove there when you get in this one it immediately has like a purple smell I use that to describe a lot away I don't know what the purple smell is I don't know what I'm describing there I'm sure there's some people out there that are gonna be like yeah and there's some people are gonna be like what the [ __ ] he's that high already but it does it smells purple purple with a hint of fruit punch on the end that's exactly what I'm getting clenched breath and it's really really cool how true their flavors are guys like you can't even begin to tell you how many other hot rods and strings like taste we're like this one's strong in and you taste it that's great it's amazing how many people just they'll name their strains anything just because that's what's hype that's what's selling right now these guys they've just got some fire a sweet in fire ass hash on the way out switching it back up again to the prophecy glass for our punch breath dab here I'm gonna go ahead and heat this up man guys given that Widowmaker at the end it's gonna be so brutal I have already baked like a cupcake my gourd is gone stone to the bone I just [ __ ] rent I think you guys a good idea of how ripped I am I've taken two gaps and I already am starving I don't feel like I need a turf map two naps like I thank you I'm taking seven gram damage guys this we just took like maybe point one maybe and I'm already ready for a turf down at the end of this I'm going to pass out right here after I've ordered new greens call it good BAM wham Shazam set timer for 45 seconds Thank You Carla alright let's go ahead scrape ourselves out some of this leaving just enough left to put into our Widowmaker jab guys we got we got some crazy stuff going with a maker jab this punch breath was definitely one of my favorites it was a lighter high than the six star starburst og but had just about the same percentage of flavor it's fan-fucking-tastic really allowed me to go about my day if I was smoking it in the morning before say a meeting or something it would be really good for that not if you were gonna go out and want a dad that was gonna last you three to four hours that would be the purple starburst six star that stuff is just [ __ ] tits it is so strong BAM Thank You Carla let's take this damn choose people it's tons tons and tons of flavor [Music] [Music] now we got the sweats going big time holy Jebus how is it is hot in here oh my god keeping you close holy [ __ ] this was a good fight hey promised the Widowmaker again oh [ __ ] turf sweats aren't [ __ ] real oh my god whoa next up we got some margarita punch six star don't let the nips cool off for a second here wow that overheated a needle is in the red Oh rubbie oh my god I completely forgot we have water over here not sponsored by but shout out the can event for carrying the happy cabbage four guys are in Central Oregon looking for a place to pick this stuff up get a man got it they got so many different strains oh yes we got one left guys we've got the margarita place six star same with the starburst og let's go ahead and take peak here in this jar very very flaky but it is all stuck together none of it is gonna fall out I don't believe ya all stuck in there when I first got it was flaky like if you sneezed it would go everywhere like a pile of blow it was pretty [ __ ] flaky oh man oh man this one probably actually I'm gonna have to take my my vote back for the smell this one has better smell than the purple starburst dojin form starburst oh gee I do believe tastes better but god damn margarita punch they're definitely a hint of that tropic punch in there but there is a kick what is that kick gasps that is straight gasp oh man yeah once you get past that punch just gassy oh that is good it doesn't have the og smell of the purple starburst I mean it is just Tropicana punch instead of deep purple starburst OG um but it does have a massive undertone of some gassy flavors go ahead keep the slime ball ring up last one and probably take a little two-minute walk around the house and then we're gonna dive into that way a but nothing's more currently done I am so big guy so I can feel my hind legs coming down [ __ ] just set a timer for 45 seconds Thank You Carla thank you very much I can feel my eyelids coming down like heavy hard it is I'm gonna be in for a real long afternoon here we got a photo we got the Gus glass show circle tonight [ __ ] I'm gonna be licking windows all night long guys so yeah super flaky super super potent smell let's get some [ __ ] taste in here oh yes oh yes wants to scrape it all off the bottom it is super flaky again yep all right we got a margarita punch six star and hash browns and over here I bring a ball right up in clothes for you guys kitchens function off the first initial hit oh my god I need a new cord after this video it's not even baked out of it it's just oh [ __ ] cheers everyone a lot more gas when you smoke it less of the push flavor than the go wow they're really not my favorite in terms of flavor definitely not bad whatsoever it's still delicious I'm probably ranked this number three the Tropicana punch probably be my least favorite out of the four but honestly I would buy all four strains again thanks they say that they're that good all scraped up on a piece of paper see if we can get it um damn er and then we will take a lap mop it off a bit and take this [ __ ] Widowmaker all those cobbles alright we got our four grams right here I have completely forgotten which one goes to which cap so that will be interesting we're just going to go ahead and see if we can take this damper here and get some of each of these on here it's not going to be a monster dabbe but I mean big enough for some fun boom there's our starting scoop of the punch breath now this is this is the margarita punch now this is gonna be a little difficult this stuff is so flaky I'm not quite sure we might have to get like a spoon for this so I'm gonna just take some of this and yeah there's no way it's gonna stick on there take that off and then last but not least we need the what what was this I forget [ __ ] I think I've lost more oil in here than I got out definitely alright well there's that there's what I've got and there's also some on this damper too this stuff has all different consistencies let me see if I can't like splurge some of this long as dabber just smush it all together that's kind of working I'd say that's working pretty damn good alright let's look at our dab here guys oh [ __ ] yeah oh Jesus alright alright let's let's get her going oh my god this is gonna be fun I literally didn't move any of this because I was terrified that the dab would fall off the dabber I think we are very lucky and fortunate that we got all that hash onto a bro without any of it falling off I didn't I think that was going to happen as this on a monster Widowmaker but like I was saying before guys - dabs in I was pretty [ __ ] toasted we're at a point now where I am just I'm good at I could be good for today for smuggling I am [ __ ] why are we doing this because you got your [ __ ] awesome but I love each

of this [ __ ] weed coma y'all beautiful wonderful amazing people please remember that as always please be kind to one another Cheers I'll see you guys soon", "DICJxd3Rb-E": "alright y'all we're about to do this source turbo and you can see how frosty cold that is we got the Everclear see how frosty that is or I'll pour that into here do a quick wash on it yeah things like never seen tipsy bartender yeah lookout broke it all down already every bit of it's right off them stems and everything look that was big bud big hold bugs broke it down to nothing so this one we're gonna do into the magical butter bags but which one did you pay I go ahead and do that and then put a little bit in one more [Music] I shoulda left that little bit for was to wash that out look how the color on that can you see that we got the ice on top of this source turbo getting it ready because that ice helps the condensation where that alcohol rises to the top that's the crucible here I wish this was silicone on the other side they have a bigger one of these that you can get all right into the fill line good wash on it now go ahead and put it on in here and you make sure when you're putting this down you don't thread it too hard as soon as it catches it's done this is just holding it straight up some of the caches it's done you put your lid on I like to have it to where it's Lance forward no particular reason put that on not sure how well they can see it from here but one of the reasons to use the bags you can see the hash and if if you don't filter them particulates will be in your concentrate yeah cuz that went through 190 but not D 25 all right so you turn on okay and then I hold it in for four seconds [Music] what it's doing now is creating a vacuum pressure so it'll suction that lid to the top real good and create a vacuum in there that's going to help that alcohol your eyes to the top that vacuum pressures will take all that alcohols will rise to the top condensate and then it's going to come to the front right here and you know see it collect right here it's gonna be about make his turbo mode is which is for goes for two hours so we'll be back in two hours and see where we're at [Music] cleaning out everything got that Jordan Bisset clean ran it through the hunted by doors and getting everything last a little bit put through it give you a good view of what the material looks like after it's been washed now those were whole bugs when before we shook it and everything just popped from the stem or anything now you can reach down in there and squeeze it and you tell like there's no sticky left to it or anything and some people say while you get rid of it you can't do much with it people do though actually I you could actually throw that in the magic butter machine when you do your next tincture and I mean you may get something you know I know plenty of people on our magic blower page who swear by the slugs and that's basically what that is do we use the hunt for when we filter it the first time and that catches all the material and then we use the 25 my column on the second because normally when you're doing making hash or something that's fine come to you but you pull it all out it'll look like some long hash that alright so this is the next day Sunday this thing basically ran all night I keep adding in the alcohol and as you can see we're in a good amount of alcohol reclaimed already and you see how clean it is [Music] so yeah we'll see I'll be back later we're almost done it's been in here since yesterday so we got a little bit more to go we had to empty the alcohol because it was up to the line but there's the alcohol never clear you can see how clearer still is so we'll reuse that I'm gonna start her back up all right so I'm gonna stop the source here and you're released a vacuum down blow warm this time just a bit poor I'm putting it in a silicone so that it can get a little more out of there all that alcohol you need to get the rest of it so use a silicone spatula you can see the color of that not bad at all it's not all the way done yet I got it on my finger and feels like like crumble almost they take this crucible here you take this you put alcohol in that again and you run it you can get the rest of that out there work ain't worried about it wipe it out with some alcohol all right so right here we have the final product see it's coming off just like shatter nice and shatter e and then right off there see how golden that looks pretty good that's pretty good all right I'm gonna break out the Aurora here get her heat it up you know - look here that's what I just made in the source turbo I taste real nice robots there you go smokeable dabs out of the source turbo quick out co-wash although it took overnight but minimal effort I think I ended up with actually a gram and a half out of that to grams almost all right guys so here's the alcohol we have reclaimed out of the dabs we just made so we got basically all of it back that's crazy and it's got a little a little bit of a tint to it but not much a little bit of a yellowish tint and here is my pucks that I smash when I make dad is in the rosin press so what I'm going to do is I'm going to take this reclaim alcohol I'm gonna use it again somebody stuff for my edibles I'm gonna take this and shake it run that through the magic butter machine and then with the rest of that that I have I'm gonna take all these bags that I press in we get everything I can get out of those it's really cools I press some CBD this time so there's gonna be CBD in here too bring that out and put that in with that right there and then when I take this out of magic butter machine I'll put it in that source and I'll get 80% of my alcohol back on that because I won't get as much because they'll still be left in like some of the sludge in this people use that 13 capsules and take it I think people put it on brownies too so you can use every piece of this butter machine 130 for 8 hours all right we'll see you like subscribe comment set your notifications you make sure when you're done cleaning out I always like clean it with some isopropyl some 91% put a little bit in there and make sure you get it all nice and clean I do the same thing with that clean it all around so make sure you clean it up good clean the lid it collects moisture up under this so make sure you clean everything good cleaning out my bottles my mason jars here so make sure it's all clean for next time we'll see you then one thing this comes right up out of there really easy so you can clean up around in the edges in here cuz right here it collects you know moisture and everything so make sure it's all nice and dry when you put it away so it comes right out"}
